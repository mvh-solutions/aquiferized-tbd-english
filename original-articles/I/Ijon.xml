<p class="h1">IJON</p>
<p class="fl">Town assigned to Naphtali’s tribe in the extreme north of Palestine. Some identify it with Tell ed-Dibbon between the Litani River and Mt Hermon, but this is disputed. Ijon was one of the towns taken by Ben-hadad of Damascus during Baasha’s reign (c. 900 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.20">1 Kgs 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.4">2 Chr 16:4</a>). Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria captured the town and deported its people during Pekah’s reign (c. 733 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>).</p>
