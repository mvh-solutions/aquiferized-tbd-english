<p class="h1">ISRAELITE</p>
<p class="fl">Descendant of the 12 sons of Israel (the name God gave to Jacob, <a href="?bref=Gen.32.28">Gn 32:28</a>). As the sons of Abraham, they are distinguished from the Ishmaelites (descended from Abraham by Hagar his concubine), and as sons of Isaac, from the Edomites (descendants of Esau), by having Jacob as their ancestor. They lived in Egypt from the time of Joseph until the exodus, when God led them into Canaan to fulfill his promise to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.8">17:8</a>).</p>
<p>God led the Israelites out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the land of Canaan that he had promised them. They were ruled by judges, kings, and conquerors from other countries. In 722 <span class="era">BC</span> the northern kingdom was conquered by Assyria and became incorporated into that empire. After this time, “Israel” refers to members of the southern tribes, Judah and Benjamin. An “Israelite” was one who, religiously as well as politically, belonged to the remnant of the covenant nation of Israel.</p>
