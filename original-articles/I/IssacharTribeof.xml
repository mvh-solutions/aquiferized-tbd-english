<p class="h1">ISSACHAR, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Tribal inheritance of Issachar. The territory is defined in <a href="?bref=Josh.19.17-23">Joshua 19:17-23</a>; detailed boundary descriptions are not included. On the east its boundary ends at the Jordan. The area can be located by the list of towns encompassed by the inheritance of which Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, Anaharath, Kishion, Remeth, and En-gannim have identifications of varying degrees of certainty. Jezreel and En-gannim are in the southeast corner of the valley of Jezreel; Chesulloth is just west of Mt Tabor; and Shunem is at the foot of the hill of Moreh. The northern border can be deduced from the southern boundaries of Zebulun and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.10-12,33-34">Jos 19:10-12, 33-34</a>). All three areas, that of Issachar, Naphtali, and Zebulun, met at Mt Tabor. On the south side, there were some major towns not conquered in Joshua’s time (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>) that were taken from Issachar and given to Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.11">Jos 17:11</a>); these included important centers such as Beth-shan, Ibleam, and Tanaach.</p>
<p>In the same territory, there were disturbances among the local tribes (recorded on a stele of Seti I at Beth-shan); the area is called “Mt Yarunta,” after Yarmuth (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.29">Jos 21:29</a>, Jarmuth = Remeth). Issachar was located on the rich plateau stretching east of Mt Tabor and the hill of Moreh and north of the Beth-shan Valley.</p>
