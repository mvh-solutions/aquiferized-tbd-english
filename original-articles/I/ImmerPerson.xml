<p class="h1">IMMER (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Priest in the time of David. He became the ancestral head of a house of priests: Pashhur, the priest who had Jeremiah arrested and placed in stocks, was a descendant of Immer (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.1">Jer 20:1</a>). There were 1,052 priests of the subclan of Immer who returned from the exile (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.12">1Â Chr 9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.37">Ezr 2:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.40">Neh 7:40</a>). A descendant of Immer helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.29">Neh 3:29</a>) and 128 priests under Amashsai (also a descendant) helped resettle the city and tend the temple (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.13-14">Neh 11:13-14</a>).</p>
