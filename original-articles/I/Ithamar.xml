<p class="h1">ITHAMAR</p>
<p class="fl">Aaron’s fourth and youngest son, who served as a priest to the tribes of Israel during the wilderness period (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23">Ex 6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.2-4">Nm 3:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.60">26:60</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3">1 Chr 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.2">24:2</a>). After the death of two of his brothers, he was given the special duty of overseeing the moving of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.4.28,33">Nm 4:28, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.8">7:8</a>). During David’s reign, the descendants of Ithamar and Eleazar were organized as the formal temple priesthood (<a href="?bref=1Chr.24.3-6">1 Chr 24:3-6</a>). Later, some of his descendants returned with Ezra from Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.2">Ezr 8:2</a>).</p>
