<p class="h1">ICHABOD</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to Phinehas’s son (Eli’s grandson) to commemorate the glory that had departed from Israel, after the ark of God was taken by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.19-22">1 Sm 4:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.3">14:3</a>).</p>
<p>Phinehas was killed in the battle of Aphek, at the same time the Philistines had captured the ark. When Phinehas’s wife heard of the tragedy, she went immediately into labor, and when the child was born, she named him Ichabod (meaning “no glory”) to express her despair.</p>
