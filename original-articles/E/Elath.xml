<p class="h1">ELATH</p>
<p class="fl">Edomite city (also spelled Eloth) at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.8">Dt 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26">1 Kgs 9:26</a>), on the eastern border of the wilderness of Paran (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.6">Gn 14:6</a>, where it is alternately called El-paran). It probably owed its named (which means “grove of trees”) to the many palm trees in the area and may have been located in a grove of sacred trees. Elath was strategically located along a primary trade route running from southern Arabia and Egypt to Phoenicia, making it a valuable city to possess.</p>
<p>Elath was taken by Kedorlaomer from the Horites (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5-6">Gn 14:5-6</a>). Later it was regarded as the southern limit of the territory of Edom (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.8">Dt 2:8</a>). David probably captured it when he conquered Edom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.14">2 Sm 8:14</a>). During the reign of Joram, Jehoshaphat’s son, revolt restored it to the Edomites (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">2 Kgs 8:20-22</a>). A few years later it was recaptured and rebuilt by Judah’s King Uzziah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.22">2 Kgs 14:22</a>). It remained under Judah’s rule until the time of Ahaz, when it was taken by Rezin of Syria and occupied by Syrians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.6">2 Kgs 16:6</a>). From about 753 <span class="era">BC</span> onward, it remained an Edomite city until it was abandoned sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. Then the Nabateans, who controlled the area, built a city a little farther east of the original site and renamed it Aila.</p>
