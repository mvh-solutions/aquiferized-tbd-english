<p class="h1">EN-GANNIM</p>
<p class="list">1. Village in the lowland of Judah near Beth-shemesh (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.34">Jos 15:34</a>). Some identify it with the modern Beit Jemal, but this is doubtful.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town on the boundary of Issachar (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.21">Jos 19:21</a>). It was a Levitical city of the Gershonites (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.29">21:29</a>) and the Anem of <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.73">1 Chronicles 6:73</a>, which may be a copyist’s mistake. It seems to be the Ginaea of Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.6.1). Its site is the modern Jenin, a village on the southern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, five miles (8.1 kilometers) northeast of Dothan and about 68 miles (109.4 kilometers) north of Jerusalem.</p>
