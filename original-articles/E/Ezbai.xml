<p class="h1">EZBAI</p>
<p class="fl">Father of Naarai, one of David’s elite force known as “the thirty” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.37">1 Chr 11:37</a>). In <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.35">2 Samuel 23:35</a> he is called Paarai the Arbite. This has led some interpreters to suggest that “the son of Ezbai” in the 1 Chronicles passage is a corruption of “the Arbite” and that the correct reading of his name should be Naarai the Arbite.</p>
