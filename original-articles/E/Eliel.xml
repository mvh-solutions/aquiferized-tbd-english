<p class="h1">ELIEL</p>
<p class="list">1. Warrior and head of a family of the half-tribe of Manasseh that lived east of the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.24">1 Chr 5:24</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Tola’s son, a Kohathite who was one of the Levitical singers in the time of David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.34">1 Chr 6:34</a>); possibly the same as Eliab (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.27">1 Chr 6:27</a>). </p>
<p class="list"> 3. Shimei’s son and a chief of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.20">1 Chr 8:20</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 4. Shashak’s son and a chief of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.22">1 Chr 8:22</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 5. Warrior among David’s mighty men (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.46">1 Chr 11:46</a>), called a Mahavite.</p>
<p class="list"> 6. Another warrior among David’s mighty men (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.47">1 Chr 11:47</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 7. Warrior from the Gadites who joined David at Ziklag in his struggle against King Saul. Eliel was one of those experts with a shield and spear. Whether the Eliel of <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.11">1 Chronicles 12:11</a> should be equated with either of the two Eliels of <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.46-47">1 Chronicles 11:46-47</a> is impossible to say.</p>
<p class="list"> 8. Levite and chief of the family of Hebron, who was involved in bringing the ark to Jerusalem in David’s time (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.9">1 Chr 15:9</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 9. Priest who assisted in bringing the ark to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.11">1 Chr 15:11</a>); possibly the same as #8 above.</p>
<p class="list">10. Levite who assisted Conaniah in the administration of the tithes, contributions, and dedicated things given to the temple during Hezekiah’s reign (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.13">2 Chr 31:13</a>).</p>
