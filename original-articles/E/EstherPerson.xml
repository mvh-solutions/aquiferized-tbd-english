<p class="h1">ESTHER (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of two names borne by the Jewish queen of Persia. Hadassah (Hebrew “Myrtle”) apparently was her Jewish name (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.7">Est 2:7</a>), and Esther (Persian “Star”) her name as queen of Persia. Some scholars speculate about a connection with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, since exiled Jews were occasionally given pagan names (see <a href="?bref=Dan.1.7">Dn 1:7</a>).</p>
<p>Esther was an orphan from the tribe of Benjamin who lived with the Jewish exiles in Persia. She was reared by her cousin Mordecai, a minor government official and covert leader of the Jewish community (see <a href="?bref=Esth.3.5-6">Est 3:5-6</a>) in Susa, capital of the Persian kingdom. Esther became queen after King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) became displeased with Queen Vashti when she refused to obey his command to attend a banquet (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.11-12">1:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>After Esther’s coronation, she discreetly won Xerxes’ confidence by informing him of an assassination plot (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.21-23">Est 2:21-23</a>). The favor she won in the king’s eyes enabled her to deliver her family and her people from a massacre by Haman, a high official to the king.</p>
<p>The Feast of Purim was instituted to celebrate God’s deliverance of his people through Esther and Mordecai. This festival is still observed annually by Jews.</p>
