<p class="h1">ETHAN</p>
<p class="list">1. Wise man comparable to Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.31">1 Kgs 4:31</a>) and probably the author of <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">Psalm 89</a>. It is uncertain whether he was a contemporary of Solomon.</p>
<p class="list">2. Descendant of Judah and son of Zerah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.6">1 Chr 2:6</a>), perhaps the same as #1 above. However, they are ascribed different fathers in the two passages.</p>
<p class="list">3. Son of Zimmah, a descendant of Gershon, Levi’s oldest son (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.42">1 Chr 6:42</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Descendant of Levi through his son Merari, and the son of Kishi (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.44">1 Chr 6:44</a>) or Kushaiah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.17">15:17</a>). He was one of three outstanding musicians, along with Heman and Asaph, appointed by David (vv <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.16-19">16-19</a>). It was probably this Ethan whose name is ascribed in the title to <a href="?bref=Ps.39.1-13">Psalm 39</a> (as “Jeduthun,” which he is called in <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.41">1 Chr 16:41</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1">25:1</a>) as “chief musician”; it is likely that he composed the music for the psalm.</p>
