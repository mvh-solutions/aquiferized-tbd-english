<p class="h1">EUTYCHUS</p>
<p class="fl">Common slave name, mentioned only in <a href="?bref=Acts.20.9">Acts 20:9</a>. It was Eutychusâ€™s misfortune to become sleepy while sitting on a windowsill listening to the apostle Paul preach at Troas. He sank into a deep sleep and fell from the ledge, which was in the third loft. The apostle Paul revived him from the dead (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.20.7-12">7-12</a>).</p>
