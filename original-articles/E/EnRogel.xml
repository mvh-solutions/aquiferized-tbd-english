<p class="h1">EN-ROGEL</p>
<p class="fl">Spring that was an important landmark identifying the boundary line between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.7">Jos 15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>). Jonathan and Ahimaaz hid at En-rogel when they were spying on Absalom’s troops for King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.17">2 Sm 17:17</a>), and from there a maidservant delivered their messages to the king. Here also Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and goats when he anticipated David’s death and wished to set himself up as king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.9">1 Kgs 1:9</a>).</p>
<p>Of the two suggested locations for En-rogel, the older suggestion identifies it with a spring in a cave near Siloam, on the west side of the Kidron Valley, known as the Virgin’s Fount. There is strong evidence, however, that this is actually the Gihon Spring (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.33">1 Kgs 1:33</a>), which is mentioned as distinct from En-rogel. A more likely suggestion is another spring south of Jerusalem known as the Well of Job.</p>
