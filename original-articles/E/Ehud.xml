<p class="h1">EHUD</p>
<p class="list">1. Judge of Israel from Benjamin’s tribe who delivered Israel from Eglon, king of the Moabites (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-30">Jgs 3:12-30</a>). He was notable because he was left-handed (Hebrew “hindered in the right hand”). Before taking Israelite tribute to Eglon, he made an iron dagger, with which he assassinated the unsuspecting Eglon during a private audience. He then rallied the Israelites west of the Jordan to encircle the Moabite troops before they could return south to Moab. When the 18-year rule of Eglon over the Israelites ended, an 80-year period of peace began.</p>
<p class="list">2. Bilhan’s son, a member of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.10">1 Chr 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.8.6">8:6</a>).</p>
