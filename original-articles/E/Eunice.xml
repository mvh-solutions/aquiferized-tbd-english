<p class="h1">EUNICE</p>
<p class="fl">Timothy’s mother, daughter of Lois (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.5">2 Tm 1:5</a>), and the wife of a pagan Greek. She was a Jewish Christian (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1">Acts 16:1</a>). She apparently taught her son the OT Scriptures “from childhood” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.15">2 Tm 3:15</a>) and was converted to Christianity during Paul’s first trip to her home in Lystra, previous to his visit mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.1">Acts 16:1</a>.</p>
