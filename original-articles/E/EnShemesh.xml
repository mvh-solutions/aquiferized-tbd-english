<p class="fl">Place mentioned only in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.7">Joshua 15:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Josh.18.17">18:17</a> as a boundary marker between Judah’s northern border and Benjamin’s southern border. The usual identification is with ’Ain el-Hod, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) east of Jerusalem on the road to Jericho. On the basis of a tradition that the apostles drank there, it is sometimes referred to as the Spring of the Apostles.</p>
