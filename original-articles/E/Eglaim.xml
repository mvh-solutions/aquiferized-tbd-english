<p class="h1">EGLAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Town mentioned in <a href="?bref=Isa.15.8">Isaiah 15:8</a>. It cannot be located with certainty, but it was probably in southern Moab. A village called Aigaleim was mentioned by Eusebius and another called Agalla by Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.1.4). However, their identification with Eglaim is uncertain.</p>
