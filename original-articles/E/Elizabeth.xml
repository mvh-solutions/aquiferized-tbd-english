<p class="h1">ELIZABETH</p>
<p class="fl">Woman of priestly descent (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Lk 1:5</a>) and mother of John the Baptist, she was a relative of Mary, mother of Jesus (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.36">36</a>). The name Elizabeth, which derives from the same Hebrew word as Elisheba, wife of Aaron (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23">Ex 6:23</a>), means “my God is an oath.” Only Luke’s Gospel, which characteristically focuses greater attention upon the role of women, mentions Elizabeth and her husband, Zechariah.</p>
<p>Luke emphasized Elizabeth and Zechariah’s godly character and blameless conduct (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.6">Lk 1:6</a>) before stating that the elderly couple had not been favored with children. Although in Jewish culture childlessness was regarded as a reproach (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.22-23">Gn 30:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.25">Lk 1:25</a>), the devout pair continued to steadfastly worship and serve God. Unexpectedly, an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah with the announcement that Elizabeth would conceive and bear a son, who would be the forerunner of the promised Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.13-17">Lk 1:13-17</a>). When Elizabeth conceived, she withdrew from public life for five months, during which time her kinswoman Mary visited her.</p>
