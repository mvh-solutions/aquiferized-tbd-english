<p class="h1">EPENETUS</p>
<p class="fl">Believer greeted by Paul in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.5">Romans 16:5</a> as “my dear friend” and “the very first person to become a Christian in the province of Asia” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). It is not known if Epenetus was a personal convert of Paul. Mention of his name has been used to promote the hypothesis that the letter was written for the Ephesians, but this is not sufficient grounds for making this identification.</p>
