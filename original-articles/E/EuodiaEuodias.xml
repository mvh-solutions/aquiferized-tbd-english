<p class="h1">EUODIA, EUODIAS*</p>
<p class="fl">Prominent woman in the Philippian church whom Paul asked to resolve her differences with Syntyche (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.2">Phil 4:2</a>). The nature of their disagreement is not known, but it was of enough severity to reach Paul in Rome. Both women had labored with him in the work of the gospel (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.3">4:3</a>).</p>
