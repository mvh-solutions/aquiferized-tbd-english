<p class="h1">ELKANAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Levite of Korah’s family (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.24">Ex 6:24</a>) from the house of Izhar (v <a href="?bref=Exod.6.21">21</a>). He was Assir’s son, and fathered Ebiasaph (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.23">1 Chr 6:23</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Father of the prophet Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.19">1 Sm 1:19</a>). He was the son of Jeroham of Ephraim, from Ramathaim-zophim (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1</a>). Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah, the former being barren (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.2">2</a>). Hannah begged God repeatedly for a son whom she would give to the Lord’s service. Samuel was subsequently born, and after his weaning, he was brought to the aged priest Eli for training. Elkanah had other sons and daughters by Hannah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.21">2:21</a>), and became the forefather of Heman, a singer in David’s time.</p>
<p class="list">3, 4. Name of two Kohathite Levites descended from Korah’s line and ancestors of Heman the singer (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.26,35">1 Chr 6:26, 35</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Levite who dwelt in the village of the Netophathites and later lived in Jerusalem in the postexilic era (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.16">1 Chr 9:16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. Benjamite warrior who joined David’s mighty men at Ziklag (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.6">1 Chr 12:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list">7. Gatekeeper (guard) for the ark of the covenant during David’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.23">1 Chr 15:23</a>). He is perhaps the same as #6 above.</p>
<p class="list">8. One who held an authoritative post in King Ahaz’s court. Elkanah was slain by Zichri, an Ephraimite, for having forsaken the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.7">2 Chr 28:7</a>).</p>
