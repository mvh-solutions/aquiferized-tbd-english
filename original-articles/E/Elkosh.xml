<p class="h1">ELKOSH</p>
<p class="fl">Home or birthplace of the prophet Nahum (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">Na 1:1</a>). Three sites have been suggested: (1) Hilkeesei, a village in Galilee, perhaps corresponding to modern el-Kauzeh; (2) Capernaum near the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus frequently taught; and (3) Bein Jebrin in southern Judea.</p>
