<p class="h1">EN-RIMMON</p>
<p class="fl">Town assigned first to Judah and then to Simeon (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.32">Jos 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.7">19:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.32">1Â Chr 4:32</a>). These verses refer to two places, Ain and Rimmon, but this was probably a scribal error for the one town, En-rimmon (see <a href="?bref=Josh.19.7">Jos 19:7</a>). It was resettled after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.29">Neh 11:29</a>), and is perhaps the Rimmon south of Jerusalem mentioned in <a href="?bref=Zech.14.10">Zechariah 14:10</a>. En-rimmon is thought to be the modern Khirbet Umm er-Rumamin, nine miles (14.5 kilometers) north of Beersheba.</p>
