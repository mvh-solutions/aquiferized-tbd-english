<p class="h1">ENCHANTMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Act of casting charms or incantations to influence others or to obtain knowledge. Balaam could place no enchantment against Israel but could only bless them (<a href="?bref=Num.23.23">Nm 23:23</a>). Enchanters were present among the wise men of Nebuchadnezzar’s court; however, Daniel and his three friends were found to be ten times wiser than they (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.20">Dn 1:20</a>). The enchanters were unable to recall King Nebuchadnezzar’s forgotten dream (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.2-27">2:2-27</a>) or to interpret his second one (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.7">4:7</a>); later, under Belshazzar, they could not read or interpret the handwriting on the palace wall (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.7-15">5:7-15</a>). According to the prophet Isaiah, even the great powers of Babylon’s enchantments would not save it from eventual destruction (<a href="?bref=Isa.47.9,12">Is 47:9, 12</a>). In a more figurative sense, the psalmist writes: wickedness “does not hear the voice . . . of the cunning enchanter” (<a href="?bref=Ps.58.5">Ps 58:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
