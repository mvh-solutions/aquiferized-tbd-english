<p class="h1">ENDOR</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient Canaanite city, four miles (6.5 kilometers) south of Mt Tabor, assigned to the tribe of Manasseh, though never fully taken by them (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.11">Jos 17:11</a>). The city witnessed the defeat of Jabin and Sisera by Barak (<a href="?bref=Ps.83.9-10">Ps 83:9-10</a>). Endor is best known as the dwelling place of the witch who was called upon by King Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.7">1Â Sm 28:7</a>). On that occasion, Saul disguised himself because his journey to Endor took him near the Philistine army encamped at Shunem.</p>
