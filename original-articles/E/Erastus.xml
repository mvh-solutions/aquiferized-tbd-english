<p class="h1">ERASTUS</p>
<p class="fl">Name mentioned three times in the NT. Whether only one individual is being referred to cannot be ascertained, although in each case Erastus is an associate of Paul’s. The three instances are (1) a helper of Paul sent with Timothy into Macedonia (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.22">Acts 19:22</a>); (2) the city treasurer of Corinth (a steward of financial affairs, possibly a slave or freedman of some wealth and an important man in the Corinthian community), who sends greetings with Paul to the church in Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">Rom 16:23</a>); and (3) a friend of Paul’s who stayed at Corinth (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.20">2 Tm 4:20</a>).</p>
