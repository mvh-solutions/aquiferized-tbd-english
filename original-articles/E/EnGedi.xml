<p class="h1">EN-GEDI</p>
<p class="fl">A vital oasis on the west side of the Dead Sea about 35 miles (56.3 kilometers) southeast of Jerusalem. Allotted to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.62">Jos 15:62</a>), En-gedi contained a hot water spring coming from the side of a limestone cliff, producing semitropical vegetation. The area became known for its palms, vineyards, and balsam (<a href="?bref=Song.1.14">Sg 1:14</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.1.2). The ancient site was southeast of the oasis at Tell el-Jarn near modern ’Ain Jidi.</p>
<p>En-gedi was called Hazazon-tamar in <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.2">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>, and figured in several OT events. There Kedorlaomer conquered the Amorites (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.7">Gn 14:7</a>); David sought refuge from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.29">1 Sm 23:29</a>); and in Ezekiel’s vision of Israel’s restoration, fishermen would catch fish from the Dead Sea from En-gedi to En-eglaim (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.10">Ez 47:10</a>).</p>
