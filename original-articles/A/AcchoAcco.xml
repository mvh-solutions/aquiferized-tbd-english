<p class="h1">ACCHO*, ACCO</p>
<p class="fl">Major Palestinian port city from the earliest Canaanite period. The only clear OT reference to Acco is the statement that at the time of Israel’s conquest of Canaan, Asher’s tribe failed to drive out its inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Jgs 1:31</a>). Acco is frequently mentioned in Middle and New Kingdom Egyptian texts and in Assyrian records. Presumably Acco came under Israelite control during David’s reign and was among the 20 cities given by Solomon to King Hiram of Tyre (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.11-14">1 Kgs 9:11-14</a>). In later centuries, Acco was captured by Alexander the Great of Macedonia. It was eventually rebuilt and renamed Ptolemais (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.7">Acts 21:7</a>).</p>
