<p class="h1">AGAG</p>
<p class="list">1. Name of an Amalekite king, or perhaps a general title for their kings (like the Egyptian “pharaoh”). Balaam prophesied that Israel’s king would be greater than Agag (<a href="?bref=Num.24.7">Nm 24:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Name of another Amalekite king. God told Samuel to send King Saul to wipe out the Amalekite nation down to the last sheep. Saul conquered them but spared Agag’s life and the Amalekites’ best sheep and oxen. Samuel then executed Agag and told Saul that, because of his disobedience, he could no longer be Israel’s king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.1-35">1 Sm 15</a>).</p>
