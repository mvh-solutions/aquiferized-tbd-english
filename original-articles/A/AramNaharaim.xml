<p class="h1">ARAM-NAHARAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word meaning “Aram of the two rivers”; it refers to the area bounded by the upper Euphrates and the Habur Rivers. It is sometimes translated “Mesopotamia” (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.4">Dt 23:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The major city of that area was Haran, where Terah and Abram stopped and where Terah died (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31-32">Gn 11:31-32</a>). A servant of Abraham (Abram) returned to the same region to seek a wife for Abraham’s son Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-10">Gn 24:1-10</a>). Isaac’s son Jacob also returned to Haran to seek a wife (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.1-5">Gn 28:1-5</a>; Paddan-aram is a synonym of Aram-naharaim). Aram-naharaim was the home of Balaam, the pagan prophet (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.4">Dt 23:4</a>). One oppressor of Israel during the period of the judges was Cushan-rishathaim, king of Aram-naharaim (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.8-11">Jgs 3:8-11</a>). Later, in King David’s wars with Ammon, he had to confront mercenary charioteers hired from the Aramean centers of Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.19.6">1 Chr 19:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.60.1">Ps 60 title</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=SyriaSyrians_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Syria, Syrians</a>.</p>
