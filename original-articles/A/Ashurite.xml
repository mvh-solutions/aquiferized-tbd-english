<p class="h1">ASHURITE</p>
<p class="fl">Probably a variant spelling for Asherite, a member of Asher’s tribe. The Ashurites were among those who supported Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, instead of David as king over Israel after Saul’s death (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-9">2 Sm 2:8-9</a>). In <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.6">Ezekiel 27:6</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) the Hebrew word refers to a kind of wood rather than a group of people.</p>
