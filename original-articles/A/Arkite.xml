<p class="h1">ARKITE</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a clan descended from Ham’s son Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.17">Gn 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.15">1 Chr 1:15</a>). The Arkites were probably residents of Arqa, a Phoenician town north of Tripolis in Syria. According to an early inscription, Arqa was captured by the Assyrian Tiglath-pileser III in 738 <span class="era">BC</span>. Possibly another branch of the tribe settled near Ataroth, a town on the border between Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.2">Jos 16:2</a>).</p>
