<p class="h1">ANDRONICUS</p>
<p class="list">1. Deputy of Seleucid king Antiochus Epiphanes. This Andronicus aroused the Jews by murdering Onias, the high priest, and was himself then executed by Antiochus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.31-38">2 Macc 4:31-38</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Officer in charge of Gerizim after Antiochus Epiphanes sacked Jerusalem (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.21-23">2 Macc 5:21-23</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Christian greeted by the apostle Paul in his Letter to the Romans (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.7">16:7</a>) but not mentioned elsewhere. Paul called Andronicus his kinsman. The word could mean fellow countryman, fellow Jew, member of Paul’s own family, or other relative. Andronicus may also have been a fellow prisoner for the cause of Christ, perhaps even in the same prison with Paul (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.4-5">2 Cor 6:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.23">11:23</a>). Paul described him as a man of note among the apostles and recognized him respectfully as an “older” Christian.</p>
