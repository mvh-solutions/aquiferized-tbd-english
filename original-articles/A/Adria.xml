<p class="h1">ADRIA</p>
<p class="fl">The Adriatic Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean Sea bordered by Italy on the west and by Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia on the east. The apostle Paul was tossed about in a ship for 14 days in a violent storm on this body of water (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.27">Acts 27:27</a>). Other ancient literature attests to the violence of the Adriatic Sea. The Jewish historian Josephus was shipwrecked in the Adriatic in <span class="era">AD</span> 64, and the Greek poet Homer made several references in his writings to the great storms on this sea.</p>
