<p class="h1">AGUE*</p>
<p class="fl">Intense fever marked by recurring chills, common in malaria. Our English word comes from the same stem as “acute.” The “fever” (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.22">Dt 28:22</a>) can cause “your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away” (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.16">Lv 26:16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Both passages describe punishments the Israelites would suffer if they disobeyed God’s laws. Early translators of the Septuagint used the Greek word for jaundice to translate the Hebrew word for ague, no doubt from association of both symptoms with malaria.</p>
