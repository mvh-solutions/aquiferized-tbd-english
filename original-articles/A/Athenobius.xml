<p class="h1">ATHENOBIUS</p>
<p class="fl">Friend of King Antiochus VII of Syria (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.28-36">1 Macc 15:28-36</a>). When Antiochus besieged the city of Dor the high priest Simon Maccabeus sent him 2,000 soldiers along with gold, silver, and military equipment. Antiochus refused the gift, severed all treaties with Simon, and sent Athenobius to Jerusalem to demand that Simon turn several fortified places over to him or pay heavy tribute, threatening retaliation if Simon refused. When Simon offered to pay only a tenth of the Syrian demands, Athenobius “returned wrath” to Antiochus, who then sent his general, Cendebeus, to attack Judea (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.38-41">1 Macc 15:38-41</a>).</p>
