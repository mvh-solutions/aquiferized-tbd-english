<p class="h1">ASMODEUS</p>
<p class="fl">An evil demon and jealous lover in the story of Tobit (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.3.8">Tb 3:8</a>). In the story, Sarah, only daughter of Raguel of Ecbatana, lost seven husbands to Asmodeus on seven different wedding nights. She remained in a state of deep grief until Tobit’s son Tobias married her and, through the advice of the angel Raphael, defeated Asmodeus through a ritualistic burning of the heart and liver of a fish. Generally speaking, Asmodeus was looked on as the king or chief of demons in Hebrew mythology. Possibly he was related to “Aeshma-daeva,” a Persian demon of storms, anger, and lust.</p>
