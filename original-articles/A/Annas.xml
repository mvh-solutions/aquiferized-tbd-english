<p class="h1">ANNAS</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish high priest from <span class="era">AD</span> 7 to 15. Appointed by Quirinius, Roman governor of Syria, Annas was put out of office by Valerius Gratus, procurator of Judea. Annas was succeeded by three minor figures before the post was assumed by his son-in-law Caiaphas (<a href="?bref=John.18.13,24">Jn 18:13, 24</a>). The tenure of Caiaphas extended from <span class="era">AD</span> 18 to 36; thus, he was high priest at the time of Jesus’ public ministry.</p>
<p>Evidently Annas’s power and influence remained considerable even after his removal from that office. Like an American Supreme Court justice, the high priest held a lifetime appointment. Deposition of a high priest by the pagan Romans would have been strongly resented by the Jews. Consequently, Annas may still have been referred to as high priest among the populace, as a sort of high priest emeritus. Such a practice, evidenced in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus, tends to clear up those references in the NT to Annas as high priest during the same chronological period as Caiaphas (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.2">Lk 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.19,22-24">Jn 18:19, 22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>). The fact that Annas conducted a private inquiry of Jesus after he was arrested (<a href="?bref=John.18.13,19-24">Jn 18:13, 19-24</a>) but before he was taken to Caiaphas, is a strong indication that Annas was still a person of considerable stature among the Jewish religious leaders.</p>
<p>Annas is also mentioned in the NT account of an investigation of the apostles Peter and John. Interestingly, the penalty imposed on the apostles was far less severe than the one Jesus suffered (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.6-21">Acts 4:6-21</a>).</p>
