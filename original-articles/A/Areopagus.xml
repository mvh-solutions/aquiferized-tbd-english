<p class="h1">AREOPAGUS*</p>
<p class="fl">Hill northwest of the Acropolis in Athens overlooking the marketplace (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.19">Acts 17:19</a>). “Areopagus” also refers to the Athenian council or court that met there. The irregular limestone outcropping was also known as Mars Hill, Mars being the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Ares. Paul was taken to the Areopagus after he had been reasoning with Jews and God-fearing Gentiles in the Athenian synagogue and marketplace <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">agora</span><span class="ital">)</span> for several days (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.16-21">Acts 17:16-21</a>). Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers involved in those discussions brought Paul before the council but evidently not for an official arraignment. Trials were held at the Areopagus; there, some five centuries earlier, Socrates had faced those who accused him of deprecating the Greek gods. By Paul’s day the council of the Areopagus was responsible for various political, educational, philosophical, and religious matters, as well as for legal proceedings. The general tone of Paul’s address does not suggest judicial proceedings. He spoke as an intelligent Christian believer who was able to meet the intellectual Athenians on their own ground (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.22-31">Acts 17:22-31</a>). Some remained skeptical, but his address was convincing to a few who “joined him and became believers” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.32-34">Acts 17:32-34</a>).</p>
