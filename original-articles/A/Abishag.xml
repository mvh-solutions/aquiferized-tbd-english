<p class="h1">ABISHAG</p>
<p class="fl">Beautiful young woman from Shunem who was appointed to care for David during his last days (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-4">1 Kgs 1:1-4</a>). After David’s death, Adonijah asked permission from his half brother King Solomon to marry Abishag. In the ancient Near East, to claim the concubine of a deceased king was to claim the throne. Enraged, Solomon ordered Adonijah to be killed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.13-25">1 Kgs 2:13-25</a>).</p>
