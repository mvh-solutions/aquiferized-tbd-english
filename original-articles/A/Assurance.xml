<p class="h1">ASSURANCE</p>
<p class="fl">Certainty or confidence about one’s beliefs or actions. The “assurance of hope” (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.11">Heb 6:11</a>) and the “assurance of faith” (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.22">Heb 10:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.1">11:1</a>) are mentioned as qualities of wholeness that lead believers to responsible living. Paul spoke of an “assured understanding” of the gospel of Christ, which resulted in love in the community (<a href="?bref=Col.2.2">Col 2:2</a>), and of the “assured blessing” which was his in Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.29">Rom 15:29</a>).</p>
