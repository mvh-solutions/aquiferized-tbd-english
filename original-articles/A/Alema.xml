<p class="h1">ALEMA</p>
<p class="fl">City in Gilead from which Judas Maccabeus liberated Jews who had been surrounded by hostile Gentiles (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.24-35">1 Macc 5:24-35</a>). Most authorities place it some 25 to 35 miles (40 to 55 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee, perhaps at modern Alma in Gilead. Helam, scene of a decisive victory by David, might be the same site (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.16-17">2 Sm 10:16-17</a>).</p>
