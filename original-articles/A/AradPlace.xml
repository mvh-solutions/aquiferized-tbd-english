<p class="h1">ARAD (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a Canaanite settlement or region in the Negev Desert at the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan. The king of Arad attacked the Israelites and was defeated (<a href="?bref=Num.21.1-3">Nm 21:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.40">33:40</a>). Consequently the Israelites renamed the place Hormah (“destruction”). Arad was later conquered by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.14">Jos 12:14</a>).</p>
<p>Until recently archaeologists thought this Arad was the modern Tell Arad. Excavations at Tell Arad, however, have shown that this site was uninhabited at the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Some scholars have suggested that the Arad mentioned in Numbers and Joshua was a region and not a specific place. Others say there were two Arads, the Canaanite city located possibly at Tell Malhata about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) southwest of Tell Arad, and the Israelite city located at modern Tell Arad. This second suggestion is supported by an inscription of Shishak, an Egyptian pharaoh (940?–915 <span class="era">BC</span>), which indicates that two cities named Arad existed during the early first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The only possible mention of modern Tell Arad is in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Judges 1:16</a>, where Arad is used as a reference point for the land settled by the Kenites. Tell Arad had been a large important city during the early Bronze Age, but after being destroyed around 2600 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was not reoccupied until shortly before 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>. From the time of King Solomon (970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>) until the Jews were taken into exile, Tell Arad served as a fortified citadel on Judah’s southern border.</p>
<p>Several interesting discoveries were made during the excavation of Tell Arad. An Israelite sanctuary was uncovered that is very similar in plan to the tabernacle and the temple, with an altar of the dimensions described in <a href="?bref=Exod.27.1">Exodus 27:1</a>. It has been suggested that this sanctuary might have served as the worship center of the Kenite clan. Tell Arad has also provided us with a number of inscribed potsherds, called ostraca. One such ostracon contains a reference to the “house of Yahweh,” a possible reference to the temple in Jerusalem.</p>
