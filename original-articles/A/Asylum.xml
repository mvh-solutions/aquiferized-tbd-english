<p class="fl">Place of refuge where a fugitive from justice is immune to arrest or retribution; also, the protection afforded by such a place. An equivalent term is “sanctuary” (originally meaning “holy place”), from the ancient custom of seeking asylum at an altar or in a temple. Thus Adonijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.50-53">1 Kgs 1:50-53</a>) and Joab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.28-31">1 Kgs 2:28-31</a>) both sought sanctuary from King Solomon at the altar of the tabernacle. In the law of Moses asylum was provided through the establishment of cities of refuge. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=CitiesofRefuge_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Cities of Refuge</a>.</p>
