The boy king traveled with his regent Lysias to relieve the besieged Jerusalem in 163 <span class="era">BC</span>. He eventually made peace with Judas Maccabeus. Returning to Antioch, Antiochus V was betrayed by his cousin Demetrius I who also claimed the throne. The young king and his regent were put to death in 162 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
