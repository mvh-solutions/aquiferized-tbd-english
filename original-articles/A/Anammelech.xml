<p class="h1">ANAMMELECH</p>
<p class="fl">Deity associated with Adrammelech, who was worshiped by the people of Sepharvaim, whom the Assyrians relocated in Samaria after 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. Anammelech is evidently the Hebrew rendering of the designation for a Mesopotamian deity, Anu-melek, meaning “Anu is King.” Anu was the name of the chief god of Assyria, the sky god. The worship of this deity by the Sepharvites in Samaria included child sacrifice (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.31">2 Kgs 17:31</a>). It is not certain whether the burning of children in the Anu cult was brought from Sepharvaim or was an innovation when the Sepharvites came to Canaan.</p>
