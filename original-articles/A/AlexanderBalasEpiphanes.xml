<p class="fl">Pretender who claimed to be the son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Alexander landed at Ptolemais in 152 <span class="era">BC</span> and from 150 <span class="era">BC</span> onward claimed to be the king.

In 147 <span class="era">BC</span>, Alexander was challenged by Demetrius II and was overcome in 145 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.1-11.74">1 Macc 10–11</a>).</p>
