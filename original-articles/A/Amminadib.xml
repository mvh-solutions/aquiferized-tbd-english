<p class="h1">AMMINADIB*</p>
<p class="fl">Word occurring in some English versions of the <a href="?bref=Song.6.12">Song of Songs 6:12</a>, “or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib” (<span class="sc">asv</span> mg, <span class="sc">nasb</span> mg). More recent translators have not regarded the term as a proper name. Some proposals for more accurate wording are: “among the chariots of my willing people” (<span class="sc">asv</span>); “in a chariot beside my prince” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>); “over the chariots of my noble people” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>); and “in my princely bed with my beloved one” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
