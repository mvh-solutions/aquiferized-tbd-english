<p class="h1">ASHTAROTH, ASHTERATHITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Town of Bashan, named along with Edrei as the home of King Og (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.4">Dt 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.10">Jos 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.4">12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.12,31">13:12, 31</a>). Ashtaroth is the plural form of Ashtoreth, the name of the Canaanite fertility goddess who was worshiped there. After Og was defeated by the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.1-11">Dt 3:1-11</a>), Moses gave Ashtaroth to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.12,31">Jos 13:12, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.13">Dt 3:13</a>). Later, it became a Levitical city inhabited by the Gershonites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.71">1 Chr 6:71</a>). Ashteroth-karnaim (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>) is probably the same town as Ashtaroth. Its location is usually identified with Tell Ashtarah, 21 miles (34 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.44">1 Chronicles 11:44</a> one of David’s mighty men, Uzzia, is called an Ashterathite.</p>
