<p class="h1">APPEAL</p>
<p class="fl">Legal term meaning to request a higher court review of a decision by a lower one. OT law made no provision for appeals. In the NT the apostle Paul appealed to Caesar for a hearing after his arrest in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.11">Acts 25:11</a>). Because he was a Roman citizen, Paul could have his case removed from the Jewish courts where he feared an unfair trial.</p>
