<p class="h1">AMULET*</p>
<p class="fl">Small object worn by an individual, usually around the neck, as a charm or means of protection against evil, witchcraft, disease, or other physical and spiritual threats. The word is probably derived from either a Latin or Arabic term meaning “to carry.” Amulets (also known as talismans) have been made of various substances and occur in many forms. Pieces of metal or strips of parchment with portions of sacred writings (even Scriptures), as well as herbs and animal preparations, have been used. Semiprecious gems were often inscribed with a magical formula.</p>
<p>No Hebrew or Greek word in the Bible is translated “amulet” with certainty. The practice of wearing amulets, however, is sometimes implied—generally with disapproval. The gold earrings worn by the Israelites escaping from Egypt, from which Aaron fashioned a golden calf, have been considered amulets (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.2-4">Ex 32:2-4</a>). The prophet Isaiah condemned the ornaments worn by the women of his day (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.16-23">Is 3:16-23</a>). Most scholars regard the phylacteries and mezuzahs used by the Jews as forms of amulets. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Phylactery_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Phylactery</a>; <a href="?item=Magic_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Magic</a>; <a href="?item=Frontlet_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Frontlet</a>.</p>
