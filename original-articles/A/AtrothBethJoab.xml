<p class="h1">ATROTH-BETH-JOAB</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Judah near Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.54">1 Chr 2:54</a>). Since the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">‘ataroth</span> means “crowns,” some scholars think that the phrase may not be a town name at all but a reference to Salma’s descendants as chiefs of Joab’s clan.</p>
