<p class="h1">ANTIOCHIANS</p>
<p class="fl">“Turncoat” Jews of the intertestamental period who had largely abandoned their Judaism for Greek ideas and practices. During the reign of the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes (second century <span class="era">BC</span>), Palestine was subjected to an intensive “Hellenizing” program. Many citizens of Jerusalem compromised or disregarded their religious heritage under the strong social and economic pressure to “be Greek” in every possible way. Jason supplanted his brother Onias as high priest (through a bribe) and worked hand in hand with Antiochus Epiphanes to create a community of Greek-thinking people within Jerusalem. Jason established a gymnasium (school) to further his indoctrination program and introduced new customs contrary to the Jewish practice. Many Jews corrupted themselves at his prodding and left the faith of their fathers. Even the priests neglected the sacrificial system to sample the worldly pleasures offered by Jason and his cohorts, “putting the highest value on Greek forms of prestige” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.15">2 Macc 4:15</a>). In <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.9">2 Maccabees 4:9</a>, this group of turncoat Jews was referred to as “citizens of Antioch” (the Syrian capital). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MaccabeanPeriod_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Maccabean Period</a>; <a href="?item=Hasmonean_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Hasmonean</a>.</p>
