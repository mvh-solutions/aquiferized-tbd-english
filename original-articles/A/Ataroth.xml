<p class="h1">ATAROTH</p>
<p class="list">1. Town in the mountainous region east of the Jordan River. Ataroth was rebuilt by Gad’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.32.3,33-36">Nm 32:3, 33-36</a>). It was mentioned on the famous Moabite Stone by King Mesha, who said he brought back the “altar of David” from Ataroth. This Ataroth is probably modern Khirbet Attarus.</p>
