<p class="h1">AHIMELECH</p>
<p class="list">1. A priest at Nob who aided David in his flight from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-9">1 Sm 21:1-9</a>). When he was asked for food, all he could provide was the holy bread in the tabernacle (Jesus referred to this incident in <a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-8">Mt 12:1-8</a>). Doeg the Edomite subsequently reported this action to Saul, who ordered Ahimelech put to death. Saul’s guards were unwilling to execute a priest, but the informer Doeg had no such inhibitions. He killed Ahimelech and 84 other priests, plus their families and livestock (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.9-19">1 Sm 22:9-19</a>). Only Abiathar, Ahimelech’s son, escaped and fled to David’s protection (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.20-23">22:20-23</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.52.1-9">Psalm 52</a> was written by David as an indictment of Doeg’s treachery.</p>
<p class="list">2. Hittite who joined David’s guerrilla force during his flight from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.6">1 Sm 26:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Son of Abiathar and grandson of #1 above. This Ahimelech aided his father in the priesthood under King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sm 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.3,5,31">1 Chr 24:3, 5, 31</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.16">1 Chr 18:16</a>, where some versions have Abimelech instead).</p>
