<p class="h1">ARPAD</p>
<p class="fl">City in northern Syria. Arpad was overrun twice by the Assyrians: in 740 <span class="era">BC</span> by Tiglath-pileser III and in 720 <span class="era">BC</span> by Sargon II. The Assyrians used Arpad and Hamath as examples of the inability of any gods, including Israel’s, to protect cities against Assyria’s attacks (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.34">2 Kgs 18:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.13">19:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.9">Is 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.19">36:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.13">37:13</a>). Arpad and Hamath are also mentioned in a later prophecy against the Syrian city of Damascus (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.23">Jer 49:23</a>). Arpad has been identified as modern Tell Erfad, north of Aleppo.</p>
