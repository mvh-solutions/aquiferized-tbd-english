<p class="h1">APOTHEGM*</p>
<p class="fl">Short, pithy saying. As used by some biblical scholars, the term “apothegm” denotes brief stories in the Gospels that culminate in a saying of Jesus (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.8.18-22">Mt 8:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.10-13">9:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.18-22">Mk 2:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.13-15">10:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.1-5">Lk 6:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.37-44">11:37-44</a>). Also known as “pronouncement stories,” the apothegmata (plural) are devoid of a larger historical setting and contain only enough detail to make the saying of Jesus intelligible. Because such stories were used in worship, in the education of new Christians, and in the correction of false teachings, they were of great interest to the early church.</p>
