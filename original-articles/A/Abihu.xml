The four sons of Aaron were made priests along with their father (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.1">Ex 28:1</a>), but later Abihu and Nadab were burned to death for offering “a different kind of fire” before the Lord (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1">Lv 10:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; see also <a href="?bref=Num.3.2-4">Nm 3:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.61">26:61</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.1-2">1 Chr 24:1-2</a>).</p>
