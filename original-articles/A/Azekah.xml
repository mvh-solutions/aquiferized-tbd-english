<p class="h1">AZEKAH</p>
<p class="fl">Town in the agricultural plain known as the Shephelah. It existed at least as early as the conquest of Canaan (the Promised Land), since Joshua drove the confederation of Amorite kings to Azekah (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.10,22">Jos 10:10, 22</a>). It is also mentioned in connection with the encounter of David and Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1">1 Sm 17:1</a>). Archaeological excavations have shown that Azekah was heavily fortified with a system of underground refuge chambers (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.9,11">2 Chr 11:9, 11</a>). Azekah, Lachish, and Jerusalem are mentioned as the only remaining walled cities of the southern kingdom of Judah at the time of Nebuchadnezzar’s assault on Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.34.7">Jer 34:7</a>). Azekah was resettled by some who returned from the Babylonian exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.30">Neh 11:30</a>). Today it is known as Tell Zakariyeh.</p>
