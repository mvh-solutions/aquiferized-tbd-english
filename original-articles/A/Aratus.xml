<p class="h1">ARATUS*</p>
<p class="fl">Greek poet (315?–245? <span class="era">BC</span>). Born at Soli in Cilicia (region in Asia Minor), Aratus studied in Athens where he was influenced by Zeno, the father of Stoicism. Later, Aratus lived in the palace of Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia and Antiochus I, king of Syria. Aratus’s only existing work is a poem on astronomy, “Phaenomena,” dedicated to Zeus. The apostle Paul quoted from that poem in his speech on the Aeropagus in Athens: “We are indeed his offspring” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">Acts 17:28</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
