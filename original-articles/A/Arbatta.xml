<p class="h1">ARBATTA</p>
<p class="fl">Region south of the Esdraelon Valley in the southwest corner of Galilee. When its inhabitants were threatened by non-Jewish forces of Ptolemais, Tyre, and Sidon (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.15">1 Macc 5:15</a>), they sent an urgent letter requesting help from Judas Maccabeus. Judas dispatched his brother Simon who, with 3,000 men, rescued the Galileans “and led them into Judea with great rejoicing” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.23">1 Macc 5:23</a>).</p>
