<p class="h1">AKRABBIM*</p>
<p class="fl">A mountain pass or slope in southern Palestine between the southwestern tip of the Dead Sea and the wilderness of Zin. The pass (<a href="?bref=Num.34.4">Nm 34:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.36">Jgs 1:36</a>) of Mt Akrabbim served as part of the southern border of the land given to Judah’s tribe after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.3">Jos 15:3</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Maaleh-acrabbim”). During the intertestamental period, Judas Maccabeus won an important victory over the Idumeans at this pass (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.3">1 Macc 5:3</a>). Also called Scorpion Pass.</p>
