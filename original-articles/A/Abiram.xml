<p class="h1">ABIRAM</p>
<p class="list">1. One of Eliab’s two sons. Abiram and his brother Dathan joined in an uprising against Moses and Aaron. At Moses’ word, the ground split open beneath the two rebellious brothers and everything associated with them was swallowed up in a massive earthquake (<a href="?bref=Num.16.1-33">Nm 16:1-33</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Hiel’s oldest son, who died prematurely when his father presumptuously rebuilt Jericho (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kgs 16:34</a>). Joshua’s prophetic curse was thereby fulfilled (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.26">Jos 6:26</a>).</p>
