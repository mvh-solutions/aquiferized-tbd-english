<p class="h1">ARVAD, ARVADITE</p>
<p class="fl">Small fortified island about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) off the coast of Syria (ancient Phoenicia) and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Tripolis. Arvad developed a large trading and fighting fleet, and the fame of its sailors was referred to in a description of the naval power of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.8,11">Ez 27:8, 11</a>). Egyptian records recount Arvad’s fall to Thutmose III about 1472 <span class="era">BC</span>. Assyrian records indicate the importance of Arvad and its recurrent conquest by foreign powers from the 11th to the 7th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Arvad was later known as Aradus or Arados, and is referred to as such in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.23">1 Maccabees 15:23</a>. During the Persian and Hellenistic periods it was once again an important Mediterranean seaport, only to decline again. The Canaanite tribe of Arvadites (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.18">Gn 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.16">1 Chr 1:16</a>) possibly had an ethnic connection with the island Arvad. Today Arvad is known as Ruad.</p>
