<p class="h1">ASHER (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jacob’s son born to Leah’s maid Zilpah (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.12-13">Gn 30:12-13</a>). The name Asher, probably meaning “happy,” was given to the child by Leah in her delight at his birth. Asher had four sons, Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and a daughter, Serah (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.17">Gn 46:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.30">1 Chr 7:30</a>). Some have speculated that the tribe of Asher took its name from a locality mentioned in Egyptian texts of the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. It is more likely that the tribe bore the name of its ancestor. Asher and his brothers received a special blessing and prediction from Jacob as he was dying (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.20">Gn 49:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.33.24-25">Dt 33:24-25</a>, where the dying Moses blessed Asher and the other tribes).</p>
