<p class="h1">APOLLOPHANES</p>
<p class="fl">Syrian warrior during the intertestamental period. Apollophanes was killed at a fortress named Gazara by the forces of Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.37">2 Macc 10:37</a>). His death occurred after a dramatic battle in which the Jewish forces relied on the Lord for victory, in contrast with the Syrians who “made rage their leader” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.24-31">2 Macc 10:24-31</a>).</p>
