<p class="h1">ABIEZER</p>
<p class="list">1. Descendant of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.1-2">Jos 17:1-2</a>). Although Abiezer’s father is not named, Abiezer is listed with the descendants of his mother’s brother, Gilead (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.18">1 Chr 7:18</a>). In <a href="?bref=Num.26.30">Numbers 26:30</a>, Abiezer’s name is shortened to Iezer (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Jeezer”), and the family is called Iezerites (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Jeezerites”). Abiezer’s family, to which Gideon belonged, was the first clan to respond to Gideon’s call to fight the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.34">Jgs 6:34</a>). Abiezer’s descendants were referred to as Abiezrites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.11,24,34">Jgs 6:11, 24, 34</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.8.32">8:32</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Member of Benjamin’s tribe from Anathoth and warrior among David’s mighty men, known as “the thirty” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.27">2 Sm 23:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.28">1 Chr 11:28</a>). This Abiezer was commander of the ninth division of the army in the rotation system established by David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.12">1 Chr 27:12</a>).</p>
