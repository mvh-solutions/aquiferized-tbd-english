<p class="h1">ADONIJAH</p>
<p class="list">1. David’s fourth son, born to Haggith at Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.4">2 Sm 3:4</a>). After the deaths of his three older brothers (Amnon, Chileab, and Absalom), Adonijah was next in line for the throne. According to 1 Kings, David had promised his wife Bathsheba that their son Solomon would be the one to succeed him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.17">1:17</a>). When his elderly father seemed to be dying, Adonijah began preparations to crown himself king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-10">1:1-10</a>). Before the ceremonies could take place, David appointed Solomon as his successor (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.11-40">1:11-40</a>). Adonijah kept out of Solomon’s way at first (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.41-53">1:41-53</a>) but eventually worked up enough courage to ask King Solomon for permission to marry Abishag, the woman from Shunem who was appointed to care for David during his last days. In the ancient Near East, to claim the concubine of a deceased king was to claim the throne. Enraged, Solomon ordered Adonijah to be killed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.13-25">2:13-25</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Levite sent out by King Jehoshaphat of the southern kingdom of Judah to teach the people the law of the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.8">2 Chr 17:8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Political leader who signed Ezra’s covenant of faithfulness to God with Nehemiah and others after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.16">Neh 10:16</a>).</p>
