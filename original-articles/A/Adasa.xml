<p class="h1">ADASA</p>
<p class="list">1. Town mentioned only in the period of the Maccabean revolt. Judas Maccabeus defeated the Syrian army under Nicanor in 161 <span class="era">BC</span> at Adasa. The victory was celebrated annually on the 13th of Adar (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.40,45,49">1 Macc 7:40, 45, 49</a>). The modern site is probably Khirbet ’Adassa, 7 miles (11 kilometers) from Beth-horon.</p>
<p class="list">2. Leader of a group of Babylonian exiles returning to Judah who were unable to prove their Jewish ancestry (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.5.36">1 Esd 5:36</a>). The same name, spelled Addon, seems to refer to an otherwise unidentified place in the Babylonian Empire (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.61">Neh 7:61</a>).</p>
