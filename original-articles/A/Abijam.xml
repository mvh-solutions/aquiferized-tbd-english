<p class="h1">ABIJAM</p>
<p class="fl">Rehoboam’s son and successor as king of Judah, 913–910 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.10">1 Chr 3:10</a>; alternately called “Abijah” in <a href="?bref=2Chr.11.18-22">2 Chr 11:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.16">12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.1-22">13:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.14.1">14:1</a>). A major focus of Abijam’s reign was his war with King Jeroboam I of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.1-3">2 Chr 13:1-3</a>). Before a decisive battle, Abijam stood on Mt Zemaraim and shouted condemnation of Jeroboam’s political divisiveness and religious idolatry (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.4-12">2 Chr 13:4-12</a>). Abijam and his army then prayed for God’s help in their precarious military position. Against two-to-one odds, they fought their way out of an ambush and won a stunning victory over Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.13-19">2 Chr 13:13-19</a>). Abijam’s reign in the southern kingdom of Judah was summed up rather unfavorably in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.1-8">1 Kings 15:1-8</a>: “He committed the same sins as his father before him, and his heart was not right with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of his ancestor David had been” (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3">3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). But God had promised to keep David’s descendants on the throne in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.36">1 Kgs 11:36</a>), so Abijam’s son Asa succeeded him. Being of David’s line, Abijam was an ancestor of Jesus, the Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.7">Mt 1:7</a>, “Abijah”).</p>
