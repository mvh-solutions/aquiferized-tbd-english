<p class="h1">ACZIB</p>
<p class="list">1. City in Judah’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.44">Jos 15:44</a>). The prophet Micah listed it among cities that would be destroyed with Samaria (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.14">Mi 1:14</a>). It was probably the same as Chezib (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.5">Gn 38:5</a>) and Cozeba (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.22">1 Chr 4:22</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. City in Asher’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.29">Jos 19:29</a>), one of seven from which the tribe failed to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Jgs 1:31</a>). Recent excavations at Aczib (modern ez-Zib) show that the town was occupied almost continuously from the ninth to the third centuries <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
