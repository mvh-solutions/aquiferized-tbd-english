<p class="h1">ATTALIA</p>
<p class="fl">Mediterranean seaport in Asia Minor from which the apostle Paul and Barnabas sailed back to Antioch at the end of Paul’s first missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.25">Acts 14:25</a>). The town was founded by Attalus II Philadelphus, king of the province of Pergamum (159–138 <span class="era">BC</span>), which was taken by the Romans in 779 <span class="era">BC</span> and became a senatorial province in <span class="era">AD</span> 43. In Paul’s time Attalia was part of the province of Pamphylia. Today, though its harbor is shallow, it is still an important Turkish seaport (Antalya).</p>
