<p class="fl">City some 26 miles (41.8 kilometers) south of Caesarea rebuilt by Herod the Great in 9 <span class="era">BC</span> in honor of his father, Antipater. Before its rebuilding, it was known as Aphek. Paul passed through Antipatris under Roman guard on his way from Jerusalem to Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.31">Acts 23:31</a>). Antipatris served as a Roman military relay station and marked the border between Judea and Samaria.</p>
