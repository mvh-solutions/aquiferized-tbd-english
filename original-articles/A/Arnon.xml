<p class="h1">ARNON</p>
<p class="fl">River of Transjordan, the present Wadi el-Mojib, running from east to west through a canyon with walls 1,500 feet (457 meters) high into the Dead Sea. At the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the gorge served as a natural border between Moab to the south and the Ammonite kingdoms to the north (<a href="?bref=Num.21.13-15">Nm 21:13-15</a>). After the division of the land under Joshua the river Arnon became the southern boundary of Reuben’s territory (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.12,16">Dt 3:12, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.16">Jos 13:16</a>).</p>
