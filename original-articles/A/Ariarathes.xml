<p class="h1">ARIARATHES</p>
<p class="fl">King of Cappadocia in Asia Minor (163–130 <span class="era">BC</span>). Educated in Rome, Ariarathes absorbed Roman ideas and became a close ally of the Romans. Because of his Roman ties, he declined a proposal to marry the sister of the Syrian king Demetrius Soter, who then declared war on him and drove him from his throne. After fleeing to Rome in 158 <span class="era">BC</span>, Ariarathes was successful in eventually being restored to the throne of Cappadocia. In response to Simon Maccabeus, the Romans wrote to him and several other rulers in 139 <span class="era">BC</span> that they should be kind to the Jews and “do them no harm, nor fight against them” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.16-19,22">1 Macc 15:16-19, 22</a>).</p>
