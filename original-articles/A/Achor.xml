<p class="h1">ACHOR</p>
<p class="fl">Valley that received its name when Achan, the troubler of Israel, was stoned and burned there (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.24-26">Jos 7:24-26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.7">1 Chr 2:7</a>). Achor was on the northern boundary of Judah’s tribal allotment (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.7">Jos 15:7</a>). Later, the valley is mentioned in prophecies of Israel’s future blessings. A valley once known as the scene of Israel’s trouble would become “a door of hope” and a place for joyful singing (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.15">Hos 2:15</a>); a place of relative desolation would one day become a place for herds to lie down (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.10">Is 65:10</a>). The valley of Achor is commonly identified as the Buqei‘ah.</p>
