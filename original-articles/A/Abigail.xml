<p class="h1">ABIGAIL</p>
<p class="list">1. Nabal’s wife, who later became the wife of David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.2-42">1 Sm 25:2-42</a>). Nabal was a wealthy sheep owner whose holdings had been protected by David’s men. When David requested provisions in return for that protection, Nabal refused. Enraged, David set out with 400 armed men to destroy Nabal and his house. Abigail had been informed of her husband’s behavior and met David with many provisions, taking the blame for her foolish husband. David thanked God for using Abigail to restrain his anger.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Nabal woke from a drunken stupor the next morning and learned what had happened, he had a stroke from which he died 10 days later. Abigail then married David and shared his adventurous life among the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.3">1 Sm 27:3</a>). She was captured by the Amalekites and rescued by David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-19">1 Sm 30:1-19</a>). Abigail went with David to Hebron when he became king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.2">2 Sm 2:2</a>), and she bore his second son, Chileab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.3">2 Sm 3:3</a>), also called Daniel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1">1 Chr 3:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. David’s sister, who married Jether and gave birth to Amasa (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.16-17">1 Chr 2:16-17</a>). There appears to be confusion as to the ancestry of this Abigail. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.13-17">1 Chronicles 2:13-17</a> she is listed as a daughter of Jesse. However, in <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.25">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, her father is identified as Nahash. The discrepancy could be due to scribal error, or Nahash may be another name for Jesse, or the widow of Nahash could have married Jesse.</p>
