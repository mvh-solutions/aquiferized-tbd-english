<p class="h1">ASHNAH</p>
<p class="fl">Name of the two towns that Judahâ€™s tribe received after the conquest of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.33,43">Jos 15:33, 43</a>). No certain location for either is known, but both were in the lowlands separating Judah and Philistia. Although the Philistines often overran that buffer zone, they never got beyond its eastern border.</p>
