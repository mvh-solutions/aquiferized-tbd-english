<p class="h1">ATHBASH*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew cryptograph in which the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet is substituted for the last, the second for the next-to-last, etc., to produce a code. Such a code or cipher was used for the word “Chaldea” in <a href="?bref=Jer.51.1">Jeremiah 51:1</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> interprets the cipher as meaning “them that rise up against me”). Another athbash was used for “Babylon” in <a href="?bref=Jer.25.26">Jeremiah 25:26</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.51.41">51:41</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> treats that cipher as a proper name, “Sheshach”). The early Greek translation of the OT, the Septuagint, correctly deciphered these and translated them as “Chaldea” and “Babylon” respectively.</p>
