<p class="fl">An area near Pirathon in Ephraim, probably about six miles (9.6 kilometers) west of Shechem (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.15">Jgs 12:15</a>). It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible but not in the Greek manuscripts of the OT. Some scholars find the reference confusing; however, it is possible that an argument based on <a href="?bref=Judg.5.14">Judges 5:14</a> and <a href="?bref=Judg.12.15">12:15</a> can be made that there was a small Amalekite district in Ephraim.</p>
