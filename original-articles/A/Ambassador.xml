<p class="h1">AMBASSADOR</p>
<p class="fl">Messenger or envoy officially representing a higher authority. In the OT, an ambassador was a messenger, envoy, or negotiator sent on a special, temporary mission as an official representative of the king, government, or authority who sent him. Examples include the ambassador of Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.4">Is 30:4</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), of the princes of Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Chr.32.31">2 Chr 32:31</a>), and of Neco, king of Egypt (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.21">2 Chr 35:21</a>). In the letters of Paul, the apostle called himself an ambassador for Christ because he had an apostolic mission to convey the gospel of Christ to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.20">2 Cor 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.20">Eph 6:20</a>).</p>
