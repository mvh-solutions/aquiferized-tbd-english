<p class="h1">ADUMMIM</p>
<p class="fl">Pass extending from the hill country into the Jordan Valley, which formed part of Judah’s northern border (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.7">Jos 15:7</a>). It is a reference point establishing the location of Geliloth on Benjamin’s southern border (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.17">Jos 18:17</a>). The road from Jerusalem to Jericho ran through this mountain pass. The church father Jerome felt that this place was the setting for Jesus’ story of the Good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.30-37">Lk 10:30-37</a>). The modern Arabic name means “ascent of blood.” The Hebrew name Adummim (“red rocks”) probably stems from the natural color of the rocks rather than from the fate of many travelers through the pass at the hands of robbers.</p>
