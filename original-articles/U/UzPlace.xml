<p class="h1">UZ (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Homeland of Job (<a href="?bref=Job.1.1">Jb 1:1</a>). The name appears in parallels with Edom and is associated with the Uz in the family tree of the original Horites in Seir (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.21">Lam 4:21</a>). The book of Job does not locate the land of Uz, but it does say that the sons of the East (Kedem) lived there (<a href="?bref=Job.1.3">Jb 1:3</a>). Uz is also said to be close to the desert (v <a href="?bref=Job.1.15">15</a>) and to the Chasdim (v <a href="?bref=Job.1.17">17</a>). This indicates that it was located to the east of the land of Israel.</p>
<p>The associations with Edom strongly suggest that the land of Uz was populated by descendants of the Horites of Seir. Further support for this view is a verse in the Greek version at the end of the book of Job: “since he had lived in the land of Uz on the borders of Edom and Arabia.” Certain ancient traditions place the home of Job in Bashan. Josephus also says that Job lived in Traconitis and Damascus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 1.6.4), with reference to the Uz of the Aramean genealogy (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.23">Gn 10:23</a>).</p>
