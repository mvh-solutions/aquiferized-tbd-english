<p class="h1">UNLEAVENED BREAD</p>
<p class="fl">Bread made without leaven (yeast). In ancient times, bread makers used a piece of dough remaining from a former baking process, a piece that had fermented and developed a certain acid content—the yeast that caused bread to rise.</p>
<p>Bread used at the Jewish Passover and most other religious observances was, by the command of God, unleavened (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.15-20">Ex 12:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.15">23:15</a>). Only under certain conditions were the people permitted to use leavened bread for spiritual purposes (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.13">Lv 7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.17">23:17</a>). This was largely owing to the fact that leaven generally symbolized evil; fermentation implied decay and corruption.</p>
<p>With the exception of Jesus’ teaching on the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.33">Mt 13:33</a>), the NT also speaks of leaven with a negative connotation. Jesus warned of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.6">16:6</a>); Paul exhorted believers to guard against that tiny bit of yeast—unhealthy values—that can work through a whole batch of dough (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.6-8">1 Cor 5:6-8</a>).</p>
