<p class="h1">UZZAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Son of Abinadab who was killed while accompanying the cart that carried the ark of the covenant when it was returned from the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-8">2 Sm 6:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.7-11">1 Chr 13:7-11</a>). He was struck dead by the Lord because he took hold of the ark while trying to steady it, thereby violating the instructions of <a href="?bref=Num.4.15">Numbers 4:15</a>. Uzzah’s brother, Ahio, was apparently leading the oxen while Uzzah walked alongside. As a result of the incident, David renamed the site Perez-uzzah (“the breaking forth against Uzzah”) and left the ark at the home of Obed-edom.</p>
<p class="list">2. Levite from the clan of Merari who is listed as the son of Shimei and the father of Shimea (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.29">1 Chr 6:29</a>).</p>
