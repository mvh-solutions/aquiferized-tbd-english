<p class="h1">URIM AND THUMMIM</p>
<p class="fl">Two untranslated Hebrew words that might mean “lights and perfections.” They refer to some kind of stones or tokens that the ancient high priests of Israel used for discovering the will of God (<a href="?bref=Num.27.21">Nm 27:21</a>). They were probably like dice or coins that had to land upright or upside down. According to <a href="?bref=Exod.28.30">Exodus 28:30</a>, they were kept on or in the breastpiece of the high priest. They are not mentioned from the time of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.6">1 Sm 28:6</a>) until the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.63">Ezr 2:63</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.65">Neh 7:65</a>), when they were used for reaccrediting returned priests. In <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.41">1 Samuel 14:41</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span> mg, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), the Greek translation preserves what may have been lost from the Hebrew original, a mention of them in connection with Saul’s effort to determine guilt in his army. That they could give answers to true-false or yes-no questions is evident from this verse. Hence, the system was probably akin to casting lots.</p>
<p>None of the major spiritual leaders (e.g., Abraham, Moses, David, or the prophets) ever used them for determining the will of God, and there is no mention of them in the NT. The Urim and Thummim belonged to the nation Israel in its developing years, not when there were prophets and surely not once the Holy Spirit was available to believers.</p>
