<p class="h1">SALIM</p>
<p class="fl">Location near Aenon on the west side of the Jordan River. Aenon was known for its many springs and was used by John as a place for baptism (<a href="?bref=John.3.23">Jn 3:23</a>). Its location is not certain. Some scholars agree with Eusebius (an early church father) that its location was about seven miles (11.3Â kilometers) south of Scythopolis (Beth-shan) in the Decapolis region. Others suggest it was the Salim east of Nablus near Shechem in Samaria, or perhaps the Wadi Saleim, six miles (9.7 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem.</p>
