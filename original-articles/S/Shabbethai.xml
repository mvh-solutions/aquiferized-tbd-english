<p class="list">1. Levite who opposed Ezra’s suggestion that the sons of Israel should divorce the foreign women they had married upon returning to Palestine from exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.15">Ezr 10:15</a>). He explained the law to the people at Ezra’s reading (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.7">Neh 8:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the chiefs of the Levites who oversaw the outside work of the sanctuary during the postexilic period (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.16">Neh 11:16</a>). He is perhaps identical with #1 above.</p>
