<p class="h1">SHULAMMITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Name or title of Solomon’s lover in his Song (<a href="?bref=Song.6.13">Sg 6:13</a>). Her identity is not certain. Some suggest that Shulammite refers to a woman from the city of Shunem. Her designation as Shunammite was perhaps changed to Shulammite for its similarity in sound to Solomon’s Hebrew name. Shunem was situated in the land of Issachar near Mt Gilboa (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.4">1 Sm 28:4</a>). It was from this city that Abishag the beautiful Shunammite woman was called to nurse King David in his later years (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-4,15">1 Kgs 1:1-4, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.17-22">2:17-22</a>). It is possible that Abishag became the beloved Shulammite maiden of Solomon’s song.</p>
