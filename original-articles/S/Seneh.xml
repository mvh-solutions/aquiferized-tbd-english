<p class="fl">Name of one of the two rocky crags at a pass across the Wadi es-Suweinit over which Jonathan and his armor bearer crossed in their skirmish against the Philistines. The crag opposite Seneh was called Bozez and faced the town of Micmash to the north. Seneh was visible to the town of Geba to the south (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.4-5">1Â Sm 14:4-5</a>).</p>
