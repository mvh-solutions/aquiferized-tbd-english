<p class="h1">SHUR</p>
<p class="fl">Wilderness region located in the Sinai Peninsula east of Egypt’s Nile Delta and west of the Negev. In antiquity, a caravan route passed through this region from Egypt to Palestine. Abraham lived for a time between Shur and Kadesh (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.1">Gn 20:1</a>), and it was part of the territory occupied by the Ishmaelites (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.18">25:18</a>). After crossing the Red Sea, Moses led Israel on a three-day trek through this arid wasteland (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.22">Ex 15:22</a>). King Saul of Israel (1020–1000 <span class="era">BC</span>) conquered the Amalekites in the vicinity of Shur (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.7">1 Sm 15:7</a>), and later David (1000–961 <span class="era">BC</span>) defeated the Geshurites, Girzites, and Amalekites here (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.8">27:8</a>). The wilderness of Etham in <a href="?bref=Num.33.8">Numbers 33:8</a> is identical with the wilderness of Shur.</p>
