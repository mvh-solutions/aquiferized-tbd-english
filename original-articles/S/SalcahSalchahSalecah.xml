<p class="h1">SALCAH*, SALCHAH*, SALECAH</p>
<p class="fl">City or district that formed the northeastern extremity of the Amorite kingdom of Og in Bashan, east of the Jordan River. Salecah (variously spelled Salcah and Salchah in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>) was located near the city of Edrei (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.5">Jos 12:5</a>). The Israelites gained possession of this city when they defeated Og (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.10">Dt 3:10</a>). Later, Salecah was included in the land received by Gad’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.11">Jos 13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.11">1 Chr 5:11</a>). The city is identifiable with the modern town of Salkhad.</p>
