<p class="h1">SEIR (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Father of seven sons and a descendant of Abraham through Esau’s line. Originally a Horite tribe dwelling in the land of Edom, the nation descended from Seir was first dispossessed by, but later intermarried with, Esau’s descendants. Perhaps for this reason Seir and his offspring were included in the genealogies of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.20-21">Gn 36:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.38">1 Chr 1:38</a>).</p>
