<p class="h1">SERAPH*, SERAPHIM</p>
<p class="fl">Angelic beings mentioned only twice in the Bible, both occurring in the same chapter of Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.2,6">Is 6:2, 6</a>). The word <span class="hebrew">seraphim</span> is plural in number, but it is impossible to say from Isaiahâ€™s vision just how many he saw. The prophet spoke of them as though they were quite familiar spiritual beings, which seems a little curious since they are not mentioned elsewhere.</p>
<p>Isaiah described each seraph as having six wings: two shielded the face, two covered the feet, and the remaining pair enabled the seraph to fly. The most that can be said from the available evidence is that they were exalted spiritual entities who were occupied constantly in the praise and worship of God. Most probably the seraphim were an order of celestial beings comparable in nature to the cherubim and engaged in a somewhat similar form of service around the divine throne.</p>
