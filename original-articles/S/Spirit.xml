<p class="h1">SPIRIT</p>
<p class="fl">Designation of that aspect of existence that is noncorporeal and immaterial. Its Latin derivation (as with the Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible—<span class="hebrew">ruach</span> and <span class="greek">pneuma</span>) denotes blowing or breathing (<a href="?bref=Job.41.16">Jb 41:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.25.4">Is 25:4</a>). So the noun <span class="ital">spiritus</span> signifies breath and life. God, the source of all life, is himself Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.4.24">Jn 4:24</a>). He put a spirit within all human beings so that they could commune with him in his realm and in his nature. A Christian’s experience of Jesus Christ is made real when that person experiences the Spirit of Jesus Christ in his or her spirit.</p>
