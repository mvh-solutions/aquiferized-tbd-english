<p class="h1">SIMON MACCABEUS</p>
<p class="fl">The second son of Mattathias was successor to his brother Jonathan. In 142 <span class="era">BC</span> Simon (d. 135 <span class="era">BC</span>) negotiated a treaty with Syria by supporting Demetrius II against the plunderer Trypho. Under this treaty, Judea was recognized as politically independent. The Syrians were finally driven from the citadel at Jerusalem and “the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.13.41">1 Macc 13:41</a>). In 141 <span class="era">BC</span> “the Jews and their priests decided that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever until a trustworthy prophet should arise” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.41">14:41</a>). These two offices were made hereditary in the Hasmonean family. Simon Maccabeus is considered perhaps the best leader of Israel in the postexilic period. Antiochus VII invaded Israel in 133 <span class="era">BC</span> and was defeated by Simon’s sons, Judas and John, at Modin. This was the single interruption in six years of prosperous rule. Simon and his sons were assassinated by his son-in-law and chief rival for power, Ptolemy son of Abub. John Hyrcanus (d. 104 <span class="era">BC</span>), Simon’s youngest son, escaped and succeeded to his father’s position before Ptolemy could reach Jerusalem. John ruled from 134 to 104 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
