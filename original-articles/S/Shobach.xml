<p class="h1">SHOBACH</p>
<p class="fl">Commander of the army of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, who led the Ammonite-Syrian campaign against Israel. David’s army killed Shobach and so completely destroyed his forces that the Ammonite-Syrian alliance was broken, and the kingdoms that were tributary to Hadadezer became subject to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.16-18">2 Sm 10:16-18</a>). He is also called Shophach in <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.16-18">1 Chronicles 19:16-18</a>.</p>
