<p class="h1">SYROPHOENICIA*</p>
<p class="fl">Homeland of the Greek woman who approached Jesus in the region of Tyre and Sidon and pleaded with him to cast a demon out of her daughter (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.26">Mk 7:26</a>). The region of Phoenicia was located in the Roman province of Syria. Perhaps the designation of Syrophoenicia was used so as not to confuse this womanâ€™s country with the Phoenicia of North Africa called Libyphoenicia. In a parallel passage, this woman is identified as a Canaanite, a name by which Phoenicians called themselves (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.22">Mt 15:22</a>).</p>
