<p class="h1">SUICIDE</p>
<p class="fl">The act of taking one’s own life voluntarily and intentionally. Though the word “suicide” does not appear in most Bible translations (see, however, <a href="?bref=John.8.22">Jn 8:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), the OT records suicides by Saul and his armor bearer (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.3-6">1 Sm 31:3-6</a>), Ahitophel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.23">2 Sm 17:23</a>), and Zimri (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.15-19">1 Kgs 16:15-19</a>). Judas Iscariot is the only suicide victim mentioned in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-5">Mt 27:3-5</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible does not directly condemn suicide but rather treats it as an indication of moral failure, often intensified by guilt or great personal loss. Saul had lost his sanity, his stability, and then his three sons on the battlefield. So he ended his life. Ahitophel, once a trusted counselor, was ruined by his ambition. When his plot against David was refused by Absalom, he felt disgraced. So he went home, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. Judas Iscariot also hung himself, but his suicide was far more tragic. He, one of the twelve disciples, betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Then he deeply regretted what he had done, and brought back the money to the Jewish leaders, saying “I have sinned in that I betrayed an innocent man” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-4">Mt 27:3-4</a>). As an expression of desperate remorse, Judas hanged himself.</p>
