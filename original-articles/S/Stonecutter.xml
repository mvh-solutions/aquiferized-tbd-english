<p class="h1">STONECUTTER</p>
<p class="fl">A stonemason who removed stone from the quarry and squared it up for use in large buildings like palaces, the temple, administrative buildings, and large houses (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.18">1 Kgs 5:18</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.12">2 Kgs 12:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.22.2,15">1 Chr 22:2, 15</a>). At first, the Israelites used Phoenician artisans, but they soon learned the art themselves and produced many fine buildings, such as those in Samaria. Herod’s masons left behind beautiful masonry in Jerusalem, Hebron, Samaria, and elsewhere. Some of these artisans produced fine work for the interior of buildings to be used in windows, doors, lintels, and capitals for pillars. One special class of stonecutters, the engravers (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.11">Ex 28:11</a>), worked with precious stones to produce seals, ornamental pieces, and jewelry.</p>
