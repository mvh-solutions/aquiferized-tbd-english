<p class="h1">STRONG DRINK</p>
<p class="fl">Any intoxicating liquor. It was forbidden to Levites who were entering the tent of meeting (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.9">Lv 10:9</a>); to those taking the Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.3">Nm 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.13.4-14">Jgs 13:4-14</a>); to kings and rulers (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.4">Prv 31:4</a>); and to John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.15">Lk 1:15</a>). The writer of <a href="?bref=Pr.20.1">Proverbs 20:1</a> suggests that the wise man does not become intoxicated by it. Isaiah pronounces woe on those addicted to it (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.11,22">Is 5:11, 22</a>). Strong drink was used as a libation in the Levitical sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Num.28.7">Nm 28:7</a>) and was permitted in the menu of the feast at the time of tithing (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.26">Dt 14:26</a>).</p>
