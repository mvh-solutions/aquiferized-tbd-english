<p class="h1">SON OF MAN</p>
<p class="fl">Messianic title used by Jesus to express his heavenly origin, earthly mission, and glorious future coming. It does not refer merely to his human nature or humanity, as some church fathers or contemporary scholars believe. Rather, it reflects on the heavenly origin and divine dignity of Jesus, on the mystery of his manifestation in human form, and on his earthly mission that took him to the cross and then into glory.</p>
<p>The background of the term “Son of Man” is to be found in the OT. The book of Ezekiel is the general source, since this prophet was referred to as “son of man” 90 times. For example, God addressed him, “Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.1">Ez 2:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus’ use of the term “Son of Man” and numerous themes from Ezekiel suggest his desire to identify himself as the eschatological prophet who, like Ezekiel (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-17">4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.1-27">7</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">10</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.1-31">22</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">40–48</a>), had the last word about the destruction of Jerusalem and the restoration of the kingdom of God to Israel (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-24.51">Mt 23–24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-8">Acts 1:6-8</a>).</p>
<p>The specific source of the term is <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, with its vision of one “like a son of man” who “comes with the clouds” into the presence of “the Ancient of Days,” who gives him the universal and eternal kingdom of God. Jesus repeatedly quoted parts of this text in teaching about his second coming (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Mt 16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31">25:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.64">26:64</a>). Clearly, Jesus understood this passage as a prophetic portrayal of his own person: his incarnation, ascension, and inheritance of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In the Gospels, the term “Son of Man” is used by Jesus about 80 times as a mysterious, indirect way of speaking about himself (Mt, 32 times; Mk, 14 times; Lk, 26 times; Jn, 10 times). In all these texts, Jesus was always the speaker, and no one ever addressed him as “Son of Man.” In some texts the reference is cryptic enough for some interpreters to insist that Jesus was speaking about another person. Such uncertainty is recorded in only one text in John, where the crowd asks Jesus, “Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” (<a href="?bref=John.12.34">Jn 12:34</a>). In most texts, the identification is clear. In some it is explicit: “Who do men say that the Son of Man is?”—followed by, “Who do you say that I am?” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13,15">Mt 16:13, 15</a>). The conclusion generally drawn is that Jesus used the term as a messianic title for himself, so that he could speak modestly about his person and mission yet convey the exalted content he wished to reveal about himself. He could do this with considerable originality because the term was not fraught with popular misconceptions concerning the Messiah.</p>
<p>The term occurs only four other times in the NT. In <a href="?bref=Acts.7.56">Acts 7:56</a>, Stephen says, “Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing in the place of honor at God’s right hand!” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). <a href="?bref=Heb.2.6">Hebrews 2:6</a> quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.8.4">Psalm 8:4</a> as applying to Jesus. Finally, <a href="?bref=Rev.1.13">Revelation 1:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.14.14">14:14</a> record visions of someone “like a son of man,” who is undoubtedly the glorified Jesus.</p>
<p>In the synoptic Gospels, the first theme in Jesus’ self-revelation connected with his use of the title “Son of Man” concerns his coming to earth to accomplish his messianic mission. A general comparison of Jesus’ present earthly condition with that of his previous heavenly glory is expressed in the saying “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.20">Mt 8:20</a>; see <a href="?bref=Luke.9.58">Lk 9:58</a>). This saying indicates that the Son of Man gave up his heavenly home to suffer all the humiliations of his earthly ministry (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-11">Phil 2:5-11</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus used the title to claim divine prerogatives, saying, “The Son of Man is Lord of the sabbath” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.8">Mt 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.28">Mk 2:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.5">Lk 6:5</a>). The Sabbath, a divine institution, may not be revised by ordinary men. But since Jesus is the Son of Man from heaven, he is free to rule as Lord even of the Sabbath, because he is the same Lord who instituted the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.2">Gn 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>). After healing the paralytic at Capernaum, Jesus claimed that “the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.6">Mt 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.10">Mk 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.24">Lk 5:24</a>). Previously, forgiveness of sins came from heaven and from God, but now forgiveness comes from Capernaum and is given by Jesus.</p>
<p>The second aspect of Jesus’ use of the “Son of Man” title concerns his suffering, death, and glorious resurrection as the mysterious method he would use to fulfill his earthly mission as the Son of Man. Jesus began expounding this passion theme after Peter confessed him to be Messiah and Son of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>). Jesus’ prediction of his passion as the Son of Man begins in <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31-32">Mark 8:31-32</a> and is repeated in several other texts. The Gospels expand the theme to include his suffering of mockery and scourging (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.12">Mt 17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.18">20:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.22">Lk 9:22</a>), betrayal by Judas (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.22">Mt 17:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.24-25">26:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.21,41">Mk 14:21, 41</a>), rejection by the Jewish leaders (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.18">Mt 20:18</a>), death by crucifixion (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.19">Mt 20:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.12,31">Mk 9:12, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.33">10:33</a>), burial for three days (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">Mt 12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.30">Lk 11:30</a>), and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.22-23">Mt 17:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>).</p>
<p>In the famous text “The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>), Jesus teaches that his death was a vicarious sacrifice for the salvation of his people. This idea of substitutionary atonement is a new element in the Son of Man material and derives from Jesus’ understanding of himself as the suffering Servant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Is 53</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus also used the “Son of Man” title to teach about his second coming. As the Son of Man, Jesus will return to earth from heaven in the glory of his Father with the angels (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Mt 16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mk 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.26">Lk 9:26</a>). First, he will be seated at the right hand of God, and then he will come again (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.64">Mt 26:64</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mk 14:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.69">Lk 22:69</a>) with the clouds (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Mt 24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mk 13:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.27">Lk 21:27</a>). This coming will be unexpected (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.27">Mt 24:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.40">Lk 12:40</a>), like a flash of lightning or the flood of Noah (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.37">Mt 24:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.24">Lk 17:24</a>). His coming will be for the gathering of the elect, the judgment of all the nations of the earth (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">Mt 19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.32">25:32</a>), and the restoration of final righteousness in the world (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.46">25:46</a>).</p>
<p>In these passages, Jesus’ focus shifts from the provisional victory in his passion and resurrection to the final victory of the Son of Man at his second coming. Here again, the dramatic emphasis is on the heavenly origin and divine prerogatives of the Son of Man. This man Jesus, the Son of Man, will be the final judge (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">Acts 17:31</a>).</p>
<p>The Gospel of John has its own distinctive material concerning the Son of Man. The angels are said to ascend and descend on the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=John.1.51">Jn 1:51</a>), thereby signifying that he is a preexistent person who has come from heaven to earth (<a href="?bref=John.3.13">3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.62">6:62</a>). His being lifted up (by crucifixion) will bring about eternal life for all who believe in him (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">3:14</a>). The Son of Man (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">3:14</a>) is also the Son of God (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">3:16</a>), God’s one and only Son (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.18">3:18</a>). Quite simply, in John’s Gospel, the “Son of Man” title is equivalent to the title “Son of God.” It reveals his divinity, preexistence, heavenly origin, and divine prerogatives. It affirms his present earthly condition for revelation and passion, and his future eschatological glory. The Father has given the Son of Man authority to raise the dead and to judge the world (<a href="?bref=John.5.25-27">5:25-27</a>).</p>
