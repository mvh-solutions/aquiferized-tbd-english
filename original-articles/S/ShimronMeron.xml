<p class="h1">SHIMRON-MERON</p>
<p class="fl">Canaanite city destroyed by Joshua on his northern military campaign in Palestine. The king of Shimron-meron was one of 31 kings defeated by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.20">Jos 12:20</a>). This king was perhaps one of the northern kings summoned by Jabin, king of Hazor, to combine forces in an attempt to defeat Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.1">11:1</a>). In all probability, Shimron-meron was one of the 12 cities included in the territory allotted to Zebulun for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.15">19:15</a>).</p>
