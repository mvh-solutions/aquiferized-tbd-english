<p class="h1">SO</p>
<p class="fl">A king of Egypt, mentioned once in Scripture (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.4">2 Kgs 17:4</a>), with whom Hoshea, king of Israel, sought an alliance. This rebellious move, in part, prompted Shalmaneser V of Assyria to imprison Hoshea (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.3-5">2 Kgs 17:3-5</a>). It is difficult to identify So with any of the rulers of Egypt who are named in extrabiblical sources.</p>
