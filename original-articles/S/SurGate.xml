<p class="h1">SUR GATE</p>
<p class="fl">Gate in Jerusalem linking the king’s palace to the temple. It is mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.6">2 Kings 11:6</a> in connection with the enthronement of Jehoash over Judah and the murder of Athaliah. Its parallel passage in <a href="?bref=2Chr.23.5">2 Chronicles 23:5</a> reads the “Gate of the Foundation,” revealing perhaps a corruption within the Hebrew text.</p>
