<p class="h1">SELEUCIA</p>
<p class="fl">Name of several ancient Near Eastern cities, all founded by Seleucus I Nicator (312–281 <span class="era">BC</span>). The most important is Seleucia in Syria on the northeast corner of the Mediterranean, five miles (8 kilometers) north of the mouth of the Orontes River and 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) from Antioch, for which it was the port. Built by Seleucus I in 301 <span class="era">BC</span> and strongly fortified to guard his capital from the west, it changed hands several times in the disputes between the Seleucid rulers in Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Dan.11.7-9">Dn 11:7-9</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.8-19">1 Macc 11:8-19</a>). In 109 <span class="era">BC</span> the Seleucid ruler, having shaken free of the Ptolemies, granted freedom to the city, along with the privilege of coining money. When the Romans appeared in the east, Pompey conferred the status of “free city” on Seleucia. However, he broke the power of the Seleucids and formed the Roman province of Syria with the free city of Seleucia as a port of entry to the east. Its fine natural harbor and artificial defenses were improved.</p>
<p>In NT times Seleucia remained a free city and harbored Rome’s Syrian fleet. Barnabas, Saul, and John Mark sailed from here on their first missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.4-5">Acts 13:4-5</a>) and returned to Antioch via Seleucia (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.26">14:26</a>). Later, on Paul’s second missionary journey, Paul and company again set out from Seleucia (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39-41">15:39-41</a>). The city was undoubtedly an attractive place with many public buildings, a temple, and an amphitheater cut out of a cliff.</p>
