<p class="h1">SUPH</p>
<p class="fl">Region mentioned in <a href="?bref=Deut.1.1">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>, which was “beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “the Red Sea”). The exact location of Suph is uncertain. It may refer to the region of Suphah (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.21.14">Nm 21:14</a>), east of the Jordan River, or perhaps to the Gulf of Aqaba, the northeastern branch of the Red Sea.</p>
