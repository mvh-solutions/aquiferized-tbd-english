<p class="h1">SEPHARVAIM, SEPHARVITES*</p>
<p class="fl">One of five cities and its inhabitants who were transported to Samaria after the fall of Israel to Sargon II, king of Assyria, in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24">2 Kgs 17:24</a>). The Sepharvites were remembered for their abominable practice of offering their children as burnt sacrifices to their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech. In a taunting message to King Hezekiah of Judah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>), King Sennacherib of Assyria (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) warned that as the gods and kings of Sepharvaim were not able to prevent her fall to the Assyrians, so too it would be with Jerusalem and Hezekiah’s God (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.34">2 Kgs 18:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.19">Is 36:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.13">37:13</a>). The location of Sepharvaim is uncertain. It is probably identifiable with the Syrian city of Sibraim near Damascus (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.16">Ez 47:16</a>).</p>
