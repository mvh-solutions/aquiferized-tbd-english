<p class="h1">SHALMAN</p>
<p class="fl">Unknown conqueror whose brutal destruction of Beth-arbel was descriptive of Israelâ€™s approaching judgment (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.14">Hos 10:14</a>). Several suggestions as to the identification of Shalman are the following: Salamanu, the king of Moab who paid tribute to Tiglath-pileser of Assyria; one of the Shalmaneser kings of Assyria; and Shalmah, a north Arabian tribe that invaded the Negev.</p>
