<p class="h1">SMITH</p>
<p class="fl">Worker in metals; a blacksmith. The earliest metalworker mentioned in the Bible is Tubal-cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.22">Gn 4:22</a>). The term covers metalworkers of all kinds: copper, bronze, iron, silver, and gold. Silversmiths are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Judg.17.4">Judges 17:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.19.24">Acts 19:24</a>. Ironsmiths were rare or even nonexistent in Israel up to the time of Samuel, and the Israelites had to go to the Philistine smiths to have their iron tools sharpened (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19">1 Sm 13:19</a>). In the days of the kings, Israelite smiths were active and were subsequently taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.14-16">2 Kgs 24:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.24.1">Jer 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.2">29:2</a>). Details of the work of the smith are given in several accounts (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.4">Prv 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.12">Is 44:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.16">54:16</a>). The smiths mentioned in <a href="?bref=Zech.1.20">Zechariah 1:20</a> are probably ironsmiths or blacksmiths.</p>
