<p class="h1">SANBALLAT</p>
<p class="fl">Leading political official of Samaria residing at Beth-horon in Ephraim. In a letter from Elephantine of Egypt, Sanballat was named as the governor of Samaria in 407 <span class="era">BC</span>. Sanballat, along with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arab, were adversaries of Nehemiah. They tried to prevent him from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem during the postexilic period (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.10,19">Neh 2:10, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1,7">4:1, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-14">6:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.28">13:28</a>). The Judean province probably had been included under Samaritan rule since its defeat by Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nehemiahâ€™s determination to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem was in essence an assertion of Judean independence from Sanballat and Samaritan control.</p>
