<p class="h1">SHAARAIM</p>
<p class="list">1. One of 14 cities in the lowland region of the territory allotted to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance, listed between Azekah and Adithaim (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.36">Jos 15:36</a>). Shaaraim was in the direction in which the Philistines tried to escape from the pursuing Israelites following David’s slaying of Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.52">1 Sm 17:52</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. One of 14 cities where the sons of Shimei, a descendant of Simeon, lived until David’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.31">1 Chr 4:31</a>). It is possibly the same city as Sharuhen (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.6">Jos 19:6</a>), mentioned in a parallel passage, and Shilhim, located in the southern portion of Judah near Edom’s border (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.32">15:32</a>).</p>
