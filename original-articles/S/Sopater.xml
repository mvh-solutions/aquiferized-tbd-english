<p class="h1">SOPATER</p>
<p class="fl">Man from the church at Berea who, with others, accompanied Paul to Jerusalem to deliver the offering collected by the gentile churches for the Jewish Christians who were suffering from the effects of a famine (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>). Sopater is perhaps identical to Sosipater, the kinsman of Paul who sent greetings to the church at Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.21">Rom 16:21</a>).</p>
