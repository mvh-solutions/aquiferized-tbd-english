<p class="h1">SILK</p>
<p class="fl">Fine, delicate thread extracted from the cocoon of the silkworm. Originating in China, silk may have been introduced into Palestine as early as Solomon’s reign (970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>), or perhaps not until the conquests of Alexander the Great (336–323 <span class="era">BC</span>). A fine silken fabric was apparently included in the fashionable attire of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.10-13">Ez 16:10-13</a>). <a href="?bref=Rev.18.12">Revelation 18:12</a> lists silk as a valuable trade commodity of Babylon (Rome).</p>
