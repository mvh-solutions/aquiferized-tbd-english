<p class="h1">SAMOS</p>
<p class="fl">Small Greek island located off the coast of Asia Minor in the Aegean Sea near the promontory of Trogyllium. This Ionian island was positioned southwest of Ephesus and northwest of Miletus. In Paul’s day, it was a prosperous commercial center and considered autonomous by Rome. In his wish to bypass Ephesus, Paul anchored near Samos on his journey to Jerusalem at the close of his third missionary journey. Paul’s stay at Samos was mentioned between stops at Kios and Miletus (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.15">Acts 20:15</a>).</p>
