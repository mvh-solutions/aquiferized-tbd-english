<p class="fl">Geographical landmark defining one of the boundaries of the territory settled by the sons of Joktan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.30">Gn 10:30</a>). Undoubtedly located in southern Arabia, Sephar is most often identified with one of two towns bearing the Arabic name Zafar: the seaport town in central Yemenâ€™s Hadhramaut province, or the site in southern Yemen, once the capital of the Himyarites.</p>
