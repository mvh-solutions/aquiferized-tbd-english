<p class="h1">SUSANNA</p>
<p class="fl"/>
<p class="list-space">1. One of the women who ministered to Jesus out of her own resources (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.3">Lk 8:3</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. The heroine of the apocryphal book Susanna and the Elders; a woman falsely charged with adultery but saved by the young prophet Daniel. This story, compacted into 64 verses, is considered a great piece of literature and the first true detective story. The book is economical in its characters, casting the prophet Daniel as the clever private investigator, Susanna as the beautiful and virtuous crime victim, and two community elders as unscrupulous, lustful villains. Characteristic of this story, like its counterparts in the modern genre, is the belief that right will prevail.</p>
