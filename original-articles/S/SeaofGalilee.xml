<p class="h1">SEA OF GALILEE</p>
<p class="fl">A large body of water in Palestine. It has had many names in its history. In the OT the Sea of Galilee was known as the Sea of Chinnereth or Kinnereth (<a href="?bref=Num.34.11">Nm 34:11</a>), named for the town (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.35">Jos 19:35</a>), or as Chinneroth (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">12:3</a>). Later, the name was changed to Lake of Gennesaret because the city of Gennesaret was located on the site of Chinnereth or Tell Ureime (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1">Lk 5:1</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.67">1 Macc 11:67</a>). The most familiar name—the Sea of Galilee—was due to its connection with the province of Galilee to the west (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18">Mt 4:18</a>). It derived the name Sea of Tiberias (<a href="?bref=John.6.1,23">Jn 6:1, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.1">21:1</a>) from the town of Tiberias on its southwestern shore. About <span class="era">AD</span> 26 Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, built the town near the warm springs of Hamath by the sea and named it for the emperor. In the Gospels “the sea” usually identifies the Sea of Galilee. Its modern Hebrew name is <span class="hebrew">Yam Kinneret</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p class="h2" id="Location">Location</p>
<p class="fl">The sea lies in the lower section of the Jordan Valley about 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) north of Jerusalem, located in a range of mountains. The mountains of Upper Galilee are northwest of the lake and rise to a height of 4,000 feet (1,219.2 meters) above sea level, while the mountains on the east and west ascend about 2,000 feet (609.6 meters). On the west, south, and east is the Decapolis.</p>
<p>At the northwest corner of the lake the mountain wall flattens into the rich plain of Gennesaret, and on the east at 2,000 feet (609.6 meters) above sea level it gives way to the fertile El Batila in the northeast, where the Jordan enters the sea. At the time of the NT the Sea of Galilee was surrounded by the towns of Capernaum, Bethsaida, Korazin, Magdala, Tiberias, and others.</p>
<p>The sea is an integral part of the Jordan River, which feeds it with water from the snowcapped Mt Hermon (towering over 9,000 feet, or 2,743.2 meters, above sea level) and the Lebanon mountains. In its 65-mile (104.6-kilometer) course from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, the Jordan River drops 590 feet (179.8 meters), an average of about nine feet per mile.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Description">Description</p>
<p class="fl">The lake is approximately 13 miles or 20.9 kilometers long and 6 miles or 9.7 kilometers wide (7½ miles or 12.1 kilometers at its broadest point opposite Magdala). It lies almost 700 feet (213.4 meters) below the Mediterranean Sea, and its greatest depth is 200 feet (60.9 meters). Its shape resembles a harp, and some scholars think the name Chinnereth comes from a Hebrew word meaning “harp.” The climate is semitropical. Because of this climate, combined with the sulphur springs at Tiberias, it became a resort to which sick people traveled. The lake abounds in fish, so fishing became an important industry (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-22">Mt 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">Mk 1:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.9-11">Lk 5:9-11</a>). Sudden and violent storms (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.23-27">Mt 8:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-41">Mk 4:35-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.22-25">Lk 8:22-25</a>), caused by the collision of warm and cold air, occur regularly.</p>

<p class="fl">Most of the events of Jesus’ life took place in Galilee, especially around Gennesaret, the most densely populated area of Palestine. He is said to have lived at Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13">Mt 4:13</a>), and he did many miracles there (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.23">11:23</a>). Because the area on the west of the lake was a health resort, Jesus found many infirm people there and healed them (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.32-34">Mk 1:32-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.53-56">6:53-56</a>). Other important occurrences in relation to the sea were the Sermon on the Mount, traditionally near Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-48">Mt 5:1ff</a>.; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.8.1,5">8:1, 5</a>); the drowning of the swine in the region of the Gadarenes (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.28-34">8:28-34</a>); the curse on Korazin (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.21">11:21</a>); the calming of the sea (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.23-27">8:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-41">Mk 4:35-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.22-24">Lk 8:22-24</a>); and Jesus’ walking on the water (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.22-23">Mt 14:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.45-51">Mk 6:45-51</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.16-21">Jn 6:16-21</a>).</p>
