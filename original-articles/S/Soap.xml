<p class="h1">SOAP</p>
<p class="fl">Cleansing agent extracted from a number of alkali-bearing plants. The alkali was gathered from the ashes of the burned plants and formed into a detergent. Saltwort, soapwort, and glasswort were alkali-bearing plants indigenous to western Asia and known to the ancient Hebrews. Soap was used primarily for cleansing purposes. In <a href="?bref=Jer.2.22">Jeremiah 2:22</a> soap is used to clean the body, and in <a href="?bref=Mal.3.2">Malachi 3:2</a>, to wash clothes.</p>
