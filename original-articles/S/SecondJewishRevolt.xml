<p class="h1">SECOND JEWISH REVOLT*</p>
<p class="fl">This Bar-Kochba Revolt, so-called after its leader, lasted from <span class="era">AD</span> 131 to 135. The cause was twofold: (1) the emperor Hadrian made circumcision a crime punishable by death; and (2) he decided to rebuild Jerusalem and erect a shrine to Zeus on the derelict temple site. This incensed Jewish fury.</p>
<p>Bar-Kochba—whose name means “son of a star” and was therefore believed to be the “star out of Jacob” (<a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Nm 24:17</a>)—was hailed by many Jews as the Messiah. His guerrilla warfare tactics involved Jews and Romans in colossal losses, but Julius Severus finally eradicated Jewish resistance.</p>
<p>Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem, renamed it Aelia Capitolina, resettled it with Gentiles, and forbade Jews even to enter it, on pain of death.</p>
