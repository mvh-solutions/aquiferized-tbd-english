<p class="h1">LIGHTNING</p>
<p class="fl">The flashing of light. When the Bible speaks of lightning, it usually has to do with God making an appearance. It occurs, therefore, at very dramatic moments, as when God comes down upon Mt Sinai just before giving the Ten Commandments to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.16">Ex 19:16</a>); or referring to the return of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.27">Mt 24:27</a>), where lightning is only one of many spectacular signs of the event (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.14">Ez 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.6">Dn 10:6</a>). It is a common symbol also in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.5">Rv 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.5">8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.18">16:18</a>), a book whose chief concern is to give a vision of God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the figure of lightning speaks of God in special ways. It can accompany judgment against God’s enemies (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.15">2 Sm 22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.18">Rv 16:18</a>). More often, it points to God’s power and kingship over all creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.135.7">Ps 135:7</a>). Lightning is one of the things God mentions to Job (<a href="?bref=Job.38.35">Jb 38:35</a>) to show him how great is the creation and the Creator, and how small Job is by comparison (compare <a href="?bref=Ps.77.16-18">Ps 77:16-18</a>).</p>
