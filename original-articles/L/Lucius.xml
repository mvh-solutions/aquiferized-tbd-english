<p class="h1">LUCIUS</p>
<p class="list">1. Man from Cyrene, listed among the prophets and teachers in Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">Acts 13:1</a>). He may have been among the Jewish Christians from Cyprus and Cyrene who preached to the Gentiles in Antioch in the face of persecution (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-21">11:19-21</a>). Various attempts have been made to identify him with Luke, the author of Acts, or with the Lucius of <a href="?bref=Rom.16.21">Romans 16:21</a>, but these have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="list">2. Jewish believer (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.3">Rom 9:3</a>) and one of the companions of Paul who sent greetings to those in Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.21">16:21</a>). This casts doubt on Origenâ€™s identification of this Lucius with the Luke of the Gospel and Acts, who was most likely a Gentile (<a href="?bref=Col.4.12-14">Col 4:12-14</a>).</p>
