<p class="h1">LONGSUFFERING*</p>
<p class="fl">Word denoting long and patient endurance. This is a word used in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> four times in the OT (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Ex 34:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.18">Nm 14:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.15">Ps 86:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.15">Jer 15:15</a>) and 13 times in the NT. The <span class="sc">nlt</span> and other modern versions use “forbearance” and “patience” and other synonyms.</p>
<p>Longsuffering is usually applied to God (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.4">Rom 2:4</a>). A holy God must punish sin. Yet his loving nature delays that punishment to give the sinner time to repent and turn away from his sin (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.16">1 Tm 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.20">1 Pt 3:20</a>). Longsuffering is also a Christian virtue, a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>). Christians need to exercise this in their relationships with each other.</p>
