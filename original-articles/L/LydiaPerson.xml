<p class="h1">LYDIA (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Gentile woman who was converted under the preaching of Paul in Philippi (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14,40">Acts 16:14, 40</a>). Lydia was a dealer in purple cloth and came from the city of Thyatira in the region of Lydia in the western part of the Roman province of Asia (commonly known as Asia Minor). The description of her as “a worshiper of God” (or “God-fearer”) indicates that she was a Gentile who had been attracted to Judaism. After her conversion to Christianity and her baptism, she hosted Paul and Silas during their stay in Philippi.</p>
