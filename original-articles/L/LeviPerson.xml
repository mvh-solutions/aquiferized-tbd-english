<p class="list">1. Jacob’s third son by Leah (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.34">Gn 29:34</a>). The etymology of the name is uncertain. Levi’s name is associated with the tragedy at Shechem, where the male inhabitants of the city were ruthlessly murdered when Levi and Simeon sought to avenge the violation of their sister Dinah by Shechem the Hivite. Jacob condemned the act and before his death pronounced a judgment on Levi’s behavior (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.5-7">49:5-7</a>). According to these words, Levi’s descendants were to be dispersed among the tribes.</p>
<p class="list-text">The tribe of Levi was composed of the descendants of Levi’s three sons: Gershon (Gershom), Kohath, and Merari. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam traced their genealogy to Kohath (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.16">Ex 6:16</a>). The Levites remained faithful to Yahweh at the occasion of the golden calf by Mt Horeb. They were rewarded with the right to special service in and around the tabernacle (ch <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">32</a>) and later in the temple.</p>
