<p class="h1">LEHI</p>
<p class="fl">Place in Judah where the Philistines assembled to capture Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.15.9">Jgs 15:9</a>). The place was evidently in the hills, and after Samson’s victory (using a jawbone of an ass for a weapon), it was called “the height of the jawbone” (“Jawbone Hill,” <span class="sc">nlt</span>), that is, Ramath-lehi (v <a href="?bref=Judg.15.17">17</a>). It was apparently near a spring in a crater or depression (v <a href="?bref=Judg.15.19">19</a>). An adjacent cliff was called Etam (v <a href="?bref=Judg.15.11">11</a>). Other than somewhere in the hills behind Beth-shemesh, there is no hint of where to locate (Ramath-) Lehi.</p>
