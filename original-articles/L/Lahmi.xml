<p class="h1">LAHMI</p>
<p class="fl">Brother of Goliath the Gittite. According to <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.5">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>, he was killed by Elhanan. However, <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.19">2 Samuel 21:19</a> says that Elhanan killed Goliath rather than his brother Lahmi. Most interpreters accept the 1 Chronicles passage as the correct reading, the 2 Samuel text being a textual corruption.</p>
