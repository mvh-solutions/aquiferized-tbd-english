<p class="h1">LASEA</p>
<p class="fl">Seaport city on the island of Crete, about five miles (8 kilometers) east of Fair Havens. Paul’s ship passed Lasea on its way to Italy (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.8">Acts 27:8</a>). Little is known about Lasea; it is probably in ruins near Fair Havens. It may be the same as the Lasos that Pliny the Elder mentions in his <span class="ital">Natural History</span> (4.12.59). He says it was famous in the ancient world, for its region contained 100 cities and it was one of Crete’s most important ports.</p>
