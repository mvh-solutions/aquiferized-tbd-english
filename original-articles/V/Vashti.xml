<p class="h1">VASHTI</p>
<p class="fl">Queen during the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) who was deposed for refusing to show herself to the guests at a royal banquet (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.9-19">Est 1:9-19</a>). Since neither she nor Esther is otherwise known in secular history, many have suggested that they were inferior wives or concubines who were simply dignified with the title “queen.” According to Plutarch, Persian custom dictated that the kings would ordinarily eat with their legitimate wives, but when they wanted to “riot and drink,” they would send their wives away and call in their concubines. While this citation is often used to support the judgment that Vashti was called because she was only a concubine, the opposite conclusion better explains Vashti’s refusal to come. Vashti’s position as queen is indicated by the fact that she was supposed to appear with her “royal crown,” that she was always called “queen” until the time of her dismissal, and that her behavior should serve as an example for all the women in the kingdom.</p>
