<p class="h1">BAKER</p>
<p class="fl">One who prepares food. In biblical times, the baker operated in the home (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.3">Gn 19:3</a>), in the public bakery (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.21">Jer 37:21</a>), and in the palaces of kings and nobles (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.1-22">Gn 40:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.10,13">41:10, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.8.13">1Â Sm 8:13</a>), preparing bread and cakes from the basic staples of oil and flour. The Israelites fleeing from Egypt baked unleavened bread for their journey (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.39">Ex 12:39</a>). The bread and cakes were baked in some kind of pan or oven (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.4">Lv 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.26.26">26:26</a>). As Israelite society developed, specialized bakers operated and formed guilds. Some have argued that Hosea was a baker because of his knowledge of baking techniques (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.4-8">Hos 7:4-8</a>).</p>
