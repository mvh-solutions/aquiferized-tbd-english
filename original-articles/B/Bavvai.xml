<p class="h1">BAVVAI*</p>
<p class="fl">Individual who directed the repair of a section of the Jerusalem wall under Nehemiah’s supervision (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.18">Neh 3:18</a>). Bavvai was Henadad’s son and the official of half the district of Keilah, a town 17 miles (27.4 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem. Binnui (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.24">Neh 3:24</a>), also mentioned as Henadad’s son (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.9">Ezr 3:9</a>), may be a corrupted spelling of Bavvai, or the two may have been brothers. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Binnui_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Binnui #4</a>.</p>
