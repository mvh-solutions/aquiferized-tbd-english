<p class="h1">BETH-EDEN</p>
<p class="fl">Small Aramean (Syrian) state north of Damascus. Assyria conquered Beth-eden and deported its people to Kir (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.9">2 Kgs 16:9</a>), fulfilling the prediction in <a href="?bref=Amos.1.5">Amos 1:5</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “house of Eden”). Beth-eden, which means “house of delight,” is sometimes equated with the Eden of <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.23">Ezekiel 27:23</a>, the location of which is unknown. Its inhabitants are referred to as the “children of Eden” in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.12">2 Kings 19:12</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
