<p class="fl">Asphalt as found in its natural state; pitch, tar. “Bitumen” (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “slime”) was used for mortar in the Tower of Babel’s construction (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.3">Gn 11:3</a>) and to seal the reed basket in which baby Moses was concealed (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.3">Ex 2:3</a>). In Israel, the valley of Siddim was dotted with numerous bitumen pits into which a number of soldiers fell during Chedorlaomer’s war against Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.10">Gn 14:10</a>).</p>
