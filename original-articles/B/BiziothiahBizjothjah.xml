<p class="h1">BIZIOTHIAH, BIZJOTHJAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Listed in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.28">Joshua 15:28</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Bizjothjah”) as a city in the Negev Desert area of Judah. The Greek OT, called the Septuagint, has “and her daughters,” which would mean that this was not a specific place but rather the cluster of villages surrounding Hazar-shual and Beersheba. Such a translation is possible with a slight adjustment to the Hebrew text. It is difficult to say how the Hebrew text originally read.</p>
