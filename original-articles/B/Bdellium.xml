<p class="h1">BDELLIUM*</p>
<p class="fl">Substance mentioned twice in the OT, evidently the resinous gum of an Arabian shrub (known scientifically as <span class="ital">Commiphora africana</span>). The same genus of Middle Eastern plants includes the shrub from which myrrh is derived and possibly the one from which the biblical “balm” was obtained.</p>
<p>Apart from the Bible, bdellium was described by an English herbalist as an aromatic gum from a tree known in Persia and eastward. In the first century <span class="era">AD</span> the Roman writer Pliny mentioned the same tree and described the gum as waxlike and looking like pearl.</p>
<p>The manna gathered by the Israelites is described in the Bible as having the same color as bdellium (<a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Nm 11:7</a>). Bdellium is also mentioned along with the gold and onyx stone found near the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.12">Gn 2:12</a>). Because it was included in that list, bdellium was once thought to be pearl or a precious stone.</p>
