<p class="h1">BLACK OBELISK*</p>
<p class="fl">Shaft of black limestone describing the military successes of Shalmaneser III of Assyria (858–824 <span class="era">BC</span>) during the first 31 years of his reign. Six and a half feet (2 meters) high, smoothed off on its four sides, the obelisk has five rows of bas-reliefs extending around it with inscriptions between them written in cuneiform. The pictures show payment of tribute from five parts of Shalmaneser’s Empire.</p>
<p>Of special interest to Bible students is the second row of reliefs, portraying King Jehu of the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-10.36">2 Kgs 9–10</a>) bowing before Shalmeneser, who is accompanied by 13 Israelites bearing tribute. The inscription identifies him as Jehu and lists the tribute brought as including silver and gold bowls and vases, tin, and a royal staff. The relief is the only contemporary representation of any Israelite king. Jehu is shown in a long fringed cloak, a pointed soft cap, and a short rounded beard. His payment of tribute dates to 841 <span class="era">BC</span>, but there is no reference to it in the Bible.</p>
