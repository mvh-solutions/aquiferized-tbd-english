<p class="h1">BIRZAITH, BIRZAVITH*</p>
<p class="fl">Malchiel’s son of Asher’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.31">1 Chr 7:31</a>). Since parallel lists fail to mention him (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.17">Gn 46:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.44-47">Nm 26:44-47</a>), it is possible that Birzaith (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Birzavith”) was the name of a city Malchiel founded. If so, the city may have been northwest of Bethel, near Tyre, and is now called Birzeit.</p>
