<p class="h1">BAMOTH, BAMOTH-BAAL</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Moab allotted to Reuben’s tribe by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.17">Jos 13:17</a>, called Bamoth-baal). It had been one of Israel’s last encampments on the route into Canaan, the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.21.19-20">Nm 21:19-20</a>). Bamoth-baal, a mountain or high place, was probably a shrine to the Canaanite god Baal. King Balak of Moab took the prophet Balaam there to try to get him to curse Balak’s enemies, the people of Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.22.41-23.13">22:41–23:13</a>).</p>
