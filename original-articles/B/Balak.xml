<p class="h1">BALAK</p>
<p class="fl">Zippor’s son, king of Moab. Balak became fearful after the Israelites defeated the Amorites, so he attempted to hire a soothsayer named Balaam to pronounce a curse against Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-7">Nm 22:1-7</a>). Balak escorted Balaam to three different mountains and offered three different sacrifices, only to have Balaam each time deliver a blessing to the Israelites (chs <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">22–24</a>). Enraged, Balak sent Balaam away. That event was later remembered as an example of God’s special blessing on the Israelites and of the futility of trying to alter God’s will (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.9-10">Jos 24:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.25">Jgs 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.5">Mi 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.14">Rv 2:14</a>).</p>
