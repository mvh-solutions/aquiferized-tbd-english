<p class="h1">BEER-LAHAIROI</p>
<p class="fl">Well between Kadesh and Bered where Hagar, pregnant with Ishmael, was confronted by the angel of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.7-14">Gn 16:7-14</a>). The name given to the site means “the well of the Living One who sees me,” referring to God’s appearance to Sarai’s servant girl. Later, it became a frequent watering place for Isaac on his travels (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.62">Gn 24:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.11">25:11</a>).</p>
