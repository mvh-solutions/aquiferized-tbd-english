<p class="fl">Hebrew word used once in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> as a proper name for Jerusalem, denoting a promised blessing for the people of God (<a href="?bref=Isa.62.4">Is 62:4</a>). The word means “married” and was used symbolically by the prophet Isaiah to describe what God’s special relationship would be to his restored people. The same theme recurs in NT references to the “Bride of Christ.”</p>
