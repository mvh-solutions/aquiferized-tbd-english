<p class="h1">BOAZ (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Salmon’s son of Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ru 4:18-22</a>). Boaz lived in Bethlehem in the days of the judges and married Ruth, a Moabite woman. Boaz was an ancestor of Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Mt 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.32">Lk 3:32</a>) and a wealthy relative by marriage of Ruth’s mother-in-law, Naomi. Ruth attracted the attention of Boaz when she was gleaning in one of his fields (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.1-23">Ru 2</a>). His kindness to Ruth convinced Naomi that Boaz might be willing to redeem some land her husband had owned and at the same time accept the levirate marriage with Ruth that such a transaction required.</p>
