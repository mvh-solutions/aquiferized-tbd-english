<p class="list">1. Israelite campsite on their wilderness journey, probably just north of the Arnon River on the Moabite-Amorite border (<a href="?bref=Num.21.16">Nm 21:16</a>). The name means “a well.” Water from the well they dug there was commemorated in a song (<a href="?bref=Num.21.17-18">Nm 21:17-18</a>). A Moabite well that was later called Beer-elim (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.8">Is 15:8</a>) may have been the same location. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=WildernessWanderings_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Wilderness Wanderings</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Place to which Gideon’s son Jotham escaped after telling a parable against his half brother Abimelech, who had killed all the other sons of Gideon in an attempt to become king of Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.21">Jgs 9:21</a>).</p>
