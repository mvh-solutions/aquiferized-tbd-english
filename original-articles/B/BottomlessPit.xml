<p class="h1">BOTTOMLESS PIT</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase used in the Bible to denote the abode of the dead and of demonic forces. The Hebrew word (literally “the deep”) is translated “abyss” in many versions of the Bible. In the ancient world, the concept referred to anything so deep as to be unfathomable—for example, wells or fountains. It is used in that way in the OT to describe the primeval sea (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Gn 1:2</a>) or the ocean depths (<a href="?bref=Ps.33.7">Pss 33:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.77.16">77:16</a>). In Near Eastern cultures, the term was used to signify the inverse of the great vault of heaven; hence, it came to be used metaphorically for the grave, synonymous with Sheol (<a href="?bref=Ps.71.20">Ps 71:20</a>). In intertestamental times, it came to be used for the abode of evil spirits (Jubilees 5:6; 1 Enoch 10:4, 11).</p>
<p>In the NT, the term is used in both of these metaphorical ways. The demons pleaded not to be flung into “the abyss” (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.31">Lk 8:31</a>), which many connect with later references to a “prison” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Pt 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.6">Jude 1:6</a>). The exact meaning of such a prison is difficult to define; recent studies of passages like the above and of <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19">1 Peter 3:19</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">4:6</a> suggest that the abyss is probably not meant to be synonymous with hades. More likely, it refers to a place where evil spirits are confined. <a href="?bref=Rom.10.7">Romans 10:7</a>, on the other hand, uses the term for the grave, contrasting descent into it with ascension into heaven. Paul there freely adapted <a href="?bref=Deut.30.12-13">Deuteronomy 30:12-13</a>.</p>
<p>The major use of the term comes in the book of Revelation. There the “bottomless pit” is the abode of scorpion-like locusts (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1-11">Rv 9:1-11</a>); of the prince of the underworld, named “Abaddon” or “Destruction” (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">9:11</a>); and of the “Beast,” or Antichrist (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.7">11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>). It is also the place where Satan is confined for 1,000 years (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.1,3">20:1, 3</a>).</p>
<p>Several characteristics should be noted in a study of the “bottomless pit” concept in Revelation. First, it is under the absolute control of God. The angel “was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit” to unlock it (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1">9:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>); the Beast “is to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to perdition” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Satan is seized, bound, thrown, and locked in it (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.2-3">20:2-3</a>). Second, from the beginning it is meant for eternal destruction. After it was opened, “from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace” (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.2">9:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Although the bottomless pit is not the place of torment (i.e., “the lake of fire” in <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10-15">20:10-15</a>), it will be replaced by eternal punishment after the End (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>). Finally, it is the reverse image of heaven, and from it wickedness gushes forth. This is in keeping with the metaphor and the picture throughout Revelation in which the dragon (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.9">12:9</a>) and the Beast attempt to duplicate the power and glory reserved for God alone. Just as heaven is the source of all that is worthwhile, the bottomless pit is the source of all that is evil. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=RevelationBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Revelation, Book of</a>.</p>
