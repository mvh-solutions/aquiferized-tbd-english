<p class="h1">BAAL-HAZOR</p>
<p class="fl">Mountain home of King David’s son Absalom. Two years after Amnon raped Absalom’s sister Tamar (Amnon’s half sister), Absalom invited Amnon and his other brothers to a feast at Baal-hazor at sheepshearing time (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.21-30">2 Sm 13:21-30</a>). During the festivities, Absalom got his revenge: he had Amnon killed.</p>
<p>Baal-hazor is not to be confused with the Hazor in Benjamin’s territory (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.33">Neh 11:33</a>) or the Hazor north of the Sea of Galilee in Naphtali’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.10-11">Jos 11:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15">1 Kgs 9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>). Baal-hazor was located in the territory of Ephraim at Jebel el-Asur, northeast of Bethel.</p>
