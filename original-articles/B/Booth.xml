<p class="h1">BOOTH</p>
<p class="fl">Small, temporary hut or shelter constructed of branches and sticks when permanent buildings were unavailable. Booths provided shade during the day and protection from the dew and winds during the night (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.17">Gn 33:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.4.5">Jon 4:5</a>). The word is also used as a figure of speech for something fragile and easily destroyed (<a href="?bref=Job.27.18">Jb 27:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.8">Is 1:8</a>).</p>
