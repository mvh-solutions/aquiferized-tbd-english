<p class="h1">BOIL</p>
<p class="fl">Inflamed localized swelling on the skin. In modern medicine the term “boil” is restricted to a pus-filled swelling caused by infectious germs, usually staphylococci. The pus is a mixture of germs and white blood cells, which are the body’s defense against germs. Although painful, boils usually heal naturally after rupturing or being lanced. A more severe boil with several openings is called a carbuncle. If the infection goes deeper and injures internal organs or tissues, it is called an abscess and can even be fatal.</p>
<p>In the Bible the word translated “boil” probably referred to a variety of skin diseases. The sixth plague that God inflicted on Egypt through Moses and Aaron was a plague of boils (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.9-11">Ex 9:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.27,35">Dt 28:27, 35</a>) or blisters. Boils or skin eruptions of a certain type were described in the Mosaic health and sanitation code as one indication of leprosy (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-8,18-23">Lv 13:1-8, 18-23</a>). Job’s “terrible case of boils from head to foot” (<a href="?bref=Job.2.7-8,12">Jb 2:7-8, 12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>) were probably too extensive to be boils in the modern sense; he may have had smallpox, psoriasis, tubercular leprosy, or some other disease accompanied by severe itching. King Hezekiah’s boil was probably a carbuncle (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.1-7">2 Kgs 20:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.21">Is 38:21</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MedicineandMedicalPractice_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Medicine and Medical Practice</a>; <a href="?item=Disease_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Disease</a>; <a href="?item=PlaguesuponEgypt_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Plagues upon Egypt</a>.</p>
