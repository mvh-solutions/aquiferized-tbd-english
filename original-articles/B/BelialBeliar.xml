<p class="h1">BELIAL*, BELIAR*</p>
<p class="fl">Common Hebrew noun meaning “baseness,” “worthlessness,” “wickedness,” or “lawlessness.” Belial, however, is often rendered as a proper noun. Thus, such translations as “sons of Belial” appear (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.22">Jgs 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12">1 Sm 2:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), “daughter of Belial” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.16">1 Sm 1:16</a>), or “children of Belial” (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.13">Dt 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.13">Jgs 20:13</a>). Newer translations generally prefer the common noun form and give such readings as “worthless rabble” or simply “worthless” and the like (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.13">Dt 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.22">Jgs 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.13">20:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.16">1 Sm 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12">2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.27">10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.12">Prv 6:12</a>). One possible exception to this rule is found in <a href="?bref=Nah.1.15">Nahum 1:15</a>, which some scholars think should be rendered as “Belial,” a personalized designation of the Assyrian conqueror who had been a threat to the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<p>Intertestamental literature often used “Belial” as a proper noun and thus prepared the way for its NT usage. In the NT the term appears once as “Belial” (or Beliar in <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.15">2 Cor 6:15</a>) and is identified with Satan, the personification of all that is evil. Noncanonical writings of the NT period commonly used it as a name for Satan or the Antichrist.</p>
