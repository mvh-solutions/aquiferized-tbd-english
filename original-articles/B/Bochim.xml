<p class="h1">BOCHIM*</p>
<p class="fl">Place near Gilgal mentioned in <a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-5">Judges 2:1-5</a> where the angel of the Lord confronted the nation of Israel with their failure to drive out the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. For their disobedience, judgment was pronounced. The heathen peoples would become “thorns” in their sides, and their gods, “snares.” The people wept, and the place was named “Bochim,” meaning “weepers.” Many scholars feel Bochim was merely another name for Bethel. This is supported by the Septuagint, which reads Bethel in this passage.</p>
