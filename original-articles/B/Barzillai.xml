<p class="h1">BARZILLAI</p>
<p class="list">1. One of three men who offered hospitality to David and his supporters at Mahanaim during the dangerous time of Absalom’s rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.27">2 Sm 17:27</a>). After Absalom was defeated, Barzillai, a Gileadite, came to the Jordan River as David prepared to cross it in a triumphant return to Jerusalem. The 80-year-old Barzillai declined King David’s invitation to be his permanent guest in Jerusalem but sent his son Chimham in his place (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.31-40">19:31-40</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.7">1 Kgs 2:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Adriel’s father. Adriel married Saul’s daughter Merab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.8">2 Sm 21:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.19">1 Sm 18:19</a>). Barzillai was thus the paternal grandfather of five of the seven men hanged in Gibeon in recompense for Saul’s guilt in trying to wipe out all Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-9">2 Sm 21:1-9</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Priest who married the daughter (or descendant) of #1 above and adopted the family name. His descendants returned to Jerusalem in 538 <span class="era">BC</span> with Zerubbabel after the exile. They were refused priestly status because they had lost the genealogies establishing their heritage and priestly descent (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.61">Ezr 2:61</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.63">Neh 7:63</a>).</p>
