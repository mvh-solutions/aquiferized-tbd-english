<p class="h1">BAANAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Rimmon’s son, a member of Benjamin’s tribe. Baanah and his brother Rechab were captains under Ishbosheth after Ishbosheth’s father, King Saul, died in battle. Ishbosheth, crowned king by Saul’s general, Abner, was David’s rival to the throne of Israel. Baanah and Rechab murdered Ishbosheth in his sleep and cut off his head (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.2-7">2 Sm 4:2-7</a>). They took the head to David, thinking he would be pleased that they had killed the son of his enemy. But David, who had wept at the death of Saul, God’s chosen king (ch <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.1-27">1</a>), was angry instead. He ordered Baanah and Rechab executed. Their hands and feet were cut off and their bodies hanged (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.8-12">4:8-12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Baanah’s son, Heled, from the town of Netophah near Bethlehem in Judah’s territory, was one of David’s 30 “mighty men” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.29">2 Sm 23:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.30">1 Chr 11:30</a>).</p>

<p class="list">4. Leader who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel after the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.2">Ezr 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.7">Neh 7:7</a>).</p>
