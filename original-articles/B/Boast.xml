<p class="h1">BOAST</p>
<p class="fl">To speak of deeds, abilities, or characteristics in a manner showing pride or self-satisfaction. In the Bible the word also has a more positive connotation (“to glory in”).</p>
<p>In the OT, “boasting” is often used to describe the basic attitude of the ungodly, who depend on their own resources rather than on God (<a href="?bref=Ps.52.1">Pss 52:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.3-4">94:3-4</a>). Enemies of Israel boasted of their victories and claimed the glory for themselves (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.27">Dt 32:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.10.3">Pss 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.26">35:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.9">73:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.9">Is 3:9</a>). They boasted of their riches (<a href="?bref=Ps.49.6">Ps 49:6</a>) and wisdom (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.11">Is 19:11</a>). According to the Lord, the rich and wise are to “boast about this: that he understands and knows me, that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on the earth” (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.24">Jer 9:24</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>Jesus depicted a proud Pharisee boasting to God in prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.10-14">Lk 18:10-14</a>). Most of the NT usages of the word occur in the apostle Paul’s letters. The negative aspect of vaunting one’s own accomplishments is contrasted with the positive counterpart of glorying in what the Lord has done (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.27-28">Rom 3:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.17">2 Cor 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.14">Gal 6:14</a>). Selfrighteousness and bragging are to be avoided (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.30">Rom 1:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.17,23">2:17, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.9">Eph 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.2">2 Tm 3:2</a>). Paul associated boasting with the attitude of those Jews who developed a feeling of self-confidence because of having kept the law. For Paul, the only legitimate boasting was to boast (rejoice) in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.11">Rom 5:11</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rom.5.3">Romans 5:3</a>, the rabbinic view of glorying in one’s sufferings is contrasted with Paul’s view that his present sufferings pointed to God’s power and toward Paul’s hope for the future.</p>
<p>Paul’s boasting was not based upon comparisons with others, in contrast to the boasting of his opponents. Because Christ worked through him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.2-6">2 Cor 3:2-6</a>) and God commended him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.18">10:18</a>), he could give glory to God. Paul preferred to boast of his own weakness, and of the Lord’s power and strength (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.5,9">12:5, 9</a>).</p>
<p>On occasion, the apostle did boast concerning a particular group of Christians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.4,14">7:4, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.24">8:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.2-3">9:2-3</a>), but with the implication that he was expressing confidence in <span class="ital">them,</span> not bragging about his own successes. Concerning himself, Paul boasted reluctantly and only as a means of defense against an unsupportive element in the Corinthian church. He said that those who should have commended him had instead compelled him to engage in “foolish” boasting (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.11">2 Cor 12:11</a>).</p>
