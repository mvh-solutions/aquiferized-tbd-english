<p class="h1">BITHRON*</p>
<p class="fl">Term in <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.29">2 Samuel 2:29</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>; <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg) whose meaning is uncertain. Abner, commander of Ishbosheth’s army, fled through Bithron after losing a battle to David’s army. The Hebrew root has the meaning “to cut into pieces.” Three explanations have been suggested: (1) it refers to a valley, perhaps the Jabbok; (2) it is the area “cut off” by a great curve in the Jabbok River; (3) it refers to the first part of the day, “all through the morning” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
