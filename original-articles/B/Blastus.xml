<p class="h1">BLASTUS</p>
<p class="fl">Royal secretary to Herod Agrippa I (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.20">Acts 12:20</a>). The cities of Tyre and Sidon were looked down upon by Herod, so when their delegates wanted an appointment with the king when he was in nearby Caesarea, they approached him through Blastus. Herod addressed them and was struck by a fatal illness for accepting their worship (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.12.21-23">21-23</a>).</p>
