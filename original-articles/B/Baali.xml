<p class="h1">BAALI*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew title meaning “my lord” or “my master” (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.16">Hos 2:16</a>). The title was rejected by God because of its association with the Canaanite Baal. God chose instead to be addressed with the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">’ishi</span><span class="ital">,</span> “my husband,” which has a similar meaning but is untainted by pagan associations. Thus, in a prophetic play on words, God stressed his covenantal love for his people and emphatically rejected any implication that he was for Israel only what Baal was for the Canaanites. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BaalIdol_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baal (Idol)</a>; <a href="?item=GodNamesof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">God, Names of</a>.</p>
