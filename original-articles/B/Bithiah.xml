<p class="h1">BITHIAH</p>
<p class="fl">Mered’s wife. Bithiah may have been a princess, or the phrase “daughter of Pharaoh” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) may merely indicate that she was Egyptian (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.17-18">1 Chr 4:17-18</a>). Her name (meaning “daughter of Yah”) seems to indicate that she was a Jewish convert.</p>
