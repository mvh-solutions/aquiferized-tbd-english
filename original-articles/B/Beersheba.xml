<p class="h1">BEERSHEBA</p>
<p class="fl">Scriptural designation for the southern extremity of the Promised Land, located 28 miles (45.1 kilometers) southwest of Hebron. It was an important Negev site at an early time. Hagar wandered with Ishmael in this area, as did Abraham. Later Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.23">Gn 26:23</a>) and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.1">46:1</a>) both had significant spiritual experiences there, and later yet it was important in the lives of numerous other Hebrews.</p>
<p>Beersheba of the Hebrew monarchy period was located at Tell Beersheba, two miles (3.2 kilometers) northeast of the modern city. Recent excavations reveal that the city was founded by the Hebrews in the 12th or 11th century <span class="era">BC</span> and probably was the place where the sons of Samuel judged the people (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.2">1 Sm 8:2</a>).</p>
<p>This city was only about two and a half acres (one hectare) in size. In its ruins there were the remains of a horned altar, which when reassembled stood to a height of about five feet (1.5 meters). This is the same height as the altar found at Arad, and the two are the only Hebrew altars yet found that date to the period of the first temple. These altars were the same height as the one in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.1">Ex 27:1</a>) and probably the same as the original altar in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.13">2 Chr 6:13</a>). A great water system was also uncovered similar to those of Megiddo and Hazor.</p>
