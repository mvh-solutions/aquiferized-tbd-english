<p class="h1">BENJAMIN, G<span class="lc">ate of</span></p>
<p class="fl">One of the gates in Jerusalem’s old wall. The Gate of Benjamin was probably at the northeast corner, since the prophet Jeremiah passed through it on his way to Benjamin’s territory northeast of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.12-13">Jer 37:12-13</a>). On at least one occasion King Zedekiah held court there (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.7">38:7</a>). It was essentially opposite the west wall’s Corner Gate (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.10">Zec 14:10</a>). When the walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt at the end of the exile, a new gate known as the Sheep Gate (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.1,32">Neh 3:1, 32</a>) or possibly the Muster Gate (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.31">Neh 3:31</a>) may have been at the same site. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Jerusalem_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
