<p class="h1">BEZEK</p>
<p class="list">1. Site of a major victory for the tribes of Simeon and Judah over the Perizzites and Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.3-7">Jgs 1:3-7</a>). Adoni-bezek, which means “lord of Bezek,” was king of the city at that time. Bezek was perhaps located at Khirbet Bezqa, a few miles northwest of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="list">2. Place where Saul gathered an army to attack the Ammonites who were troubling Jabesh-gilead (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.8-11">1 Sm 11:8-11</a>). This Bezek is usually located at Khirbet Ibziq, a little south of Mt Gilboa.</p>
