<p class="h1">BOZRAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Well-fortified city in northern Edom (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.33">Gn 36:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.44">1 Chr 1:44</a>), regarded as impossible to conquer because it was protected by cliffs on three sides. Located 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) north of Petra, at modern Buseirah, it controlled the traffic on the King’s Highway. Bozrah was mentioned as one of the strongholds that would fall when God judged Edom (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.6">Is 34:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.1">63:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.13">Jer 49:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.12">Am 1:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the cities cited by the prophet Jeremiah as collapsing with the Moabite nation (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.24">Jer 48:24</a>); probably a variant spelling of Bezer. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BezerPlace_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bezer (Place)</a>.</p>
<p class="list">3. City also called Bosorah captured by Judas Maccabeus in the course of his Gilead campaign (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.26,28">1 Macc 5:26, 28</a>). It is perhaps the same place as #2 above.</p>
