<p class="h1">BAAL-PERAZIM</p>
<p class="fl">Location near Jerusalem of a battle in which Israel’s newly anointed King David defeated the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.20">2 Sm 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.11">1 Chr 14:11</a>). David named the area Baal-perazim to commemorate the Lord’s “breaking through” his enemies, since the phrase means the “lord of breaking through.” A prophetic reference to a Mt Perazim, where the Lord came “suddenly and in anger,” may recall David’s battle with the Philistines (<a href="?bref=Isa.28.21">Is 28:21</a>).</p>
