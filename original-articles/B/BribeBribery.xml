<p class="h1">BRIBE, BRIBERY</p>
<p class="fl">To give a person in authority something valuable in order to influence that person’s decision or action. Bribery was prohibited under OT law (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.8">Ex 23:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.19">Dt 16:19</a>) and condemned by the prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.23">Is 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.12">Am 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.11">Mi 3:11</a>). Although Samuel denied that he ever took a bribe (<a href="?bref=1Sam.12.3">1 Sm 12:3</a>), his sons did not maintain the same standard (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.3">8:3</a>).</p>
<p>The distinction between bribery and merely giving gifts was not always clear. Hence, giving something valuable is seen as a way to prevent unwanted conflict (<a href="?bref=Pr.21.14">Prv 21:14</a>). Giving a gift is described (with neither approval nor condemnation) as a way to get ahead (<a href="?bref=Pr.18.16">18:16</a>).</p>
<p>For the most part, bribery is seen in the Bible as despicable. “The wicked accept secret bribes to pervert justice” (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.23">Prv 17:23</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Any system that legitimizes bribery gives the rich an unfair advantage in persuading leaders and judges; the poor find it difficult to get a fair hearing. Innocent people who are poor can be condemned; guilty people who are rich can offer a sizable bribe and go free (<a href="?bref=Ps.15.5">Ps 15:5b</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.23">Is 5:23</a>). In extreme cases, bribes are said to have been used to hire killers (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.25">Dt 27:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.12">Ez 22:12</a>).</p>
