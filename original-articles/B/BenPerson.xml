<p class="h1">BEN* (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Levite musician appointed by King David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.18">1Â Chr 15:18</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The Masoretic Text (the OT as annotated by medieval Hebrew scholars) and the <span class="sc">kjv</span> include the name Ben, but the Septuagint (ancient Greek translation of the OT) and modern versions omit it because it is missing in verses <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.20">20</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.21">21</a>. Since the Masoretic Text also omits it in the later verses, the inclusion of Ben in verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.18">18</a> may be a scribal error.</p>
