<p class="h1">BETH-MILLO</p>
<p class="fl">House or fortress associated with the city of Shechem mentioned in connection with the crowning of Abimelech (son of Gideon) as king there (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.6,20">Jgs 9:6, 20</a>). Since the term “millo” probably means “mount” or “earthwork,” Beth-millo is often identified with the “tower of Shechem” mentioned later in the same chapter (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.46-49">Jgs 9:46-49</a>).</p>
