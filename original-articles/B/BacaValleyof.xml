<p class="fl">Phrase in <a href="?bref=Ps.84.6">Psalm 84:6</a> often translated “valley of weeping.” The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">baca</span> refers to some kind of tree in <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.23-24">2 Samuel 5:23-24</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.14-15">1 Chronicles 14:14-15</a>, where it is translated mulberry (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), aspen, or balsam. It is not known whether the valley of Baca in <a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-12">Psalm 84</a> was a literal place or a symbolic expression for grief or difficulty in life. For those who seek to follow in the Lord’s steps, the psalmist said, that valley becomes a pool of blessing and refreshment.</p>
<p>Some scholars think the valley was a specific place located near Jerusalem and the valley of Rephaim. If so, it could have been associated with weeping because (1) balsam or other trees in the valley exuded resinous gum, like tears; (2) the path was difficult to follow; or (3) it was a dreary place where waters seeped out of “weeping” rocks.</p>
