<p class="h1">BETH-ZUR</p>
<p class="fl">Hill town of Judah in the mountains north of Hebron (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.58">Jos 15:58</a>). Beth-zur was settled by Maon, one of Caleb’s descendants (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.45">1 Chr 2:45</a>), and was one of the natural strongholds of Judah. It was fortified by King Rehoboam of the southern kingdom in the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>, even though it had begun to decline in importance (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.7">2 Chr 11:7</a>). It served as an administrative center during the time of Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.16">Neh 3:16</a>). In the Maccabean period it was known by the Greek name Bethsura. Judas Maccabeus defeated Syrian general Lysias there (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.29,61">1 Macc 4:29, 61</a>) and lost the town a few years later. After recapturing Beth-zur from the Syrians, Simon Maccabeus strengthened it in 140 <span class="era">BC</span>, making it one of the most important fortresses on the border between Judah and Idumea (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.65-66">11:65-66</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.33">14:33</a>).</p>
