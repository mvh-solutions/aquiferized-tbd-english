<p class="h1">BAAL-ZEBUB</p>
<p class="fl">Pagan god of the Philistine city of Ekron. After King Ahaziah of Israel fell from his upstairs porch (852 <span class="era">BC</span>), he sent messengers to Baal-zebub to ask about his recovery (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.2">2 Kgs 1:2</a>). He was severely rebuked for that by the prophet Elijah, who declared that his affront to Israel’s God would result in the king’s death.</p>
<p>Identification of Baal-zebub (which means “lord of the flies”) is somewhat uncertain. The god may have been thought to give oracles by the flight or buzzing of a fly, or may have protected his worshipers from plagues of flies. Excavations at Philistine sites have uncovered golden images of flies. Most scholars believe that the name is a corruption of Baal-zebul (“Baal the prince”). The distortion was probably a deliberate effort to demean the god.</p>
