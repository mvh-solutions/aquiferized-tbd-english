<p class="h1">BETHER*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word occurring in the phrase “upon rugged mountains” and regarded as a proper name in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> (“mountains of Bether,” <a href="?bref=Song.2.17">Sg 2:17</a>). Occurrence of the phrase “mountains of spices” in an almost identical verse (<a href="?bref=Song.8.14">8:14</a>) suggests “spices” or a particular spice (such as cinnamon) as an appropriate translation of <span class="hebrew">bether</span><span class="ital">.</span> Bether also occurs as the name of the city Beth-anoth in the hill country of Judah in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.59">Joshua 15:59</a> (but only in the Septuagint). In <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.59">1 Chronicles 6:59</a> the Septuagint reads “Bether” instead of “Beth-shemesh.” Some scholars identify this Bether with Khir-bet el-Jehudiyeh, southwest of Bittir, which may preserve the ancient name. It is unlikely that Bether is related to the phrase “mountains of Bether.”</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 135, Bether became the site of the last Jewish stronghold against the Romans in the Second Revolt (<span class="era">AD</span> 132–135). There Simon Bar-Kochba, the designated “messiah,” and the Jewish forces were massacred.</p>
