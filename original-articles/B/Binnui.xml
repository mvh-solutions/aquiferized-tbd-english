<p class="h1">BINNUI</p>
<p class="list">1. Noadiah’s father. Noadiah was a Levite in charge of weighing temple valuables after the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.33">Ezr 8:33</a>). Possibly the same as #4 below.</p>
<p class="list">2. Pahath-moab’s son or descendant. He obeyed Ezra’s exhortation to divorce his pagan wife after the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.30">Ezr 10:30</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. According to the Apocrypha and the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, one of Bani’s sons (descendants) who also obeyed Ezra’s exhortation to divorce his pagan wife (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.38">Ezr 10:38</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.9.34">1 Esd 9:34</a>). Because the list of Bani’s descendants is proportionally very long and because verse <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.38">38</a> in Hebrew can easily be construed “of the sons of Binnui,” most modern translations make Binnui an ancestor of a new group rather than a descendant of Bani.</p>
<p class="list">4. Henadad’s son who repaired part of Jerusalem’s wall after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.24">Neh 3:24</a>). He was among the Levites who signed Ezra’s covenant of faithfulness to God (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.9">Neh 10:9</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Alternate spelling for Bani in <a href="?bref=Neh.7.15">Nehemiah 7:15</a>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Bani_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bani #4</a>.</p>
<p class="list">6. Levite who returned to Judah with Zerubbabel after the exile. He was one of several in charge of songs of thanksgiving (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.8">Neh 12:8</a>).</p>
<p class="sp">The popularity of this name and its similarity to other Jewish names (e.g., Bani and Bavvai) has caused much confusion in the genealogical lists. The above is one of several possible arrangements.</p>
