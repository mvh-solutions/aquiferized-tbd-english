<p class="h1">BILHAH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Servant given by Laban to his daughter Rachel when she married Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.29">Gn 29:29</a>). Realizing her own childlessness, Rachel gave Bilhah to her husband as a concubine and accepted their two sons as her own, naming them Dan and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.3-8">30:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.25">35:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.46.25">46:25</a>). Archaeological investigation has confirmed the custom of a barren wife’s providing a concubine to guarantee children to her husband. Such an arrangement is mentioned in marriage contract documents dug up at Nuzi and dated from about the same time as the <a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-35">Genesis 29</a> events. Jacob’s son Reuben was later guilty of incest with Bilhah (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.22">35:22</a>).</p>
