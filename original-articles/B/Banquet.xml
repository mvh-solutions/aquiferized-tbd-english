<p class="h1">BANQUET</p>
<p class="fl">Lavish ceremonial meal, usually held in honor of some notable event or person; also a symbol of the feast to be given by Christ in the kingdom of God. Banqueting and feasting were major parts of the social and religious life of biblical times. In addition to the religious feasts prescribed by Mosaic law, banquets and feasts were celebrated on nearly any occasion of joy or solemnity: at the ratification of covenants (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.30">Gn 26:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.31.54">31:54</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.11">Ex 24:11</a>); at weddings (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.22">Gn 29:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.10">Jgs 14:10</a>); at harvest (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.27">Jgs 9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.3.1-3">Ru 3:1-3</a>); at the shearing of sheep (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.11">1 Sm 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23-29">2 Sm 13:23-29</a>); at the arrival of guests (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.3">Gn 19:3</a>); at the weaning of a child (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.8">21:8</a>); at coronations (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.9,19-25">1 Kgs 1:9, 19-25</a>); on various state occasions (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.3-9">Est 1:3-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.18">2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.5.4-8">5:4-8</a>); and for many other reasons.</p>
<p>Many customs associated with banquets in the ancient Near East are portrayed in the Bible and in extrabiblical literature; wall reliefs and carvings from some excavations also depict banquet scenes. The sequence of banquet preparation in <a href="?bref=Pr.9.2-5">Proverbs 9:2-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Matthew 22:1-14</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.14.15-24">Luke 14:15-24</a> is also known from the legend of King Keret in Ugaritic literature: (1) preparation of the foods, (2) sending messengers with the invitation and announcement that all is ready, and (3) the presentation of food and wine in order. The prophet Amos portrays a lavish feast and shows the main eating customs (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4-6">Am 6:4-6</a>). Meals were ordinarily taken while reclining on a couch before a table (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.41">Ez 23:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.10">Mt 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.49">Lk 7:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.10,15">14:10, 15</a>).</p>
<p>Banquet imagery is prominent in both Testaments with reference to the kingdom of God. Isaiah foresaw the judgment of the nations and the deliverance of Israel followed by the Lord’s reign over his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.23">Is 24:23</a>); inauguration of that reign is accompanied by a huge banquet to which all peoples are invited (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.6-8">Is 25:6-8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.13.29">Lk 13:29</a>). Meals shared following the sacrifice of animals in the OT prefigure that great feast when there will be no more death, tears, or reproach for the people of God (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.7">Is 25:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.21.4">Rv 21:4</a>). The banquet of the new covenant likewise directs attention to the future, when the redeemed will drink fine wine (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.6">Is 25:6</a>) with Christ in the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.14-20">Lk 22:14-20</a>). By participating in the Lord’s Supper (Communion), all Christians anticipate that great feast.</p>
<p>That future, final banquet in the kingdom of God is also pictured specifically as a wedding feast; all is in readiness, the invitation is issued to many, but few are chosen (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Mt 22:1-14</a>). The church looks forward to the marriage feast of the Lamb (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.7-9">Rv 19:7-9</a>).</p>
