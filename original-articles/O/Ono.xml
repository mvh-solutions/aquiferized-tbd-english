<p class="h1">ONO</p>
<p class="fl">Benjaminite town built by Shemed (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.12">1 Chr 8:12</a>). Some of its inhabitants returned to Palestine with Zerubbabel following the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.33">Ezr 2:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.37">Neh 7:37</a>). Its location was variously known as the plain of Ono (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.2">Neh 6:2</a>) or as the valley of craftsmen (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.35">11:35</a>). Ono is identified with Kefr ‘Ana, seven miles (11.3 kilometers) southeast of Joppa.</p>
