<p class="h1">OTHNIEL</p>
<p class="fl">Judge of Israel, mentioned as the son of Kenaz and Caleb’s nephew (or perhaps brother), who delivered Israel from the tyranny of Cushan-rishathaim, and who earlier distinguished himself by capturing Debir (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.15-17">Jos 15:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.11-13">Jgs 1:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.8-11">3:8-11</a>).</p>
<p>At Caleb’s prompting (promising his daughter Achsah to anyone who could conquer Debir), Othniel took Kiriath-sepher (Debir) and received Achsah for his wife. When Caleb gave her and her land as a present, Achsah asked for a water source and was given the upper springs and the lower springs (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.19">Jos 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.15">Jgs 1:15</a>).</p>
<p>Later, Othniel delivered the Israelites from the oppressive Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia (Aram-naharaim), whom the Israelites had served for eight years on account of their sin (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.7">Jgs 3:7</a>). When the people cried for relief, the Lord raised up Othniel. Delivering them, he was described as someone that the “Spirit of the Lord came upon” (v <a href="?bref=Judg.3.10">10</a>). The effects of his work as judge lasted for a generation (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.3.9-11">9-11</a>).</p>
