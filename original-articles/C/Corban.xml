<p class="h1">CORBAN*</p>
<p class="fl">Greek transliteration of a Hebrew term <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">korban</span><span class="ital">)</span> that occurs only in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.11">Mark 7:11</a>, where Mark provides an editorial explanation: corban is “given,” that is, “dedicated or given to God.” Hence, corban is an offering.</p>
<p>Jewish law allowed individuals to earmark their service or property as “dedicated to God,” thus removing it from profane use and giving it the character of an offering intended for God. To do this was a serious decision (according to the Mishnah, <span class="hebrew">Nedarim</span>) and was rarely reversed (<span class="hebrew">Nedarim</span> 5), for violation of a corban vow risked the severe consequences of divine judgment. In <a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-37">Mark 7</a> Jesus chastises the scribes because, theoretically, a son could exclude his parents from gaining any benefit from his estate by declaring his property “corban to them.” This in effect nullifies the fifth commandment (see <a href="?bref=Exod.20.12">Ex 20:12</a>), setting rabbinic traditions against the law of Moses. Worse still, if the son repented of his vow—arguing that it had been given in haste—a rabbinic tribunal would no doubt forbid a reversal of corban (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.12">Mk 7:12</a>; cf <a href="?bref=Num.30.1-2">Nm 30:1-2</a>).</p>
