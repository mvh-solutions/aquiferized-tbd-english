<p class="h1">CUP-BEARER</p>
<p class="fl">Official whose primary duty was to taste the wine served to the king as a precaution against poisoning. Cup-bearers frequented the courts of kings and high officials in antiquity (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.5">1 Kgs 10:5</a>). These men were close to those in authority and sometimes exercised considerable influence. Generally several of them served the king with the “chief cup-bearer” (butler) at their head (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.1-23">Gn 40:1-23</a>). Solomon’s court included cup-bearers (<a href="?bref=2Chr.9.4">2 Chr 9:4</a>), and Nehemiah was the king’s cup-bearer (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.11-2.1">Neh 1:11–2:1</a>); Rabshakeh may have been a cup-bearer (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-19">2 Kgs 18:13-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.2">Is 36:2</a>).</p>
