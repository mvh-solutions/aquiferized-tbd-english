<p class="h1">CALNEH</p>
<p class="list">1. City in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.10">Gn 10:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. City identified as Kullani (Kullan Koy), about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) north of Aleppo in northern Syria. This northern identification is hinted at in <a href="?bref=Isa.10.9">Isaiah 10:9</a>, where Calno is associated with Carchemish, some 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) to the northeast, as well as in the context of <a href="?bref=Amos.6.2">Amos 6:2</a> (note the north-to-south progression—Calneh, Hamath, Gath). Canneh in <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.23">Ezekiel 27:23</a> seems to refer to the same general location and is perhaps to be linked with Calneh. Kullani was captured by Tiglath-pileser II, king of Assyria, about 741 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
