<p class="h1">CISTERN</p>
<p class="fl">Place to store water; a man-made catch basin or reservoir. Stone cisterns plastered with lime came into common use in Palestine in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Leaky or abandoned cisterns were often used as burial, torture, or prison chambers. For example, the dungeon into which the prophet Jeremiah was lowered was an abandoned muddy cistern (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.6">Jer 38:6</a>). Ishmael threw the bodies of 70 murdered men into a large cistern originally constructed by King Asa for a wartime water supply (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.4-9">41:4-9</a>).</p>
<p>Cisterns were vitally important in the arid Near East. King Uzziah of Judah is described as hewing out many cisterns in areas where springs or wells were lacking (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.10">2 Chr 26:10</a>). An Assyrian general taunting King Hezekiah and his people promised that, if they would submit, everyone would drink the water of his own cistern (<a href="?bref=Isa.36.16">Is 36:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.31">2 Kgs 18:31</a>). Much earlier, Moses had assured the Israelites that cisterns already hewn out would be among God’s blessing in the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.11">Dt 6:11</a>).</p>
