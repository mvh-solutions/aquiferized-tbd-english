<p class="h1">CARAVAN</p>
<p class="fl">Traveling group of merchants, pilgrims, or others in Bible times who joined together for mutual protection. Usually travelers used pack animals to carry their wares or personal belongings. To transport goods from one district to another, donkeys were mainly used until about 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the use of camels became more common. Ancient Palestine, situated between the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt on one side and Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and lands farther east on the other, was crisscrossed by trade routes. The nation of Israel was thus intimately acquainted with caravans, many in OT times coming from Transjordan and Arabia. Arabian caravans often transported spices and incense, products that were particularly lucrative. The rulers of Sheba were engaged in that enterprise (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2">1 Kgs 10:2</a>). The size of a caravan depended on the amount of traffic, precariousness of the route, and availability of camels. Perhaps 40 camels might be joined by ropes attached from the saddle of one camel to the nose ring of the trailing camel. Caravans could travel in single file or with three to four camels abreast. In hot weather or on an extensive journey, a camel could carry about 350 pounds (159 kilograms); on short, cool trips, it could carry much more. Joseph was sold into slavery to a spice caravan going to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-28">Gn 37:25-28</a>). Raiding expeditions also formed caravans at times (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.3-5">Jgs 6:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-20">1 Sm 30:1-20</a>).</p>
