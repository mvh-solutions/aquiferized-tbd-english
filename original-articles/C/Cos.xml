<p class="h1">COS</p>
<p class="fl">Island of the Sporades group in the Aegean, containing a city of the same name, located off the coast of Caria in Asia Minor. Cos was the apostle Paul’s first stop beyond Ephesus on his voyage to Jerusalem at the end of his third missionary tour (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.1">Acts 21:1</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Coos”). In the Apocrypha, Cos and other areas are mentioned as recipients of a decree by the Roman consul Lucius forbidding war against the Jewish population (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.23">1 Macc 15:23</a>).</p>
<p>Cos (modern Kos) was a major shipping center, famous for its wheat, ointments, wines, and silk. It eventually became one of the financial centers of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Hippocrates, the “father of medicine,” was born and practiced medicine there in the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. Under King Herod’s rule Cos received perpetual revenues, and a statue was built there to honor his son Herod Antipas.</p>
