<p class="fl">Port city situated off the southwest corner of Asia Minor, mentioned as a harbor passed by the apostle Paul en route to Italy (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.7">Acts 27:7</a>). During the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, it had a Jewish colony (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.23">1Â Macc 15:23</a>). The island on which Cnidus was built is now joined to the mainland by a sandbar.</p>
