<p class="h1">CENCHREA, CENCHREAE*</p>
<p class="fl">Seaport city that served the maritime needs of the larger city of Corinth, about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) to the west. Cenchrea is known as early as the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> in connection with an Athenian attack on Corinth. Before the Corinthian Canal was cut through the isthmus, traffic to Europe from Asia often passed from Cenchrea through Corinth to Lechaion.</p>

<p>Excavations begun in 1963 have located the harbor mole (breakwater), warehouse remains dating to the early first century, and a large second-century stone building. A fourth-century church testifies to the influence of Christianity in the city. Portions of the ancient road leading southeast from the Cenchrean Gate in Corinth may still be seen among the ruins of that cityâ€™s <span class="greek">agora</span> (marketplace).</p>
<p>Cenchrea is mentioned twice in the NT. The apostle Paul took an oath requiring the cutting of his hair before leaving Cenchrea during his third missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">Acts 18:18</a>). In his letter to the church in Rome, Paul commended Phoebe, a deaconess of the church in Cenchrea, well known for her Christian service (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.1">Rom 16:1</a>).</p>
