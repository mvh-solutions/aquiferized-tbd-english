<p class="h1">CLOPAS</p>
<p class="fl">Husband of Mary, one of the women who was present at Jesus’ crucifixion (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>). From the Greek it cannot be determined if Mary the wife of Clopas was also the sister of Jesus’ mother or a different person. One tradition identifies Clopas as the brother of Joseph. Another links him with Cleopas of <a href="?bref=Luke.24.18">Luke 24:18</a>, even though “Clopas” is of Hebrew origin and “Cleopas” is Greek. A third possibility is to equate him with Alphaeus. This is feasible only if James, son of Alphaeus (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Mt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Lk 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>) is the same as James, son of Mary (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">Mt 27:56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mk 15:40</a>), and Mary is the same person mentioned in <a href="?bref=John.19.25">John 19:25</a>. These suggestions are theoretical; it is possible that Clopas, Cleopas, and Alphaeus are all separate individuals.</p>
