<p class="h1">CAESAR’S HOUSEHOLD*</p>
<p class="fl">Term referring to imperial servants, both slave and free, in Rome and in the provinces of the Roman Empire. The apostle Paul closed his letter to the Philippian Christians with greetings from those “of Caesar’s household” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.22">4:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The imperial household staff numbered in the hundreds, and the positions carried a certain amount of social importance.</p>
<p>According to the Martyrdom of Paul, written in the second century, when Paul arrived at Rome, he was greeted by people “from Caesar’s household.” He put himself in communication with the local Jewish leaders and preached and taught unhindered (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.17,31">Acts 28:17, 31</a>). Some men and women were convinced and believed (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.23-24">Acts 28:23-24</a>), no doubt including some in Caesar’s household. The message even spread to the whole Praetorian Guard (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.13">Phil 1:13</a>). Some scholars trace certain believers mentioned in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">Romans 16</a> to members of the imperial household.</p>
