<p class="h1">CHELOUS</p>
<p class="fl">According to <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.9">Judith 1:9</a>, Chelous was one ofÂ the cities to which messengers were sent by King Nebuchadnezzar to procure aid for his campaign against Arphaxad. Most scholars think that Chelous is the site known by some ancient geographers as Elusa but which is now called Khalasa. Khalasa is located south of Beersheba on a latitude line running through the southern shore of the Dead Sea. It is situated near an important crossroads.</p>
