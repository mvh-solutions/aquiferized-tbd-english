<p class="h1">CAIN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">First son of Adam and Eve, who became a tiller of the soil while his brother, Abel, was a keeper of sheep. Cain’s murder of Abel became proverbial of similarly violent and destructive sins (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>). Each of the two brothers had brought a sacrifice to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-4">Gn 4:3-4</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Heb.11.4">Hebrews 11:4</a>, Abel had acted in faith by bringing a more acceptable sacrifice than that of Cain. The latter’s anger had flared against the divine rejection. In retaliation, he killed his brother, whose offering had been accepted (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.5-8">Gn 4:5-8</a>). In seeking a reason for Cain’s inappropriate violent reaction, biblical commentary simply says that he belonged to the evil one (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.12">1 Jn 3:12</a>). The Lord confronted Cain with his guilt, judged him, and pronounced a curse upon him, driving him out to the land of Nod, east of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.9-16">Gn 4:9-16</a>). When he complained that his punishment was greater than he could bear and that someone would find him and kill him, the Lord placed a mark on Cain and promised to take sevenfold vengeance on anyone who dared to kill him.</p>
<p>In the land of Nod, Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.17">Gn 4:17</a>). Through Enoch, Cain became the progenitor of a large family that during its early generations became tent-dwelling herdsmen, musicians, and fashioners of metal objects and implements (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.4.18-22">18-22</a>).</p>
