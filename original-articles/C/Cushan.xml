<p class="h1">CUSHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a tribe or place mentioned only once in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.7">Hb 3:7</a>). Some have identified Cushan with the people and land referred to in the OT as Cush, or Ethiopia in most English versions. The parallel position of “Cushan” to “the land of Midian” in <a href="?bref=Hab.3.7">Habakkuk 3:7</a>, however, as well as the location of the other places mentioned in the passage (Teman, Mt Paran) seems to place Cushan in the vicinity of Edom and Midian, south and southeast of the Dead Sea.</p>
