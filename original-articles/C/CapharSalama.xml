<p class="h1">CAPHAR-SALAMA</p>
<p class="fl">Village where a battle was fought between Judas Maccabeus and the Syrian commander Nicanor (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.31">1 Macc 7:31</a>). After about 500 of Nicanor’s men had been killed, the fugitives took refuge in the “city of David,” so Caphar-salama must have been near Jerusalem.</p>
