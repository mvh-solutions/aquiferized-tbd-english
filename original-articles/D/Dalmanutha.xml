<p class="h1">DALMANUTHA</p>
<p class="fl">Area on the west side of the Sea of Galilee near the southern end of the plain of Gennesaret. Its exact location is uncertain. Jesus and his disciples stayed there briefly after the incident of the feeding of the 4,000 (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.10">Mk 8:10</a>). The Pharisees came to him seeking a sign from heaven in order to test him. After his answer that no sign would be given to this generation (v <a href="?bref=Mark.8.12">12</a>), he departed from there.</p>
<p>The word “Dalmanutha” is present in the best manuscripts, although other sources record Magadan or Magdala. The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Matt.15.39">Matthew 15:39</a> cites Magadan. Because of this, the exact name and location have been difficult to pinpoint. Probably the various names are meant to designate the same site or at least two places in the same area.</p>
