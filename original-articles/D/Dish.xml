<p class="h1">DISH</p>
<p class="fl">A vessel, usually made of baked clay or metal, used in everyday life and in religious ceremony. Dishes were used to serve or preserve food (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.25">Jgs 5:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.23">Mt 26:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.20">Mk 14:20</a>). They had to be wiped and left to dry (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.13">2Â Kgs 21:13</a>), but later the Pharisees added a ritual cleansing as well (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.25-26">Mt 23:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.39">Lk 11:39</a>). Dishes were used in connection with the meal offering (<a href="?bref=Num.7.13">Nm 7:13</a>) and with the table of showbread for worship in the OT tabernacle and temple (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.29">Ex 25:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.16">37:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.7">Nm 4:7</a>).</p>
