<p class="h1">DRUSILLA</p>
<p class="fl">Third and youngest daughter of Herod Agrippa, king of Judea. A Jewess, Drusilla was born about <span class="era">AD</span> 38 and had two sisters, Bernice and Mariamne. She became engaged to Epiphanes, prince of Commogene, but the engagement was broken as a result of his refusal to convert to Judaism.</p>
<p>Drusilla’s brother Agrippa II, then arranged for her to marry Azizus, king of Emesa, who agreed to be circumcised. Soon after her marriage, Felix, a gentile governor of Judea, fell in love with the 16-year-old Drusilla. Around <span class="era">AD</span> 54 he persuaded her to break the Jewish law and leave her husband to marry him.</p>
<p>Drusilla and Felix heard the apostle Paul’s proclamation of the gospel, while Paul was held in custody at Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.24">Acts 24:24</a>). Their son, Agrippa, perished when the Italian volcano Vesuvius erupted in <span class="era">AD</span> 79.</p>
