<p class="h1">DYSENTERY</p>
<p class="fl">Diarrhea caused by parasitic bacteria, protozoa (amoeba), or worms in contaminated food or drink. Dysentery is accompanied by intestinal spasms and ulceration, with the appearance of blood and pus in the excrement. On the island of Malta the apostle Paul miraculously cured a person of dysentery (Greek <span class="greek">dysenteria</span><span class="ital">,</span> <a href="?bref=Acts.28.8">Acts 28:8</a>). As the verse indicates, high fever accompanies acute dysentery, epidemics of which still plague Malta. A disease described in the OT was probably amoebic dysentery, in which intestinal tissue can be sloughed off day by day (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.14-19">2Â Chr 21:14-19</a>). A sporadic form of dysentery occurs when the body is able to tolerate the disruptive organism for the most part.</p>
