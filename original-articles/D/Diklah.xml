<p class="h1">DIKLAH</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Joktan in the list of nations descended from Noah’s sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.27">Gn 10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.21">1 Chr 1:21</a>); perhaps the name refers to an Arabian tribe or territory, living in or near a palm-bearing area, as the name suggests (Diklah is a variant of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">dikla</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means date tree or palm tree).</p>
