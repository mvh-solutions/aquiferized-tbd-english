<p class="fl">Traditional name of the rich man in Christ’s parable about the beggar Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>). It came from the Latin term <span class="ital">dives,</span> translating a Greek word for “rich,” “wealthy.” Though the rich man was not named in the parable, this name was already well accepted in the church by the third century. A second-century Egyptian scribe gave him the name “Neves,” meaning “nothing.” <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Lazarus_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Lazarus #1</a>.</p>
