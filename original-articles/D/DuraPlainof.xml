<p class="h1">DURA, Plain of</p>
<p class="fl">Location in the province of Babylon where Nebuchadnezzar set up the great image of gold, which all his subjects were ordered to worship (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.1">Dn 3:1</a>). Its exact location is uncertain. It may be situated to the southeast of Babylon, or perhaps even located within the great outer wall of the city itself. The image was doubtless in a prominent place, probably in an open area used for public gatherings. Since <span class="hebrew">dur</span> means “rampart,” the phrase should probably be read as “the plain of the rampart” (within Babylon).</p>
