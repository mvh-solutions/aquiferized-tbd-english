<p class="h1">DEFORMITY</p>
<p class="fl">Any obvious physical abnormality. In the OT sacrificial system both the animal to be sacrificed (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.3">Lv 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.4.3">4:3</a>) and the priest who performed the sacrifice (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1-24">21</a>) had to be perfect physical specimens, without defect or blemish. By being perfect, they are both OT types of Christ.</p>
<p>Of the 11 defects that would exclude a man from becoming a priest (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.17-20">Lv 21:17-20</a>), seven are in the musculoskeletal system, two are in the eye, one is of the skin, and one is in the reproductive system. The deformity of the “flat nose” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “disfigurement” (<span class="sc">niv</span>) in <a href="?bref=Lev.21.18">Leviticus 21:18</a> does not refer to a normal variant, but to a severely diseased nose. There are a large number of genetic syndromes and inherited diseases that feature very deformed noses. Likewise, the acquired infectious diseases of syphilis, tuberculosis, and leprosy can cause destruction of the bone and cartilage support of the nose. With the support gone, the skin of the nose sinks inward. This is referred to today as a “saddle-shaped” deformity of the nose.</p>
<p>Both the OT and the NT describe an instance where a man has a “withered” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “shriveled” (<span class="sc">niv</span>) arm or hand. Such a defect occurs when the nerves supplying an extremity are damaged and the muscles atrophy. An injury from a sword striking an arm can cause this (<a href="?bref=Zech.11.17">Zec 11:17</a>). From the NT we learn that Jesus had the power to instantly heal a man with a chronically paralyzed hand (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.10">Mt 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.1">Mk 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.6">Lk 6:6</a>).</p>
