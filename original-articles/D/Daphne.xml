<p class="h1">DAPHNE</p>
<p class="fl">A beautiful grove and sanctuary to Apollo located near Antioch in Syria. The Greek ruler Seleucus I lived here and built a huge statue of Apollo in addition to a temple. Here, criminals and political refugees could take asylum, as it was illegal to arrest anyone within Daphne. In <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.33">2Â Maccabees 4:33</a> the high priest Onias, who had been true to Yahweh in boldly scolding King Menelaus, hid here. He was, however, brought out by trickery and murdered.</p>
