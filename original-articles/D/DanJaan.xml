<p class="h1">DAN-JAAN</p>
<p class="fl">Geographical landmark denoting the northern limit of David’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.6">2 Sm 24:6</a>). Joab’s census taking stopped here. Some think this is a copyist’s error, because no town with a similar name is known to have existed in that area. Others believe that it means “Dan in the wood,” referring simply to Dan (see <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Still others think it refers to a town within Dan, perhaps Jaan, of which all traces have vanished.</p>
