<p class="h1">DELILAH</p>
<p class="fl">Samson’s mistress, who betrayed him to his Philistine enemies (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.1-31">Jgs 16</a>). Because Philistia held southern Israel in vassalage at the time (c. 1070 <span class="era">BC</span>), Samson was chosen by God to begin the delivery of Israel. His success prompted the five Philistine rulers to offer Delilah a bribe if she would help capture him by discovering the secret of his enormous strength.</p>

<p>Delilah was from the valley of Sorek, in the southeast corner of Dan’s territory, only a few miles from Samson’s home in Zorah. It is clear from <a href="?bref=Judg.14.1">Judges 14:1</a> that she was a Philistine, although the large reward she accepted (5,500 pieces of silver) implies that her motivations were other than Philistine loyalty. Her unhindered contact with men probably indicates that she was a prostitute.</p>
<p>On her fourth attempt Delilah finally tricked Samson into revealing his secret. His strength was from God; his long hair, which signified that he was under a Nazirite vow (see <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-8">Nm 6:1-8</a>) and thus “set apart” by God for special service (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.5">Jgs 13:5</a>), was never to be cut. Delilah lulled him to sleep, shaved his head, and delivered him (still unsuspecting) into the hands of his enemies.</p>
