<p class="h1">DEDAN (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Region located in the Arabian Peninsula. The Dedanites were listed among those who rejoiced at the downfall of Israel during the time of the Babylonian captivity. Jeremiah and Ezekiel foretold Dedan’s approaching destruction (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.23">Jer 25:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.8">49:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.13">Ez 25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.13">38:13</a>). Apparently the Dedanites were merchants who traveled by caravan and traded saddlecloths and various garments associated with riding (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.13">Is 21:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.20">Ez 27:20</a>). Dedan is believed to have been located at or near an oasis called El-’ula in the central portion of the Arabian Peninsula. This oasis was part of the ancient trade routes, and undoubtedly played a role in the Dedanites’ mercantile way of life.</p>
