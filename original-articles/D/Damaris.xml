<p class="h1">DAMARIS</p>
<p class="fl">Woman mentioned (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.34">Acts 17:34</a>) as one of the first converts in the city of Athens, following Paulâ€™s preaching there. Since Luke singles her out by name, she may have been a person of importance (see <a href="?bref=Acts.13.50">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.12">17:12</a>).</p>
