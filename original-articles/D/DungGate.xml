<p class="h1">DUNG GATE</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 11 gates in the Jerusalem wall in Nehemiahâ€™s time (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.13">Neh 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.3.14">3:14</a>). It was located near the southwest corner of the city and led to the valley of Hinnom, where rubbish and refuse were dumped. This particular gate had been reconstructed by Malkijah, son of Recab (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.14">Neh 3:14</a>), and was situated between the Fountain Gate and the Valley Gate. When the restored walls of Jerusalem were completed, the ceremony of dedication took place near this gate. Josephus knew it as the Essene Gate.</p>
