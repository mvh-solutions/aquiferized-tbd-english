<p class="h1">DIOTREPHES</p>
<p class="fl">A church member whom John reprimanded for his contentious behavior (<a href="?bref=3Jn.1.9-10">3 Jn 1:9-10</a>). He spoke against John; had resisted John’s authority by refusing to receive an earlier letter; and refused to show Christian hospitality, urging others to do likewise. He may have been an official in the church who abused his position, since he liked to put himself first.</p>
