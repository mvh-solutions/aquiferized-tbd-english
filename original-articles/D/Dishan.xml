<p class="h1">DISHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Chieftain in the land of Seir, a mountainous area southwest of the Dead Sea. Dishan’s father was Seir the Horite (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.21">Gn 36:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.38">1 Chr 1:38</a>). The Horites were driven out of their territory by the Edomites (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.12">Dt 2:12</a>). Later OT references often use Seir and Edom synonymously.</p>
