<p class="h1">DEMAS</p>
<p class="fl">One of Paul’s associates who was with him during one of his imprisonments. Little is known about Demas beyond the brief information given in the NT. Initially he supported Paul’s ministry and was mentioned in the salutations of Paul’s letters to the Colossians (<a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Col 4:14</a>) and to Philemon (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>). However, in <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Timothy 4:10</a> Paul writes that Demas deserted him because of his love for the present world.</p>
