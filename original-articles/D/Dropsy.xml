<p class="h1">DROPSY*</p>
<p class="fl">Old medical term for excessive accumulation of watery fluid in any tissue or space of the body. Dropsy, mentioned in <a href="?bref=Luke.14.2">Luke 14:2</a>, is a symptom of several serious disorders such as heart, kidney, or liver disease; Jesus healed a man “who had dropsy” but whose underlying illness is not described. The word “dropsy” has generally been replaced with more specific medical terms: excessive abdominal fluid is now referred to as ascites, cutaneous or subcutaneous dropsy as edema, and pleural dropsy as hydrothorax. Dropsy is not mentioned directly in the OT. A reference to swollen feet (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.4">Dt 8:4</a>) could refer to pedal edema or simply to the formation of blisters.</p>
