<p class="h1">QUADRATUS*, Apology of</p>
<p class="fl">An early Christian apology was written by Quadratus (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 125) to the emperor Hadrian as a defense of Christianity. The only surviving fragment is found in the writings of Eusebius, where these words are credited to Quadratus:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">But the works of our Savior were always present (for they were genuine): namely, those who healed, those who rose from the dead; who were not only seen in the act of being healed or raised, but were also always present; and not merely when the Savior was on earth, but after his departure as well, they lived for a considerable time; insomuch that some of them survived even to our own day.</p>
<p class="sp">According to Eusebius, the apology was written in order to defend the church because “certain evil men tried to trouble those who belonged to us.” Moreover, Quadratus hoped to persuade Hadrian of the truthfulness of Christianity so that he, being assured of the pure intents of the Christians, would call a halt to the persecutions. The apology of Quadratus is sometimes mistakenly identified with the “Letter to Diognetus.”</p>
