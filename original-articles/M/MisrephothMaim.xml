<p class="h1">MISREPHOTH-MAIM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the northernmost places to which the Israelites pursued the fleeing Canaanite armies defeated at the waters of Merom (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.8">Jos 11:8</a>). Misrephoth-maim, meaning “burning of water,” defined part of the boundary of land remaining yet to be possessed by Israel during the days of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.6">13:6</a>). In all probability, Misrephoth-maim is identical with the cluster of springs at Khirbet el-Musheirifeh near the Mediterranean Sea, 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) south of Sidon and 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) north of Tyre, at the base of Ras en-Nakurah.</p>
