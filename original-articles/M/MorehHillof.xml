<p class="h1">MOREH, Hill of</p>
<p class="fl">Hill close to the valley of Jezreel, near which the Midianites camped when they were attacked by Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.1">Jgs 7:1</a>). It was probably called by this name because it was the location of a sanctuary where divination was practiced. Its name may imply instruction or divination. It is generally identified with Jebel Nabi Dahi, across the valley from Mt Gilboa.</p>
