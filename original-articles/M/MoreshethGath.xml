<p class="h1">MORESHETH-GATH</p>
<p class="fl">Town in the lowland country of Judah included in Micah’s lament (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.14">Mi 1:14</a>); perhaps the same as Moresheth, Micah’s hometown. The “gath” in Moresheth-gath suggests that the town was in close proximity to the major Philistine city by that name. Its exact location is uncertain. Jerome (a fourth-century <span class="era">AD</span> church father) suggested that Moresheth-gath was situated a short distance east of Eleutheropolis, identifiable with modern Khirbet el-Basel. Another possible site is Tell ej-Judeideh, six miles (9.7 kilometers) southeast of Gath.</p>
