<p class="h1">MADMEN</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Moab, according to Jeremiah’s oracle (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.2">Jer 48:2</a>). It may be a form created by dittography from an original Dimon, as in the oracle against Moab by Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.9">Is 15:9</a>). If so, Khirbet Dimneh, seven and a half miles (12.1 kilometers) northwest of Kerak at the head of Wadi Beni Hammad, would be a possible site. In any case, there is a word play in the Jeremiah passage between the place-name and the Hebrew word “be silent.”</p>
