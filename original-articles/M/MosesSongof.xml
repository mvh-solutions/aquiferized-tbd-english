<p class="h1">MOSES, Song of</p>
<p class="fl">One of two archaic poems: the Blessing of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.1-29">Dt 33</a>) and the Song of Moses (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.32.1-52">32</a>). The Song of the Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>) is set at a much earlier period of Moses’ life, while these two poems are virtually his “last will and testament.”</p>
<p>Moses had already written books of the Law as a witness against Israel, should they turn away from God. But the law itself required at least two witnesses to establish any charge (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.6">Dt 17:6</a>). Moses was then commanded to write down the song as a further witness against Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.19">31:19</a>).</p>
<p>The song is therefore a witness to the greatness and goodness of God, and in particular, his goodness to Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.10-14">Dt 32:10-14</a>). This grace underlines all the more the sinfulness of Israel’s response, which can only call forth the anger of God and consequent punishment. God will use “natural disasters,” wild beasts, and wars to carry out his purposes. Yet even this is not the end. God, in his grace, will turn his hand against Israel’s enemies instead, and rescue his own people (v <a href="?bref=Deut.32.36">36</a>).</p>
<p>This song carries the consistent message of every great prophet of the OT, a message that <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">Psalm 78</a> expresses in terms of Israel’s historical situations. The song outlines the very nature of God, so it is not strange that the song of heaven is “the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb” (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.3">Rv 15:3</a>).</p>
