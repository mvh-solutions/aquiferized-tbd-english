<p class="h1">MOUNT, MOUNTAIN</p>
<p class="fl">Elevated topographical feature. In Israel, as in surrounding countries, mountains were places where people expected to meet God. Many significant events in Israel’s religion took place on Mt Sinai or Horeb (see <a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4">Ex 3:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.16.1-36">16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-23.33">19–23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.8-18">1 Kgs 19:8-18</a>), and Mt Zion became almost as important when David was king (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.2">Ps 50:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">Is 2:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>Whereas the Hebrews’ neighbors sometimes thought mountains were magical places where their gods actually lived, the Israelites knew that their God lived in heaven and only descended upon the mountain at significant times (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-25">Ex 19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT much of Jesus’ activity takes place on mountains. He preached there (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1">Mt 5:1</a>); he retired there to pray (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.12">Lk 6:12</a>); and he was transfigured on a mountain (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-36">9:28-36</a>).</p>
