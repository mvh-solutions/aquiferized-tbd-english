<p class="h1">MYSIA</p>
<p class="fl">Region in northwest Asia Minor (modern Turkey). It had a long history, leading up to its annexation into the Roman Empire in 133 <span class="era">BC</span> as part of the province of Asia. For about 150 years before that it had been part of the kingdom of Pergamum. The travel account in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.7-8">Acts 16:7-8</a> indicates that the apostle Paul passed through this region on his second missionary journey but did not preach there.</p>
