<p class="h1">MIZRAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word for the land of Egypt and/or its people, though some scholars suggest that Mizraim refers to a site either on the Edomite border or in northern Syria. In <a href="?bref=Gen.10.6">Genesis 10:6</a>, Mizraim (Egypt) is identified as one of the sons of Ham who settled south of Canaan. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.14">Genesis 10:14</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Isaiah 11:11</a> distinguish Mizraim from Pathrushim, that is, Upper Egypt (the southern half of the United Kingdom of Egypt), but in the majority of the nearly 700 known references to Mizraim, there is no distinction between the two parts of the kingdom, and the term refers simply to the Egyptian territory.</p>
