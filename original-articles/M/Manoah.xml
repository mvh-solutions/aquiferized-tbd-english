<p class="h1">MANOAH</p>
<p class="fl">Danite from Zorah whose wife was barren. Through encounters with the Angel of the Lord, the couple learned that God was about to give them a son who would judge the Philistines and deliver Israel from its oppression. Manoah later fathered Samson, who fulfilled these promises (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.1-25">Jgs 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.16.31">16:31</a>).</p>
