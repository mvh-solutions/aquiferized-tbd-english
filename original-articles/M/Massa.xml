<p class="h1">MASSA</p>
<p class="fl">Ishmael’s seventh son and Abraham’s grandson (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.14">Gn 25:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.30">1 Chr 1:30</a>). His descendants inhabited northwestern Arabia. Tiglath-pileser III mentions these people, along with the inhabitants of Tema (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.15">Gn 25:15</a>) and others who were ruled by him and paid tribute to him. The people of Tema probably were descendants of Massa’s brother Tema.</p>
<p>Massa forms part of the titles of <a href="?bref=Pr.30.1">Proverbs 30:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Pr.31.1">31:1</a>. The definite article precedes it in <a href="?bref=Pr.30.1">30:1</a> and can be translated “the burden” or “the oracle.” It is frequently used in prophetic passages in the ominous sense of God’s impending judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.1">Is 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">Na 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.1.1">Hb 1:1</a>).</p>
