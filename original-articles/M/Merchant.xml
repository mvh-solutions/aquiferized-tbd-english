<p class="h1">MERCHANT</p>
<p class="fl">A person who buys and sells commodities for profit. The barter system of trade gave way in time to a system where professional merchants facilitated the exchange of goods. At first, it was for payment in silver pieces (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.16">Gn 23:16</a>) and then in coinage or some other medium of exchange. Merchants operated locally and internationally with Arameans (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.34">1 Kgs 20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.16-18">Ez 27:16-18</a>), Canaanites and Phoenicians (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.2,8">Is 23:2, 8</a>), Assyrians (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.16">Na 3:16</a>), Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. Some merchants traveled afar (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.16-20">Neh 13:16-20</a>). Desert peoples with caravans traded their wares in many lands (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.15,20-23">Ez 27:15, 20-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.13">38:13</a>). They operated in bazaars and set up shops for trade (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.34">1 Kgs 20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.3.31">Neh 3:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.19-20">13:19-20</a>). Commodities were held in storehouses (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.49">Gn 41:49</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.19">1 Kgs 9:19</a>). The sons of Jacob traded in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.11">Gn 43:11</a>). In Solomon’s day, trade greatly expanded (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-27">1 Kgs 9:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.28">10:28</a>). During the exile, Jews became involved in merchant activity in Babylonia, and many never returned to Palestine. In Jerusalem the merchants helped Nehemiah to rebuild the wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.31-32">Neh 3:31-32</a>).</p>
