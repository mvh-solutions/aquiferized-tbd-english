<p class="fl">Word appearing in <a href="?bref=Job.38.32">Job 38:32</a> that may refer to a constellation. The Hebrew form is feminine in <a href="?bref=Job.38.32">Job 38:32</a> and masculine in <a href="?bref=Job.9.9">Job 9:9</a>, where it has usually been thought to refer to the Hyades. Some hold that Mazzaroth refers to the constellation of the Bear, while others think it refers to the 12 signs of the zodiac, the Corona Borealis, or the Hyades.</p>
