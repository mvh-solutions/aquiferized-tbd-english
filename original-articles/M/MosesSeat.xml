<p class="h1">MOSES’ SEAT*</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical expression occurring only in <a href="?bref=Matt.23.2">Matthew 23:2</a>, where Jesus speaks of the scribes and the Pharisees as having sat down on the seat of Moses. In biblical times, the seat that one occupied usually indicated the degree of rank or respect one claimed for himself or was to receive from others (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.6">Mt 23:6</a>). Sitting on “Moses’ seat” referred to a place of dignity and the right to interpret the Mosaic law. The scribes were the successors and the heirs of Moses’ authority and were rightfully looked to for pronouncements upon his teaching.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="?bref=Matt.23.2">Matthew 23:2</a>, Jesus does not seem to challenge this right, for he commands his hearers to practice and observe whatever the scribes and the Pharisees speak, that is, all they teach that is in accordance with the law. But Jesus warned the people against doing their works, because they did not practice what they spoke. On other occasions Jesus condemned their unbiblical traditions relative to the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.3-6">Mt 15:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.4,16-22">23:4, 16-22</a>).</p>
