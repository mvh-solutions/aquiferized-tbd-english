<p class="h1">MAGISTRATE</p>
<p class="fl">Title of a public official who acted as judge and administrator of a given municipality. King Artaxerxes ordered Ezra to select magistrates along with judges to govern the people when they returned to Palestine (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.25">Ezr 7:25</a>). This official was one of the officers of Nebuchadnezzar’s court invited to the dedication feast (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.2-3">Dn 3:2-3</a>). <a href="?bref=Luke.12.58">Luke 12:58</a> portrayed the magistrate as a ruling authority whose verdict was final.</p>
<p>During the Roman era, each Roman colony was assigned two magistrates (called <span class="ital">duumviri</span>) who were primarily responsible for judging criminal offenses against the state. Hence, Paul and Silas were brought before the magistrates at Philippi for allegedly advocating customs unacceptable to the Romans (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.20-38">Acts 16:20-38</a>). Before this <span class="ital">duumvir,</span> they were ordered to be stripped, beaten, and thrown into prison. A chief magistrate was sometimes called a “praetor” (Greek <span class="greek">strategos</span>), a deferential title given to a leading <span class="ital">duumvir.</span></p>
