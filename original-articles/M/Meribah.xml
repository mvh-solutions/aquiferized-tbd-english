<p class="h1">MERIBAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Noun meaning “strife,” named for a place at Horeb, near Rephidim (Wadi Feiran), where Israel contended with Moses for water near the beginning of the wilderness wanderings (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.7">Ex 17:7</a>). This is the place probably alluded to in <a href="?bref=Deut.33.8">Deuteronomy 33:8</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.95.8">Psalm 95:8</a>, and is alternately called Massah.</p>
<p class="list">2. Another place, near Kadesh-barnea in the wilderness of Zin, where Israel also quarreled with Moses for water, and God again provided it from a rock (<a href="?bref=Num.20.13,24">Nm 20:13, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.27.14">27:14</a>); alternately called Meribath-kadesh in <a href="?bref=Deut.32.51">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>. This episode took place toward the close of the desert wanderings. The waters of Meribah were waters of contention. Here God’s anger was provoked against Moses and Aaron because they did not listen to him and sanctify him before Israel. Instead of speaking to the rock as God commanded, Moses—angered at Israel’s hardness of heart—struck the rock twice with his rod. The psalmist records that here God tested Israel (<a href="?bref=Ps.81.7">Ps 81:7</a>), and Israel’s subsequent rebellion prodded Moses to sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.32">106:32</a>). Meribah-kadesh is mentioned as a place on Israel’s southern border (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.19">Ez 47:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.28">48:28</a>).</p>
