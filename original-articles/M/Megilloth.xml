<p class="h1">MEGILLOTH*</p>
<p class="fl">Plural form of the Hebrew word for scroll. The word occurs several times in <a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-32">Jeremiah 36</a>, where King Jehoiakim, rejecting the word from God, burned the scroll that the prophet sent to him.</p>
<p>Megilloth is also used collectively of the OT books of Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther. These are the “five rolls,” which are read by the Jews during the major festivals of the Jewish year: the Song of Songs at Passover, Ruth at Pentecost (Firstfruits), Lamentations on the anniversary of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, Ecclesiastes at the Feast of Tabernacles, and Esther at Purim.</p>
