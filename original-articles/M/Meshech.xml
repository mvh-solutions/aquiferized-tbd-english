<p class="list">1. Son of Japheth and Noah’s grandson (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.2">Gn 10:2</a>). His descendants are usually mentioned in connection with Tubal, Gog, or Magog (<a href="?bref=Ps.120.5">Ps 120:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.13">Ez 27:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.26">32:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.2-3">38:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.1">39:1</a>). They are called Muski in Assyrian records and inhabited the mountains north of Assyria during the reigns of Tiglath-pileser I (1115–1102 <span class="era">BC</span>), Shalmaneser III (859–824 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Sargon (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>). The people of Meshech are characterized as aggressive and pagan, traders in bronze and slaves with Tyre.</p>
<p class="list">2. Shem’s son according to <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.17">1 Chronicles 1:17</a>, but rendered Mash in the parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.23">Genesis 10:23</a>. The latter is generally accepted.</p>
