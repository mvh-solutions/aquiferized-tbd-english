<p class="h1">MEDEBA</p>
<p class="fl">Moabite town in the fertile plain northeast of the Dead Sea, about 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) south of Philadelphia (modern Amman). It was situated 6 miles (9.7 kilometers) south of Heshbon on the Roman road to Kerak.</p>
<p>Here the Amorites defeated Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.21.30">Nm 21:30</a>). Later, Israel defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, at Medeba and assigned it to Reuben’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.9,16">Jos 13:9, 16</a>). At this place David routed an Aramean army hired by the Ammonites to attack his forces (<a href="?bref=1Chr.19.7">1 Chr 19:7</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Moabite Stone, the town was once controlled by Omri and Ahab of Israel; however, when Mesha reasserted Moabite dominance in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, he rebuilt Medeba and other Moabite cities. Medeba is named in Isaiah’s prophecies against Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>). In later times Joram and Jehoshaphat made unsuccessful attempts at capturing this city.</p>
