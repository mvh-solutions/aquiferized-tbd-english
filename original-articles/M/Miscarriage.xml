<p class="h1">MISCARRIAGE</p>
<p class="fl">Spontaneous abortion of a nonviable fetus. It occurs in both human (<a href="?bref=Job.3.16">Jb 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.14">Hos 9:14</a>) and animal (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.38">Gn 31:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.21.10">Jb 21:10</a>) pregnancies. The major problem is not in being unable to conceive or to become pregnant but in carrying the pregnancy to full term. The curse of a “miscarrying womb” results in not being able to have children (<a href="?bref=Hos.9.14">Hos 9:14</a>), while the blessing of God results in successful pregnancies and long life (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.26">Ex 23:26</a>).</p>
<p>The time factor is the key abnormality as indicated by premature delivery or “untimely birth” (<a href="?bref=Ps.58.8">Ps 58:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.3.16">Jb 3:16</a>). While miscarriages occur for many reasons, Scripture mentions two: improper care (in animals) (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.38">Gn 31:38</a>) and trauma to a pregnant woman (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.22">Ex 21:22</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Num.5.1-31">Numbers 5</a> gives the test for an unfaithful wife. If she is guilty of adultery, then “her abdomen will swell and her thigh waste away” (v <a href="?bref=Num.5.27">27</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). These phrases may be euphemisms for miscarriage or for sterility (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Paul underscores his inherent unworthiness to be an apostle by comparing his spiritual birth to an untimely physical birth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8">1 Cor 15:8</a>).</p>
