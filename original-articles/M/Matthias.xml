<p class="h1">MATTHIAS</p>
<p class="fl">Disciple of Jesus, mentioned by name only in <a href="?bref=Acts.1.23-26">Acts 1:23-26</a>, chosen to take the place of Judas Iscariot.</p>
<p>Shortly after Jesusâ€™ ascension, Peter voiced the need for another apostle, the stipulations being that the candidate must have been a follower of Jesus from his baptism to his ascension and have been a witness to his resurrection. The assembly put forward two men who met these criteria: Joseph called Barsabbas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias. They then cast lots (some scholars believe they cast ballots). Whatever the method, Matthias was chosen. Later, the apostolate was widened to include others such as Paul, Andronicus, and Junias. Scripture never mentions Matthias again, though tradition says that he preached in Judea and was finally stoned to death by the Jews.</p>
