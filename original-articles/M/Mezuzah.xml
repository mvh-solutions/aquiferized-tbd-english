<p class="h1">MEZUZAH*</p>
<p class="fl">A Hebrew word, used about 20 times in the OT, that means the upright framework of a door or gate. The blood of the Passover lamb was smeared on the “mezuzah” of the house (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.7,22-23">Ex 12:7, 22-23</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Deut.6.9">Deuteronomy 6:9</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.11.20">11:20</a>, the Hebrews were instructed to write the commandments on the doors of the houses and on the city gates. This practice is still followed by the Jewish community. Every Jewish home has a small metal or wooden container mounted about shoulder-height on the doorpost of the house. This container, which itself became known as a mezuzah, has inside a small piece of parchment inscribed on one side with the words of <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.11.13-21">11:13-21</a>, and on the other side with the word <span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span><span class="ital">,</span> the Hebrew name for God Almighty. On the outside the mezuzah has embossed the Hebrew letter <span class="ital">shin,</span> the first letter of the name <span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span><span class="ital">.</span> Every time a pious Jew enters or leaves the house, he or she will touch the mezuzah and then kiss the fingers as he repeats to himself the words of <a href="?bref=Ps.121.8">Psalm 121:8</a>: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
