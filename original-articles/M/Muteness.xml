<p class="h1">MUTENESS</p>
<p class="fl">The inability to speak. Muteness, or aphasia, can be a momentary phenomenon or a permanent handicap. It may result from mental retardation, brain lesion, or deafness.</p>
<p>The Bible records several examples of muteness. Zechariah was made mute by the angel Gabriel for not believing he would become the father of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.18-22">Lk 1:18-22</a>). That condition persisted at least nine months, until the baby was born and named (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.62-64">62-64</a>).</p>
<p>Inability to speak is usually associated with neurological diseases or severe structural deformities. When Jesus healed people who were thus afflicted, or hearing-impaired (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.32-33">Mt 9:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.22-23">12:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.30-31">15:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.32-37">Mk 7:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.17-27">9:17-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.14">Lk 11:14</a>), observers were understandably astonished.</p>
<p>Other scattered biblical passages refer to muteness in people (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.8">Prv 31:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.6">Is 35:6</a>) and in animals (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.10">Is 56:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.16">2 Pt 2:16</a>). The fact that false gods and idols cannot speak (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.18-20">Hb 2:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.2">1 Cor 12:2</a>) was frequently pointed out by the prophets, who contrasted them with the living, speaking God of Israel.</p>
