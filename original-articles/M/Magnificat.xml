<p class="fl">The song of Mary found in <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Luke 1:46-55</a>. This poem is in the style of the OT psalms and is strongly reminiscent of the prayer of Hannah in <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1-10">1Â Samuel 2:1-10</a>. At an early date it found a place in Christian worship. It was chanted in the vesper service of the Roman Catholic Church and was carried over into Lutheran and Anglican usage. From the time of the Renaissance, countless musical settings have been written for this beautiful canticle, both in Latin and in various Western languages.</p>
