<p class="h1">MITYLENE</p>
<p class="fl">Main city on the island of Lesbos in the Aegean Sea near the northwestern coast of Asia Minor. Mitylene was a seaport with two harbors. Originally itÂ had been built on a small island separate from Lesbos. In NT times it was connected with the main island by a raised roadway across a narrow stretch of water. <a href="?bref=Acts.20.14">Acts 20:14</a> identifies Mitylene as one of the overnight stopping places where Paul and his traveling companions lodged as they journeyed by ship toward Jerusalem.</p>
