<p class="h1">MAMMON*</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic word, meaning wealth or property, transliterated by the Gospel writers in Greek letters. Some English translations preserve the Greek form of the word in English (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>); others translate it with the words “wealth” or “money” (<span class="sc">neb</span>, <span class="sc">tev</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In <a href="?bref=Matt.6.24">Matthew 6:24</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.16.13">Luke 16:13</a>, “mammon” is personified as a rival to God for the loyalty of the disciples: To which master will obedience be given? In <a href="?bref=Luke.16.9-11">Luke 16:9-11</a> the term designates material wealth or property. Mammon itself does not carry a negative value, as the parallel phrasing in <a href="?bref=Luke.16.11">Luke 16:11</a> makes clear: “If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true riches?” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
