<p class="h1">MALACHI (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Author of the last book of the OT (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.1">Mal 1:1</a>). The prophet Malachi lived about 500–460 <span class="era">BC</span>. His name means “my angel” or “my messenger” and is so translated in <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</a> and elsewhere. Apart from the book that bears his name, nothing else is known about him from the Bible. In the apocryphal book of <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.40">2 Esdras 1:40</a> he is identified as “Malachi, who is also called a messenger of the Lord.” Rabbinic tradition suggests that Malachi may be another name for Ezra the scribe, although there is no supporting evidence for this identification.</p>
