<p class="h1">KENIZZITES</p>
<p class="fl">A people related to Kenaz, grandson of Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.11,15">Gn 36:11, 15</a>). The Kenizzites were of Edomite stock and resided to the southeast of Judah in the vicinity of the Kenites. They are thought to belong to the pre-Israelite population of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.19">Gn 15:19</a>). Their territory was to be given to the Israelites along with that of the Kenites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.15.19-21">19-21</a>).</p>
<p>In Numbers and Joshua, Caleb, the faithful spy, is reckoned to belong to the Kenizzites (<a href="?bref=Num.32.12">Nm 32:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.14.6,14">Jos 14:6, 14</a>). According to <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.15">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>, Caleb’s genealogy is traced back to Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.1">1 Chr 4:1</a>). The relationship of Caleb to the Kenizzites is far from clear. Caleb established his patrimony at Kiriath-sepher (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.11-13">Jgs 1:11-13</a>), which is in Judah but which is also situated close to the territory of the Kenizzites. Critical opinion views the Kenizzites as non-Israelites who occupied Hebron, Debir, and the southernmost hill country of the Negev and became politically incorporated into Judah.</p>
