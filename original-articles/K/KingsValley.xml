<p class="h1">KING’S VALLEY</p>
<p class="fl">Valley near Salem, the city of Melchizedek, where Abraham encountered the king of Sodom and rejected his offer of a morally compromised truce (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.17">Gn 14:17</a>); also called the valley of Shaveh. If Salem is the same site as Jerusalem, the “king’s valley” is probably either the Kidron Valley or the valley of Hinnom. This would be the site where Absalom raised a pillar as a monument to himself (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.18">2 Sm 18:18</a>).</p>
