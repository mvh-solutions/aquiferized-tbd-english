<p class="h1">KARNAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Town situated along the King’s Highway and along one of the northeastern tributaries of the Yarmuk River, 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee on the Transjordan Plateau. The prophet Amos prophesied against Karnaim (also spelled Carnaim), foretelling its impending destruction on account of its wickedness (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.13">Am 6:13</a>).</p>
<p>It was the leading town in the area after the decline of its sister city, Ashtaroth, and became the main center of an Assyrian province in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. In 163 <span class="era">BC</span> it was captured by Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.26,43-44">1 Macc 5:26, 43-44</a>). Christian and Jewish traditions believe it to be the home of Job.</p>
