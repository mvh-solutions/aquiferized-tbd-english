<p class="h1">KARKOR</p>
<p class="fl">City in the Transjordan where Gideon attacked the armies of the two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.10">Jgs 8:10</a>). Indications of its location are sketchy. <a href="?bref=Judg.8.11">Judges 8:11</a> places it east of Nobah and Jog-behah, a town identified with Jubeiah, which is seven miles (11.3 kilometers) northwest of Amman in Jordan. A more feasible site is in the vicinity of ancient Succoth (Tell Dier ‘Alla) and Penuel (Tell edh-Dhahab esh-Sherqiyeh), both assigned to Gad’s tribe in Gilead.</p>
