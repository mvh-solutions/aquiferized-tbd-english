<p class="h1">KINSMAN</p>
<p class="fl">A relative of the same family. In ancient Israel the tribe was the largest social and political unit. The smallest social unit within the tribe was the family. The relationship of one family to another was carefully regulated by the list of those to whom one should not be married (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lv 18</a>). Those who were related, even though somewhat distantly, received by law privileges and obligations for all members of the family. It was the right of the “kinsman” to receive the inheritance of a family without heir (<a href="?bref=Num.27.11">Nm 27:11</a>). He was also obligated to reclaim property of a kinsman who had gone into debt (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.25-28">Lv 25:25-28</a>), especially if it involved someone’s enslavement to a non-Israelite (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-49">47-49</a>). In this function the kinsman <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">karov</span><span class="ital">)</span> becomes the kinsman-redeemer <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">go’el</span><span class="ital">).</span> In the book of Ruth, Boaz is the kinsman-redeemer: “The man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.20">Ruth 2:20</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). On legal grounds Boaz had a right to reclaim the property of Naomi, but he was required by law to wait for his turn, as he was not the <span class="ital">nearest</span> relative (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.4">4:4</a>). Only after this nearest relative refused (v <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.6">6</a>) did Boaz proceed with his obligation as kinsman.</p>
