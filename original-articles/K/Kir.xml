<p class="h1">KIR</p>
<p class="list">1. Mesopotamian city from which the Syrians migrated to Damascus and back to which they were later exiled by the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.5">Am 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">9:7</a>). Escape from Kir to Aram paralleled the exodus of the Israelites. It must have been a terribly bitter experience to have been deported (by Tiglath-pileser) back to Kir (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.9">2 Kgs 16:9</a>). Whether the city actually existed or not is debatable. It could have become a metaphor for enslavement and exile.</p>
<p class="list">2. Fortress usually identified with the ancient capital of Moab. Soldiers from Kir were associated with those from Elam (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.6">Is 22:6</a>). Likewise, Kir was paralleled with Ar in Isaiah’s lament over Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.1">15:1</a>). Kir of Moab, therefore, is probably the same as Kir-hareseth (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.25">2 Kgs 3:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.7">Is 16:7</a>), located at Kerak, 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) east of the southern end of the Dead Sea.</p>
