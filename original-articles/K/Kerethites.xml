<p class="h1">KERETHITES</p>
<p class="fl">Members of a tribal group that lived in southern Judah near Hebron (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.14">1 Sm 30:14</a>), mentioned along with the Pelethites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.18">2 Sm 8:18</a>). The Kerethites were associated with the Philistines, according to <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.15-17">Ezekiel 25:15-17</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.5">Zep 2:5</a>). They were judged with “the rest of the seacoast” for the Philistines’ offense against Israel. Since the Philistines most likely originated in the islands of the Mediterranean, including Crete, the word Kerethite probably means Cretan. “Pelethite” is probably an alternate spelling of Philistine.</p>
<p>Because of the Kerethites’ Philistine connections, what is known about the Philistines may shed light on them. Archaeological evidence from Cretan murals and Egyptian tomb paintings and temple reliefs shows Philistines wearing plumed headdresses. Similarities between Philistine, Cretan, and Greek pottery designs also suggest a strong link among these Mediterranean peoples.</p>
<p>Kerethites and Pelethites were hired by David as mercenaries, forming an elite corps of foreign soldiers faithful to him through all his troubles (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.18">2 Sm 15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.7,23">20:7, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.38">1 Kgs 1:38</a>). Later kings may have continued to use them as soldiers, as suggested by the mention of “Carites” (Kerethites?) in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.4,19">2 Kings 11:4, 19</a>.</p>
