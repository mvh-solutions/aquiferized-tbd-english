<p class="fl">Town in the Hauran taken by Nobah (<a href="?bref=Num.32.42">Nm 32:42</a>) but later lost to Geshur and Aram (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.23">1Â Chr 2:23</a>). It was a Canaanite city known from Egyptian execration texts of the 19th and 18th centuries <span class="era">BC</span> and from the conquest by Thutmose III and the Amarna letters. In the Hellenistic period it became one of the cities of the Decapolis; Jewish returnees from Babylon had settled there, and the rabbis considered it a border town of the Promised Land. It was also called Kanatha.</p>
