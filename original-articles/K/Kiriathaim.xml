<p class="h1">KIRIATHAIM</p>
<p class="list">1. Town on the Moabite plateau, mentioned in the march of the four kings against the five (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>) where the indigenous Emim were attacked. It was taken by the Israelites from Sihon (<a href="?bref=Num.32.37">Nm 32:37</a>) and included in Reuben’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.19">Jos 13:19</a>). The Moabite Stone records that Sihon fortified the place after gaining control of the plateau; in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span> it was still under Moabite control (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.1,23">Jer 48:1, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.9">Ez 25:9</a>). Eusebius placed it 10 Roman miles west of Medeba. Two identifications have been proposed—either Khirbet el-Qureiyeh or Qaryat el-Mukhaiyet, six miles (9.7 kilometers) northwest and three miles (4.8 kilometers) northwest of Medeba respectively.</p>
<p class="list">2. Levitical town in Naphtali’s territory (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.76">1 Chr 6:76</a>), called Kartan in <a href="?bref=Josh.21.32">Joshua 21:32</a>; the latter is probably a dialectical variant. The suggested identification is with Khirbet el-Qurieyeh, northeast of ‘Ain Ibl in southern Lebanon.</p>
