<p class="h1">KIMHAM</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Barzillai (according to Josephus), a very wealthy man who supplied David and his men with food while they were in Mahanaim during their flight from Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.32">2 Sm 19:32</a>). David offered to take Barzillai back to Jerusalem with him, but Barzillai declined and suggested that David show kindness to Kimham instead (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.37-40">37-40</a>). David accepted the proposal and ordered his son and successor, Solomon, to grant Kimham a pension at the palace (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.7">1 Kgs 2:7</a>). His name is reflected centuries later in Geruth-kimham, a place near Bethlehem where the people Johanan had rescued from Ishmael stayed, intending to go to Egypt later (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.17">Jer 41:17</a>).</p>
