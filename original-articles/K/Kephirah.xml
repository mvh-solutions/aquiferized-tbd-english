<p class="h1">KEPHIRAH</p>
<p class="fl">Hivite city included in a treaty with Joshua that the Gibeonites secured by deception (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.17">Jos 9:17</a>). When the Israelites conquered the land of Canaan, Kephirah became the property of Benjaminâ€™s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.26">18:26</a>). Many inhabitants of this city came back to Judea with the repatriates after the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.25">Ezr 2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.29">Neh 7:29</a>). The site is now identified as Khirbet Kefireh, located southwest of ancient Gibeon.</p>
