<p class="h1">KINAH</p>
<p class="fl">Town in the Negev of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.22">Jos 15:22</a>), perhaps named after the Kenites who lived in the area (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>). According to a letter discovered at Arad, troops were sent from Kinah to reinforce Ramoth-negev against an Edomite attack. The ancient name is preserved in Wadi el-Qeini, in the eastern Negev.</p>
