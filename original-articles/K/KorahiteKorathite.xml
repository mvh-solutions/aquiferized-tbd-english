<p class="h1">KORAHITE, KORATHITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Member of Levi’s tribe, of the division of Kohath (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.18,21">Ex 6:18, 21</a>). Their ancestor, Izhar, was a member of the priestly family and was related to Moses and Aaron. The rebellion led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram against Moses and Aaron ended with the death of many members of the Korahite family (<a href="?bref=Num.16.31-35">Nm 16:31-35</a>). Only those who did not participate survived (v <a href="?bref=Num.16.11">11</a>). They settled around Hebron in the Levitical cities (<a href="?bref=Num.26.58">26:58</a>).</p>
<p>The Korahites were known as temple singers, according to the superscriptions of <a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-11">Psalms 42</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-49.20">44–49</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-85.13">84–85</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.87.1-88.18">87–88</a>. David put them in charge of the musical service in the house of the Lord after the ark was brought to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.31-33">1 Chr 6:31-33</a>). They also acted as gatekeepers (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.19">9:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.19">26:19</a>) and bakers of sacrificial cakes (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.31">9:31</a>). They are mentioned as singers during the celebration of Jehoshaphat’s victory over Ammon and Moab (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.19">2 Chr 20:19</a>).</p>
