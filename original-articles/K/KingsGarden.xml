<p class="h1">KING’S GARDEN</p>
<p class="fl">Probably an area of the royal estates, situated outside the walls of Jerusalem near the pool of Siloam (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.4">2 Kgs 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.39.4">Jer 39:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.7">52:7</a>) in the Kidron Valley, near where the Kidron meets the valley of Hinnom. Upon the return from the exile, Nehemiah set the families to work, each building a part of the wall. Fountain Gate is recorded as being near the pool of Siloam by the king’s garden (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.15">Neh 3:15</a>). It is not certain whether the site now called the king’s garden outside the walls of modern Jerusalem is the original site.</p>
