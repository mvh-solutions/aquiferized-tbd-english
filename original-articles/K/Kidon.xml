<p class="fl">Threshing floor where Uzzah was struck down by God as he attempted to steady the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=1Chr.13.9">1 Chr 13:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.6">2 Samuel 6:6</a> refers to this place as “the threshing floor of Nacon.” Following the death of Uzzah, the place was renamed Perez-uzzah, which means either “the breach of Uzzah” or “the outbreak against Uzzah” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.8">2 Sm 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.11">1 Chr 13:11</a>).</p>
