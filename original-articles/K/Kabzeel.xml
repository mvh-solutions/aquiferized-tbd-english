<p class="h1">KABZEEL</p>
<p class="fl">City located in the extreme south of Judah’s territory adjacent to neighboring Edom (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.21">Jos 15:21</a>; also called Jekabzeel in <a href="?bref=Neh.11.25">Neh 11:25</a>). Benaiah, one of David’s valiant warriors, came from there (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.20">2 Sm 23:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.22">1 Chr 11:22</a>). The reference in Nehemiah indicates that Judah’s tribe returned to this area after the exile. Its exact site is not known, but Khirbet Hora has been suggested.</p>
