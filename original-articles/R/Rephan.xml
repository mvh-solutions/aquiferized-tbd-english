<p class="h1">REPHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Pagan deity mentioned by Stephen in <a href="?bref=Acts.7.43">Acts 7:43</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Remphan”; <span class="sc">nasb</span> “Rompha”) when he cited the text of <a href="?bref=Amos.5.26">Amos 5:26</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “Kaiwan,” see mg) to portray the paganism of the wandering Israelites. Stephen was quoting from the Septuagint, whose translators had taken <span class="hebrew">kaiwan</span> to refer to the Assyrian god of Saturn, or perhaps to the Egyptian Saturn god Repa. Some scholars argue that <a href="?bref=Amos.5.26">Amos 5:26</a> is a general reference to the Israelites’ wilderness paganism and names no ancient deities at all.</p>
