<p class="h1">RACA*</p>
<p class="fl">Derogatory expression used by Jews of the first century <span class="era">AD</span> to show open contempt for another. <span class="ital">Raca</span> is derived from an Aramaic and Hebrew term meaning “empty” or “worthless.” Literally meaning “empty-headed,” <span class="ital">raca</span> probably insinuates an intellectual stupidity or inferiority rather than a moral deficiency. In the OT it is comparable to the worthless lot that Abimelech hired to follow him (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.4">Jgs 9:4</a>), the idle men who gathered around Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.3">11:3</a>), and the scoundrels who joined up with Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.7">2 Chr 13:7</a>). Michal accused David of acting like one of the vulgar fellows [<span class="ital">raca</span>] who shamelessly uncovered himself (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.20">2 Sm 6:20</a>). Rabbinic literature used this term to describe an immoral, untrained person.</p>
<p>Jesus warned against calling a brother <span class="ital">“Raca!”</span> (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22">Mt 5:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). According to Jesus, the perpetrator of the insult was to be judged by the highest court of the land and punished by its severest penalty. The commandment against murder (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.13">Ex 20:13</a>) not only prohibited the deed itself but also the thoughts of unrighteous anger and expressions of unwarranted contempt.</p>
