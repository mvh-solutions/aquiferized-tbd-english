<p class="h1">RELIGION</p>
<p class="fl">The service and worship of God; an institutionalized system of religious beliefs and practices. The Israelitesâ€™ service and worship of God had become institutionalized by the time Jesus lived. Jesus himself criticized several of its practices for having a show of piety but lacking true heart-felt adoration of God. The institutionalization of the Christian faith occurred in many churches long after the time of the apostles. Hence, it is not discussed in the NT.</p>
