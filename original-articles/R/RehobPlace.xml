<p class="list">1. Northernmost territory explored by the Israelite spies prior to occupation of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.21">Nm 13:21</a>). It agrees with the location of Beth-rehob (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.28">Jgs 18:28</a>) and is mentioned with Zobah and Maacah as an opponent of David in the Ammonite war (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.6-8">2 Sm 10:6-8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Two cities belonging to Asher’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.28-30">Jos 19:28-30</a>). One was given to the Levitical family of Gershon (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.31">Jos 21:31</a>) and became a city of refuge (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.75">1 Chr 6:75</a>). The other remained in Canaanite hands (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Jgs 1:31</a>). Some scholars identify the references as one city.</p>
