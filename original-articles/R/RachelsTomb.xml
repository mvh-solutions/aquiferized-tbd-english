<p class="h1">RACHEL’S TOMB</p>
<p class="fl">Landmark set up by Jacob at the site of Rachel’s grave (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.19-20">Gn 35:19-20</a>) that was still in existence at the time of Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.2">1 Sm 10:2</a>). Two persisting traditions make its original location still questionable. The older tradition locates the tomb near Bethlehem, south of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.19">Gn 35:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.48.7">48:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.2.18">Mt 2:18</a>). This option has won the impressive historical support of Josephus, Eusebius, Jerome, Origen, and the Talmudists. A second site is Ephrath (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.19">Gn 35:19</a>), which was on the northern border of Benjamin, 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) north of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.2">1 Sm 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.15">Jer 31:15</a>), near ancient Bethel.</p>
<p>Rachel’s tomb is the first recorded instance in the Bible of a sepulchral monument. A picture of the tomb is a common decorative piece in Jewish homes throughout the world.</p>
