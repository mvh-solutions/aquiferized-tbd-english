<p class="fl">Moabitess and the widow of Mahlon, the son of Naomi and Elimelech, who were Ephrathites from Bethlehem living in Moab because of a severe famine in Judah. After the death of Elimelech and Naomi’s two sons, Naomi returned to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law Ruth during the time of the barley harvest (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.4-22">Ru 1:4-22</a>). While gleaning in the barley fields of Boaz, Ruth found favor in his eyes (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.2-22">2:2-22</a>). She later married Boaz, when he, serving as nearest kin to the childless Naomi, purchased Naomi’s estate to keep it within the family (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.5-13">4:5-13</a>). Ruth is mentioned in Matthew’s genealogy of Christ as the mother of Obed and the great-grandmother of David (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Mt 1:5</a>).</p>
