<p class="h1">REPHAIM, Valley of</p>
<p class="fl">Geographical landmark forming part of the common boundary of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “the valley of the giants” in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.8">Jos 15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>); a broad valley in the southwestern outskirts of Jerusalem thought to be frequented by giants like the Anakim and the Nephilim. During David’s reign, after hearing that he had been anointed king, the Philistine armies came up from the coast to search for him in the Valley of Rephaim (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.18-22">2 Sm 5:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.9">1 Chr 14:9</a>). This valley joined the Wadi Serar, which led down to the Philistine coast and was a fertile area where grain was grown (<a href="?bref=Isa.17.5">Is 17:5</a>).</p>
