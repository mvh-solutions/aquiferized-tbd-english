<p class="h1">RAPHON</p>
<p class="fl">A town where Judas Maccabeus and his troops defeated the Syrian commander Timothy (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.37-43">1 Macc 5:37-43</a>). It was near Carnaim, and since Carnaim is the same as Ashteroth-karnaim (the modern Sheikh Sa’ad), Raphon is probably er-Rafeh on the Nahr el-Ehreir.</p>
