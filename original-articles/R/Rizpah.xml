<p class="h1">RIZPAH</p>
<p class="fl">Daughter of Aiah and a concubine of Saul. She bore two sons, Armoni and Mephibosheth, to Saul. In a dispute between Ishbosheth and Abner, Ishbosheth accused Abner of having relations with Rizpah, suggesting an attempt to become a royal claimant to Saul’s throne. Infuriated at this apparent false accusation, Abner vowed to assist David in defeating Saul and to make David king of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.7-10">2 Sm 3:7-10</a>). During the reign of David, Rizpah’s two sons, along with five other sons of Saul, were killed by the Gibeonites as reparation for Saul’s unwarranted slaughter of the sons of Gibeon. Rizpah courageously protected her son’s exposed bodies from natural predators until they were buried by David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.8-11">2 Sm 21:8-11</a>).</p>
