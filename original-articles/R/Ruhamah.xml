<p class="h1">RUHAMAH</p>
<p class="fl">One of two symbolic names showing God’s altered perspective toward Israel from one of hostility to one of mercy. God’s attitude of displeasure was symbolized by the name Lo-ruhamah (meaning “Not pitied”), which Hosea named his daughter. God had withdrawn his compassion from Israel because of their great sin (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.6,8">Hos 1:6, 8</a>). His new attitude of mercy was portrayed by the name Ruhamah (meaning “She has obtained pity”), revealing God’s revived spirit of compassion that was to be poured out on Israel (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.1,23">2:1, 23</a>).</p>
