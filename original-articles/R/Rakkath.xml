<p class="h1">RAKKATH</p>
<p class="fl">One of 19 cities allotted to Naphtaliâ€™s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.35">Jos 19:35</a>). The city served as a buffer against military attack on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Jewish tradition identifies Rakkath with Tiberias, but modern scholars prefer its location at either Khirbet el-Quneitireh or Tell Eklatiyah.</p>
