<p class="h1">REZEPH</p>
<p class="fl">City destroyed by the Assyrians. It was mentioned in a derisive letter sent from Sennacherib, king of Assyria, to Hezekiah of Judah. Rezeph was listed along with the conquered cities of Gozan and Haran and the sons of Eden in Telassar. The Assyrian king was reminding Hezekiah that just as the local deities of these cities were not able to protect them from Assyrian conquest, so neither could Hezekiah’s God preserve Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.12">2 Kgs 19:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.12">Is 37:12</a>). Rezeph was a notable Assyrian city, known for its commerce and governing seat. It was brought into the Assyrian Empire well over a century before Hezekiah’s confrontation with Sennacherib. It is perhaps identifiable with the modern Syrian city of Resafa.</p>
