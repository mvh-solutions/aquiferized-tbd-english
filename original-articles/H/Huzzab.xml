<p class="h1">HUZZAB*</p>
<p class="fl">Obscure Hebrew word found only in <a href="?bref=Nah.2.7">Nahum 2:7</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). Scholars are uncertain whether the word is a verb meaning “it is decreed,” a noun personifying Nineveh, or a reference to an Assyrian queen. The problem is perhaps due to textual error, but thus far neither textual scholarship nor archaeology has been able to resolve the question.</p>
