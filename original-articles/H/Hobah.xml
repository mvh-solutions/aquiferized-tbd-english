<p class="h1">HOBAH</p>
<p class="fl">Town to which Abraham pursued the armies under Chedorlaomer (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.15">Gn 14:15</a>). Its location is uncertain, but various suggestions have been made. Some equate it with the Hobah about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Damascus; others, with the territory called Ube in the Amarna letters; and still others, with Tell el-Salihite, 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Damascus.</p>
