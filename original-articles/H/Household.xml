<p class="h1">HOUSEHOLD</p>
<p class="fl">Persons who live in the same place and compose a family or extended family. In biblical times a household included father, mother(s), children, grandparents, servants, concubines, and sojourners. Jacob’s household, for example, included 66 people, not counting the wives of his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.26">Gn 46:26</a>). Households were seen as corporately responsible for the honor of the family (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.27">2 Sm 3:27</a> gives an example of revenge by a household). Male members of the entire household were circumcised as a sign of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.23">Gn 17:23</a>). In the NT era, some entire households were baptized (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.14">Acts 11:14</a>).</p>
