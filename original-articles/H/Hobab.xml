<p class="h1">HOBAB</p>
<p class="fl">Name associated with Moses’ father-in-law (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Jgs 4:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), who was a priest of Midian (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.1">Ex 18:1</a>) and ancestor of the Kenites (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Jgs 4:11</a>). He is usually called Jethro (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">Ex 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.4.18">4:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.18.1-12">18:1-12</a>), but also Reuel (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">Ex 2:18</a>).</p>
<p>The confusion surrounding the name Hobab has never been satisfactorily resolved. <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a> seems to identify Hobab with Jethro; there is some manuscript evidence for adding “Hobab” to “the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law” in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Judges 1:16</a>, and to the mention of Reuel in <a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">Exodus 2:18</a>. But Hobab could be Jethro’s son, on one reading of <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Numbers 10:29a</a>: “Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law.” In this passage Moses requests that Hobab accompany Israel as guide and adviser in the wilderness.</p>
