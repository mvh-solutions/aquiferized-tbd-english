<p class="h1">HALLEL*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew term describing a song of praise to God. It was later used in the Talmud and in rabbinical writings to refer to several groups of psalms of praise to God. <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-118.29">Psalms 113–118</a> were known as the Egyptian Hallel, and first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Jewish tradition assigned them to Moses. During the temple period, this Hallel was recited on 18 days in the year, but only once at night, on the Passover. For that occasion it was recited in parts. <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-114.8">Psalms 113–114</a> preceded the meal, prior to drinking the second cup, and <a href="?bref=Ps.115.1-118.29">Psalms 115–118</a> were recited after the last cup was filled. This is probably the song that is meant in the reference to the Last Supper of Jesus and his disciples, when they sang a “hymn” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.30">Mt 26:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.26">Mk 14:26</a>). This Hallel was also used for the feasts of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Tabernacles, and Dedication.</p>
<p>The Great Hallel consisted of <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">Psalm 136</a> but sometimes included <a href="?bref=Ps.120.1-136.26">Psalms 120–136</a>. <a href="?bref=Ps.146.1-148.14">Psalms 146–148</a> were also considered a single Hallel. These were used in the daily morning service of the synagogue.</p>
