<p class="list">1. Nahash’s son and successor to the Ammonite throne. When King Nahash died, King David of Israel sent messengers to console Hanun and to express his continued friendship. But Hanun insulted David by humiliating his messengers and accusing them of spying. This action led to war and the defeat of Ammon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-14">2 Sm 10:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1">11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.26-31">12:26-31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.1-20.3">1 Chr 19:1–20:3</a>).</p>
