<p class="h1">HUSHAI</p>
<p class="fl">Friend and adviser who remained faithful to David when his other adviser, Ahithophel, defected to join the rebelling Absalom. According to David’s instructions, Hushai pretended loyalty to Absalom and slipped information to David regarding Absalom’s plans. Ahithophel urged Absalom to attack the fleeing David before he had a chance to strengthen his forces, but Absalom followed Hushai’s advice, which gave David time to escape over the Jordan and ultimately to defeat Absalom’s party. When his counsel was not followed, Ahithophel hanged himself, probably anticipating the disastrous outcome (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.32-37">2 Sm 15:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.15-17.23">16:15–17:23</a>). Hushai belonged to the Archite family from Ataroth, a town on Ephraim and Benjamin’s border (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.2,7">Jos 16:2, 7</a>).</p>
