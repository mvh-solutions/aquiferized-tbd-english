<p class="h1">HERMOGENES</p>
<p class="fl">Prominent Asian believer who “turned away” from Paul (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.15">2 Tm 1:15</a>). His actions may have been the result of doctrinal disagreement but more likely involved his unwillingness to come to Paul’s defense during the apostle’s second Roman imprisonment for fear of suffering the same fate himself.</p>
