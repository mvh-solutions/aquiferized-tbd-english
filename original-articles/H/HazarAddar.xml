<p class="h1">HAZAR-ADDAR</p>
<p class="fl">Town that, with Azmon, defined the southern border of Judah (<a href="?bref=Num.34.4">Nm 34:4</a>), usually identified with Khirbet el-Qudeirat near Kadesh-barnea. The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.3-4">Joshua 15:3-4</a> lists four places—Hezron, Addar, Karka, and Azmon—instead of two. Some have suggested that Hazar-addar and Addar are the same place; others, that it was renamed Hezron to distinguish it from Addar.</p>
