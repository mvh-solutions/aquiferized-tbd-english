<p class="h1">HERCULES</p>
<p class="fl">A Greek god, the son of Zeus, renowned for strength. Second Maccabees 4 records the Hellenizing fervor of Antiochus Epiphanes (175–164 <span class="era">BC</span>), who succeeded Seleucus IV Philopator, as he “founded a gymnasium right under the citadel” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.12">2 Macc 4:12</a>). At the quadrennial games in Tyre when the king was present, Jason the brother of Onias, who had obtained the high priesthood by corruption, “sent envoys, chosen as being Antiochian citizens from Jerusalem, to carry three hundred silver drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.19">19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Those who were sent with the money thought it inappropriate to use it for the sacrifice, so they applied it to the construction of ships instead (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.19-20">19-20</a>), which indicates some resistance to the pattern of Hellenization.</p>
