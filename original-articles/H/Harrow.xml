<p class="h1">HARROW*</p>
<p class="fl">Agricultural term for implement or procedure, though no implement corresponding to the modern harrow is known from Palestine or Egypt. <a href="?bref=Job.39.10">Job 39:10</a> speaks of an ox performing the harrowing, while <a href="?bref=Isa.28.24">Isaiah 28:24</a> notes that plowed ground was leveled as part of the process. Like the foregoing references, <a href="?bref=Hos.10.11">Hosea 10:11</a> speaks of harrowing in connection with plowing. Most probably harrowing consisted of branches being pulled behind an animal or plow to smooth the land and before seeding. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Agriculture_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Agriculture</a>.</p>
