<p class="h1">HANNAH</p>
<p class="fl">Wife of Elkanah from Ephraim’s tribe and the mother of the prophet Samuel. The childless Hannah prayed annually at Shiloh for a son, whom she vowed to dedicate to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord answered her prayer, and she called her son Samuel. When he was weaned (probably about age three), she dedicated him at Shiloh to the service of the Lord in the sanctuary. Henceforth, Samuel lived with Eli the priest and was visited by his parents on their annual pilgrimages. Hannah had three more sons and two daughters (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-2.21">1 Sm 1:1–2:21</a>). Her prophetic psalm (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1-10">1 Sm 2:1-10</a>) anticipates Mary’s song of praise, the “Magnificat” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Lk 1:46-55</a>).</p>
