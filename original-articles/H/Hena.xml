<p class="h1">HENA</p>
<p class="fl">One of the six cities that the rabshakeh boasted fell before the armies of Sennacherib, in spite of their gods (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.34">2 Kgs 18:34</a>). Rabshakeh hoped the example of these cities would strike fear in King Hezekiah’s heart and make him doubt the Lord’s deliverance as the same hordes surrounded Jerusalem. The kings of the five other cities are mentioned along with Hena again in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.13">2 Kings 19:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.37.13">Isaiah 37:13</a>.</p>
