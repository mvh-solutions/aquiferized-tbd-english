<p class="h1">HARMON*</p>
<p class="fl">Place mentioned by the prophet Amos to which the inhabitants of Bashan would be exiled (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.3">Am 4:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). Harmon occurs only once in the Bible, and there is no known place with such a name. There are problems with the text and numerous emendations have been proposed. Some Hebrew manuscripts render it as a common noun, meaning “palace” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), rather than a proper name. The Septuagint renders it “the mountain of Rimmon,” perhaps referring to a hill east of Rimmon (see <a href="?bref=Judg.20.45-47">Jgs 20:45-47</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.15.32">Jos 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.13">19:13</a>).</p>
