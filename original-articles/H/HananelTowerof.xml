<p class="h1">HANANEL, Tower of</p>
<p class="fl">Tower on the north wall of Jerusalem, located near the Sheep Gate (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.1">Neh 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.39">12:39</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Hananeel”). Later in Israel’s history John Hyrcanus erected a Maccabean fortress on this spot, which Pompey destroyed in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>. Still later, Herod the Great built the Tower of Antonia here to oversee the temple area. Two prophecies refer to the Tower of Hananel as a boundary point in the rebuilding of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.38">Jer 31:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.10">Zec 14:10</a>).</p>
