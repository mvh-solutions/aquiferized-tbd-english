<p class="h1">HERMON, Mount</p>
<p class="fl">Mountain often mentioned as the northern extremity of the territory conquered by Joshua and Moses in Transjordan; it is also the northern boundary of the inheritance of the half-tribe of Manasseh as well as of Israel in general (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.8">Dt 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.48">4:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.17">Jos 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.1,5">12:1, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.11">13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.23">1Â Chr 5:23</a>). Hermon is said to tower over the valley of Lebanon (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.17">Jos 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.5">13:5</a>) and over the land of Mizpah in the valley of Mizpah, to which Joshua pursued the kings of Canaan after his victory over them at the waters of Merom (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.3,8">Jos 11:3, 8</a>). Biblical poetry praises Hermon for its height and for causing dew on Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.133.3">Ps 133:3</a>), and it was famed for its wildlife (<a href="?bref=Song.4.8">Sg 4:8</a>). It also appears in tandem with Mt Tabor (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.12">Ps 89:12</a>) and with the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Ps.42.6">Ps 42:6</a>). The mountain itself is about 13 miles (21 kilometers) long and rises to a height of 9,166 feet (2.8 kilometers).</p>
