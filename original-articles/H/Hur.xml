<p class="h1">HUR</p>
<p class="list">1. Aaron’s assistant in supporting Moses’ hands until the Amalekites were defeated at Rephidim (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-13">Ex 17:8-13</a>). He is mentioned again as assisting Aaron in overseeing Israel while Moses was on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.14">24:14</a>). According to Josephus, Hur was the husband of Miriam, the sister of Moses (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 3.2.4).</p>
<p class="list">2. Fourth of the five kings of Midian who was killed with Balaam by the Israelites under Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.31.8">Nm 31:8</a>). He is also referred to as one of the “princes of Midian” and “Sihon” (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.21">Jos 13:21</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Father of one of the 12 officers whom Solomon appointed to provide food for the king’s household (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.8">1 Kgs 4:8</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <span class="sc">nlt</span> “Ben-hur”).</p>
<p class="list">4. Son of Caleb and Ephrath and the grandfather of Bezalel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.19-20">1 Chr 2:19-20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.31.2">Ex 31:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.22">38:22</a>). Although some interpreters regard the Hur discussed in #1 as the grandfather of Bezalel, others think that the Hur who assisted Moses and the Hur who was Bezalel’s grandfather were different men.</p>
<p class="list">5. Father (or perhaps family name) of Rephaiah, a postexilic leader who assisted Nehemiah in rebuilding the Jerusalem wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.9">Neh 3:9</a>).</p>
