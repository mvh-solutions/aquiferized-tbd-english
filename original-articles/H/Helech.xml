<p class="h1">HELECH</p>
<p class="fl">Term mentioned in Ezekiel’s prophecy against the city of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.11">Ez 27:11</a>), perhaps referring to Cilicia or to mercenaries from Cilicia, which was southeast of Asia Minor. Assyrian texts indicate that Cilicia was once called Hilakku, but little is known about the people. They are first mentioned by Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria (854–824 <span class="era">BC</span>), in his conquest of Asia Minor. Their history under the Assyrians was quite violent. Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon had to put down revolts from the Hilakku. Later, they gave tribute to Ashurbanipal.</p>
