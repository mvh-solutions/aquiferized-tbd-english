<p class="h1">HABAZZINIAH</p>
<p class="fl">Jaazaniah’s grandfather. Jaazaniah was a leader of the Recabites, warriors tested by Jeremiah with regard to their forefather’s command not to drink wine (<a href="?bref=Jer.35.3">Jer 35:3</a>). They remained loyal to the command, and Jeremiah used their loyalty in an appeal to Judah to be faithful to God.</p>
