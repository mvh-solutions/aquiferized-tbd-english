<p class="h1">HARBONA</p>
<p class="fl">One of King Ahasuerusâ€™s seven personal attendants. They were ordered by Ahasuerus to parade Queen Vashti before a drunken banquet to satisfy his vanity (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.10">Est 1:10</a>). Harbona later suggested that Haman be hanged on the gallows he had built for Mordecai (<a href="?bref=Esth.7.9">7:9</a>).</p>
