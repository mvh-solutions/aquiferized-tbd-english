<p class="h1">HAMOR</p>
<p class="fl">Hivite or Horite prince of the country about Shechem (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.2">Gn 34:2</a>), from whom Jacob bought land when returning with his family from Paddan-aram. At this time Hamor’s son Shechem committed fornication with Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. At his son’s request Hamor asked Jacob for a marriage alliance between Shechem and Dinah, offering a dowry. Simeon and Levi, in pretended friendship, persuaded the males of the city to be circumcised, but then attacked and killed them before they were healed, taking revenge for their sister’s humiliation.</p>
<p>“Hamor” is the Hebrew word that Jacob uses to denote Issachar in blessing his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.14">Gn 49:14</a>) and is the usual word for “ass” in the OT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.42.26">Gn 42:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.15">Jgs 15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.3">Is 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zec 9:9</a>).</p>
