<p class="h1">HORMAH</p>
<p class="fl">Town near Beersheba in the Negev and on the border of the tribes of Judah and Simeon. Originally a Canaanite settlement, it became Judah’s according to <a href="?bref=Josh.15.30">Joshua 15:30</a> and then Simeon’s according to <a href="?bref=Josh.19.4,9">Joshua 19:4, 9</a>. Judah dominated it again by the time of the early monarchy (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.30">1 Sm 30:30</a>). The change of the Canaanite name Zephath to Hormah when the Hebrews first conquered it is noted in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.17">Judges 1:17</a>. Hormah took David’s side during his running feud with King Saul and David rewarded the town by sending it some of the spoils of Ziklag (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-31">1 Sm 30</a>). <a href="?bref=Josh.15.30">Joshua 15:30</a> describes it as being in the south near Kesil and Ziklag, but its precise location remains unknown. From the reference in <a href="?bref=Num.14.45">Numbers 14:45</a>, it could well be south of Kadesh-barnea, where the Israelites spent much of the wilderness period.</p>
