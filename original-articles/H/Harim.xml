<p class="h1">HARIM</p>
<p class="list">1. Priest whom King David appointed to official duties in the temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.24.8">1 Chr 24:8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ancestor of a Jewish family who returned from the Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.32">Ezr 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.10.5">Neh 10:5</a>). Members of this family were guilty of marrying foreign women (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.31">Ezr 10:31</a>), but they divorced their wives and a representative of the clan signed Ezra’s covenant (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.27">Neh 10:27</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Ancestor of a family of priests who returned from the exile with Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.39">Ezr 2:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.42">Neh 7:42</a>). Some identify him with #1 above. Members of this family were guilty of marrying foreign women.</p>
<p class="list">4. Ancestor of Malkijah. Malkijah repaired a section of the Jerusalem wall during Nehemiah’s time (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.11">Neh 3:11</a>). This Harim could be the same as #2 above.</p>
<p class="list">5. Priest who returned from the exile with Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.3">Neh 12:3</a>; Hebrew “Rehum,” see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). His son (or grandson) Adna is listed as a leading priest during the high priesthood of Joiakim (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.15">12:15</a>). Later, under Ezra, a representative of the family (probably related to #3 above) signed the covenant of faithfulness to God (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.5">10:5</a>).</p>
