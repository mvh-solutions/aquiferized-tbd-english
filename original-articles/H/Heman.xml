<p class="h1">HEMAN</p>
<p class="list">1. Lotan’s son, the brother of Hori and a descendant of Seir the Horite (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.22">Gn 36:22</a>); alternately spelled Homam in <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.39">1 Chronicles 1:39</a>, reflecting a later scribal error.</p>
<p class="list">2. Mahol’s son, descendant of Zerah from Judah’s tribe and one of the sages whose wisdom was surpassed by King Solomon’s (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.31">1 Kgs 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.6">1 Chr 2:6</a>). He is perhaps the Ezrahite and author of <a href="?bref=Ps.88.1-18">Psalm 88</a>.</p>
<p class="list">3. Kohathite Levite, Joel’s son and one appointed, along with Asaph and Ethan (also called Jeduthun), by David to lead the musicians in the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.33">1 Chr 6:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.17">15:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.41">16:41</a>). During the transport of the ark from Obed-edom’s house to Jerusalem, he was responsible for sounding the bronze cymbals (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.19">1 Chr 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.5.12">2 Chr 5:12</a>). Heman fathered 14 sons and 3 daughters, all of whom served as musicians in the Lord’s house (<a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1-6">1 Chr 25:1-6</a>). Later, his descendants participated in the cleansing of the temple during King Hezekiah’s reign (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.14">2 Chr 29:14</a>) and assisted with the Passover celebration initiated by King Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.15">2 Chr 35:15</a>).</p>
