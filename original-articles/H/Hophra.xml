<p class="h1">HOPHRA</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Psammis, ruler over Egypt from 589–570 <span class="era">BC</span> during the 26th dynasty. Called Pharaoh Hophra in <a href="?bref=Jer.44.30">Jeremiah 44:30</a>, although he is alluded to several other times during the divided kingdom period (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.5">Jer 37:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.43.8-13">43:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.1-3">Ez 29:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.1-18">31:1-18</a>).</p>
<p>He came to power after the death of his father, and in 589 <span class="era">BC</span> marched into Judah against Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians in order to assist Zedekiah. Apparently he retreated before superior forces, Jerusalem was overthrown in 586 (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.5-8">Jer 37:5-8</a>), and Hophra was killed as prophesied (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.30">Jer 44:30</a>). This occurred in 566 <span class="era">BC</span>, at the hands of Amasis (Ahmose II), who had usurped the throne of Egypt in 569 <span class="era">BC</span>. Both Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.9-13">Jer 43:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.13-26">46:13-26</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.1-30.26">Ez 29–30</a>) foretold this defeat.</p>
