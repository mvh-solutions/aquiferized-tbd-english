<p class="h1">GATH-RIMMON</p>
<p class="list">1. City located in the land allotted to Dan’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.45">Jos 19:45</a>). It was assigned as one of the four Levitical cities for the Kohathites in Dan (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.24">21:24</a>). Lost to the Canaanites, Gath-rimmon was later regained by Ephraim and included as one of its cities for the sons of Levi (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.69">1 Chr 6:69</a>). Its site is identifiable with the modern Tell el-Jerisheh.</p>

<p class="list">2. One of two cities given to the Levites in Manasseh west of the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.25">Jos 21:25</a>), suggesting a possible transcription mistake, which is better read as Bileam (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.70">1 Chr 6:70</a>).</p>
