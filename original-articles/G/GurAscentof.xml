<p class="h1">GUR, Ascent of</p>
<p class="fl">Elevated place near Ibleam where Ahaziah, king of Judah, was smitten by the soldiers of Jehu of the northern kingdom. From Gur, Ahaziah fled to Megiddo, where he died (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.27">2Â Kgs 9:27</a>). Though its location is uncertain, some identify it with the Akkadian Gurra, about one-half mile (800 meters) south of Jenin.</p>
