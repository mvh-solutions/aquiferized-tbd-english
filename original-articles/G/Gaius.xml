<p class="h1">GAIUS</p>
<p class="list">1. Native of Macedonia and traveling companion of Paul during the apostle’s third missionary journey. He and Aristarchus were both seized at Ephesus during the riot caused by Demetrius the silversmith (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.29">Acts 19:29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Native of Derbe in Lycaonia, who traveled with Paul from Ephesus to Macedonia (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>). Some have identified him with #1 above.</p>
<p class="list">3. Prominent believer in Corinth and host to Paul and the whole church there (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">Rom 16:23</a>). Since Romans was written in Corinth, the Gaius mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.14">1 Corinthians 1:14</a> was probably the same person. If so, he was baptized by Paul.</p>
<p class="list">4. Man to whom John addressed his third letter (<a href="?bref=3Jn.1.1">3 Jn 1:1</a>).</p>
