<p class="list">1. One of the 12 sons of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.26">Gn 35:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.2">1 Chr 2:2</a>). He was the first of the two sons born to Jacob by Zilpah, Leah’s maid. Delighted with giving Jacob another son, Leah named the boy Gad, meaning “good fortune” (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.11">Gn 30:11</a>). Later, Gad moved his family with Jacob to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.4">Ex 1:4</a>). When Jacob blessed his sons, he predicted that Gad would constantly be troubled by foreign invaders but would successfully withstand them and put them to flight (see <a href="?bref=Gen.49.19">Gn 49:19</a> and discussion below under Gad, Tribe of). Gad became the father of seven sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.16">Gn 46:16</a>) and the founder of the Gadites (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.12,16">Dt 3:12, 16</a>), one of the 12 tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.2.14">Nm 2:14</a>).</p>

<p class="list">2. Prophet and seer during the reign of David. He counseled David to leave Mizpeh of Moab and return to the land of Judah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.5">1 Sm 22:5</a>). Gad communicated David’s punishment for numbering the fighting men of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.11-14,18-19">2 Sm 24:11-14, 18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.9-19">1 Chr 21:9-19</a>), assisted David and Nathan in setting up the order of worship in the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.25">2 Chr 29:25</a>) and later wrote an account of David’s life (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>).</p>
