<p class="h1">GITTAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Benjamin to which the inhabitants of Beeroth fled, where they remained under civil protection (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.3">2Â Sm 4:3</a>). <a href="?bref=Neh.11.33">Nehemiah 11:33</a> lists Gittaim as one of the places where the returned exiles later settled. The two references may indicate two different places. If so, the second Gittaim may be located northwest of Jerusalem. Some scholars, however, believe that there is only one Gittaim, the one near Beeroth.</p>
