<p class="h1">GEHAZI</p>
<p class="fl">Servant of Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.25">2 Kgs 5:25</a>) who instructed the prophet how best to recompense the generous Shunammite woman for her kindness to him (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.11-17">4:11-17</a>). Gehazi took Elisha’s staff to use in reviving the woman’s dead son, but he was unsuccessful (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.31">31</a>), and the prophet himself had to revive the child (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.32-37">32-37</a>). His greed in securing from Naaman presents declined by Elisha resulted in his contracting Naaman’s leprosy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.20-23,27">5:20-23, 27</a>). In <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.1-6">2 Kings 8:1-6</a> Gehazi again encountered the Shunammite woman as she was petitioning the king of Israel.</p>
