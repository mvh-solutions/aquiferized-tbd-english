<p class="h1">GATEKEEPERS</p>
<p class="fl">Those who guarded gates of the cities and doors of palaces, temples, and other large buildings. Their task was to admit or reject visitors (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.7.10-11">2Â Kgs 7:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.4-9">11:4-9</a>). In the Bible these men are variously named as gatekeepers, porters, doorkeepers, and guards.</p>
