<p class="h1">GUARD, Gate of the</p>
<p class="fl">Gate located in the north or northwest part of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.38-39">Neh 12:38-39</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “prison gate”), although unrelated to the courtyard of the guard (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.25">3:25</a>), which was connected to the palace. Perhaps it was the same as the Muster Gate. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Jerusalem_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jerusalem</a>.</p>
