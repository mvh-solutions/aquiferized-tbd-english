<p class="h1">GOZAN</p>
<p class="fl">City and district near the Euphrates River. The Habor River (modern Khabur) flowed through it. The Assyrians conquered it sometime before Sennacherib’s invasion of Judah (701 <span class="era">BC</span>). This fact is mentioned by Sennacherib, king of Assyria, in a blasphemous letter sent to Hezekiah, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.12">2 Kgs 19:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.12">Is 37:12</a>). Later it became one of the places in Assyria where conquered Israelites were deported.</p>
