<p class="h1">GILEAD (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Region east of the Jordan River. Generally used to designate the territory occupied by all the Transjordanian Israelite tribes (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.1">Jgs 20:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.33">2 Kgs 10:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.50.19">Jer 50:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.10">Zec 10:10</a>). Specifically, Gilead is the area of the Transjordan lying between the Yarmuk and Arnon Rivers and divided by the Jabbok River.</p>
<p class="list-text">The so-called Dome of Gilead is an extension of the central hill country of Judah, rising to heights of more than 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) above the Jordan Valley. The valleys and hills were well watered by numerous rivers and tributaries, making flatter portions of the countryside well suited for agriculture, especially olive trees, grapevines, and grains (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.11">46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.8">Hos 2:8</a>). The densely forested and rugged hills were sometimes compared to those of Lebanon (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.6">Jer 22:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.10">Zec 10:10</a>) and made the land a refuge for those in flight, since the terrain prohibited ready pursuit by enemies (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.31.21">Gn 31:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.7">1 Sm 13:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Originally the region of Gilead was allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>). The period of the judges saw Israelite security there assailed by the Midianites and Amalekites, only to be checked by the military exploits of Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-7.25">Jgs 6–7</a>). Half a century later, Jephthah was recalled from his banishment to rescue Gilead from oppressive Ammonite rule (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.10.1-11.40">10–11</a>). During the united monarchy, Saul delivered Jabesh-gilead from Ammonite dominance (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-11">1 Sm 11:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.8-13">31:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-7">2 Sm 2:1-7</a>). Abner installed Ish-bosheth as a rival to David in Gilead (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-9">2 Sm 2:8-9</a>). David conquered the Ammonites controlling Gilead as he extended the borders of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.11-12">8:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-19">10:1-19</a>). He fled there for refuge in the face of Absalom’s rebellion (chs <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-17.29">15–17</a>) and was finally restored to the throne when Absalom was slain in the forest of Ephraim (chs <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-19.43">18–19</a>). Gilead remained a battleground during the divided monarchy, as first the Israelites warred with the Syrians (Arameans; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.23-43">1 Kgs 20:23-43</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-4,29-40">22:1-4, 29-40</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.22">2 Kgs 13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.3">Am 1:3</a>) and then with the Assyrians, who wrested the territory from Pekah in 733 <span class="era">BC</span> and deported the Israelite population, thus severing Gilead’s tie to the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.27-31">2 Kgs 15:27-31</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. A city condemned for its evil (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.8">Hos 6:8</a>), possibly an abbreviated name for Jabesh-gilead or Ramoth-gilead. This may be the same Gilead that was identified with Mizpah #5. (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.10.17-18">Jgs 10:17-18</a>).</p>
