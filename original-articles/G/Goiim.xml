<p class="h1">GOIIM</p>
<p class="list">1. People or region mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1,9">Genesis 14:1, 9</a> as ruled by a king named Tidal. The word is variously translated “nations” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) and “Goiim” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Tidal, together with three other kings—Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, and Kedorlaomer of Elam—attacked several cities in the valley of Siddim near the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.3">Gn 14:3</a>). They defeated the five kings of the valley region, looted their towns, and captured Lot, Abraham’s nephew, who lived in Sodom (v <a href="?bref=Gen.14.12">12</a>). When Abraham heard of this, he gathered his soldiers, pursued the victorious kings, defeated them, and rescued Lot (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.14.13-16">13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. People mentioned in connection with Joshua’s victory over an unknown king of Goiim (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.23">Jos 12:23</a>). The location of these people is uncertain, since the verse reads “Gilgal” in the Hebrew text and “Galilee” in the Septuagint.</p>
