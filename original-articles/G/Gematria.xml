<p class="h1">GEMATRIA*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the rabbinic hermeneutic rules for interpreting the OT. It consisted of explaining a word or group of words according to the numerical value of the letters or by substituting and rearranging certain letters according to a set system. By that rule of interpretation, for example, some rabbis have argued that Eliezer (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2">Gn 15:2</a>) was worth all the servants of Abraham put together, for Abraham had 318 servants and Eliezer’s name equaled 318 (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.14">Gn 14:14</a>). The name Babylon is arrived at in <a href="?bref=Jer.25.26">Jeremiah 25:26</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.51.41">51:41</a> by substituting the last letter of the Hebrew word for the first letter of the same word.</p>
<p>The pseudepigraphal Epistle of Barnabas interprets the 318 servants of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.14">Gn 14:14</a>) as pointing to Jesus’ death on the cross, because 300 is the numerical value of the Greek letter “t,” which is cross-shaped, and 18 the value of the first two letters of the Greek word for Jesus. In the book of Revelation the number of the beast is 666 (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.18">Rv 13:18</a>). If the number seven is considered to be the perfect number in the Bible, and if three sevens represent complete perfection, then the number 666 falls completely short of perfection.</p>
