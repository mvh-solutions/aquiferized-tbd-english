<p class="h1">GOUGING</p>
<p class="fl">Common practice among the Philistines, Amorites, Babylonians, and other nations surrounding Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.21">Jgs 16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.7">2 Kgs 25:7</a>) of forcibly removing the eyes. The practice was intended not only to disable but also to bring extreme disgrace upon the person (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.2">1 Sm 11:2</a>). Although the Israelites seem to have known about it from their sojourn in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Num.16.14">Nm 16:14</a>), there is no evidence that it was a common practice in Israel.</p>
