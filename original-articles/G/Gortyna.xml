<p class="h1">GORTYNA</p>
<p class="fl">A city of Crete mentioned in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.23">1 Maccabees 15:23</a> in the list of places to which the Romans sent letters instructing the kings and countries that they should do the Jews no harm (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.19">1 Macc 15:19</a>). In classical times it allied with Knossos to control Crete, but it was soon fighting its partner. Under the Romans, it became the capital city of Crete. Excavations in 1884 recovered the Gortyna legal code of the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Being near Fair Havens, Paul may have preached the gospel to the Jewish residents there on his voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.8-9">Acts 27:8-9</a>).</p>
