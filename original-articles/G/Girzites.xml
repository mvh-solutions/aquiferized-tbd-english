<p class="h1">GIRZITES</p>
<p class="fl">People living in southwest Canaan who were raided by David when at Ziklag (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.8">1 Sm 27:8</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Gezrites”). The Hebrew text has <span class="hebrew">girzi</span><span class="ital">,</span> while the marginal variant transposes two consonants to read <span class="hebrew">gizri</span><span class="ital">,</span> “Gezrites.” The Greek version follows the Hebrew marginal variant. The confusion of the name is obviously early. If “Gerzites” is the original, they could have been a Canaanite tribe living in the Mt Gerizim area. If it was “Gezrites” originally, the people could have migrated from Gezer. They are otherwise unmentioned in the OT.</p>
