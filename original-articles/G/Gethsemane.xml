<p class="h1">GETHSEMANE</p>
<p class="fl">Place to which Jesus and his disciples walked after their Last Supper together in the upper room. In Gethsemane, Jesus underwent a great inner struggle, as he realized the hour of his betrayal was at hand (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.36-56">Mt 26:36-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32-50">Mk 14:32-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.39-53">Lk 22:39-53</a>).</p>
<p>The name Gethsemane, used only in the Gospels of Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.36">26:36</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.32">14:32</a>), means “oil press,” suggesting the presence of an olive grove. The use of the Greek word “place” in the Gospel accounts indicates that Gethsemane was an enclosed piece of ground. It may be that the grove was privately owned and that Jesus and his disciples had special permission to enter.</p>
<p>Though the Gospels of Luke and John do not mention the word Gethsemane, they both record Jesus’ agony before his betrayal. Luke says the location was on the “Mount of Olives” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.39">Lk 22:39</a>). John describes the area as “across the Kidron Valley” (<a href="?bref=John.18.1">Jn 18:1</a>); John’s is the only Gospel to call the spot a garden. From those accounts it is also evident that Jesus and his disciples gathered in Gethsemane often for fellowship and prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.39">Lk 22:39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.2">Jn 18:2</a>). The Gospel narratives indicate that the garden was large enough for the group to separate into different parts of it.</p>
