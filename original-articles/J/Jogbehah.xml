<p class="h1">JOGBEHAH</p>
<p class="fl">City in Gilead (Transjordan) built and fortified by Gad’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.32.35">Nm 32:35</a>). During the period of the judges, Gideon, in his pursuit of the Midianites, circled to the east of Jogbehah in order to attack the unsuspecting camp of Midian at Karkor (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.11">Jgs 8:11</a>). This ancient city is now identified with Khirbet el-Ajbeihat, seven miles (11.3 kilometers) northwest of Amman.</p>
