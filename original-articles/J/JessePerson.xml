<p class="h1">JESSE (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Obed and grandson of Ruth and Boaz (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.17,22">Ru 4:17, 22</a>). Jesse was a shepherd from Bethlehem. He had eight sons, of whom David was the youngest. He had at least two daughters, Zeruiah and Abigail, who became mothers of famous warriors.</p>
<p>When Samuel went to Jesse’s home to search for and anoint a king, Jesse did not at first feel it worthwhile to call David for examination (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.11">1 Sm 16:11</a>). Later he sent David to play the lyre for Saul (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.19-21">19-21</a>). After David became a fugitive from Saul, Jesse and others of the family came to David in the cave of Adullam. David then brought his father and mother to Mizpah in Moab (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.3">22:3</a>). Nothing further is heard of Jesse.</p>
<p>After Saul broke with David, he commonly spoke of David derisively as a “son of Jesse” to underscore his humble origins (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.31">1 Sm 20:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.7">22:7</a>). This same emphasis on Jesse’s modest station in life is found in such messianic references as <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Isaiah 11:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.10.1-34">10</a>, which speak of the “shoot from the stump of Jesse” and “the root of Jesse” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
