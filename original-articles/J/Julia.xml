<p class="h1">JULIA</p>
<p class="list">1. Woman greeted by the apostle Paul (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.15">Rom 16:15</a>). Her name follows that of Philologus, who may have been her brother or husband.</p>
<p class="list">2. According to a variant reading, a woman noted by Paul as being one of his coworkers, as well as a distinguished apostle (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.7">Rom 16:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). She was probably Andronicus’s wife. The couple, like Aquila and Priscilla, formed an apostolic team. In other manuscripts, the reading is Junia—which, in the Greek, can be understood as a masculine name or feminine, depending on the accent. However, the most ancient manuscripts do not have an accent mark on this name; therefore, the interpreter must decide if this apostle was male or female.</p>
