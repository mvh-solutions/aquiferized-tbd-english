<p class="h1">JARMUTH</p>
<p class="list">1. Fortified city in the northern part of the Shephelah given to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.35">Jos 15:35</a>). It was one of five Amorite cities that banded together to attack Gibeon after they had made peace with Joshua and Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.3-5">10:3-5</a>). Jarmuth was reinhabited after the exile by people of Judah (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.29">Neh 11:29</a>), and possibly maintained a population throughout the Dispersion. It is identified with Khirbet Yarmuk, 18 miles (29 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area of the Bronze Age city was six to eight acres (2.4 to 3.2 hectares) and had a population of about 1,500 to 2,000 people. It is mentioned in the Amarna letters as receiving aid from Lachish.</p>
<p class="list">2. One of four cities of Issachar given to the Levites for their inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.28-29">Jos 21:28-29</a>). It is apparently identifiable with Ramoth in <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.73">1 Chronicles 6:73</a> and Remeth in <a href="?bref=Josh.19.21">Joshua 19:21</a>. A stele of Pharaoh Seti I was found at Beth-shan, referring to the whole area as Mt Jarmuth.</p>
