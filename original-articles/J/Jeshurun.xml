<p class="h1">JESHURUN*</p>
<p class="fl">Poetical name for Israel, possibly derived from the Hebrew root meaning “upright,” but according to many scholars a diminutive of Israel. The name Jeshurun is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Deut.32.15">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.33.5,26">33:5, 26</a> (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). In the Septuagint, the word is not translated as a proper name but as an adjective, “beloved.” In <a href="?bref=Isa.44.2">Isaiah 44:2</a> Jacob is described as “Israel, my chosen one” (with mg note saying “Jeshurun,” see <span class="sc">nlt</span>), thus linking the name with the idea of election. In <a href="?bref=Deut.33.5">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> Israel is reminded that “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> became king in Jeshurun” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), and in verse <a href="?bref=Deut.33.26">26</a> it is told that there is none like God. If we follow the Septuagint, there is a link with the term “beloved” used of Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">Mt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.6">Eph 1:6</a>) and of the church (<a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.4">1 Thes 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13">2 Thes 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.1">Jude 1:1</a>).</p>
