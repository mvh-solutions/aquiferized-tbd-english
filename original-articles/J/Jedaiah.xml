<p class="h1">JEDAIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Shimri’s son and the father of Allon. He is listed in the genealogical tables of the Simeonites who settled in the valley of Gedor in Hezekiah’s time (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.37">1 Chr 4:37</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Harumaph’s son, who helped repair the Jerusalem wall after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.10">Neh 3:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Aaron’s descendant and head of the second of the 24 priestly divisions for temple service in David’s time (<a href="?bref=1Chr.24.7">1 Chr 24:7</a>). His descendants are listed among the returned exiles (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.10">1 Chr 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.36">Ezr 2:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.39">Neh 7:39</a>). The individuals and families listed below are probably a part of this priestly line, but their exact relationships are difficult to determine.</p>
<p class="list">4. Provincial priest who agreed to resettle in postexilic Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.10">Neh 11:10</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Neh.11.2">2</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Priest who returned with Zerubbabel after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.6-7">Neh 12:6-7</a>). In the next generation this was the name of a family (v <a href="?bref=Neh.12.21">21</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. One of the exiles taken by Zechariah as witness to the symbolic crowning of Joshua (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “Jeshua”). He may be the same as #4 or #5 above. He came back from captivity bringing gifts for the temple in the days of the high priest Joshua (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.10-14">Zec 6:10-14</a>).</p>
