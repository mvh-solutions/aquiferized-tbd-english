<p class="h1">JOHN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list"> 1. Father of Simon Peter and Andrew (<a href="?bref=John.1.40-42">Jn 1:40-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.15-17">21:15-17</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Matthew 16:17</a>, Peter’s father was named Jona (Jonas, Jonah). Either Jona was an alternate form of the name John or, more probably, two independent traditions existed regarding his name.</p>
<p class="list"> 2. Member of the high priestly family who, along with Annas, Caiaphas, and Alexander, questioned Peter and John after the two apostles had healed a lame man (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 3. According to the early church bishop Papias, a member of the larger group of Jesus’ disciples outside the Twelve (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.10.1">Lk 10:1</a>).
