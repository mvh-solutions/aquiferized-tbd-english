<p class="fl">Son of Shelemiah who was sent by King Zedekiah to request Jeremiahâ€™s prayers for Judah (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.3">Jer 37:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.38.1">38:1</a>). Later he tried to kill Jeremiah, who continued to prophesy the invasion of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, thereby undermining the confidence of the people and the army (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.1-6">38:1-6</a>).</p>
