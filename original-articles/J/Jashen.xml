<p class="h1">JASHEN</p>
<p class="fl">One of David’s 30 mighty men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.32">2 Sm 23:32</a>). The Hebrew text reads “the sons of Jashen,” and <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.34">1 Chronicles 11:34</a> reads “the sons of Hashem the Gizonite.” Scholars are generally agreed that the phrase “the sons of” is dittographic and repeats the last three letters of the preceding word. The reading in the original text probably was either “Jashen the Gizonite” or “Hashem the Gizonite,” making him, and not his son, the mighty man of David’s army.</p>
