<p class="h1">JEHOSHAPHAT, Valley of</p>
<p class="fl">Valley mentioned in prophecy as the place of future judgment (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.2,12">Jl 3:2, 12</a>), sometimes called the valley of decision (v <a href="?bref=Joel.3.14">14</a>). Its exact location is disputed. Some (notably Jerome) identify it with the Kidron Valley, east of Jerusalem, pointing to early Christian tradition; others prefer the valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem. This tradition may be traced back through Eusebius to the book of 1 Enoch (1 Enoch 53:1). Still others say the name is symbolic and refers only to coming judgment, not to a specific place.</p>
