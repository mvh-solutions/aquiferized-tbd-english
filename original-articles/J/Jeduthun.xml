<p class="h1">JEDUTHUN</p>
<p class="fl">Member of the Levitical family of Merar who, along with Asaph and Heman, presided over the music in the sanctuary in David’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1">1 Chr 25:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.5.12">2 Chr 5:12</a>; called “Ethan” in <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.44">1 Chr 6:44</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.17">15:17</a>). Jeduthun is mentioned in the titles of <a href="?bref=Ps.39.1-13">Psalms 39</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.62.1-12">62</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.77.1-20">77</a>. Some of his sons were set apart to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals (<a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1-3">1 Chr 25:1-3</a>), apparently following the example of their father, who was called “the king’s seer” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.15">2 Chr 35:15</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.38">1 Chronicles 16:38</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.42">42</a>, he is listed as Obed-edom’s father.</p>
