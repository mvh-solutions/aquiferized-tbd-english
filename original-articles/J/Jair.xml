<p class="h1">JAIR</p>
<p class="list">1. Descendant of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Num.32.41">Nm 32:41</a>), who at the time of the Conquest took several villages in the Argob region of Bashan and Gilead and called them after his own name, Havvoth-jair, meaning “Towns of Jair” (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Dt 3:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.13.30">Jos 13:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">1 Kgs 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.23">1 Chr 2:23</a>).</p>

<p class="list">2. One of the judges of Israel. He judged Israel 22 years. His being a Gileadite makes it probable that he was a descendant of #1 above (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.3-5">Jgs 10:3-5</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Father of Elhanan, who killed Lahmi, Goliath’s brother (<a href="?bref=1Chr.20.5">1 Chr 20:5</a>). In <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.19">2 Samuel 21:19</a> he is called Jaare-oregim.</p>
<p class="list">4. Father of Mordecai (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.5">Est 2:5</a>). Because of the time lapse from the capture of Jeconiah, king of Judah (597 <span class="era">BC</span>), to the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, king of Persia (486 <span class="era">BC</span>), Jair was either the one taken captive with Jeconiah or his father, Shimei, was, in which case Jair would have been born during the Captivity.</p>
