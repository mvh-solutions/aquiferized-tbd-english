<p class="h1">TERTULLUS</p>
<p class="fl">Prosecuting attorney chosen by the Sanhedrin to lead in the trial of Paul before Felix, Roman procurator of Judea (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.1-2">Acts 24:1-2</a>). It is not clear whether Tertullus was a Roman, Greek, or Jew. The chief arguments that he was a Jew come from references to “our law” and to the mention that Lysias had taken Paul from “our hands.” However, these words are part of two verses (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.24.6-7">6b-7</a>) that are not included in the most ancient manuscripts.</p>
<p>From the speed with which the Jews were able to bring him forward, he was probably a professional attorney who practiced law regularly in the Roman court. His speech (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.2-8">Acts 24:2-8</a>) begins with a word of flattery for Felix. Then he proceeds to charge Paul with being a public nuisance, a disturber of the peace, and a leader of the sect of the Nazarenes. All of these were serious charges in Roman law.</p>
