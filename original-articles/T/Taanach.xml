<p class="h1">TAANACH</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Canaanite fortress cities bordering the plain of Esdraelon and the valley of Jezreel, including Jokneam, Megiddo, Ibleam, and Beth-shan. The modern site, about five miles (8 kilometers) southeast of Megiddo, retains the ancient name, Tell Taanak. Excavations reveal a 14th-century <span class="era">BC</span> wall made of huge, irregularly shaped rocks, with smaller stones set in the chinks, along with ruins of a local king’s palace. Some 40 cuneiform tablets of the 15th and 14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span> were unearthed, and from a later period, brick houses possibly of Israelite construction. A terra-cotta incense altar was found in a house of Israelite date.</p>
<p>Taanach is first mentioned in the Bible in a list of kings conquered by the Israelites on the west side of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.21">Jos 12:21</a>). In the tribal division of Palestine, Manasseh received Taanach (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.25">21:25</a>), which was also named as a Levitical city. Manasseh, however, was not able to capture Taanach or any of the other strong cities in its inheritance (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>).</p>
<p>After the defeat of Sisera, Deborah and Barak sang a song in which it was said that the fighting took place at Taanach near the waters of Megiddo (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.19">Jgs 5:19</a>). In the time of Solomon, Taanach was one of the towns mentioned in the enumeration of the administrative districts responsible for supplying monthly provisions for the king’s household (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). The last mention of Taanach in the Bible is in a genealogical list (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.29">1 Chr 7:29</a>), where the city is said to have belonged to Ephraim, along the borders of the Manassites.</p>
