<p class="h1">TROPHIMUS</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Asians who accompanied Paul on his final trip to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>). Because the Jews had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with Paul in Jerusalem, they incorrectly assumed that he had accompanied Paul into the temple (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.29">21:29</a>). Since Trophimus was not a Jew, his alleged act of profaning the temple served as the pretense for Paul’s arrest and subsequent imprisonment. Trophimus was traveling with Paul as one of the representatives of the Asian church who had been selected to superintend the collection for the Jerusalem church. Trophimus was probably one of the two brothers who accompanied Titus in the delivery of 2 Corinthians to Corinth (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.16-24">2 Cor 8:16-24</a>). According to <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.20">2 Timothy 4:20</a>, Trophimus had been accompanying Paul (prior to his final imprisonment) but then stayed behind in Miletus due to illness. Legend suggests that Trophimus was ultimately beheaded by the order of Nero.</p>
