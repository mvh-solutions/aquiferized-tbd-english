<p class="h1">TIMNAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. One of the cities on the northern boundary of Judah’s inheritance, located between Beth-shemesh and Ekron (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.10">Jos 15:10</a>). This is the likely site of Judah’s affair with Tamar, which resulted in the birth of Perez and Zerah (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.12-14">Gn 38:12-14</a>). A frontier town between Judah and Philistia, Timnah was the place where Samson had his first marital difficulties with one of the daughters of the Philistines (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.1-5">Jgs 14:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.6">15:6</a>). The town evidently changed hands frequently between the Israelites and the Philistines. Apparently, Israel did achieve control of Timnah during the conquest (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.19.43">Jos 19:43</a>), but it was under Philistine control by the time of Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.1">Jgs 14:1</a>). Ahaz recaptured Timnah (c. 730 <span class="era">BC</span>) from the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.18">2 Chr 28:18</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the cities of the southern hill country that was part of the inheritance of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.57">Jos 15:57</a>). It is possible that this is the site of Judah’s encounter with Tamar (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.12-14">Gn 38:12-14</a>; and perhaps the same as #1 above).</p>
