<p class="h1">TERAH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Father of Abram (Abraham), Nahor, and Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.26">Gn 11:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.26">1Â Chr 1:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.34">Lk 3:34</a>). Though Abram is listed first among his sons, it is likely that Abram was not the oldest. After Terah lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.26">Gn 11:26</a>). Stephen reports in the NT, however, that Abram left Haran after the death of his father, at which time Abram was 75 years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.4">Gn 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.4">Acts 7:4</a>). Terah died at the age of 205 (v <a href="?bref=Gen.11.32">Gn 11:32</a>), which suggests that Terah was at least 130 when Abram was born. Terah initiated the trip to Canaan, though he failed to go beyond Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31-32">Gn 11:31-32</a>). Abram was commanded there to leave his family and proceed to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1">12:1</a>).</p>
