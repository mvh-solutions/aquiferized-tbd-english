<p class="h1">THEBEZ</p>
<p class="fl">City where Abimelech was killed when “a certain woman” dropped a millstone on him (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.50">Jgs 9:50</a>). Abimelech had attacked Thebez after burning down the Tower of Shechem but had failed to capture the fortress within the city. After being critically injured by the millstone, Abimelech ordered his armor bearer to kill him lest it be said that he had been killed by a woman. Thebez was located about 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) northeast of Shechem, traditionally identified with modern Tubas.</p>
