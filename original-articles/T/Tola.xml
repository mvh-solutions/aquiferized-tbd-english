<p class="h1">TOLA</p>
<p class="list">1. One of the four sons of Issachar named among the 66 descendants of Jacob who accompanied him in the migration to Egypt to join Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.13">Gn 46:13</a>); and the ancestor of the first of four families of the tribe of Issachar, as identified in the census of Israel undertaken by Moses and Eleazar (<a href="?bref=Num.26.23">Nm 26:23</a>). Tola’s sons were Uzzi, Rephaiah, Jeriel, Jahmai, Ibsam, and Shemuel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.2">1 Chr 7:2</a>). The Israelite clan of the Tolaites took its name from him (<a href="?bref=Num.26.23">Nm 26:23</a>), and during the time of David the warriors of his family numbered 22,600 men (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.1-2">1 Chr 7:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the judges of Israel, the son of Puah and the grandson of Dodo (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.1">Jgs 10:1</a>), of Issachar’s tribe. Shamir, his home and burial place, was in the hill country of Ephraim. There he judged Israel for 23 years.</p>
<p class="list-text">Although he “delivered” Israel after the debacle of Abimelech’s abortive attempt to establish a monarchy at Shechem, his accomplishment is covered in just two verses (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.1-2">Jgs 10:1-2</a>). Like other “minor judges,” mentioned only briefly (e.g., <a href="?bref=Judg.12.8-15">12:8-15</a>), he actually functioned in the judicial role—some more prominent “judges” (e.g., Gideon and Jephthah) were first, and perhaps solely, military heroes.</p>
