<p class="h1">TEST</p>
<p class="fl">The process of proving one’s worth. When ascribed to God in his dealings with people, it means that God tests his peoples’ faith and moral character. When the word is used in a negative way, it means “to tempt”—that is, to entice, solicit, or provoke to sin. Both senses of the word could be applied to Jesus’ forty days of trial in the wilderness. He was tested by God and found faithful, while he was tempted by Satan and found sinless. The Spirit of God led Jesus into the wilderness to have his faith tried; but the agent in this trial was the wicked one, whose whole object was to seduce Jesus from his allegiance to God. It was temptation in the bad sense of the term. Yet Jesus did not give in to temptation; he passed the test (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">Heb 7:26</a>).</p>
