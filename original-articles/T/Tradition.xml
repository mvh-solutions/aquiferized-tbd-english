<p class="h1">TRADITION</p>
<p class="fl">Respect for tradition was particularly strong among Jews during the period at the beginning of the Christian era. Among these traditions, the most important collection was <span class="ital">Pirke Aboth</span> (Traditions of the Fathers). This consisted of comments by famous rabbis in explanation of the written Law. This and a growing collection of other rabbinic traditions interpreting the Law became an authoritative commentary on the written code. This collection was esteemed to be equal to the written Law.</p>
<p>The Pharisees used the expression “tradition of the elders” when speaking to Jesus about hand washing (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.2">Mt 15:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.5">Mk 7:5</a>). In his response, Jesus referred to the “traditions of men,” thus drawing attention to their human origin. In fact, in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.8">Mark 7:8</a>, he definitely set the commandment of God over these traditions, which had become a burden to the people. Jesus strongly criticized the scribes and Pharisees for the way these traditions were enforced (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-39">Mt 23</a>). He noted that adherence to the tradition had become more important than the moral and personal effect of the teaching.</p>
