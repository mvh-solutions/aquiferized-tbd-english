<p class="h1">TEL-ABIB</p>
<p class="fl">Village on the river Kebar where Ezekiel visited the Babylonian exiles (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.15">Ez 3:15</a>). Although the exact location of the site is unknown, it was probably in the delta region of southern Babylonia. The Kebar was likely an irrigation canal that enhanced the fertility of the surrounding soil; hence, the name Tel-abib (“hill of corn”).</p>
