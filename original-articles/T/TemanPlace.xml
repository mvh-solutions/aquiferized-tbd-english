<p class="h1">TEMAN (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the prophetic writings, Teman seems to have been considered the principal city of Edom and is often used as a poetic parallel for the entire land of Edom (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.7,20">Jer 49:7, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.12">Am 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.9">Ob 1:9</a>). Since Teman means “south,” it is likely that Teman was located in the far south of Edom; however, its precise location remains unknown. The residents of Teman were evidently well known for their wisdom (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.7">Jer 49:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.9">Ob 1:9</a>). This reputation may well derive from Eliphaz the Temanite, who was one of Job’s counselors (<a href="?bref=Job.2.11,4">Jb 2:11, 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.15.1">15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.22.1">22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.42.7-9">42:7-9</a>).</p>
