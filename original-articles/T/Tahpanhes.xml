<p class="h1">TAHPANHES</p>
<p class="fl">Important Egyptian center in the eastern Delta. Listed with Memphis among Israel’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.16">Jer 2:16</a>), it is the place to which Jews fled after the murder of Gedaliah in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> when Jeremiah was taken to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.7-9">43:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.1">44:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.14">46:14</a>). Ezekiel prophesied doom against this city (alternately spelled Tehaphnehes in <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.18">Ez 30:18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Today the site is identified with Tell Dephneh (Defenneh), 26 miles (41.8 kilometers) southwest of Port Said. There is little evidence of occupation here before the time of Psammetichus I (664–610 <span class="era">BC</span>), who established a fortress at the site and left a garrison of Greek mercenaries. Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, where Jeremiah buried stones as a promise of Nebuchadnezzar’s invasion (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.9">Jer 43:9</a>), has been identified with the fortress of Psammetichus. A fragmentary Neo-Babylonian text of the 37th year of Nebuchadnezzar refers to operations against Pharaoh Amasis and a Greek garrison.</p>
