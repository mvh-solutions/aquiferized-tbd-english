<p class="h1">TAPPUAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. One of 14 cities located in the Shephelah assigned to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance, mentioned between En-gannim and Enam (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.34">Jos 15:34</a>). This locality is not to be mistaken for the land of Tappuah in Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.8">17:8</a>) or the town of Beth-tappuah at Hebron (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.53">15:53</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BethTappuah_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Beth-tappuah</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. City situated in the hill country of Palestine defining part of the northern boundary of the territory allotted to Ephraim’s tribe for an inheritance. From Tappuah the northern border ran westward to Kanah Brook, then followed its course to the Mediterranean Sea (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.8">Jos 16:8</a>). The land of Tappuah was a district within the territory given to the tribe of Manasseh; however, the city of Tappuah, located on the border of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.8">17:8</a>).</p>
