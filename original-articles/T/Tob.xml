<p class="h1">TOB</p>
<p class="fl">Place where Jephthah fled after his half brothers threw him out for being illegitimate (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.3-5">Jgs 11:3-5</a>). During the reign of David, the Ammonites hired 12,000 men from Tob as mercenaries to fight against David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.6-8">2Â Sm 10:6-8</a>). It is probably the same as the Aramite kingdom named Tob, which was located in the desert east or northeast of Gilead. During the Maccabean period, a Jewish colony was located in Tob.</p>
