<p class="h1">TYCHICUS</p>
<p class="fl">One of the believers who accompanied Paul in his trip to collect and deliver the offering for the Jerusalem church (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>). Since he is often mentioned with Trophimus of Ephesus, Tychicus was likely also a native of that city. He served as the courier for Paul’s letter to Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.21">Eph 6:21</a>) as well as Paul’s letters to Philemon and the Colossians (<a href="?bref=Col.4.7">Col 4:7</a>). Most believe that he was also one of the two Christians (with Trophimus) who accompanied Titus in the delivery of 2 Corinthians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.16-24">2 Cor 8:16-24</a>). Paul mentioned Tychicus twice in his later letters, first sending him to Crete to be with Titus (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">Ti 3:12</a>), and later mentioning to Timothy that he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.12">2 Tm 4:12</a>). Evidently, Tychicus and Paul were close friends as well as coworkers, since Paul frequently referred to Tychicus as a “beloved brother.”</p>
