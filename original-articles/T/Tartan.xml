<p class="fl">Title of the highest-ranking Assyrian official, second in command only to the king. The tartan was the commander in chief of the Assyrian army. The position is mentioned in two OT passages: (1) Sargon II, king of Assyria (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>), ordered his commander to subdue and capture the Philistine city of Ashdod (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.1">Is 20:1</a>). (2) In <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.17">2 Kings 8:17</a> the tartan was one of three officials whom King Sennacherib of Assyria (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) posted over the Assyrian army sent from Lachish to Jerusalem to confront King Hezekiah of Judah (715–687 <span class="era">BC</span>). </p>
