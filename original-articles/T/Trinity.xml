<p class="h1">TRINITY*</p>
<p class="fl">Term designating the three members of the triune God: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The word “Trinity” does not appear in the Bible; it was created by scholars to describe the three members of the Godhead. Throughout the Bible, God is presented as being Father, Son, and Spirit—not three “gods” but three personas of the one and only God (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Mt 28:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.23-24">1 Cor 16:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.13">2 Cor 13:13</a>). The Scriptures present the Father as the source of creation, the giver of life, and God of all the universe (see <a href="?bref=John.5.26">Jn 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.6">1 Cor 8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.14-15">Eph 3:14-15</a>). The Son is depicted as the image of the invisible God, the exact representation of his being and nature, and the Messiah-Redeemer (see <a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-6">Phil 2:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.14-16">Col 1:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-3">Heb 1:1-3</a>). The Spirit is God in action, God reaching people—influencing them, regenerating them, infilling them, and guiding them (see <a href="?bref=John.14.26">Jn 14:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6">Gal 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.18">Eph 2:18</a>). All three are a tri-unity, inhabiting one another and working together to accomplish the divine design in the universe (see <a href="?bref=John.16.13-15">Jn 16:13-15</a>).</p>
