<p class="h1">TROGYLLIUM*</p>
<p class="fl">Rocky straits between Samos and Miletus. In <a href="?bref=Acts.20.15">Acts 20:15</a>, some manuscripts indicate that Paul’s ship stopped at this place on his trip to Jerusalem near the end of his third missionary journey. Since Trogyllium is a promontory jutting out into the sea between Samos and Miletus, it is not unlikely for the sailing vessel to have landed there for the evening. However, most textual critics consider the phrase “after remaining at Trogyllium” (see Textus Receptus and <span class="sc">kjv</span>) to be a later insertion into the text.</p>
