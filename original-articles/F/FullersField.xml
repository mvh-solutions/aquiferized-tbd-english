<p class="h1">FULLER’S FIELD*</p>
<p class="fl">Place outside Jerusalem that was linked to a spring or pool by a causeway or aqueduct (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17">2 Kgs 18:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Is 7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.2">36:2</a>). It has been generally identified with an area near En-rogel (“spring of the fuller”). The spring was south of Jerusalem in the Kidron Valley. It was originally the tribal boundary between Judah and Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.7">Jos 15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>). When Absalom rebelled and King David fled from Jerusalem, two of David’s men stayed at En-rogel to gather information about the rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.17">2 Sm 17:17</a>).</p>
<p>En-rogel has been identified with the modern Bir Attub, or “Job’s Well,” on the left bank of Wadi en-Nar. The well sinks deep into the rock, reaches an underground stream, and gushes forth following rainfalls.</p>
