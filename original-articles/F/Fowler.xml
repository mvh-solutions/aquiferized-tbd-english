<p class="h1">FOWLER*</p>
<p class="fl">One who traps or shoots wild birds. The catching of birds for pets, food, and sacrifices was the business of the fowler. This was done by the use of a bow and arrow, a sling, or a net (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.17">Prv 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.13">Ez 12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.20">17:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.7.12">Hos 7:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.8">9:8</a>). Other methods included the use of bird lime, a sticky substance to which birds adhere, and a throw stick that broke the birds’ legs. Fowlers lay in wait near their trap, placing the captured birds in a basket (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.26-27">Jer 5:26-27</a>). The term “fowler” appears also as a metaphor for wicked men who trap other men (<a href="?bref=Ps.91.3">Pss 91:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.124.7">124:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.5.26">Jer 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.8">Hos 9:8</a>).</p>
