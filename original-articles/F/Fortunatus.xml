<p class="h1">FORTUNATUS</p>
<p class="fl">Member of the church at Corinth. Fortunatus is a Roman proper name written in Greek and found only once in the NT (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.17">1 Cor 16:17</a>). Paul rejoiced that he, along with Stephanas and Achaicus, had come to be with him in Ephesus. The Textus Receptus has a subscript naming these three men as the carriers of Paul’s letter to the Corinthians.</p>
