<p class="h1">FISH GATE</p>
<p class="fl">Gate probably located in the north wall of the city of Jerusalem. The Fish Gate was built in David’s time and later formed part of Manasseh’s fortifications (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.14">2 Chr 33:14</a>). After the Babylonian exile, it was restored under Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.3">Neh 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.39">12:39</a>); it is mentioned along with the Mishneh or Second Quarter (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.10">Zep 1:10</a>). The gate was probably so named either because fish were brought into the city from the north, or because it was located near the city’s fish market.</p>
