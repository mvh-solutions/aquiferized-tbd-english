<p class="h1">FOUNDATION GATE</p>
<p class="fl">Structure mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Chr.23.5">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>, in the narrative about Queen Athaliah’s execution. The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.6">2 Kings 11:6</a> reads “Sur Gate,” while the Septuagint has “gate of the ways,” indicating some difficulties within the Hebrew text.</p>
