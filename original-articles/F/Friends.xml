<p class="h1">FRIENDS</p>
<p class="fl">Term used to indicate close acquaintances. Since Jesus called his disciples friends (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.4">Lk 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.14-15">Jn 15:14-15</a>), it would have been natural for Christians to refer to themselves as “the friends of Christ,” especially since such terminology was used for members of philosophical groups in the Greek world. But no such terminology emerged.</p>
