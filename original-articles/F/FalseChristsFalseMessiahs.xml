<p class="h1">FALSE CHRISTS*, FALSE MESSIAHS</p>
<p class="fl">Those who falsely claim to be the Christ or Messiah. False christs are mentioned only in the eschatological discourse of Jesus recorded by Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.24">24:24</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.22">13:22</a>).</p>
<p>In that discourse Jesus instructed his disciples about the future. He prophesied the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem and warned about the deception and persecution that would confront the disciples. He especially warned his disciples that during the terrible days surrounding the destruction of the temple they were not to be deceived by false christs and false prophets (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.21-23">Mk 13:21-23</a>). In this particular form of deception, some would claim that the Christ was in a particular location (v <a href="?bref=Mark.13.21">21</a>). Those deceivers would perform signs and wonders to try to deceive the elect. But Jesus prepared his disciples by instructing them that there will be cosmic signs preceding his return as the Son of Man (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.13.24-25">24-25</a>) and that his coming will be with great power and glory visible to all.</p>
<p>From history we know that Jesus’ instruction enabled Christians to flee the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, and to withstand the deception of false christs. The church still awaits Jesus’ return as the glorious Son of Man.</p>
