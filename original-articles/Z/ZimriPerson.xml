<p class="h1">ZIMRI (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Clan chief of Simeon’s tribe who was killed by Phinehas for consorting with a Midianite woman at Peor (<a href="?bref=Num.25.14">Nm 25:14</a>). Zimri’s sin was magnified by the fact that he did it openly, that he was a leader within his tribe, and that the woman was the daughter of an important Midianite prince.</p>
<p class="list">2. King of Israel for seven days (885 <span class="era">BC</span>) following his assassination of Elah and the rest of the family of Baasha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.9-12">1 Kgs 16:9-12</a>). Zimri, commander of half of the chariot forces, failed to gain the support of the people, who supported Omri, the commander of the army. When Omri marched against Zimri at Tirzah, Zimri committed suicide by burning his palace down (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.15-18">16:15-18</a>). The cruelty of Zimri’s coup is reflected in Jezebel’s later taunt against Jehu, when she compared his duplicity to that of Zimri (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.31">2 Kgs 9:31</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. One of the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah by Tamar (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.6">1 Chr 2:6</a>); alternately called Zabdi in the parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1,17">Joshua 7:1, 17</a>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Zabdi_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Zabdi #1</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. Descendant of Saul from Benjamin’s tribe, listed as the son of Jehoaddah and the father of Moza (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.36">1 Chr 8:36</a>). He is likely the same as Zimri the son of Jadah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.42">9:42</a>).</p>
