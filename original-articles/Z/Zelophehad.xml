<p class="h1">ZELOPHEHAD</p>
<p class="fl">Hepher’s son from Manasseh’s tribe. He fathered five daughters but no sons (<a href="?bref=Num.26.33">Nm 26:33</a>). Because Zelophehad had no sons, his daughters petitioned Moses to give them their father’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Num.27.1">27:1</a>). Moses’ subsequent ruling provided that daughters should receive the inheritance in such cases, providing that they marry within their tribe so that the tribal allotments would remain constant (<a href="?bref=Num.27.7">Nm 27:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.36.2">36:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.3">Jos 17:3</a>).</p>
