<p class="list">1. Midianite prince who was the father of Cozbi, the Midianite woman who was killed by Phinehas for consorting with Zimri after the incident at Baal-peor (<a href="?bref=Num.25.15">Nm 25:15</a>). He was one of the five “kings” of Midian who (with Balaam) were later killed by the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Num.31.8">31:8</a>). Apparently, he was a vassal of the Amorite king Sihon, since he is listed as one of his “princes” (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.21">Jos 13:21</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Jeiel, the founder of Gibeon (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.30">1 Chr 8:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.36">9:36</a>). He was a Benjaminite and a distant relative of Saul.</p>
