<p class="h1">ZUZIM*, ZUZITES</p>
<p class="fl">One of the kingdoms attacked and defeated by Kedorlaomer’s confederation (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>), mentioned as residents of Ham. They were likely located somewhere north of the Arnon River, since the general path of Kedorlaomer was from north to south along the King’s Highway. Possibly these Zuzites are associated with the Zamzummites of <a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>, since both are linked to the same geographical proximity. Furthermore, both passages speak of them in connection with races of giants, including the Horites, the Emim, and the Rephaim.</p>
