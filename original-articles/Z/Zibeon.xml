<p class="h1">ZIBEON</p>
<p class="fl">Ancestor of Oholibamah, the Canaanite wife of Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.2,14">Gn 36:2, 14</a>). He is listed as a Hivite in <a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">Genesis 36:2</a> but is probably the same as Zibeon the son of Seir the Horite (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.20,29">Gn 36:20, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.38">1 Chr 1:38</a>). Possibly “Hivite” designated his tribal affiliation, while “Horite” indicated the fact that he dwelt in caves. It is also possible that “Hivite” is a transmission error in <a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">Genesis 36:2</a>.</p>
