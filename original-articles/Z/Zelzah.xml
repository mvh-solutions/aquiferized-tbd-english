<p class="h1">ZELZAH</p>
<p class="fl">Place near Rachel’s tomb where Saul met two men in fulfillment of Samuel’s prophecy concerning the events that would confirm Saul’s anointing (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.2">1 Sm 10:2</a>). Rachel’s tomb is traditionally located at the northern border of Benjamin, but no precise identification of Zelzah has been made. Some have argued that Zelzah and Zela are the same place, but this is unlikely.</p>
