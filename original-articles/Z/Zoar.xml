<p class="h1">ZOAR</p>
<p class="fl">One of the “cities of the plain” confederate with Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.2,8">Gn 14:2, 8</a>). Zoar, also known by its earlier name Bela, is best known as the town that served as a temporary refuge for Lot and his daughters during the destruction of Sodom and the other cities of the plain (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.22-23,30">19:22-23, 30</a>). Despite the fact that Zoar was evidently a small town (v <a href="?bref=Gen.19.22">22</a>; Zoar means “little”), this place was evidently considered a significant geographical landmark in ancient times. When Abraham and Lot divided the land, Lot selected the land close to Zoar (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.10">13:10</a>). When Moses surveyed the Promised Land from Mt Pisgah, Zoar was reckoned as the southern terminus of the plain of the valley of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.3">Dt 34:3</a>). During the prophetic period, Zoar was evidently considered to be on the southern boundary of Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.5">Is 15:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.4,34">Jer 48:4, 34</a>).</p>
