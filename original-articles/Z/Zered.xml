<p class="h1">ZERED</p>
<p class="fl">Valley and brook by which the Israelites encamped, listed between Iye-abarim and a stopping place near the Arnon River to the north (<a href="?bref=Num.21.12">Nm 21:12</a>). Though its exact location remains in question, Zered is probably identifiable with the modern Wadi el-Hesa, a streambed that formed a natural border between the ancient countries of Moab and Edom and, following a northwestward course, emptied into the southern end of the Dead Sea. The crossing of the Zered Brook by the Israelites marked 38 years since Israel rebelled against God at Kadesh-barnea (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.13-14">Dt 2:13-14</a>).</p>
