<p class="h1">ZEBUL</p>
<p class="fl">Ruler of Shechem who served as an officer of Abimelech (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.28-30">Jgs 9:28-30</a>). Zebul apparently obtained his position when Abimelech was crowned king at Shechem. When Gaal the son of Ebed incited the Shechemites to rebel against Abimelech, Zebul played an instrumental role in Abimelech’s victory. After he goaded Gaal into attacking Abimelech outside of the city, Zebul shut Gaal out of the city, preventing retreat into its confines. It is difficult to determine Zebul’s fate when Abimelech later attacked and destroyed the city, but it is possible that he too met a treacherous fate.</p>
