<p class="fl">One of Jacob’s 12 sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.23">Gn 35:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1">1 Chr 2:1</a>). He was the sixth and last son borne to Jacob by Leah, who named the boy Zebulun, meaning “abode, dwelling,” for she said, “Now my husband will <span class="ital">dwell with</span> me, because I have borne him six sons” (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.20">Gn 30:20</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, emphasis added). Later, he settled his family in Egypt with Jacob and his brothers (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.3">Ex 1:3</a>). Jacob foretold that Zebulun’s descendants would become a maritime people with their border touching Sidon (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.13">Gn 49:13</a>). Though Zebulun’s tribe was separated from the Mediterranean by Asher’s tribe and from the Sea of Galilee by Naphtali, it prospered greatly in trade with the Canaanite cities of the coastal plains. Zebulun fathered three sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.14">Gn 46:14</a>) and founded one of Israel’s 12 tribes (<a href="?bref=Num.1.30-31">Nm 1:30-31</a>).</p>
