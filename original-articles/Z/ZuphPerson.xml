<p class="h1">ZUPH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ancestor of Elkanah, the father of the prophet Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1 Sm 1:1</a>). Zuph was a member of the Kohathite branch of Levites and is listed as the son of Elkanah (different than above) and the father of Toah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.35">1 Chr 6:35</a>). He is the same as Zophai listed in <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.26">1 Chronicles 6:26</a>. It is evident that Zuph was a Levite, even though he is listed as an Ephraimite in the 1 Samuel passage.</p>
