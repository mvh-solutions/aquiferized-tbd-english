<p class="h1">PATARA</p>
<p class="fl">Seaport of the ancient region of Lycia, now located in modern Turkey. The ancient city, one of the largest and most prosperous of the region, was a center of trade and commerce. A temple to Apollo stood in Patara. Remains of a theater and baths can still be seen there. Prevailing winds made Patara a convenient place for ships to begin their voyages to the eastern Mediterranean. The apostle Paul changed ships at Patara on his final journey to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.1-2">Acts 21:1-2</a>).</p>
