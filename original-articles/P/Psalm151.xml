<p class="h1">PSALM 151*</p>
<p class="fl">A noncanonical psalm that, prior to the Qumran discoveries, was known only through ancient translations (LXX, Latin, and Syriac). At Qumran the psalm was included in the Hebrew Psalm Scroll (11Q). The Hebrew text indicates two separate poems. The first poem (designated as 151A) is a commentary on <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-13">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>. It relates how David was set over his father’s flocks but was made king over God’s people after God had looked upon his heart. The second poem (151B) is a commentary on <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Samuel 17</a> and deals with David and Goliath. It is thought by some to show the bravery of David in contrast to his humility, as is shown in 151A.</p>
