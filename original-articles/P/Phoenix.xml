<p class="h1">PHOENIX</p>
<p class="fl">Harbor town on the southern coast of Crete, where Paul and his shipmates hoped to spend the winter during their voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.12">Acts 27:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Phenice”). Phoenix was situated west of Fair Havens near the island of Cauda. Against Paul’s better judgment, the ship was ordered to leave the bay of Fair Havens and sail westward to Phoenix. While en route to this harbor town, the ship was struck by a powerful gale from the northeast. This wind drove the ship southwest past the island of Cauda and threatened to push it across the Mediterranean Sea into the treacherous north African shoals of Syrtis Major (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.9-17">9-17</a>).</p>

<p>Luke’s description of Phoenix as facing northwest and southwest (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.12">Acts 27:12</a>) suggests that this place was the same as the modern Phoinika, a town on the western edge of Cape Mouros. In antiquity, this deep harbor was apparently accessible to ships and afforded protection from the winter winds. The name Phoenix is retained in Phoinika.</p>
