<p class="h1">PHILEMON (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Christian known only from the letter addressed to him by the apostle Paul. He is mentioned nowhere else in the NT. From <a href="?bref=Col.4.17">Colossians 4:17</a> it is clear that Archippus, mentioned along with Philemon in <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.2">Philemon 1:2</a> (and perhaps his son), was a man of Colosse. Although Paul had never visited that city (<a href="?bref=Col.2.1">Col 2:1</a>), he obviously knew Philemon well. He addressed him as “our beloved co-worker” (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1">Phlm 1:1</a>); perhaps Philemon had been a colleague during Paul’s three-year mission in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.8-10">Acts 19:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.31">20:31</a>), and Paul knew that he could appeal to him on behalf of his runaway slave, Onesimus.</p>
