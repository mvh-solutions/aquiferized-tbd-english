<p class="h1">PAVEMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Term occurring ten times in the Bible, usually alluding to the stone floor of the temple(s). Particular interest focuses on the reference in <a href="?bref=John.19.13">John 19:13</a> to the pavement on which Jesus stood trial before Pilate. It was at the decisive moment of the Roman phase of the trial of Jesus when “Pilate had Jesus brought out, and seated himself on the chair of judgement at a place called the Pavement, in Hebrew Gabbatha” (<a href="?bref=John.19.13">Jn 19:13</a>, <span class="sc">njb</span>). This verse has played an important role in determining the location of Jesus’ trial. Until recently scholars located this pavement where Pilate’s judgment seat was placed under the present street level in Jerusalem at the site of Herod’s fortress Antonia. This enormous stone pavement consists of large blocks of limestone, excavated in the 1930s by Père Vincent. Today, scholars disagree about whether this is the most historically plausible site for the pavement where Jesus was condemned.</p>
