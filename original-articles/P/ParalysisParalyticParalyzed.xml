<p class="h1">PARALYSIS*, PARALYTIC*, PARALYZED</p>
<p class="fl">Symptom of an organic disease of the central nervous system affecting the temporary or permanent loss of sensation and/or voluntary muscle control. This degenerative condition was usually incurable. A few cases of paralysis (palsy) are mentioned in the NT, all of which occur in connection with Christ’s healing ministry.</p>
<p>Paralytics were included in the group of ailing people seeking Jesus’ healing in Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.24">Mt 4:24</a>), numbered among the sick at Bethesda in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=John.5.3">Jn 5:3</a>), and represented among those cured by Philip in Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.7">Acts 8:7</a>). The paralyzed servant of the centurion was described by Luke as very sick and at the point of death (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.2">Lk 7:2</a>). This man was probably victimized by an often fatal form of paralysis that begins in the legs and spreads rapidly upward through the rest of the body. The paralytic at Capernaum was most likely ailing from paraplegia, a paralysis of the lower half of the body (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.2,6">Mt 9:2, 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.3-10">Mk 2:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.18,24">Lk 5:18, 24</a>). This disease may have been brought on by an injury at birth or by damage to the spinal cord. Perhaps Aeneas, whom Peter healed at Lydda, also suffered from paraplegia (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.33">Acts 9:33</a>).</p>
