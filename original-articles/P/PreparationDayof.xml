<p class="fl">Term used in Scripture for the day before the Sabbath. Each of the Gospels refers to a day that it calls “the Preparation” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.62">Mt 27:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.42">Mk 15:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.54">Lk 23:54</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.14,31,42">Jn 19:14, 31, 42</a>), Mark calling it “the day before the Sabbath.” The Jews did not have specific names for the days (preferring to speak of “the first [second, etc.] day of the week.” But the Sabbath was distinctive, and the previous day was used to prepare for this weekly day of rest and worship. Thus, what we call “Friday” the Jews called “Preparation.” What was “prepared” is not said. But as no work could be done on the Sabbath, preparations had to be made for food and other necessities.</p>
<p>“The Preparation of the Passover” (<a href="?bref=John.19.14">Jn 19:14</a>) is often understood to mean “Passover eve,” the day before Passover, just as “the Preparation” means the day before the Sabbath. There appears, however, to be no specific extrabiblical examples of the day before Passover being called “the Preparation” or “the Preparation of the Passover.”</p>
