<p class="h1">POTIPHERA</p>
<p class="fl">Priest of On whose daughter, Asenath, was given to Joseph as his wife by Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.45,50">Gn 41:45, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.46.20">46:20</a>). On (or Heliopolis) was the center of the sun-god cult, and Potiphera was likely a high-ranking priest in the cult. His name, which means “he whom Re [the son god] has given,” does not appear in Egyptian records until the tenth century <span class="era">BC</span>, a fact employed by those who prefer a late date for the book of Genesis. Yet the name is known from the 15th century (the time of Moses), and its full form may be a modernization of a name common in Joseph’s era (20th century <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
