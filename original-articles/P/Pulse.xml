<p class="fl">KJV translation of a Hebrew word perhaps better rendered as “vegetable” (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.12,16">Dn 1:12, 16</a>). Not wishing to defile themselves with the king’s food, Daniel and his friends requested permission to live on a diet of vegetables and water. The Hebrew word translated as “vegetable” literally refers to “things sown” and probably includes any kind of edible seed. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Plants_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Plants</a>.</p>
