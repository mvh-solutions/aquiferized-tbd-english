<p class="fl">OT phrase also known by its Hebrew transliteration, <span class="hebrew">‘Am-Ha’arets</span><span class="ital">.</span> In a generic sense, <span class="hebrew">‘Am-Ha’arets</span> referred to a political or ethnic group of people, such as the Hittite sons of Heth (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.7">Gn 23:7</a>), the Egyptians (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.6">42:6</a>), the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.5">Ex 5:5</a>), the nations of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.28">Nm 13:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.24">Neh 9:24</a>), and the Ammonites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.34">Nm 21:34</a>). With the expansion of Israel as a nation, this expression was used to define the general class of people who were not part of the upper religious and political levels of society (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.14-20">2 Kgs 11:14-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.3">25:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.25">2 Chr 33:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.25">Jer 52:25</a>). During the postexilic period, the mixed race of Jews who had intermarried with heathen peoples were called the people of the land and mostly shunned by Ezra and his followers (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.4">Ezr 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.2,11">10:2, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.10.28-31">Neh 10:28-31</a>). Later, rabbinic Judaism labeled the Jewish people who were unwilling or unable to observe the whole law as <span class="hebrew">‘Am-Ha’arets</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
