<p class="h1">PAVILION*</p>
<p class="fl">A translation of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">sukkah</span> and <span class="hebrew">sokoh</span> in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">sukkah</span> is also translated as “booth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.17">Gn 33:17</a>), “tabernacle” (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.34">Lv 23:34</a>), and “tent” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.11">2 Sm 11:11</a>). Other translations of <span class="hebrew">sokoh</span> are “den” (<a href="?bref=Ps.10.9">Ps 10:9</a>), “tabernacle” (<a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">76:2</a>), and “covert” (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.38">Jer 25:38</a>). The words <span class="hebrew">sukkah</span> and <span class="hebrew">sokoh</span> signify a shelter or covering, which may be in the form of a tent (booth or tabernacle), hut, or den.</p>
<p>The word “pavilion” is used to refer to the tents of Ben-hadad’s royal entourage and allies as they were in a drunken stupor when Ahab attacked them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.16">1 Kgs 20:16</a>). Other versions read “booths” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), “temporary shelters” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>); “quarters” (<span class="sc">neb</span>), and “tents” (<span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The metaphorical use is found in the book of Psalms. In <a href="?bref=Ps.27.5">Psalms 27:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.31.20">31:20</a> the psalmist speaks of the Lord’s special protection as a place where one may find refuge from the evildoers. The word may also refer to the clouds that, in the pictorial language of the psalmist, cover the presence of the Lord, “He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—the dark rain clouds of the sky” (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.11">Ps 18:11</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
