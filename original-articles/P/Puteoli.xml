<p class="fl">Italian seaport town on the Bay of Naples. It was a normal stopping place for seafaring travelers and cargo going to Rome. Paul, following his landing at Rhegium, resided with Christians in Puteoli for seven days before he was taken to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.13">Acts 28:13</a>). The modern city is called Pozzuoli.</p>
