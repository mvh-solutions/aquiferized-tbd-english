<p class="h1">PROCONSUL*</p>
<p class="fl">Governor (<span class="sc">nlt</span>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “deputy”) appointed by the senate of Rome to govern a province. From the time of Augustus, the Roman senate appointed governors to administer certain of the Roman senatorial provinces, provinces considered secure enough that no army was kept in them. Proconsuls were appointed for the period of one year between a time when they were <span class="ital">praetor</span> and the time when they became consul of Rome. They are to be distinguished from procurators, who were appointed by the emperor to rule imperial provinces for an indefinite period. We meet two proconsuls in the book of Acts: Sergius Paulus of Cyprus (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.7-12">Acts 13:7-12</a>) and Gallio of Achaia (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">18:12-17</a>).</p>
