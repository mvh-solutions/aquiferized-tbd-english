<p class="h1">PAPIAS*</p>
<p class="fl">Early church leader of Hierapolis; chronicler of early Christianity. The information we have about Papias (<span class="era">AD</span> 60–130) and his work was given by Eusebius of Caesarea and Irenaeus of Lyons. Irenaeus stated that Papias had heard the apostle John preach and also knew Polycarp. Eusebius mentioned his <span class="ital">Explanation of the Sayings of the Lord.</span> In the preface to this work Papias maintains that his primary purpose was to bring forth a truthful record of a collection of the words and deeds of the apostles that were told to him by a presbyter. Irenaeus understood him to be alluding to the apostle John, but Eusebius contended that he referred to two Johns, one who was the apostle and the other who was the companion of Aristion.</p>
<p>Papias claimed that Mark, the Evangelist, who had never heard Christ, was the interpreter of Peter, and that he carefully gave an account of everything he remembered from the preaching of Peter. The statement that Matthew wrote down sayings of Jesus in Hebrew was affirmed by Papias. Irenaeus understood this as a reference to Hebraisms in Matthew’s Gospel, whereas Origen took this to mean that Matthew originally wrote his Gospel in Hebrew.</p>
<p>The statements of Papias have raised many questions concerning (1) the formation of the Gospels, (2) a possible Hebrew (Aramaic) version of Matthew, and (3) the possibility and identity of two Johns. According to tradition, Papias died a martyr.</p>
