<p class="h1">PEOPLE OF THE EAST*</p>
<p class="fl">Tribes located east and northeast of Canaan, many of them overtly hostile to the Jews. <a href="?bref=Gen.29.1">Genesis 29:1</a> provides the first reference to these peoples. Jacob, en route to Haran, crossed through territory designated as “the land of the people of the east.”</p>
<p>The comprehensiveness of the term is evident in the way it is used to refer to nomads (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.10">Ez 25:10</a>) or Mesopotamians (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.30">1 Kgs 4:30</a>). The term also occurs in association with specific tribes, such as the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.3">Jgs 6:3</a>), Ammonites (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.4">Ez 25:4</a>), Edomites (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.14">Is 11:14</a>), Kedarites (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.28">Jer 49:28</a>), Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.33">Jgs 6:33</a>), and Moabites (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.10">Ez 25:10</a>).</p>
<p>The most distinguished OT personality linked to the term is the patriarch Job, who is called the greatest man among all the people of the east (<a href="?bref=Job.1.3">Jb 1:3</a>). Job’s homeland, the land of Uz, was probably in the vicinity of Edom to the southeast of the Dead Sea.</p>
