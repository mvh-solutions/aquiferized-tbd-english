<p class="list">1. Mountain east of the Jordan and north of the Dead Sea where Balak led Balaam in a final effort to evoke a curse on Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.23.28">Nm 23:28</a>). The camp of Israel at Shittim was visible from the site (<a href="?bref=Num.24.2">24:2</a>). There Israel initiated a sexual orgy with the Moabite women, and worshiped Baal (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-13">25:1-13</a>). The exact location of the mountain is not certain, though Eusebius and Jerome place it opposite Jericho on the way to Heshbon. It is thus believed to be near Mt Nebo in the Abarim range.</p>
<p class="list">2. Place cited in the Septuagint in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.59">Joshua 15:59</a>, but not in Hebrew manuscripts. It is identified as the modern Khirbet Faghur, southwest of Bethlehem.</p>
