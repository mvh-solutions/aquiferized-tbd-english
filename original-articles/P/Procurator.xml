<p class="h1">PROCURATOR*</p>
<p class="fl">Financial officer of Rome (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “governor”), usually from the equestrian rank, whose responsibilities included the supervision and collection of imperial revenues in an assigned province. In Judea and other lesser provinces of the Roman Empire, the procurator acted at times as the governor of that region. He not only managed financial affairs but also exercised judicial and military authority, and he was primarily responsible for keeping peace in his jurisdiction. The NT mentions three Roman procurators: Pontius Pilate (<span class="era">AD</span> 26–36; Mt 27; <a href="?bref=John.18.1-19.42">Jn 18–19</a>), Antonius Felix (<span class="era">AD</span> 52–59; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.24-25.14">Acts 23:24–25:14</a>), and Porcius Festus (<span class="era">AD</span> 59–62; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.27-26.32">Acts 24:27–26:32</a>). These administrators were held accountable and subordinate to the governor of Syria.</p>
