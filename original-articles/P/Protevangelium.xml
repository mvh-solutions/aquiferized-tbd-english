<p class="h1">PROTEVANGELIUM*</p>
<p class="fl">The word means first <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">protos</span><span class="ital">)</span> gospel <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">evangelion</span><span class="ital">).</span> Theologians have used the word in reference to the message of redemption God spoke after the fall of man. Speaking to Satan (embodied in a serpent), God said, “From now on, you and the woman will be enemies, and your offspring and her offspring will be enemies. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In the protevangelium we have the protorevelation of the humanity (her offspring) and the divinity (crushing the head of serpent) of the great Deliverer. In this proclamation, God promises a Deliverer who will destroy Satan in an ordeal in which he himself will suffer. This refers to Jesus’ death on the cross. In suffering that death, Jesus defeated him who had the power of death, the devil (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.14">Heb 2:14</a>).</p>
