<p class="h1">PEREZ, PEREZITE</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Judah whose name is derived from a Hebrew word meaning “he who bursts forth”; his name refers to the manner in which he unexpectedly came first from Tamar’s womb before his twin brother, Zerah (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.29">Gn 38:29</a>). He fathered two sons, Hezron and Hamul, and became the ancestral head of the Perezite family (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.12">Gn 46:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.20-21">Nm 26:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.4-5">1 Chr 2:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.1">4:1</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> and the Apocrypha translate the name variously as Pharez, Phares, and Pharzite.</p>
<p>Through the descent of his son Hezron, he became the ancestor of David and Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ru 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.3">Mt 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.33">Lk 3:33</a>). The esteem this clan enjoyed in the tribe of Judah is evidenced by the blessing pronounced upon it by the men of Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.12">Ru 4:12</a>). A descendant named Jashobeam commanded David’s captains for the first month of each year (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.2-3">1 Chr 27:2-3</a>). Upon the return from captivity in Babylon, 468 Perezites were chosen to live in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.4">1 Chr 9:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.4-6">Neh 11:4-6</a>).</p>
