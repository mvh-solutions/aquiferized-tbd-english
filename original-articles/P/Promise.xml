<p class="h1">PROMISE</p>
<p class="fl">Declaration by one person to another that something will or will not be done, giving the person to whom it is made the right to expect the performance of whatever has been specified.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TypesofPromise">Types of Promise</p>
<p class="fl">In biblical usage there are scattered examples of promises that people give either to one another (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.22.17">Nm 22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.4.7">Est 4:7</a>) or to God (e.g., <a href="?bref=Neh.5.12">Neh 5:12</a>), but the promises that God gives to man are far more significant. These divine promises are absolutely trustworthy because the one who gives them is totally able to perform that which he has promised (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.21">Rom 4:21</a>).</p>
<p>Divine promises in Scripture assure their recipients of many spiritual and temporal benefits, including sonship (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16-7.1">2 Cor 6:16–7:1</a>), forgiveness of sin (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.9">1 Jn 1:9</a>), answer to prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.9">Lk 11:9</a>), deliverance from temptations (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.13">1 Cor 10:13</a>), sustaining grace for difficult times (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.9">2 Cor 12:9</a>), provision for all needs (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.19">Phil 4:19</a>), reward for obedience (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">Jas 1:12</a>), and eternal life (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.29-30">Lk 18:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.22-23">Rom 6:22-23</a>). God’s promises are certain and sure, but participation in their blessing often requires that certain conditions on which they are predicated be met. Divine promises also are not always guarantees of blessing. Indeed, there are promises announcing the certainty of judgment on those who refuse to obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.8-9">2 Thes 1:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the promises of God, which have subjective and individual application to many different people in widely different times and places, there are a great many promises that pertain to the programmatic unfolding of God’s plan of redemption in a grand procession of historical events. These promises have neither repeated applications nor conditional natures. In such cases, promise becomes nearly synonymous with prophecy, and promises of this type, along with their subsequent fulfillment, are intricately intertwined in the entire fabric of redemptive history.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PromisesintheOldTestament">Promises in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The highlights of the promise theme in the OT can be seen in the promise of what is often termed the protevangelium (i.e., the first announcement of the gospel) given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden immediately after the fall into sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>). Subsequent promises are the covenants God made with Abraham (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-20">12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">17</a>) and with David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sm 7</a>), followed by the promise of a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.1-40">Jer 31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Protevangelium</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15b</a> says: “Your [Satan’s] offspring and her [Eve’s] offspring will be enemies. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This statement is a promise that at some future time the offspring of the woman will crush Satan. The offspring of the woman is individualized in the “he” of the last phrase. “He” shall strike you (i.e., Satan) on the head, although Satan will inflict a wound on the offspring of the woman. Here, then, is the promise that gives Adam and Eve, as well as their descendants, the basis to expect the eventual destruction of their adversary Satan through their offspring.</p>
<p class="h3">The Promise to Abraham</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-7">Genesis 12:1-7</a> Abraham is told to leave his people and country and to go to a land that the Lord would show to him. God, in turn, promises him that (1) his offspring would become a great nation; (2) he would be blessed and his name made great; (3) through him other nations would be blessed; and (4) the land of Canaan would be given to his descendants. Of particular significance among these promises given to Abraham is that through his offspring he will bless many nations. This promise is repeated five times in the book of Genesis (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gn 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.18">18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.22.18">22:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.4">26:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.14">28:14</a>) and points back to the promise of <a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</a> as well as forward to Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">The Promise to David</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Samuel 7</a>, God gave a promise to King David that his dynasty would endure forever (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sm 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.34-37">Ps 89:34-37</a>). It is with this Davidic covenant that the promised line, which had previously run from Adam through Seth, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, is now narrowed to the royal line of the house of David. David is to be the ancestor of the Messiah-King to come (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.3,27-37">Ps 89:3, 27-37</a>). David thus became a central figure in the history of God’s plan to redeem the world. Jesus Christ is referred to as the son of David, the son of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Promise of a New Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-37">Jeremiah 31:31-37</a>, it is promised that in future days the Lord would make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. The content of this new covenant reemphasizes and extends the basic promises of the former covenant: “I will be their God, and they will be my people. . . . I will forgive their wickedness and will never again remember their sins” (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.31.33-34">33-34</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). It would appear that the “new covenant” of Jeremiah is to be viewed as a restatement of the same basic promises included in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants.</p>
<p>The new covenant was inaugurated with the first advent of Christ, and believers in Christ are now recipients by the Holy Spirit of the blessings of that new covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-13">Heb 8:6-13</a>). The complete and final realization of these blessings in all their fullness awaits the return of Christ, the complete establishment of his kingdom in its outward and final form, and the blessedness of life in the new heavens and new earth. In the intervening time, God’s people live in a day in which some of the benefits of the age to come are a present reality but the fullness of the new age is yet future.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePromiseThemeintheNewTestament">The Promise Theme in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">New Testament writers refer to the OT promises in a way that indicates that they did not view these promises as separate and isolated assertions but rather as portions of a unitary promise that is ultimately fulfilled in Christ (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.54-55,69-73">Lk 1:54-55, 69-73</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.23,32-33">Acts 13:23, 32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.6-7">26:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.20">2 Cor 1:20</a>). Jesus is the fulfillment of the promises made to the patriarchs and David, and these promises are accordingly to be viewed as having a single focal point in him.</p>
<p>In the books of Galatians and Ephesians, Paul develops this idea in more detail, saying to the Gentile Christians that they are made “heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.6">Eph 3:6</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). In fact, Paul says that Gentiles who trust in Christ are incorporated into the seed of Abraham and are thus heirs according to the promise (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.29">Gal 3:29</a>), and he even goes so far as to equate the gospel with the promise given to Abraham when he states, “The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: ‘All nations will be blessed through you’ ” (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.8">Gal 3:8</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). These and other NT texts establish the close connection between the coming of Christ and the fulfillment of the promise. The promises of God find their point of convergence in Christ and all that he accomplished, and will yet accomplish, for his people.</p>
<p>One further aspect of the promise particularly emphasized in the NT concerns the coming of the Holy Spirit. Paul refers to believers as sealed with the promised Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>), and as receiving the promise of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.14">Gal 3:14</a>). The gift of the Holy Spirit is not only the fulfillment of an OT promise (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">Is 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.27">Ez 36:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>), and that of Christ himself (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.49">Lk 24:49</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.16,20">Jn 14:16, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.4">Acts 1:4</a>), but it is also itself a promise of something yet future. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit’s presence within the believer as a guarantee of our inheritance (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.14">Eph 1:14</a>). The Holy Spirit is the “firstfruit” of future glory (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Rom 8:23</a>).</p>
<p>One final aspect of the promise theme in the NT concerns the assurance of Christ’s second advent and the establishment of the new heavens and the new earth (cf. <a href="?bref=John.14.1-3">Jn 14:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.4,9,13">2 Pt 3:4, 9, 13</a>).</p>
