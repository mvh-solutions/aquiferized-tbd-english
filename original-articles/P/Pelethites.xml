<p class="h1">PELETHITES*</p>
<p class="fl">Bodyguards of David, and loyal mercenaries during the king’s political setbacks. They are always associated with the Cherethites, and both are believed to be of Philistine stock with Crete as their place of origin (Caphtor, home of the Philistines, generally taken to be Crete—<a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Am 9:7</a>). The Pelethites accompanied David when he fled Jerusalem under threat from Absalom’s forces (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.18">2 Sm 15:18</a>) and fought for David in the rebellion of Sheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.7">20:7</a>). Their leader, Benaiah, supported Solomon’s claim to David’s throne against the ambitions of Adonijah, and the presence of the Pelethites at Solomon’s anointing surely contributed to Adonijah’s demise (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.38,44">1 Kgs 1:38, 44</a>). Mercenaries from the Aegean were common.</p>
