<p class="fl">One trained in medicine. The physician tended to and repaired wounds and administered medicines to the sick. In early Israel the diagnosis and treatment of sick people was officially the concern of the priests, although many nonprofessional people practiced the healing art in the small towns and villages. King Asa sought their help for his feet (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.12">2 Chr 16:12</a>). Jeremiah inquired about physicians in Gilead (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>). Job complained that his friends were useless physicians (<a href="?bref=Job.13.4">Jb 13:4</a>). Scientific medicine and the careful training of physicians awaited the rise of Greek medicine, which by NT times saw medical schools established in various countries in the Greco-Roman world. Remarkable collections of surgical instruments have come from places like Pompeii. The NT refers to a number of sicknesses, and the word “physician” occurs several times in the Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.12">Mt 9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.17">Mk 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.26">5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.23">Lk 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.31">5:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.43">8:43</a>). Luke is given special mention as a beloved physician (<a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Col 4:14</a>). Physicians were not always able to effect a cure (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.26">Mk 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.43">Lk 8:43</a>), but Jesus the healer succeeded where others failed.</p>
