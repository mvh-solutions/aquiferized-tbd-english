<p class="h1">PUL</p>
<p class="list">1. Name given to Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian ruler (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>), when he became king of Babylon (729–727 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19">2 Kgs 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.26">1 Chr 5:26</a>). The meaning of the name is unknown, and Assyrian manuscripts do not mention it, suggesting to some scholars that Pul was Tiglath-pileser’s original name. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=TiglathPileser_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Tiglath-pileser</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. African people mentioned only in <a href="?bref=Isa.66.19">Isaiah 66:19</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). Their connection with Tarshish and Lud has strongly suggested that Pul is a copyist’s error for Put (as in various Greek manuscripts), a people related to the Egyptians and possibly a subculture of Libyans. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=PutPlace_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Put (Place)</a>.</p>
