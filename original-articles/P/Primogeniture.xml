<p class="h1">PRIMOGENITURE*</p>
<p class="fl">Word not found in the Bible; derived from the Greek translation of the Hebrew word for “firstborn.” Primogeniture refers specifically to the exclusive right of inheritance that belonged to the firstborn male. If the firstborn died, the next oldest living male did not receive that exclusive right; neither did a female if she were the firstborn; nor the firstborn if he was born of a concubine or of a slave woman (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.21.10">Gn 21:10</a>). That the Scriptures attached much importance to the rights of the firstborn (primogeniture) can be seen in the distinction drawn between the firstborn and other sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.15">Gn 10:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.13">25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.15">36:15</a>), the double portion to be given to the firstborn (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>), as well as the paternal blessing given to them (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-14">Gn 21:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-29">27:1-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.48.18">48:18</a>).</p>
