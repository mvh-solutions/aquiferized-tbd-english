<p class="h1">PELUSIUM</p>
<p class="fl">City known for its flax and wine, but also a strategic fortified town on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, situated on the trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.15-16">Ez 30:15-16</a>). Today the site is called Tell Farama and is located about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) southeast of Port Said. The Hebrew OT uses the old Egyptian name for the town, <span class="hebrew">Sin</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “fortress.” Some English translations of the OT (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) use this English name. When the Greeks controlled Egypt, they renamed the town Pelusium, “the muddy city,” apparently confusing the Egyptian name with a similar Egyptian word <span class="ital">sin,</span> meaning “mud” or “clay.” In Ezekiel it is called “the stronghold of Egypt” because it provided a defense against the ever-present danger of attack from the north.</p>
