<p class="h1">PARVAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Geographical area from which Solomon obtained gold for use in the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.3.6">2Â Chr 3:6</a>). According to rabbinic sources, the gold had a reddish hue and was used to make the vessel with which the high priest removed the ashes from the altar of burnt offering on the Day of Atonement. Parvaim was probably located in Arabia.</p>
