<p class="h1">PLEIADES</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a constellation in the eastern sky composed of six bright and many other less visible stars. Telescopic photography has captured the appearance of these stars as being strung together by currents of matter. Job is asked a question that reflects this phenomenon: “Can you hold back the movements of the stars? Are you able to restrain the Pleiades or Orion?” (<a href="?bref=Job.38.31">Jb 38:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
