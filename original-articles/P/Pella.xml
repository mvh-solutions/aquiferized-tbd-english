<p class="h1">PELLA*</p>
<p class="fl">City located east of the Jordan River in the Decapolis region. There is no reference to this city in the Bible, but records show that it was an important Canaanite city, influenced by Egypt and later by Greece and Rome. During the Jewish revolt against Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 66â€“70), Pella became a refuge for many Christians and a center for the early church.</p>
