<p class="h1">PATHROS</p>
<p class="fl">The region of Upper Egypt, mentioned five times in the Hebrew OT (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.1,15">Jer 44:1, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.14">Ez 29:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.14">30:14</a>). Each time it occurs in conjunction with a city in Lower Egypt (Noph = Memphis, or Zoan = Tanis). The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">Pathros</span><span class="ital">,</span> and the Egyptian is <span class="ital">pa to resy</span> (“the Southern Land”). Egyptologists believe that the Hebrew form is a corruption of <span class="ital">Pethoris</span> or <span class="ital">Pethores.</span> <a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Isaiah 11:11</a> suggests that <span class="hebrew">Mitsrayim</span> is to be equated with Lower and Middle Egypt, and <span class="hebrew">Pathros</span> is the region south of it up to the border of Cush (i.e., Upper Egypt). According to <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.14">Ezekiel 29:14</a>, Pathros is the original home of the Egyptians. The prophets spoke about God’s judgment on Pathros: “I will lay waste Upper Egypt [“Pathros,” mg], set fire to Zoan and inflict punishment on Thebes” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.14">Ez 30:14</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). After the exile, Jews migrated to Egypt and some settled in Pathros. Jeremiah warned that God’s judgment on Egypt was to come and that they would not escape it: “This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt [Pathros]: ‘This is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins’ ” (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.1-2">Jer 44:1-2</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
