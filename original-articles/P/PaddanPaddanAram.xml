<p class="h1">PADDAN, PADDAN-ARAM</p>
<p class="fl">Northwestern Mesopotamian district whose name means “Field of Aram,” distinguishing this flatland from the mountainous regions to the north and east. Paddan-aram is alternately called Paddan in <a href="?bref=Gen.48.7">Genesis 48:7</a>, the “land of Aram” in <a href="?bref=Hos.12.12">Hosea 12:12</a>, and Aram-naharaim in <a href="?bref=Gen.24.10">Genesis 24:10</a> meaning “Aram of the two rivers” (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The two rivers probably referred to the Euphrates and Balih rivers, between which this tract of land was situated.</p>
