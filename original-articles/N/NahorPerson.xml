<p class="h1">NAHOR (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Abraham’s grandfather (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.22-25">Gn 11:22-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.26">1 Chr 1:26</a>); also an ancestor of Jesus according to Luke’s genealogy (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.34">Lk 3:34</a>, where some English translations follow the Greek spelling, Nachor). The Genesis and 1 Chronicles passages show that Nahor is from Shem’s line. Hence, Abraham and his descendants are part of the Semitic family of nations.</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Terah and Abraham’s brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.26-29">Gn 11:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.2">Jos 24:2</a>). He married Milcah, Haran’s daughter, and his family is named in <a href="?bref=Gen.22.20-23">Genesis 22:20-23</a>. Abraham sent his servant to seek a wife for Isaac at Nahor’s residence in Mesopotamia (see <a href="?bref=Gen.24.10">Gn 24:10</a>, which possibly suggests that the city itself was called Nahor). There he found Rebekah, Nahor’s granddaughter (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-51">Gn 24:1-51</a>). Nahor is also named as the father (perhaps grandfather) of Laban, to whom Jacob went when he fled from his brother Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.5">Gn 29:5</a>). Both of these texts link Abraham’s family with related Semitic people. In <a href="?bref=Gen.31.53">Genesis 31:53</a> God is spoken of as “the God of Abraham and Nahor.”</p>
