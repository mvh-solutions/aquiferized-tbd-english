<p class="h1">NAHASH</p>
<p class="list">1. King of the Ammonites who laid siege to Jabesh-gilead during the days of Saul. The men of the city, offering themselves in servitude, petitioned Nahash to make a treaty with them; he agreed to do so on the condition that he gouge out each one’s right eye to shame all of Israel. Given a week’s reprieve from his threat, the men of Jabesh organized a secret war plan with Saul and Israel, resulting in the destruction of Nahash’s Ammonite army (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-2">1 Sm 11:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.12">12:12</a>). He later honored a reconciliation with David, which his son Hanun, on bad counsel, disregarded (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.2">2 Sm 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.1-2">1 Chr 19:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Father of Abigail and Zeruiah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.25">2 Sm 17:25</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.16">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>, Abigail and Zeruiah are listed as the daughters of Jesse and the sisters of David and his brothers. Various theories have been offered to resolve this difference. The most feasible suggests that Nahash’s wife bore him Abigail and Zeruiah; after his death, his widow married Jesse and subsequently bore David.</p>
<p class="list">3. Father of Shobi from Rabbah, the chief Ammonite city east of the Jordan. Shobi, along with Makir and Barzillai, took care of David’s domestic needs during his flight from Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.27">2 Sm 17:27</a>). He is perhaps identifiable with #1 above.</p>
