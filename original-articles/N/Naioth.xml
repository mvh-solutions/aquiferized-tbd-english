<p class="h1">NAIOTH</p>
<p class="fl">Place where David was given refuge from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.18-20.1">1 Sm 19:18–20:1</a>). Here Samuel supervised a group of prophets. According to verses <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.19">19</a> and <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.23">23</a> of chapter <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.1-24">19</a>, Naioth was located within Ramah, Samuel’s hometown.</p>
<p>The derivation of the term is enigmatic. The word occurs nowhere else in Scripture, and the Hebrew text seems intentionally obscure. The word perhaps stems from a Hebrew root meaning “pastoral abode” or “dwelling place.” In <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.25">2 Samuel 15:25</a> another derivative of the Hebrew root refers to the Lord’s habitation, prompting some to suggest that Naioth is a proper noun referring to a sanctuary in Ramah (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>, where prophets were also associated with a sanctuary). Others conclude that Naioth alludes to a school, cloister, or settlement of prophets, of which Samuel was head.</p>
