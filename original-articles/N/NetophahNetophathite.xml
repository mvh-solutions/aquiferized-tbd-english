<p class="h1">NETOPHAH, NETOPHATHITE</p>
<p class="fl">Home and designation for two of David’s thirty mighty men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.28-29">2 Sm 23:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.30">1 Chr 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.13-15">27:13-15</a>). Seraiah, one of the captains who came to Gedaliah, the governor in Jerusalem after its fall to Babylon in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, was a Netophathite (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.23">2 Kgs 25:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.40.8">Jer 40:8</a>). Fifty-six men of Netophah are mentioned as among the exiles who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.22">Ezr 2:22</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=1Chr.9.16">First Chronicles 9:16</a> speaks of Levites who lived in the villages of Netophathites, while <a href="?bref=Neh.12.28">Nehemiah 12:28</a> says that temple singers were gathered from the villages surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites. Both of these references suggest that Netophah was the name of a district and not just of a town.</p>
<p>The linking of Netophah with Bethlehem (see <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.54">1 Chr 2:54</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.26">Neh 7:26</a>) indicates that it was in that vicinity. The actual site of Netophah is not known; however, the most probable location is the modern Khirbet Bedd Faluh, three miles (4.8 kilometers) southeast of Bethlehem.</p>
