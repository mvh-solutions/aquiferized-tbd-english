<p class="h1">NEPHILIM*</p>
<p class="fl">Early group of the human race, mentioned only twice in the OT (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.4">Gn 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Nm 13:33</a>; <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Septuagint) rendered the name “Nephilim” as “giants,” and other versions followed this rendering, including the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. Modern translations, however, usually designate them as Nephilim, thus identifying them with the Anakim (<a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Nm 13:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.21">Dt 2:21</a>) and the Rephaim (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">Dt 2:20</a>). The latter two were reputed to be large physically, hence the rendering “giants.”</p>
<p>The Nephilim are of unknown origin. Some writers have taken the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">naphal</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to fall,” to imply that the Nephilim were “fallen ones”—that is, fallen angels who subsequently mated with human women. But Christ taught that angels do not have carnal relationships (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.34-35">Lk 20:34-35</a>), and therefore this view can only be maintained by assuming that <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Genesis 6:1-4</a> reflects Greek mythology, in which such unions occurred. The Genesis passage, however, deals with anthropology, not mythology.</p>
<p>The Nephilim were evidently not the “sons of God” and seem to be different also from the “daughters of men.” The best classification is with the Anakim and Rephaim as ancient peoples of unknown origin.</p>
