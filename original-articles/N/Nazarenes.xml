<p class="h1">NAZARENES</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to those who followed Jesus of Nazareth. Since Jesus was known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus the Nazarene, it was easy to transfer that title to his followers. They were “followers of the Nazarene” or “Nazarenes.” The earliest use of the term is in <a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">Acts 24:5</a>, where Tertullus accused the apostle Paul of being “a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.” Certainly, he did not intend the title as a compliment. The early Christians probably did not use that name for themselves, whereas later Jewish-Christian and Gnostic groups did call themselves Nazarenes. One early writing was even called <span class="ital">The Gospel of the Nazarenes.</span></p>
