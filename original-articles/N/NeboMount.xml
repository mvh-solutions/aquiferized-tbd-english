<p class="h1">NEBO, Mount</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a high mountain on the east side of the Jordan River opposite the city of Jericho. The Israelites encamped near it on the last stage of their journey to the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.49">Dt 32:49</a>). The mountain with which Nebo is now identified has two peaks; in the OT the peak of Nebo is called Pisgah (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.1">34:1</a>). From this high vantage point Moses beheld the Promised Land (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.34.1-5">1-5</a>).</p>
