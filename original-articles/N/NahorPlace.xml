<p class="fl">Northwestern Mesopotamian city; home of Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, and Nahor, Abraham’s brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.10">Gn 24:10</a>). Nahor is frequently mentioned in the Mari documents (18th century <span class="era">BC</span>) as the town of Nakhur, located near Haran in the Balikh River Valley. This city was probably the home of some of the ancient Habiru people. Its site is unknown.</p>
