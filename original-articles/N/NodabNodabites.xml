<p class="h1">NODAB*, NODABITES</p>
<p class="fl">Forefather of an Arabian tribe that joined forces with the Hagarites to fight against the tribes of Israel who were living east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.19">1 Chr 5:19</a>). Though not included in the list of Ishmael’s sons (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.13-15">Gn 25:13-15</a>), he was perhaps a distant relation.</p>
