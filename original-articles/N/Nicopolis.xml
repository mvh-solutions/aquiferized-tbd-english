<p class="h1">NICOPOLIS</p>
<p class="fl">Name meaning “Victory City,” a popular choice in the Roman Empire when a newly founded city required a name, especially when a newly built town was created to commemorate some military victory in days of warfare.</p>
<p>In his letter to Titus, Paul directs him to leave Crete, where he had been ministering (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>), and make his way to Nicopolis, where the apostle was working and intended to spend the winter (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">3:12</a>). Of the nine Nicopolises throughout the empire, Paul almost certainly meant the city situated northwest of the Gulf of Corinth and southeast of the promontory of Epirus.</p>
<p>Octavian founded this city in 31 <span class="era">BC</span> to celebrate his victory over Mark Antony in the great battle of Actium fought nearby. Nicopolis was Greek both in name and constitution. The center of a number of nearby towns, the new Nicopolis was a metropolis, enjoying an independence similar to that of neighboring Athens. Temples, theaters, a stadium, and an aqueduct were built, and games were instituted for the four yearly festivals. Nicopolis’s most famous citizen, Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher, lived there around <span class="era">AD</span> 90. Paul made this splendid metropolis and its satellite communities a field for evangelism.</p>
