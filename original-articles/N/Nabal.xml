<p class="h1">NABAL</p>
<p class="fl">Wealthy, successful farmer of Maon in the southern wilderness of Judah. Unlike his godly forefather, Caleb, Nabal was hard of heart and wicked in all his ways (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.3">1 Sm 25:3</a>).</p>
<p>When he enters the story of David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1-44">1 Sm 25</a>), it is sheep-shearing time, which seems to have been a time of festivity and hospitality. Fleeing from Saul, who wanted to kill him, David decided to ask Nabal for a gift, not only to mark the occasion, but also because David’s presence in the area had served to protect Nabal’s flocks. Nabal refused in a most insulting way, suggesting that David was no better than a runaway slave.</p>
<p>David decided on revenge. But Abigail, Nabal’s quick-witted wife, saved Nabal by bringing David the presents he had asked for and by begging him not to stain his record by acting in anger. David agreed. But when Nabal heard what had happened, he was struck down by what appears to have been a stroke and died 10 days later.</p>
<p>Nabal, whose name means “fool,” stands as a reminder of the deep folly of opposing God. God himself, not David, took revenge.</p>
