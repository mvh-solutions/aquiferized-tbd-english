<p class="fl">Place west of Gibeah in Benjamin’s territory (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.43">Jgs 20:43</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Other translations consider Nohah (meaning “quiet”) an adverb and translate it accordingly, “with ease” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), because no town by that name is known.</p>
