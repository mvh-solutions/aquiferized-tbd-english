<p class="h1">NICOLAS, NICOLAUS*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the seven men named in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">Acts 6:5</a>, who was enlisted for service in the Jerusalem church in its early days. His duty as specified in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-4">Acts 6:1-4</a> was to direct the fair and equal distribution of food. Due to the use of terms in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">Acts 6:1</a> (“daily distribution” or “service”) and <a href="?bref=Acts.6.2">6:2</a> (“to distribute at tables” or “to serve”), these seven men traditionally have been called “deacons” (or “servers”).</p>
<p>Nicolas, the last-named in the list, is identified as a proselyte. Thus, he was a Gentile convert to Judaism before he became a Christian. His name is Greek, and the city of Antioch is mentioned as his home. The NT writings provide no further information about him.</p>
