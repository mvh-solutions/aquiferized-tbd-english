<p class="h1">NEBAIOTH</p>
<p class="fl">Firstborn of Ishmael’s 12 sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.13">Gn 25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.29">1 Chr 1:29</a>) whose sister, Mahalath (also called Basemath, cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.36.3">Gn 36:3</a>) later married Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.9">Gn 28:9</a>). The identification of Nebaioth’s descendants is uncertain, though possibly they are the ancestors of the Nabatean Arabian tribe who possessed the land of Edom and parts of the Transjordan as far north as Palmyra (ancient Tadmor). The descendants of both Nebaioth and Kedar are noted for their superb flocks of sheep (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.7">Is 60:7</a>) and are mentioned in the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal (seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
