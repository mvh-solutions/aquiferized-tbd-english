<p class="h1">NEEDLE</p>
<p class="fl">Object used in Jesus’ lesson about the rich man and entrance into God’s kingdom. Following his discussion with the rich young ruler, Jesus told his disciples that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.24">Mt 19:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.25">Mk 10:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.25">Lk 18:25</a>). Jesus was not condemning riches or wealth but rather the change of will and false security that they may engender, as was the case with the rich young ruler (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.19.21-22">Mt 19:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.21-22">Mk 10:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.22-23">Lk 18:22-23</a>). Entrance into God’s kingdom is an act of God, not of man. Using the largest land animal in Palestine, Jesus paralleled the absurdity of a camel’s passing through the eye of a needle with a rich man’s attempt to use his position and possessions to gain entrance into heaven. A similar expression is found in rabbinic literature, where the elephant is pictured as passing through the eye of a needle.</p>
