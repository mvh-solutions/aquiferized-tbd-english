<p class="h1">NAOMI</p>
<p class="fl">Wife of Elimelech and the mother of Mahlon and Chilion. A member of Judah’s tribe, she lived in Bethlehem during the period of the judges. Her story is told in the book of Ruth. Because of a severe famine in Canaan, Naomi temporarily resettled with her family in the land of Moab, east of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.1-2">Ru 1:1-2</a>). Following the death of her husband and two sons in Moab (vv <a href="?bref=Ruth.1.3-5">3-5</a>), Naomi returned to Bethlehem with Ruth, her Moabitess daughter-in-law (vv <a href="?bref=Ruth.1.8-22">8-22</a>). Upon meeting her friends, she told them not to call her Naomi, meaning “pleasant,” but Mara, meaning “bitter,” for she said, “I went away full, but the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has brought me home empty” (vv <a href="?bref=Ruth.1.20-21">20-21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Naomi’s domestic problems were eventually resolved when Ruth married Boaz, Elimelech’s near kin (chs <a href="?bref=Ruth.2.1-4.22">2–4</a>).</p>
