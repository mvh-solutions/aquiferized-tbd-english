<p class="h1">NAHALAL</p>
<p class="fl">City in Zebulun’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.15">Jos 19:15</a>), given to the Levites for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.35">21:35</a>). Zebulun’s tribe was unable to drive the Canaanites from the city, so they forced them into hard labor (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.30">Jgs 1:30</a>, “Nahalol”). The exact location of the city is unknown. Some possible locations include Tell el-Beida, south of modern Nahalal, and Tell en-Nahl, north of the Kishon River and near the southern end of the plain of Acco, near modern Nahalal.</p>
