<p class="h1">WAY, The</p>
<p class="fl">One of the names applied to the early Christian community (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.2">Acts 9:2</a>). It was apparently used by both the Jewish and the secular community and appeared in both positive and negative assessments of the church (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.9,23">19:9, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.4">22:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.14,22">24:14, 22</a>). Paul’s use of the term in his defense before Felix suggests that the name had at least quasiofficial acceptance (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.14,22">24:14, 22</a>). Quite likely, the term came from Jesus’ own statement, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">Jn 14:6</a>).</p>
