<p class="h1">WATCHMAN</p>
<p class="fl">Military or civil security person who had the responsibility to protect ancient towns or military installations from surprise attack or civil disasters (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.16">1 Sm 14:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.24-27">2 Sm 18:24-27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.17-20">2 Kgs 9:17-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.21.6-9">Is 21:6-9</a>). Watchmen also had the responsibility of announcing the dawning of a new day (<a href="?bref=Ps.130.6">Ps 130:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.21.11-12">Is 21:11-12</a>). In a passage describing the function and responsibilities of the prophets, Ezekiel reported the watchman’s parallel responsibility to warn of impending danger. If the watchman (or prophet) failed in his task, he would be guilty of the blood of the people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.2-9">Ez 33:2-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.6.17">Jer 6:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.3.17">Ez 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.8">Hos 9:8</a>). In contrast to the faithful prophets, Isaiah compared the leaders of Israel to blind watchmen who lacked the ability to see Israel’s danger, much less lead the people to repentance (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.10">Is 56:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.4">Mi 7:4</a>). The prophets who served as Israel’s watchmen were the ones who first saw the coming destruction of Israel and also the ones who first announced their return to the land (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.11-12">Is 21:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.8">52:8</a>).</p>
