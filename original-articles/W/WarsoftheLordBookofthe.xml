<p class="h1">WARS OF THE LORD, Book of the</p>
<p class="fl">Document mentioned once in the OT (<a href="?bref=Num.21.14">Nm 21:14</a>); it is found in a description of Moab’s border at the Arnon. The book was used as a source but is no longer extant. It probably contained a record of Israel’s conquest in Transjordan and may be identical to the “Book of the Upright [Jashar]” (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.13">Jos 10:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.18">2 Sm 1:18</a>). The passage in <a href="?bref=Num.21.1-35">Numbers 21</a> has a poetic style and pertains to Israel’s conquest and warfare. However, the extent of the quotation is debatable. Some limit it to verse <a href="?bref=Num.21.14">14</a>, others include verse <a href="?bref=Num.21.15">15</a>, and still others include verses <a href="?bref=Num.21.27-30">27-30</a>.</p>
