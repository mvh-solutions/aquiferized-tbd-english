<p class="h1">WOOL</p>
<p class="fl">Important commodity of the ancient Near East. King Mesha of Moab, a sheep breeder, annually sent the wool of 100,000 rams as tribute to King Ahab of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4">2 Kgs 3:4</a>), and the people of Damascus traded wool with Tyre’s merchants (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.18">Ez 27:18</a>). Woolen garments were commonly worn by the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.47-59">Lv 13:47-59</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.8">Is 51:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.5,9">Hos 2:5, 9</a>), though woolen garments mingled with linen fabric were forbidden (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.11">Dt 22:11</a>). In fact, wearing wool was prohibited entirely for Israelite priests serving in the sanctuary’s inner court (<a href="?bref=Ezek.44.17">Ez 44:17</a>).</p>
<p>Wool is sometimes a biblical symbol for whiteness and purity, it is a simile for redemption (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>), for the hair of the Ancient of Days (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.9">Dn 7:9</a>), and for the hair and head of the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.14">Rv 1:14</a>).</p>
