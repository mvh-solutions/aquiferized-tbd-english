<p class="h1">SOUL</p>
<p class="fl">Term translating the Greek word <span class="greek">psuche</span> and the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">nephesh</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Plato (fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>) perceived the soul as the eternal element in humans; whereas the body perishes at death, the soul is indestructible. At death the soul enters another body; if it has been wicked in this life, it may be sent into an inferior human being or even an animal or bird. By means of transmigration from one body to another, the soul is eventually purged of evil. In the early centuries of the Christian era, Gnosticism also taught that the body was the prison house of the soul. Redemption comes to those initiated into the Gnostic secrets, leading to the release of the soul from the body.</p>
<p>Biblical thought about the soul is different. In the OT the soul signifies that which is vital to humans in the broadest sense. The Hebrew and Greek words for soul often can be translated as “life”; occasionally, they can be used for the life of creatures (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.20">Gn 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.11.10">Lv 11:10</a>). “Soul for soul” means “life for life” (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.23">Ex 21:23</a>). In legal writings, a soul refers to a person in relation to a particular law (e.g., “If a soul shall sin . . . ,” <a href="?bref=Lev.4.2">Lv 4:2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). When people were counted, they were counted as souls, that is, persons (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.5">Ex 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.22">Dt 10:22</a>).</p>
<p>In a narrower sense, the soul denotes human emotions and inner powers. People are called to love God with all their heart and soul (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.3">Dt 13:3</a>). Knowledge and understanding (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.14">Ps 139:14</a>), thought (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.3">1 Sm 20:3</a>), love (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.1">1 Sm 18:1</a>), and memory (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.20">Lam 3:20</a>) all originate in the soul. Here the soul comes close to what today would be called the self, one’s person, personality, or ego.</p>
<p>There is no suggestion in the OT of the transmigration of the soul as an immaterial, immortal entity. Man is a unity of body and soul—terms that describe not so much two separate entities in a person as much as one person from different standpoints. Hence, in the description of man’s creation in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a>, the phrase “a living soul” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is better translated as “a living being.” The idea is not that men and women became <span class="ital">souls,</span> because they clearly had bodies. The use of the word in the original draws attention to the vital aspect of humans as “living beings.” The Hebrew view of the unity of the person may help to explain why people in the OT had only a shadowy view of life after death, for it would be difficult to conceive how people could exist without a body (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Pss 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.49.15">49:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.3-12">88:3-12</a>). Where hope of an afterlife exists, it is not because of the intrinsic character of the soul itself (as in Plato). It is grounded in confidence in the God who has power over death and the belief that communion with him cannot be broken even by death (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6">Ex 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.6">1 Sm 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-26">Jb 19:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10-11">Pss 16:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.24-25">73:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.25.8">Is 25:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.19">26:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Dn 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.1-3">Hos 6:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">13:14</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the word for soul (<span class="greek">psuche</span>) has a range of meanings similar to that in the OT. Often it is synonymous with life itself. Followers of Jesus are said to have risked their lives (souls) for his sake (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.26">Acts 15:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.13.37">Jn 13:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.4">Rom 16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.30">Phil 2:30</a>). As the Son of Man, Jesus came not to be served but to serve and to give his life (soul) as a ransom for many (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>). As the Good Shepherd, he lays down his life (soul) for the sheep (<a href="?bref=John.10.14,17-18">Jn 10:14, 17-18</a>). In <a href="?bref=Luke.14.26">Luke 14:26</a> the condition of discipleship is to hate one’s soul, that is, to be willing to deny oneself to the point of losing one’s life for Christ’s sake (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.9.23">Lk 9:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.11">Rv 12:11</a>).</p>
<p>Frequently “soul” can mean “person” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.43">Acts 2:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.23">3:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.14">7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.9">Rom 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.1">13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.20">1 Pt 3:20</a>). The expression “every living soul” (<a href="?bref=Rev.16.3">Rv 16:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) reflects the vital aspect of living beings. As in the OT, the soul can denote not only the vital aspect of the person on the physical level, but it can also connote one’s emotional energies. It denotes the person himself, the seat of his or her emotions, one’s inmost being. For example, when Jesus was agonizing about his death, he spoke of his soul being crushed (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.38">Mt 26:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.34">Mk 14:34</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.42.6">Ps 42:6</a>). In an entirely different setting, Jesus promised rest to the souls of those who come to him (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29">Mt 11:29</a>). Here, as elsewhere, “soul” denotes the essential person (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.2.35">Lk 2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.23">2 Cor 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.8">2 Thes 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=3Jn.1.2">3 Jn 1:2</a>).</p>
<p>Several passages place the soul alongside the spirit. <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46">Luke 1:46</a> is probably a case of Hebrew poetic parallelism, which expresses the same idea in two different ways. Both terms denote Mary as a person in the depths of her being. Similarly, in <a href="?bref=Heb.4.12">Hebrews 4:12</a>, dividing the soul and the spirit is a graphic way of saying how the Word of God examines the deepest parts of our being. The prayer in <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>—that the readers may be kept blameless in spirit, soul, and body—is a way of speaking of the whole being. Here soul probably suggests physical existence, as in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, whereas spirit may imply the higher or “spiritual” side of life.</p>
<p>In other passages, the emotions, the will, and even the mind become prominent, though in each case there is the accompanying idea of a person’s inmost being. People are to love God with all the soul (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Mt 22:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.30">Mk 12:30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Dt 6:5</a>). The expression “from the soul” (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.6">Eph 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.23">Col 3:23</a>) means “from the heart,” with all one’s being. In <a href="?bref=Phil.1.27">Philippians 1:27</a> believers are called to be of one mind (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.4.32">Acts 4:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.2">14:2</a>). Passages that speak of the soul in relation to salvation include <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">Luke 12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.19">Hebrews 6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.39">10:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.7">13:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.21">James 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.20">5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.9,22-23">1 Peter 1:9, 22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>; and <a href="?bref=Rev.6.9">Revelation 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.4">20:4</a>. Such passages speak of the soul either to stress the essential human being, as distinct from the physical body, or to express man’s continued existence with God prior to the resurrection.</p>
