# General Style Guide

## About
The General Style Guide documents the choices that were taken when adapting the Tyndale Bible Dictionary articles for the “Aquifer”.

These guidelines:
- Should be followed by the linguists joining in to help adapt the remaining articles. When in doubt, the linguist should consult the rest of the team.
- Is a transparency tool and may help translators take informed translation choices.

## Replacements
Not all formal or rare words are replaced, especially if they have their own article in the Tyndale Bible Dictionary. Replacing a key theological word, for instance, would require a substantial amount of work.

The decision is not always straight forward and may require discussion with the team.

## Possessive apostrophe
An _’s_ is added straight after names normally ending with a letter _s_, when they possess something. For example: _“Jesus's teaching.”_

In the case of plural names, we don't. For example: _“deacons’ or deaconesses’ roles.”_
