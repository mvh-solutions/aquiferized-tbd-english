<p class="h1">NEHELAMITE</p>
<p class="fl">Ancestral name or the geographical designation for Shemaiah the false prophet (<a href="?bref=Jer.29.24,31-32">Jer 29:24, 31-32</a>). Its derivation is unknown. Etymologically similar to the Hebrew word for “dream,” Nehelamite is perhaps an epithet coined by Jeremiah to deride Shemaiah, the false prophet, as a dreamer.</p>
