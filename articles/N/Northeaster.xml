<p class="h1">NORTHEASTER</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to the stormy wind of <a href="?bref=Acts.27.14">Acts 27:14</a>, encountered by Paul on his journey to Rome. Against his advice, the ship weighed anchor from a harbor near Lasea. Their course was “close in” along the Cretan coast, as a gentle breeze encouraged them along. Probably no further than nine miles (14.5 kilometers) out, a sudden squall threatened their tiny craft. Luke calls it a typhoon (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “tempestuous wind”), its name being Euroclydon, meaning “the southwest wind, that stirs up waves.”</p>
