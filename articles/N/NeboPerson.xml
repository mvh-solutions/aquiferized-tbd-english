<p class="h1">NEBO (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Forefather of 52 descendants who returned with Zerubbabel to Judah following the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.29">Ezr 2:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.33">Neh 7:33</a>), 7 of whom were encouraged by Ezra to divorce their foreign wives (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.43">Ezr 10:43</a>). Some suggest that Nebo refers to a town in Benjamin’s tribe from which some inhabitants went into exile to Babylon.</p>
