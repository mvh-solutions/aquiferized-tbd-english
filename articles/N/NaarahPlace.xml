<p class="h1">NAARAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">City on the eastern border of Ephraim’s tribe, just north of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.7">Jos 16:7</a>); alternately called Naaran in <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.28">1 Chronicles 7:28</a>. Josephus locates it near Jericho and associates it with abundant water supply in Archelaus’s day (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 17.13.1). Some locate Naarah at modern Tell el-Gisr near ‘Ain Duq at the foot of the mountains northwest of Jericho. A synagogue dating to the fourth or fifth century <span class="era">AD</span> has been excavated here; it contains a mosaic floor with a zodiac, an ark of the law, and other figures.</p>
