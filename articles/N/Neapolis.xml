<p class="h1">NEAPOLIS</p>
<p class="fl">Port city of Philippi, identified with modern Kavalla. Neapolis, whose name comes from a Greek word meaning “new city,” existed as early as the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, and in Roman times was clearly dependent upon the city of Philippi.</p>
<p>After Paul’s dream of the man from Macedonia, he left Troas and the continent of Asia for the continent of Europe. The party passed by the island of Samothrace and then came to Neapolis. Thus, Neapolis was the first city of Europe visited by Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.11">Acts 16:11</a>).</p>
