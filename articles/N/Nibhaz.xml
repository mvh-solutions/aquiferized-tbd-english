<p class="h1">NIBHAZ</p>
<p class="fl">The name of a god worshiped by displaced Avvites after they were forcibly resettled in Samaria by the Assyrians in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. They brought the worship of this idol, as well as that of Tartak, with them at that time (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.31">2 Kgs 17:31</a>). Although purported to be of Mesopotamian origin, this is not likely because the worshipers were Syrian. The word Nibhaz may be a Hebrew corruption of “altar” and hence a reference to a deified altar that was the object of worship.</p>
