<p class="h1">NER</p>
<p class="fl">Benjamite, father of Abner and brother of Kish; he was probably the uncle of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.51">1 Sm 14:51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.5">26:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8">2 Sm 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.32">1 Kgs 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.28">1 Chr 26:28</a>). Although Ner’s father’s name was given as Abiel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.51">1 Sm 14:51</a>), disputed readings put Ner among the sons of Jeiel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.29-30">1 Chr 8:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.35-36">9:35-36</a>). Elsewhere he is listed as the father of Kish, the father of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.33">8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.39">9:39</a>). Ner was, then, the grandfather or the uncle of Saul, probably the latter. One suggestion is that there were two men called Kish, one of whom was Ner’s brother, the other his son. Another is that there were two men called Ner. These speculations demonstrate that genealogical tables were sometimes incomplete or ambiguous.</p>
