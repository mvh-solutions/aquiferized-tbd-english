<p class="h1">NISROCH</p>
<p class="fl">The god of King Sennacherib, in whose temple at Nineveh the king was assassinated by Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.37">2Â Kgs 19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.38">Is 37:38</a>). Nisroch was the city god of Nineveh, the chief capital of the Assyrian Empire; he was perhaps identical with the Assyrian god Nusku.</p>
