<p class="list">1. City located on the pastoral tablelands of the Transjordan and desired by the sons of Gad and Reuben (<a href="?bref=Num.32.3">Nm 32:3</a>). Reuben was apportioned this town (<a href="?bref=Num.32.38">Nm 32:38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.8">1 Chr 5:8</a>) but eventually lost it to King Mesha of Moab around 850 <span class="era">BC</span>. Later, Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.1,22">Jer 48:1, 22</a>) predicted Nebo’s destruction as part of God’s judgment against Moab.</p>
<p class="list">2. Summit in the Pisgah portion of the Abarim mountain range, situated eight miles (12.9 kilometers) east of the Jordan River at the northeastern corner of the Dead Sea, atop of which Moses viewed the Promised Land of Canaan before he died (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.49">Dt 32:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.34.1">34:1</a>). Its site has been variously identified with Jebel en Neba or with Khirbet el-Mekhaiyet.</p>
