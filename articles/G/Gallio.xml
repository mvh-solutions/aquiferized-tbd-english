<p class="h1">GALLIO</p>
<p class="fl">Marcus Annaeus Seneca’s son, and brother of the philosopher Seneca, who lived from 3 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 65. Born in Cordoba, Spain, Gallio came to Rome during Tiberius’s reign. His given name was Marcus Annaeus Novatus, but he assumed the name Gallio after his adoption by the rhetorician Lucius Junius Gallio. The wealthy Lucius trained him for his career in administration and government.</p>
<p>Gallio served as Roman proconsul of Achaia sometime between <span class="era">AD</span> 51 and 53. During the apostle Paul’s first visit to Corinth, the Jews brought the apostle before the proconsul, accusing him of having persuaded people to practice religion in an unlawful manner (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">Acts 18:12-17</a>). Gallio abruptly dismissed the charge since it dealt with Jewish and not Roman law. His action reflected the characteristic behavior of Roman governors toward religious disputes.</p>
<p>Forced to leave Achaia because of illness, Gallio returned to Rome as consul suffectus under Nero. His involvement in a conspiracy against Nero resulted in temporary pardon but eventual obligatory suicide.</p>
