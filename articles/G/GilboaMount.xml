<p class="h1">GILBOA, Mount</p>
<p class="fl">Mountain on the east side of the plain of Esdraelon between Galilee on the north and Samaria on the south (modern Jebel Fuqu’ah). Mt Gilboa towers over the valley of Jezreel. It is a weathered limestone ridge reaching to a height of 1,700 feet (518.1 meters) above sea level.</p>
<p>Many battles were fought in the area, including Deborah’s defeat of Sisera. At that time the flooding of the Kishon, which rose in Gilboa, greatly helped in the victory (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.21">Jgs 5:21</a>). This region was the probable location of Gideon’s camp when he attacked the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.33">6:33</a>). Gilboa is mentioned by name only in connection with Saul’s defense of the area against the Philistines. Here his sons were killed, and here he himself committed suicide (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1,8">1 Sm 31:1, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.6,21">2 Sm 1:6, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.12">21:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.10.1,8">1 Chr 10:1, 8</a>).</p>
