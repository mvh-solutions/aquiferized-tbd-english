<p class="h1">GIBBAR</p>
<p class="fl">Forefather of a family that returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.20">Ezr 2:20</a>). The parallel list in <a href="?bref=Neh.7.25">Nehemiah 7:25</a> reads “sons of Gibeon,” suggesting that “Gibbar” may be a textual corruption. Some support for this view lies in the fact that <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.21">Ezra 2:21</a> begins listing descendants by their home city rather than by family.</p>
