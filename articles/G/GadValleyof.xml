<p class="h1">GAD*, Valley of</p>
<p class="fl">Translation of a Hebrew phrase in <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.5">2 Samuel 24:5</a>, meaning literally “the river or streambed of Gad.” It is rendered “in the midst of the river of Gad” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), “in the middle of the valley, toward Gad” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), “the valley of Gad” (<span class="sc">asv</span>) and “in the direction of Gad” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The valley of Gad was the beginning point for David’s census, and the “river” or “valley” is undoubtedly the Arnon.</p>
