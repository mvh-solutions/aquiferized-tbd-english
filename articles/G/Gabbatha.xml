<p class="h1">GABBATHA</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration of an uncertain Aramaic expression, which is rendered in Greek as “paved with stones” and refers to the raised area before the palace in Jerusalem where formal sentencing by the governor occurred. Pilate seated himself on the elevated judgment seat here in order to preside over the trial of Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.19.13">Jn 19:13</a>). </p>
