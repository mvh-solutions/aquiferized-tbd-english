<p class="h1">GABRIEL</p>
<p class="fl">One of the two angels mentioned by name in the Bible (the other is Michael). Gabriel appeared in human form to Daniel to reveal to him the meaning of a vision, to show what would transpire on the Day of Judgment, and to give Daniel wisdom and understanding (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.16">Dn 8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.21-22">9:21-22</a>). In the NT Gabriel appeared to Zechariah the priest as he served in the temple, to announce the birth of Zechariah’s son, John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.11-20">Lk 1:11-20</a>). Six months later Gabriel appeared to Mary to announce that she would become the mother of Jesus, the long-awaited Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-33">Lk 1:26-33</a>). Gabriel is commonly called an archangel but is not referred to as such in the Bible.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of material about Gabriel in the noncanonical writings of the Jews. In the books of Enoch he is pictured as one of the four chief angels, along with Michael, Raphael, and Uriel (1 Enoch 40:3, 6). He is one of the holy angels (20:7) who looks down from heaven and is a principal intercessor (1 Enoch 9:1; 40:6; 2 Enoch 21:3). He is to destroy the wicked (1 Enoch 9:9-10) and cast them into the furnace (54:6) and is set over all powers (40:9). Michael sits at God’s right hand, and Gabriel sits on the left (2 Enoch 24:1). Michael, as guardian angel of Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1">Dn 12:1</a>) and a high priest of heaven, is more occupied with affairs in heaven, but Gabriel is God’s messenger who goes from heaven to execute God’s will on earth.</p>
