<p class="h1">GALEED</p>
<p class="fl">Name meaning literally “a heap of witness.” Jacob gave this name to a pile of stones erected as a witness to the pact of friendship made between himself and his father-in-law, Laban, who named the cairn Jegar-sahadutha (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.47-48">Gn 31:47-48</a>). Its location is unknown. The name Galeed is not to be confused with the name Gilead, designation of the territory east of the Jordan.</p>
