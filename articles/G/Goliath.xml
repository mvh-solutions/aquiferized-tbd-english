<p class="h1">GOLIATH</p>
<p class="fl">Eleventh-century <span class="era">BC</span> Philistine warrior from Gath, who challenged Israel to battle (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Sm 17</a>). He was subsequently felled and decapitated by the youthful David. Goliath was over nine feet (2.7 meters) tall, wore armor weighing about 125 pounds (56.8 kilograms), and carried a spear of 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms) weight. His sword, kept at Nob, was later given to David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.9">1 Sm 21:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.10">22:10</a>). He may have descended from the Anakim (see <a href="?bref=Josh.11.22">Jos 11:22</a>), but his height could have resulted from an anterior pituitary tumor. In <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.19">2 Samuel 21:19</a> his death is attributed to Elhanan, who in <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.5">1 Chronicles 20:5</a> is credited with killing Goliath’s brother.</p>
