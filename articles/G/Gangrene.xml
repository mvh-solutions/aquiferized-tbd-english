<p class="h1">GANGRENE*</p>
<p class="fl">Death of tissue due to loss of the vital blood supply to that part of the body. Often the most distal tip of an extremity, such as fingertips or toes, will turn black and surgeons will amputate the dead part to prevent extension and harm to more of the limb or to life itself.</p>
<p>The term “gangrene” occurs only once in Scripture (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.17">2 Tm 2:17</a>). Paul warns Timothy that godless talk will encourage more godlessness, just like gangrene tends to spread to surrounding tissues.</p>
<p>Although not identified by name, Asa’s disease of the feet (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.12">2 Chr 16:12</a>) could have been gangrene. Miriam’s leprosy was likened to the flesh of a macerated, gangrenous stillborn’s body (<a href="?bref=Num.12.12">Nm 12:12</a>).</p>
