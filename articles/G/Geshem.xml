<p class="h1">GESHEM</p>
<p class="fl">Arab opponent of Nehemiah who derided those seeking to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">Neh 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-6">6:1-6</a>). He was likely an inhabitant of the north Arabian Desert and has been identified with Gashmu son of Shahr in a Dedanite Arabian inscription. Like Sanballat and Tobiah, his economic interests were threatened by the rebuilding of Jerusalem.</p>
