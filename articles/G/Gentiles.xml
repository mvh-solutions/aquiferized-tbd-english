<p class="fl">The non-Jewish nations, known as <span class="hebrew">goyim</span> in Hebrew and <span class="greek">ethnoi</span> in Greek. According to the OT perspective, there are but two categories of people, the Jews (Godâ€™s elect) and the nations. According to the NT perspective, salvation is offered to Jew and Gentile alike.
