<p class="h1">GERUTH-KIMHAM</p>
<p class="fl">Plot of land (meaning “the lodging place of Kimham”) near Bethlehem. Geruth-kimham possibly was given to Kimham for the service that his father, Barzillai the Gileadite, had rendered to King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.31-40">2 Sm 19:31-40</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.7">1 Kgs 2:7</a>). After the fall of Jerusalem (586 <span class="era">BC</span>), Geruth-kimham was the camp of Johanan son of Kareah and his men as they prepared to flee to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.17">Jer 41:17</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Kimham_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Kimham</a>.</p>
