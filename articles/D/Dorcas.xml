<p class="h1">DORCAS</p>
<p class="fl">Christian woman in Joppa of Judea, noted for her acts of charity (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.36-41">Acts 9:36-41</a>). Dorcas is called a disciple in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.36">Acts 9:36</a>, which is the only instance where the feminine form of the word is used in the Greek NT. Her ethnic origins are not known, since Dorcas, her Greek name, was in common use among both Jews and Greeks. The Aramaic equivalent, Tabitha, meant “gazelle.”</p>
<p>When Dorcas died, the apostle Peter was nearby at Lydda. In response to news of his healing ministry there, two men were sent to bring Peter to Joppa. When he arrived, the body had been prepared for burial and placed in an upper room. Peter sent the mourners from the room, knelt to pray, and raised Dorcas back to life. Her restoration was the first of such miracles performed by an apostle.</p>
