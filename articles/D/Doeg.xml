<p class="h1">DOEG</p>
<p class="fl">Official of Saul who was commanded to kill the innocent priests at Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-22.23">1 Sm 21–22</a>). An Edomite, he was either a proselyte or a prominent Edomite chieftain captured by Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">14:47</a>). He was subsequently given supervision over Saul’s flocks (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.7">21:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.30">1 Chr 27:30</a>, where David had a foreign head over his herd). The reason for his presence at the sanctuary at Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.7">1 Sm 21:7</a>) is not clear, though he had some religious purpose in being there, maybe being detained while in a purification process (e.g., a Nazirite vow, <a href="?bref=Num.6.13">Nm 6:13</a>). Possibly he secretly hid there as a spy for Saul. Whatever the case, it is evident that he saw an opportunity to gain favor with Saul when he observed David hospitably treated by the priests, who even supplied him with a weapon—the sword of Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.9">1 Sm 21:9</a>). Shortly thereafter, he had occasion to report this to Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.9-10">22:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.52.1">Ps 52 title</a>), hoping thereby to demonstrate his loyalty. His brutal killing of the priests and the inhabitants of the city of Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.18-19">1 Sm 22:18-19</a>) shows his ruthless character and intimates further that he was not an Israelite.</p>
