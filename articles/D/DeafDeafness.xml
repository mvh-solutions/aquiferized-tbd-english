<p class="h1">DEAF, DEAFNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Inability to hear; term used in Scripture to describe both a literal, physical inability and a figurative, spiritual defect. The spiritually deaf were those who either refused to hear the divine message or were rendered incapable because of their lack of spirituality (<a href="?bref=Ps.38.13">Ps 38:13</a>). The prophet Isaiah forcefully addressed both types of deaf persons (the figurative in <a href="?bref=Isa.42.18">Is 42:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.8">43:8</a>; the literal in <a href="?bref=Isa.29.18">Is 29:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.5">35:5</a>). In the OT, although the condition was considered the result of God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.11">Ex 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.16">Mi 7:16</a>), it was wrong to curse a deaf person (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.14">Lv 19:14</a>). In the NT the deaf were among those Jesus healed (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">Mt 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.32-37">Mk 7:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.22">Lk 7:22</a>). An epileptic boy whom Jesus healed was afflicted with a “dumb and deaf spirit” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.25">Mk 9:25</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Such healings authenticated Jesus’ role as Messiah.</p>
