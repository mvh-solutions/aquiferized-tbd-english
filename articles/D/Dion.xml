<p class="h1">DION*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the cities of the Decapolis, built after the death of Alexander the Great by some of his soldiers. The city (not mentioned in the Bible) was culturally Greek, attracting many Greek immigrants; it was also a mercantile center of exchange. Dion was one of only two Decapolis cities having a Macedonian name (the other being Pella). It was located in Palestine east of the Jordan, possibly near the Yarmuk River and the town of Gadara. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Decapolis_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Decapolis</a>.</p>
