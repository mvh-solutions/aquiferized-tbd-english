Region of the 12 tribes of Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.14">Gn 25:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.30">1 Chr 1:30</a>) where there were a number of oases; identified with el-Jof, modern Dumat el-Jendel.

<p class="list">3. Hebrew term referring to the land of silence or death; that is, the place of graves (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.17">Pss 94:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.17">115:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Perhaps a designation for Edom or Idumea in <a href="?bref=Isa.21.11">Isaiah 21:11</a>.</p>
