<p class="h1">DALMATIA</p>
<p class="fl">Mountainous region on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea, across from Italy. The Dalmatians were an Illyrian (Greek) tribe, or group of tribes banded together, coming from the area around the town of Delmion (or Delminium). Their piracy gave the Romans considerable difficulty until Octavian thoroughly subjugated them in 33 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>At the time of Paul, Dalmatia was the name of the Roman province; its southern boundary was Macedonia, and its northern boundary is not clearly known. There is one reference to the province in the NT: Titus is mentioned as going there in <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2Â Timothy 4:10</a>. We are not told why he went. It may be that Paul had organized some churches there, or Titus may have been opening up a new mission field.</p>
