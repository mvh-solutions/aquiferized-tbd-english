<p class="h1">DEW</p>
<p class="fl">Moisture condensed from warm air during a cool night, usually found as small droplets on surfaces the next morning. Dew was an important source of moisture for the people of the ancient Near East, replacing some of the moisture lost during the hot days in that region. It was important to the growth of plants and successful harvests (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.10">Hg 1:10</a>). In the Bible dew and rain are spoken of together as of great value (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>). During the exodus, dew was a source of sustenance (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.13-21">Ex 16:13-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.9">Nm 11:9</a>). Figuratively, “dew” was sometimes used as a symbol of blessing; for example, Isaac blessed Jacob by asking that “the dew of heaven” be given to him (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.28">Gn 27:28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.33.13">Dt 33:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.7">Mi 5:7</a>). Dew was also a symbol of refreshment, renewal, or prosperity (<a href="?bref=Job.29.19">Jb 29:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.5">Hos 14:5</a>). A king’s favor was said to be like dew upon the grass (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.12">Prv 19:12</a>). Dew could represent stealth, coming silently by night (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.12">2 Sm 17:12</a>); it also depicted circumstances that could change rapidly, since it evaporated so quickly in the morning (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.4">Hos 6:4</a>). A passage in one of David’s psalms declares that God will renew his strength like the morning dew (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.3">Ps 110:3</a>).</p>
