<p class="h1">DYSMAS*</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to the repentant thief on the cross in apocryphal narratives based on <a href="?bref=Luke.23.39-43">Luke 23:39-43</a>. Sources such as the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy and the Acts of Pilate contain fanciful accounts of earlier dealings between Christ and Dysmas. Patristic writers often commended the repentance of the “good thief,” and the Latin church ultimately canonized him as a saint.</p>
