<p class="h1">DECAPOLIS*</p>
<p class="fl">Group of city-states where Greeks settled following Alexander the Greatâ€™s conquest of the area in the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>. They were located to the southeast of the Sea of Galilee, with the exception of Scythopolis, which was west of the Jordan River. About <span class="era">AD</span> 77 Pliny gave what is the earliest known list of the cities: Canatha, Damascus, Dion, Gadara, Gerasa, Hippos, Pella, Philadelphia, Raphana, and Scythopolis.</p>
<p>With the rise of Jewish nationalism in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Jewish king Alexander Janneus seized control of a few of these cities; they remained in the hands of Israel until they were recaptured by the Roman general Pompey in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>. During the lifetime of Jesus, the cities of the Decapolis, which had become moderately prosperous trade centers, were consolidated into a Roman alliance against a possible Jewish uprising.</p>
<p>The Decapolis is mentioned three times in the NT. The first is in <a href="?bref=Matt.4.25">Matthew 4:25</a>, where great crowds (mostly Greeks and Canaanites) followed Jesus during his early ministry. As we see in <a href="?bref=Mark.5.20">Mark 5:20</a> the demoniac who was healed by Jesus went and proclaimed Jesus throughout the Decapolis region. Finally, <a href="?bref=Mark.7.31">Mark 7:31</a> says Jesus passed through the Decapolis region on his way from Tyre and Sidon to the Sea of Galilee.</p>
