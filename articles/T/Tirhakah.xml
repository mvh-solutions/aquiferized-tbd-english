<p class="h1">TIRHAKAH</p>
<p class="fl">Ethiopian king who marched north to fight against the Assyrian army, thus diverting Sennacherib’s siege of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.9">2 Kgs 19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.9">Is 37:9</a>). The report of Tirhakah’s intended invasion prompted the Rabshakeh’s second threat against Jerusalem, Hezekiah’s prayer for deliverance, and the subsequent divine destruction of the Assyrian army (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.8-37">2 Kgs 19:8-37</a>). Tirhakah is almost certainly the Egyptian king Taharqa, who ruled from 689–664 <span class="era">BC</span> during the 25th (Ethiopian) dynasty. Tirhakah probably served as commander of the army while he was crown prince, so that the reference to him as “king” refers to his then-future position.</p>
