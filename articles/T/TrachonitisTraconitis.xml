<p class="h1">TRACHONITIS*, TRACONITIS</p>
<p class="fl">One of the five Roman provinces east of the Jordan River, along with Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, and Iturea. The region of Traconitis (apparently including Gaulanitis, Batanea, and Auranitis) was part of the tetrarchy of Philip, the brother of Herod (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). Traconitis was an extremely desolate region northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Its name in Aramaic was Argob, which signified that the region was a “heap of stones.” Other than the reference in Luke, Traconitis is seldom mentioned in historical references. Josephus suggests that it was colonized by Uz, the son of Aram (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.23">Gn 10:23</a>). The Romans gained control of the region when Augustus deposed Zenodorus, a local robber-chieftain. Herod the Great was deeded the land on the condition that he control the local bandits. Philip received the land at the death of his father but apparently retained only nominal control over the region. The region is currently named el-Lejah and is located in southern Syria and northern Jordan.</p>
