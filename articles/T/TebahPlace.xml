<p class="h1">TEBAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">City of King Hadadezer from which David received a large quantity of bronze as booty (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.8">2 Sm 8:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.8">1 Chr 18:8</a>). Hadadezer was the king of Zobah, which is located in the region of Hamath in Syria, so the location of Tebah was likely in that region.</p>
