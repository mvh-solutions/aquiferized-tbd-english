<p class="h1">THREE TAVERNS</p>
<p class="fl">Place where the believers came to meet Paul when he arrived in Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.15">Acts 28:15</a>). It was on the Appian Way located at milepost 33 (30.5 English miles or 49.1 kilometers). The Forum of Appius is ten miles (16.1 kilometers) further south along the same road. Three Taverns was near modern Cisterna at an important junction between the Appian Way and the road from Antium to Norba and was thus a common meeting place for travelers.</p>
