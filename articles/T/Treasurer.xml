<p class="h1">TREASURER</p>
<p class="fl">An officer in charge of financial matters. In OT times he had charge of the royal or sacred treasures, which consisted of goods, documents, money, and jewels. He was steward of the king’s possessions and overseer of the treasury. David appointed Azmaveth over the king’s treasuries, Jonathan over the treasuries in cities and villages (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.25">1 Chr 27:25</a>), and Ahijah over the temple treasuries (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.20">26:20</a>). Solomon’s temple treasury was in the care of Jehiel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.7-8">29:7-8</a>). In Isaiah’s day there was a treasurer for the household named Shebna (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.15">Is 22:15</a>). An inscription found near Jerusalem may record his name.</p>
<p>Treasurers held positions in other lands too. King Cyrus of Persia entrusted his temple treasures to Mithredath (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.8">Ezr 1:8</a>). Artaxerxes ordered the treasurers of the province “beyond the river” to supply funds to Ezra the priest (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.21-22">7:21-22</a>). Nehemiah appointed treasurers over storehouses to distribute goods (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.44">Neh 12:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.13">13:13</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, two treasurers are known. The Ethiopian eunuch was in charge of the treasury of Candace, queen of Ethiopia (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.27">Acts 8:27</a>), and Erastus was the city treasurer of Corinth (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">Rom 16:23</a>). An inscription left at Corinth by Erastus, a Roman treasurer, may be his.</p>
