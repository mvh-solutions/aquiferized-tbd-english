<p class="h1">TALITHA CUMI*</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic words spoken by Jesus and retained by Mark in his Gospel (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.41">Mk 5:41</a>). Jairus, a synagogue official in the Galilean region, called on Jesus to heal his sick daughter; however, she died before Jesus arrived. Coming to the girl, Jesus took her hand and said, <span class="ital">“Talitha cumi,”</span> meaning “Little girl, arise.” <span class="ital">“Talitha”</span> is a term of affection meaning “lamb” or “youth.” <span class="ital">“Cumi”</span> is a command to rise up, translated by Mark as “I say to you, arise!”</p>
<p>In his Gospel, Mark includes other Aramaic phrases attributed to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mk 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.41">5:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.11,34">7:11, 34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.9-10">11:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.36">14:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.22,34">15:22, 34</a>). Matthew retains only two Aramaic phrases (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.33,46">Mt 27:33, 46</a>), and Luke keeps none.</p>
