<p class="h1">THEOPHANY*</p>
<p class="fl">An appearance or manifestation of God; a compound word derived from the Greek noun for “God” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">theos</span><span class="ital">)</span> and the Greek verb “to appear” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">phano</span><span class="ital">).</span> A theophany is a manifestation of God in temporary forms perceptible to the external senses. A theophany is regarded as one of the means by which God’s special revelation comes to people; it is a divine revelation in which God’s presence is made visible and recognizable to people.</p>
<p>God made himself known to people through a special messenger called the Angel of the Lord, through the pillar and cloud that accompanied the Israelites in their wilderness wanderings, and through the shekinah glory indwelling the tabernacle. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Angel_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Angel (Angel of the Lord)</a>; <a href="?item=PillarofFireandCloud_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Pillar of Fire and Cloud</a>; <a href="?item=Shekinah_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Shekinah</a>.</p>
