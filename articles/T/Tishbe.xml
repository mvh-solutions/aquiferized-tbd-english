<p class="h1">TISHBE</p>
<p class="fl">Native city of Elijah the prophet and its inhabitants (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.17,28">21:17, 28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.3,8">2 Kgs 1:3, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.36">9:36</a>). The Hebrew form of Tishbe in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kings 17:1</a> prompted the KJV to translate the word as “of the inhabitants [of Gilead].” Most translations follow the Septuagint, however, in considering Tishbe a proper noun. This reading is also supported by the fact that Elijah is elsewhere called a Tishbite. If Tishbe is considered a proper name, it is likely identified with Thisbe, a town in Naphtali that is mentioned in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.1.2">Tobit 1:2</a>.</p>
