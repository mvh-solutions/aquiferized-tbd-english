<p class="h1">THRONE</p>
<p class="fl">Elevated, ceremonial chair, symbolizing the importance and the authority of the person seated on it. With the widespread use of the word “throne,” the term came to symbolize kingship and became equivalent in meaning to the kingdom itself. When Pharaoh elevated Joseph to the status and office of viceroy, he emphasized “only as regards the throne will I be greater than you” (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.40">Gn 41:40</a>). The establishment of David as king of Israel was equivalent to the establishment of the throne of David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.10">2 Sm 3:10</a>). To occupy the throne indicated succession to the kingship (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.46">1 Kgs 1:46</a>).</p>
<p>Only one throne is described in detail in the OT, the throne of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.18-20">1 Kgs 10:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.17-19">2 Chr 9:17-19</a>). The description, combined with the representation of thrones on ancient monuments, gives an idea of the appearance of the throne of Israel. An elevated seat with six steps leading up to it, the throne was partly made of ivory and overlaid with gold. The throne had a backrest and arms; alongside it were statues of lions and six similar statues on either side of the steps. Although not mentioned in the OT’s description, a footstool was an indispensable part of the throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.1">Is 66:1</a>).</p>
<p>The Hebrew term <span class="hebrew">kisseh</span> is used of a seat of honor for any distinguished person; for example, a priest (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.13,18">1 Sm 4:13, 18</a>), a ruler (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.20">Ps 94:20</a>), a military officer (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.15">Jer 1:15</a>), and a favored guest (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.10">2 Kgs 4:10</a>), although it is principally used for a king’s chair from which he discharged his royal duties. The OT refers to thrones of foreign kings (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.5">Ex 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.43.10">Jer 43:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.6">Jon 3:6</a>), but particular emphasis is on the throne of Israel, especially on the throne of David.</p>
<p>The God of Israel is described metaphorically as sitting upon a throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.1">Is 66:1</a>). The vision of God seated on a throne as seen in prophetic visions is described by Micaiah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19">1 Kgs 22:19</a>), Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-3">6:1-3</a>), Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.4-28">1:4-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1">10:1</a>), and Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.9-10">7:9-10</a>). Later, Ezekiel’s vision of the throne of God was of major significance in Jewish “throne mysticism.” In <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">Revelation 4</a> the throne of God is flanked by the 24 thrones of the elders, surrounded by an emerald rainbow and seven torches, with a crystal sea in front, and four living creatures on each side.</p>
<p>Usually, God’s throne is spoken of as being in heaven (<a href="?bref=Ps.11.4">Ps 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.34">Mt 5:34</a>), but Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.17">Jer 3:17</a>), the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.6-7">Ez 43:6-7</a>), or the nation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.21">Jer 14:21</a>) may be called the throne of God. The concept of Christ’s throne is rare in the OT (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">Is 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.25">Jer 17:25</a>) but common in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32">Lk 1:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.30">Acts 2:30</a>). This throne symbolizes Christ’s kingship and authority.</p>
