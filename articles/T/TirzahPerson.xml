<p class="h1">TIRZAH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of the daughters of Zelophehad of Manasseh’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.26.33">Nm 26:33</a>). Since her father had no sons, she and her sisters asked for and received their father’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Num.27.1">Nm 27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.3">Jos 17:3</a>). This prompted the making of a new law concerning inheritance rights with the stipulation that daughters who obtained their families’ inheritance must marry within the tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.36.11">Nm 36:11</a>).</p>
