<p class="h1">TEL-HARSHA</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Babylonian villages from which some returning exiles could not establish their genealogy (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.59">Ezr 2:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.61">Neh 7:61</a>). Its precise location is uncertain, though it is likely near the Persian Gulf in the lowland region of Babylonia.</p>
