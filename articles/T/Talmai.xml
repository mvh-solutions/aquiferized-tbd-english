<p class="list">1. Son of Anak and brother of Ahiman and Sheshai. Talmai and his people were observed by the 12 Israelite spies when they searched out the land (<a href="?bref=Num.13.22">Nm 13:22</a>). Later, Caleb successfully defeated Talmai and his brothers, who were living in Hebron (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.14">Jos 15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.10">Jgs 1:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Ammihud and father of Maacah. Maacah gave birth to Absalom, David’s third son (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.3">2 Sm 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.2">1 Chr 3:2</a>). Absalom eventually sought refuge in Talmai’s small kingdom of Geshur after murdering Amnon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.37">2 Sm 13:37</a>).</p>
