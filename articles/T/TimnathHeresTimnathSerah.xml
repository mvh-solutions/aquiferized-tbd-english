<p class="h1">TIMNATH-HERES*, TIMNATH-SERAH</p>
<p class="fl">The city that Joshua the son of Nun asked for and that was given to him as his inheritance when the land was divided among the tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.49-50">Jos 19:49-50</a>). Joshua rebuilt the city and settled there. When Joshua died, he was buried on the property located in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.30">Jos 24:30</a>). <a href="?bref=Judg.2.9">Judges 2:9</a> gives the same location, but the name is Timnath-heres (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), which means “territory [or portion] of the sun.” This seems to indicate that the city used to be a place for sun worship.</p>
