<p class="h1">TONGUES OF FIRE</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase occurring only in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.3">Acts 2:3</a>, describing the visible manifestation of the Spirit. The tongues of fire seem to be the fulfillment of John the Baptistâ€™s proclamation that the Coming One would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>). The disciples are described as filled with the Holy Spirit, thus fulfilling the OT promise reiterated by John the Baptist and Jesus of the baptism of the Spirit.</p>
