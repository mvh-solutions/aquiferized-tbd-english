<p class="h1">TEMA (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl"> Town generally identified with Teima’, an oasis located 200 miles (321.8 kilometers) north of Medina and 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) south of Dumah. Teima’ was located on an ancient caravan route that connected the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Aqaba. In prophetic literature Tema is mentioned with Dedan and Buz as Arabian oases that would not escape God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.14">Is 21:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.23">Jer 25:23</a>). The Jeremiah passage contains an obscure indication that the residents of Dedan, Tema, and Buz were among those who “cut the corners of their hair.” The practice of cutting the corners of the hair would distinguish them from the Jews, who left the corners of their hair uncut (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.27">Lv 19:27</a>). Like uncircumcision, the practice would identify the men of Tema as pagans.</p>
