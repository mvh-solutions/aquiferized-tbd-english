<p class="h1">TESTAMENT*</p>
<p class="fl">English word translated from the Greek signifying the covenantal administrations of God. Prior to Christ, this covenant is known as the Old Testament; under Christ’s administration, it is called the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Greek word, generally meaning “last will and testament,” contains certain legal characteristics that have important theological implications. First, a testament was not an agreement between parties (especially equals) but rather was exercised solely by the testator. Second, the testament became effective upon the death of the testator. Third, the testament was irrevocable.</p>
<p>When the OT was translated into Greek, the translators had the option of two words to translate the Hebrew word for “covenant.” One term carries the idea of a mutual agreement, and this often between equals. Since this would blur the divine initiative in God’s covenantal dealings with the patriarchs and with Israel, the other word was used. It connoted the self-determined action of the sovereign in making the covenant. The NT writers saw additional significance in the word “testament.” As a testament only becomes valid at the death of the testator, so the benefits of the new covenant are given to believers as a consequence of Christ’s death (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.15-22">Heb 9:15-22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>).</p>
