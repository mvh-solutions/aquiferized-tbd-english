<p class="h1">TAMAR (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">City located southwest of the Dead Sea in Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.19">Ez 47:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.28">48:28</a>). Tamar is listed in some Hebrew manuscripts of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.18">1 Kings 9:18</a> as one of the places built up by Solomon in his campaign to increase the might and grandeur of the Jewish empire. It may have been carefully fortified to safeguard the important trade route between the Elath seaport and southern Arabia.</p>
