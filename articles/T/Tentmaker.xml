<p class="h1">TENTMAKER</p>
<p class="fl">Artisans who made tents from the cloth of woven goats’ hair. The Greek term for tentmaker may have served to denote a range of activities in cloth and leather. The single biblical reference (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.3">Acts 18:3</a>) is to Aquila and Priscilla of Corinth, who worked in this trade. Paul joined them because he was trained in the same craft. He regularly earned his living at this trade during his missionary journeys (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.7-10">2 Cor 11:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">1 Thes 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.8">2 Thes 3:8</a>).</p>
