<p class="fl">Worker and process of changing hide into leather (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.43">Acts 9:43</a>). The tanner converted hides and skins into leather by soaking them in lime and the leaves and juices of certain plants. Tanners lived outside the towns because of the foul smells produced from their vats. The tabernacle coverings were made from the tanned skins of rams and goats (or perhaps sea cows). The leather was red in color either because of dye or as a result of the tanning process (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.5">Ex 25:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.26.14">26:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.7,23">35:7, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.36.19">36:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.39.34">39:34</a>). The only biblical reference to a tanner is to Simon in Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.43">Acts 9:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.6,32">10:6, 32</a>).</p>
