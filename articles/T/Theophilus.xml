<p class="h1">THEOPHILUS</p>
<p class="list">1. Person to whom the books of Luke and Acts are addressed (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.3">Lk 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.1">Acts 1:1</a>). Since Theophilus can be translated “lover of God” or “loved of God,” many have suggested that Theophilus is a title rather than a proper name and that it designates the general audience of the books. However, the use of such generic titles is contrary to ordinary NT practice. Furthermore, the adjective “most excellent” generally designates an individual, particularly one of high rank. Paul addressed Festus as “most excellent,” and Claudius Lysias and Tertullus addressed Felix in the same manner (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.26">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.2-3">24:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.25">26:25</a>). Though Theophilus may well have had some noble standing, it is difficult to speculate what his position might have been.</p>
<p class="list">2. Jewish high priest who was the son of Annas, the brother-in-law of Caiaphas, and the brother of Jonathan. The Roman prefect Vittelius installed him as high priest succeeding Jonathan in <span class="era">AD</span> 37. He served until he was deposed by Herod Agrippa in <span class="era">AD</span> 41, and was likely the high priest who gave Paul the authority to persecute the Christians. He is not mentioned by name in the NT.</p>
