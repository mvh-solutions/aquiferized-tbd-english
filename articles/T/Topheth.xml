<p class="h1">TOPHETH</p>
<p class="fl">Location within the valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem where Israel profaned the Lord by offering human sacrifices to Molech. As part of his religious reform, Josiah defiled Topheth and tore down its altars (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">2 Kgs 23:10</a>). Josiah’s reforms appear to have had only temporary impact, for the practice recurred under Manasseh (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.6">2 Chr 33:6</a>) and was later condemned by Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.31-32">Jer 7:31-32</a>). Jeremiah prophesied that the valley would be renamed the “Valley of Slaughter” because it would be the site where the Babylonians would rout Judah during their siege of Jerusalem. Jeremiah repeated the prophecy during his parable of the potter’s flask, emphasizing the fact that Jerusalem would be destroyed so thoroughly that it would resemble Topheth (<a href="?bref=Jer.19.12">19:12</a>). By this time, Topheth had evidently become a sort of city dump where broken pottery was thrown away and where burials that could not be accommodated in any of the city cemeteries would take place (v <a href="?bref=Jer.19.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>While Topheth is not mentioned in the NT, it is linked to Gehenna (Aramaic form of “valley of Hinnom”). Gehenna refers to the place of destruction and is typically translated “hell” in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22,29-30">Mt 5:22, 29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.9">18:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.43-47">Mk 9:43-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">Lk 12:5</a>).</p>
