<p class="h1">TIRZAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Early capital city of the divided kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.17">1 Kgs 14:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.21,33">15:21, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.6-23">16:6-23</a>). It was one of the cities captured by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.24">Jos 12:24</a>), but it did not gain prominence until Jeroboam established it as his royal residence (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.17">1 Kgs 14:17</a>). Although Baasha intended to move his capital to Ramah, he returned to Tirzah as a result of his war against Asa (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.21">1 Kgs 15:21</a>). Tirzah also served as the capital for Elah, Zimri, and Omri during the first six years of Omri’s reign. Omri built and established Samaria as his capital midway during his reign, resulting in the decline of Tirzah’s significance. Perhaps as a result of the rivalry between Tirzah and Samaria, Menahem used Tirzah as his base to mount his revolt against Shallum in 753 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.14">2 Kgs 15:14</a>). Although it was known as a beautiful city located on a high hill (<a href="?bref=Song.6.4">Sg 6:4</a>), Tirzah’s location has not been identified with precision.</p>
