<p class="h1">TERTIUS</p>
<p class="fl">Paulâ€™s amanuensis (secretary) for the book of Romans (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.22">Rom 16:22</a>). Since his name is a common Roman name, he was probably Roman and known by the recipients of the letter. The supposition that Tertius is the same person as Silas because their names had similar meanings in Latin and Hebrew lacks any biblical or traditional evidence.</p>
