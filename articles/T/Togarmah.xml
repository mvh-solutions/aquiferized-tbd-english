<p class="h1">TOGARMAH</p>
<p class="fl">Third son of Gomer, a descendant of Japheth (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.3">Gn 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.6">1 Chr 1:6</a>). Beth-togarmah (“house of Togarmah”) appears in Ezekiel’s prophecy against the nations that opposed Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.14">Ez 27:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.6">38:6</a>). Beth-togarmah was one of the principal trading partners of Tyre, providing war horses and mules. Since Togarmah is consistently linked with Javan, Tubal, Meshech, Dedan, and Tarshish, Ezekiel probably had the ethnographic lists of <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Genesis 10</a> in mind. As an ethnographic term, most have identified Togarmah with Armenia. The Armenians identify Togarmah (Thorgon) as the founder of their race.</p>
