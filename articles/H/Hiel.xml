<p class="h1">HIEL</p>
<p class="fl">Bethelite in the days of King Ahab who fulfilled Joshua’s curse upon the city of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.26">Jos 6:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kgs 16:34</a>). Joshua had said centuries before that anyone attempting to rebuild the city would suffer the loss of his oldest and youngest sons. It is unclear whether Hiel’s sons died a natural death or were killed in a punitive ritual.</p>
