<p class="fl">One of Zelophehad’s five daughters (<a href="?bref=Num.26.33">Nm 26:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.27.1">27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.3">Jos 17:3</a>). Zelophehad, who was of Manasseh’s tribe, had no sons, so that his inheritance passed to his daughters. They married within their own tribe according to God’s command, so that their land remained in the tribe of the family of their father (<a href="?bref=Num.36.11-12">Nm 36:11-12</a>).</p>
