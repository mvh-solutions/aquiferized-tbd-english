<p class="h1">HEMORRHAGE</p>
<p class="fl">Issue of blood, coming from any cut or nosebleed (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.33">Prv 30:33</a>). However, in Scripture it almost always refers to vaginal bleeding. Laws concerning normal and abnormal menstruation are given in <a href="?bref=Lev.15.19-30">Leviticus 15:19-30</a>. A woman with normal menstruation was considered unclean for seven days, along with anything that came into contact with her. A woman who bled longer than seven days was unclean as long as she was bleeding plus seven additional days.</p>
<p>All the Gospels except John give an account of the miraculous healing by Jesus of the woman who had a hemorrhage for 12 years (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.20-22">Mt 9:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.25-34">Mk 5:25-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.43-48">Lk 8:43-48</a>). By touching Jesus’ garment, the woman was actually violating the OT laws concerning menstruation and making Jesus’ garment unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.1-33">Lv 15</a>). Her courageous act of faith in Jesus healed her.</p>
