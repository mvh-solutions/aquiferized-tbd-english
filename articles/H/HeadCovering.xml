<p class="h1">HEAD COVERING</p>
<p class="fl">Something used to cover one’s head either for protection or for religious reasons.</p>
<p>Men wore a cap, turban, or head scarf for protection against the sun. The cap was similar to a skullcap (a cap without a brim) and was sometimes worn by the poor. The turban (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.23">Is 3:23</a>) was made of thick linen wound around the head with the ends tucked inside the folds. The priest’s turban had a plate strapped to it bearing the inscription “Holy to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.36">Ex 28:36</a>). The head scarf was made from a square yard (.8 square meter) of cloth, folded in half to form a triangle. The sides fell over the shoulders and the V-point down the back, and it was held in place by a headband made of cord. About the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, male Jews began to wear phylacteries on their foreheads, small leather boxes containing special Scripture passages, at morning prayers and at festivals, but not on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Women were often veiled in public, although this custom changed over the centuries. In NT times, women usually wore veils (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.5-6">1 Cor 11:5-6</a>). Women also wore a cloth similar to the head scarf, but the fabric was different in quality and color from that worn by men. It was often pinned over a stiff hat and set with ornaments. If a woman was married, these and other important coins covered the front of the hat and constituted her dowry (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.15.8-10">Lk 15:8-10</a>). Women also adorned their heads with an elaborate plaiting of their hair, prompting Peter to warn Christian women about too much concern with external beauty (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.3-4">1 Pt 3:3-4</a>).</p>
