<p class="h1">HAROD</p>
<p class="list">1. Spring beside which Gideon and his army camped before their encounter with the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.1">Jgs 7:1</a>). Perhaps this is the same spring by which Saul and his army pitched their tents prior to their battle with the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1">1 Sm 29:1</a>). The spring of Harod is at ‘Ain Jalud by the northern side of Mt Gilboa, about two miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of Zerin.</p>
<p class="list">2. Home of Shammah and Elika, two of David’s valiant warriors (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.25">2 Sm 23:25</a>). In the parallel passage (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.27">1 Chr 11:27</a>), Elika’s name is omitted and Shammah (Shammoth) is listed as a Harorite instead of a Harodite. “Harorite” reflects a later scribal error where the copyist mistook the Hebrew letter “d” for an “r.”</p>
