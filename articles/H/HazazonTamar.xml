<p class="h1">HAZAZON-TAMAR</p>
<p class="fl">City identifiable with En-gedi in <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.2">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>. During the time of Abraham, it was inhabited by Amorites who were subdued by Kedorlaomer as he and other eastern kings swept through the area (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.7">Gn 14:7</a>). It has been suggested that it may be the Tamar that Solomon fortified (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.18">1 Kgs 9:18</a>), placed by Ezekiel southeast of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.18-19">Ez 47:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.28">48:28</a>). Wadi Hasasa has apparently been named after the ancient site.</p>
