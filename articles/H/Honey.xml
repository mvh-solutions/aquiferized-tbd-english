<p class="h1">HONEY</p>
<p class="fl">Sweet syrup produced by bees (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.8">Jgs 14:8</a>), either wild (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.25-26">1 Sm 14:25-26</a>) or domesticated (apparently so in <a href="?bref=2Chr.31.5">2 Chr 31:5</a>). Sometimes, however, it may refer to thick grape syrup (as in Arabic) or date syrup (as described by Josephus). Honey was considered one of life’s necessities (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.39.26">Ecclus 39:26</a>); one must not, however, eat too much (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.16,27">Prv 25:16, 27</a>). It was part of the diet of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>) and of Immanuel (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.15">Is 7:15</a>). Its exclusion, along with leaven, from grain offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.11">Lv 2:11</a>) is undoubtedly because it is susceptible to fermentation. Its sweetness became a familiar metaphor (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.18">Jgs 14:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.10">Ps 19:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.10.9-10">Rv 10:9-10</a>).</p>
