<p class="h1">HADADEZER</p>
<p class="fl">King of Zobah in Syria during David’s reign in Israel. He apparently ruled a region from Ammon in the south to the Euphrates in the east. According to <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3-12">2 Samuel 8:3-12</a> (see also <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.3-10">1 Chr 18:3-10</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Hadarezer”), Hadadezer attempted to restore his power. David engaged him in battle at the river Euphrates and defeated him. When the Syrians came to his aid, David defeated them and occupied Damascus. In <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-19">2 Samuel 10</a> David sent servants to comfort Hanun when his father—Nahash, king of Ammon—died. The servants were mistreated and humiliated (v <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.4">4</a>). So David sent Joab against Ammon after Ammon allied with Syria as protection against Israel (v <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.6">6</a>). Joab defeated the combined armies (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.15-19">15-19</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.16,19">1 Chr 19:16, 19</a>). After Joab’s victory, Hadadezer sent more troops from “beyond the river.” The armies met at Helam, David was victorious, and Hadadezer begged for peace, thereby becoming a tributary to Israel.</p>
