<p class="fl">Building used for storage of records, annals, and decrees; a common structure in Near Eastern nations in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.17-6.1">Ezr 5:17–6:1</a>). In the archives at Ecbatana, a summer resort for Persian kings, King Darius (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>) found an edict of Cyrus (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>) that entitled the Jews to begin reconstruction of the Jerusalem temple following the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.2">Ezr 6:2</a>). On the basis of that edict, Darius gave his support to renewed reconstruction efforts, which had been halted for 16 years due to local opposition (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">Zec 1:1</a>).</p>
