<p class="h1">HYMENAEUS</p>
<p class="fl">Believer, probably of Ephesus, cited by Paul as one who “rejected conscience” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.19-20">1 Tm 1:19-20</a>) and “swerved from the truth” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.18">2 Tm 2:18</a>). In the first instance, Hymenaeus (mentioned with Alexander) is viewed as having rejected correct beliefs and made a shipwreck of his faith. The seriousness of his offense is evident, as Paul sternly relates that he has delivered him over to Satan. The meaning of this phrase is uncertain, although it might have involved physical affliction, as well as severance from the body of other Christians. The harsh action was meant to bring about, not ultimate destruction, but eventual and lasting benefit to Hymenaeus so he might learn not to blaspheme (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>). Apparently, this censure was not successful. In <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.17-18">2 Timothy 2:17-18</a>, Hymenaeus appears as one who is “upsetting the faith.” He (along with Philetus) was teaching that the resurrection had already taken place. Most probably, he was teaching that the resurrection takes place at the time of spiritual rebirth and baptism, based on a faulty interpretation of <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-11">Romans 6:1-11</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.3.1">Colossians 3:1</a>. Hymenaeus thus sought to teach a spiritualized resurrection taking place as the soul awakens from sin.</p>
