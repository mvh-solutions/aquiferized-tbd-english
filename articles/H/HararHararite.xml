<p class="h1">HARAR, HARARITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Terms applied to several names that appear in the accounts of King David’s “mighty men.” Shammah, one of David’s mightiest men, and Jonathan’s father (a different Jonathan than Saul’s son and David’s friend) is called a Hararite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.11,33">2 Sm 23:11, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.34">1 Chr 11:34</a> has “Shagee”), as is Agee, Shammah’s father (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.11">2 Sm 23:11</a>). Sharar, Ahiam’s father, is also so named (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.33">2 Sm 23:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.35">1 Chr 11:35</a> has “Sachar”). The meaning of the terms are uncertain; possibly “mountain” from the location of a village (Harar) or “mountaineer.”</p>
