<p class="h1">HAURAN</p>
<p class="fl">Region in northeastern Transjordan mentioned in Ezekiel’s description of the borders of the land (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.16-18">Ez 47:16-18</a>). In biblical times it corresponded to the modern Jebel ed-Druze of the Leja. This area is mentioned as early as the reign of Shalmaneser III of Assyria in his description of a military campaign in 841 <span class="era">BC</span>. His army marched to Mt Khauranu after a siege of Damascus and before crossing Galilee to Mt Carmel.</p>
<p>In 733–732 <span class="era">BC</span> Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria conquered Damascus and its surrounding region and organized it into provinces, one of which was Khaurina, or Hauran. The same province is mentioned in the Annals of Ashurbanipal during his campaign against the Arabians (639–637 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
