<p class="h1">HAZAR-SUSAH, HAZAR-SUSIM</p>
<p class="fl">City assigned to Simeon within the territory allotted to Judah for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.5">Jos 19:5</a>); alternately called Hazar-susim (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.31">1 Chr 4:31</a>). Solomon probably used it as a transfer point for horses brought from Egypt for sale to the Hittites and Syrians, as suggested by its name, meaning “horse station.” Hazar-susah has been identified with Sbalat Abu Susein, east of the Wadi Far’ah.</p>
