<p class="h1">HATRED</p>
<p class="fl">Intense feeling of aversion or enmity, which could prompt a person to loathe someone or something, or even to seek revenge for having been wronged. The Scriptures forbid people to hate others (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.17-18">Lv 19:17-18</a>) because it leads to sin. Indeed, hatred itself is considered murder (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.15">1 Jn 3:15</a>). We are called upon to let God, the holy one, avenge all wrongs (<a href="?bref=Pr.20.22">Prv 20:22</a>), and we are commanded by Jesus to love our enemies (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-44">Mt 5:43-44</a>).</p>
<p>Not all aspects of hatred are sinful. The Scriptures tell us that God hates evil (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.16-19">Prv 6:16-19</a>) and evil people (<a href="?bref=Ps.5.5">Ps 5:5</a>). The Scripture also has expressions such as “Jacob have I loved; Esau I have hated” (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.2-3">Mal 1:2-3</a>). This means that God elected Jacob and not Esau to be the progenitor of the chosen Jewish race. In similar fashion, would-be Christians are challenged by Jesus to hate their lives and earthly relationships if they want to follow him (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.26">Lk 14:26</a>). This means that they must choose Jesus above all else.</p>
