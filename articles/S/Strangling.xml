<p class="h1">STRANGLING</p>
<p class="fl">One of four practices from which the early gentile Christians were asked to abstain out of respect for their Jewish Christian brothers and sisters. Jewish law prohibited the eating of any meat from which the animalâ€™s blood was not fully drained at the time of slaughtering. The Jerusalem Council requested the early church to observe this practice in order to keep peace between Jewish and gentile Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.20,29">Acts 15:20, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.25">21:25</a>).</p>
<p>Strangulation was also one of four forms of capital punishment administered by the Jewish law courts. Though it was not mentioned as a method of punishment in the Bible, strangulation was later adopted by rabbinic Judaism as the mode of execution.</p>
