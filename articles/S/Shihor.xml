<p class="h1">SHIHOR</p>
<p class="fl">Body of water in Egypt. The name is Egyptian and is given as a boundary of the land to be possessed by the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.3">Jos 13:3</a>). <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.5">First Chronicles 13:5</a> refers to Shihor as the southwestern limit of Israelite settlement in the time of David. Isaiah speaks of grain from the region of Shihor as a source of income for the city of Sidon (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.3">Is 23:3</a>). Jeremiah describes Shihor as “the waters of the Nile” (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.18">Jer 2:18</a>). Some believe that the Shihor was the easternmost branch of the Nile Delta. Others identify the Shihor with the Wadi el-Arish, 90 miles (144.8 kilometers) east of the Suez Canal. Still others identify it with the Brook (or River) of Egypt, a body of water whose precise location cannot be determined with certainty.</p>
