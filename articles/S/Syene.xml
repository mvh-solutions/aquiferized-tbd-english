<p class="h1">SYENE*</p>
<p class="fl">Southern Egyptian village (modern Aswan) demarcating Egypt’s border with Ethiopia. The Hebrew form possibly derives from a word for “market” or “trading center,” reflecting the importance of the outpost as a place of commerce. The remote location of Syene made it a useful geographical reference for designating the full span of Egypt’s borders. “From Migdol to Syene” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.10">Ez 29:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.6">30:6</a>) describes Egypt from northern delta to southern border (cf. Israel’s description, “from Dan to Beersheba,” <a href="?bref=1Sam.3.20">1 Sm 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.25">1 Kgs 4:25</a>). Syene was located on the east bank of the Nile just north of the first cataract. While valued by the Egyptians as a source of granite, Syene’s fate was closely tied to Elephantine Island nearby. Elephantine was South Egypt’s administrative center and was well fortified against attack. It was at Elephantine that Jews fleeing Judea in 587 <span class="era">BC</span> found refuge and formed a colony.</p>
