<p class="h1">SHESHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Descendant of Judah through Jerahmeel, whose family line is traced in <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.25-41">1 Chronicles 2:25-41</a> to Elishama, evidently a contemporary of the writer. In verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.31">31</a> Sheshan’s son Ahlai is named, but verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.34">34</a> says that Sheshan had no sons. Perhaps two men of the same name are denoted here, or Ahlai may be identical with Attai, Sheshan’s grandson.</p>
