<p class="h1">SPINNER, SPINNING</p>
<p class="fl">Fibers were spun into yarn by women in all periods of Israelâ€™s history, but a class of professional spinners arose alongside them. Women spinners are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Exod.35.25-26">Exodus 35:25-26</a>. Among her other virtues, the good wife of <a href="?bref=Pr.31.1-31">Proverbs 31</a> engaged in spinning (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.19">Prv 31:19</a>). Jesus spoke of the lilies of the field that did not need to spin (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.28">Mt 6:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.27">Lk 12:27</a>).</p>
