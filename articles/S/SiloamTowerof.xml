<p class="h1">SILOAM, Tower of</p>
<p class="fl">Edifice that collapsed, killing 18 people. Jesus compared those killed by the fallen tower to the rest of the people living in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.4-5">Lk 13:4-5</a>). Though nothing is known of this tower, it seems reasonable to conclude that it was situated in Jerusalem. Perhaps it can be identified with the great tower built by Nehemiah on the wall of Ophel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.27.3">2Â Chr 27:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.3.26-27">Neh 3:26-27</a>) or with one of the towers built on the wall of Jerusalem near the pool of Siloam.</p>
