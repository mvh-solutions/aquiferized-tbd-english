<p class="fl">Any localized abnormality of the skin. It was a well-demarcated skin abnormality with a definite border between the inflamed or abnormal skin and the normal skin. Even the person “covered with sores” from head to toe has some normal skin between each of the sores. As such, “sore” is a broad term encompassing all the following types of skin abnormalities: scall, scab, rising, emerod, plague, and scar.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">kjv</span> uses the word “sore” in translating 32 different Hebrew or Greek words to mean “extremely,” a nonmedical use, such as “and Hezekiah wept sore” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.3">2 Kgs 20:3</a>) or “sore afraid” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.35">Ez 27:35</a>).</p>
