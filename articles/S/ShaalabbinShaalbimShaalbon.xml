<p class="h1">SHAALABBIN, SHAALBIM, SHAALBON</p>
<p class="fl">Amorite city known by three names, assigned to Dan’s tribe for an inheritance, mentioned between Ir-shemesh and Aijalon (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.42">Jos 19:42</a>). The Danites, however, were unable to defeat the Amorites and take possession of the city. When the house of Joseph grew strong, the Ephraimites conquered Shaalbim and reduced the Amorites to forced labor (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.35">Jgs 1:35</a>). Later, Shaalbim, along with the cities of Makaz, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-bethhanan made up Solomon’s second administrative district (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.9">1 Kgs 4:9</a>). Eliahba the Shaalbonite was one of David’s 30 mighty men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.32">2 Sm 23:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.33">1 Chr 11:33</a>).</p>
