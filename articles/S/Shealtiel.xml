<p class="h1">SHEALTIEL</p>
<p class="fl">Son of King Jeconiah (Jehoiachin) of Judah (598–597 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the father of Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel led the Jews back to Palestine and there ruled as governor of Judah during the postexilic period (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2">Ezr 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.2">5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.1">Neh 12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1,12-14">Hg 1:1, 12-14</a>). In the genealogies of Jesus Christ, Shealtiel is variously mentioned as the son of Jeconiah (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.12">Mt 1:12</a>) and as the son of Neri (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.27">Lk 3:27</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.17-19">1 Chronicles 3:17-19</a>, Shealtiel appears to be the grandfather or perhaps the uncle of Zerubbabel. One probable solution is that Shealtiel was the son of Neri and the heir apparent to the throne of Jeconiah and that, at Shealtiel’s death, Zerubbabel was next in succession.</p>
