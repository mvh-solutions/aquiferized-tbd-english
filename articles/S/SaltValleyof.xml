<p class="h1">SALT, Valley of</p>
<p class="fl">Valley in the southern vicinity of the Dead Sea. The Valley of Salt was the scene of two major military campaigns recorded in the OT. Initially, it was where David made a name for himself by routing the Edomite army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.13">2 Sm 8:13</a>). Abishai, one of David’s mighty men, was credited with killing 18,000 Edomites there (<a href="?bref=1Chr.18.12">1 Chr 18:12</a>). Later, King Amaziah of Judah defeated the Edomite army in this valley and captured Sela, an Edomite stronghold in the nearby hill country (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.7">2 Kgs 14:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.11">2 Chr 25:11</a>).</p>
<p>The location of the Valley of Salt is not altogether certain. Some identify it with Wadi el-Milh (meaning “salt”) east of Beersheba in Judah. A more probable suggestion is with es-Sebkha, a lifeless saline plain south of the Dead Sea positioned in the Arabah, leading to the hill country of Edom.</p>
