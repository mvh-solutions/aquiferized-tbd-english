<p class="h1">SHAPHIR</p>
<p class="fl">One of the towns spoken against by Micah the prophet (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.11">Mi 1:11</a>). Its exact location is not certain. Eusebius (a fourth-century church historian) suggested that it was a village positioned between the cities of Eleutheropolis and Ashkelon, placing Shaphir in Philistine territory. If this is correct, perhaps Shaphir is identifiable with one of three villages known as es-Suwafir near the city of Ashdod. Another possible site is Khirbet el-Kom, situated west of Hebron in the hill country of Judah.</p>
