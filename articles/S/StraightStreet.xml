<p class="h1">STRAIGHT STREET</p>
<p class="fl">Street in Damascus where Paul lodged after his encounter with the risen Jesus and where, in the house of Judas, he was baptized by Ananias and recovered his eyesight (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.11">Acts 9:11</a>). The street is called “Straight” because, unlike many others, this one was straight. It still is straight, though it is on an elevation about 15 feet (4.6 meters) higher than the original thoroughfare; it is called by this same name (Rue Droite). It runs east and west on the south boundary of the Christian quarter. The “house of Judas” is no longer there, but in a lane off the eastern end of Straight Street is the “house of Ananias.”</p>
