<p class="h1">SEA OF GLASS</p>
<p class="fl">A body of water in the vision of heaven described by John in the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.6">Rv 4:6</a>). It appears again later, in a different vision (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.2">15:2</a>), and is perhaps connected with other “sea” references in the same book (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.1">13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">21:1</a>). It probably depicts the vast expanse before God’s throne. The crystal clearness of this sea may symbolize that everything is translucent and revealed in the presence of God.</p>
