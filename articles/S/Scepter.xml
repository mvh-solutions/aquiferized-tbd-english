<p class="h1">SCEPTER</p>
<p class="fl">Long staff with an ornamental head and other decorations used to represent royal authority; a shorter staff was used as a battle mace to symbolize royal military power. It is of more than passing interest that those two ideas are also conveyed by the Bible when the word “scepter” appears in a passage. The scepter of royal authority is referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.49.10">Genesis 49:10</a>, indicating that Judah’s descendants would exercise royal authority (so also in <a href="?bref=Ps.45.6">Ps 45:6</a>, two times, and quoted in <a href="?bref=Heb.1.8">Heb 1:8</a>). Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.5,8">Am 1:5, 8</a>) refers to the royal authority of the kings of Syria and Philistia, and Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Zech.10.11">Zec 10:11</a>) refers to that of Egypt. King Ahasuerus held out this type of scepter to Esther (<a href="?bref=Esth.4.11">Est 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.5.2">5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.8.4">8:4</a>). The scepter of royal military power is referred to in <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Numbers 24:17</a> in reference to the coming messianic King. In <a href="?bref=Isa.14.5">Isaiah 14:5</a> it refers to the means by which Babylon exercised its oppressive military power, which was to be destroyed by God. <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.11,14">Ezekiel 19:11, 14</a> uses “scepter” to refer to the authority, power, and dominion that Israel lost and was not able to regain.</p>
