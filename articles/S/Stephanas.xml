<p class="h1">STEPHANAS</p>
<p class="fl">Christian believer at Corinth. He and his household were evidently Paul’s first converts in Achaia. The members of Stephanas’s family were some of the few Corinthian believers personally baptized by Paul. Stephanas and his kin were praised for their devotion and service to the Corinthian church. Stephanas, with Fortunatus and Achaicus, visited Paul at Ephesus in Asia Minor. Their mission probably included bringing aid for Paul’s personal needs and seeking his advice for resolving the problems in the Corinthian church. Undoubtedly, Paul wrote and sent his first letter to the Corinthian church with this small delegation when they returned to Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.16">1 Cor 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.15-17">16:15-17</a>).</p>
