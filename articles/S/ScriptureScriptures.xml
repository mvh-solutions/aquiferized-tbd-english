<p class="fl">The holy writings of Judaism and Christianity. Jews recognize 39 books as comprising their Scriptures. Christians recognize these same Jewish writings—categorized as Torah (Law), Prophets, and Writings—as Scripture, along with the four Gospels, 21 Epistles, the book of Acts, and Revelation. Some Christians also recognize the Apocrypha and/or Deuterocanonical books as Scripture. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BibleCanonofthe_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bible, Canon of the</a>; <a href="?item=BibleManuscriptsandTextoftheNewTestament_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bible, Manuscripts and Text of the (New Testament)</a>; <a href="?item=BibleManuscriptsandTextoftheOldTestament_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bible, Manuscripts and Text of the (Old Testament)</a>.</p>
