<p class="h1">SHAMGAR</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Anath from Beth-anath; a judge of Israel. Two brief references in the OT (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.31">Jgs 3:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.6">5:6</a>) tell us little of the man except for his one major exploit: the killing of 600 Philistines with an oxgoad. How such a feat was performed is not recorded. The oxgoad could have had a sharpened metal tip and may have been used as a spear. The timing of the reference indicates that his deeds took place early in the period of Philistine settlement in Canaan. <a href="?bref=Judg.5.6">Judges 5:6</a> would place him prior to the battle of Kishon (c. 1125 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
