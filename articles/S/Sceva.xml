<p class="h1">SCEVA</p>
<p class="fl">Father of seven sons and a Jewish chief priest in Ephesus at the time of Paul’s visit on his third missionary journey. Sceva’s sons attempted to imitate Paul’s exorcism of evil spirits in the name of Jesus. The exorcisms failed, and their authority was not recognized. Consequently, they were attacked and harmed by the evil spirits they tried to rebuke (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.14">Acts 19:14</a>).</p>
