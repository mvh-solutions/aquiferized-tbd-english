<p class="fl">Deity and shrine worshiped by Babylonians settled in Samaria by Assyria after the fall of Israel in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.30">2Â Kgs 17:30</a>). Various opinions exist as to the specific understanding of Succoth-benoth. Some suggest that it refers to a place of prostitution honoring a Babylonian deity or to a small structure housing female idols. Others suggest it refers to Sarpanitu, the consort of Marduk (a Babylonian deity), or to Marduk himself.</p>
