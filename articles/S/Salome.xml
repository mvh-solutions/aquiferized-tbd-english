<p class="h1">SALOME</p>
<p class="fl">Name deriving from the Hebrew greeting <span class="hebrew">shalom</span> (peace), with the additional letter being a Greek suffix.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Woman who followed Jesus and was perhaps Mary’s sister and the mother of James and John. In <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mark 15:40</a>, the evangelist describes the women who stood at the foot of the cross, and names three of them: Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the lesser and of Joses, and Salome. Similarly, when describing the women who arrived at the tomb at dawn, Mark recounts that Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome had brought spices to anoint the body (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mk 16:1</a>). Matthew speaks of two women named Mary, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who could have been Salome (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">Mt 27:56</a>). John speaks of four women: (1) Mary the mother of Jesus; (2) Mary the wife of Clopas; (3) Mary Magdalene; and (4) Mary’s sister—unnamed (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>). If Mary’s sister was Salome, and she and the mother of the sons of Zebedee were one and the same, then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were cousins of Jesus.</p>
<p class="list">2. Daughter of Herodias, from her first marriage to Herod Philip. Although not specifically named in <a href="?bref=Matt.14.6">Matthew 14:6</a> or <a href="?bref=Mark.6.22">Mark 6:22</a>, she is traditionally believed to be the girl whose dancing so pleased Herod that he promised her on oath anything she asked for up to half his kingdom. Prompted by her mother, she demanded the head of John the Baptist.</p>
