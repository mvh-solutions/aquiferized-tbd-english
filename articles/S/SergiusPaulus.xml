<p class="h1">SERGIUS PAULUS</p>
<p class="fl">Proconsul of Cyprus, described as a “man of intelligence” (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.7">Acts 13:7</a>). Paul and Barnabas, on their first missionary journey, evangelized the Cyprian city of Paphos, Sergius Paulus’s residence. Here they met the Jewish false prophet and sorcerer named Bar-Jesus (or Elymas), who strongly opposed their gospel message before the proconsul. Paul, however, rebuked Elymas and cursed him with blindness. When Sergius Paulus witnessed what had happened, he believed. Thus, he became the first recorded convert on Paul’s first missionary journey.</p>
<p>It is here that we find the transition from the name Saul to that of Paul. Origen and many since his time have believed that Paul made the change at this point in honor of his famous convert.</p>
