Second of the 12 sons of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.23">Gn 35:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1">1 Chr 2:1</a>) and the second son borne to him by Leah (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.33">Gn 29:33</a>). Simeon fathered six sons (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.15">Ex 6:15</a>) and settled his family in Egypt with Jacob and his brothers (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.2">1:2</a>). He was the founder of the Simeonites (<a href="?bref=Num.26.12-14">Nm 26:12-14</a>) and one of the 12 tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.1.23">1:23</a>).
