<p class="h1">BENJAMIN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Youngest of Jacob’s 12 sons and full brother to Joseph. Jacob named him Benjamin (“son of my right hand”) after his dying mother Rachel had called him Ben-oni (“son of my sorrow,” <a href="?bref=Gen.35.18">Gn 35:18</a>). After Joseph had been sold into Egypt by his half brothers, their father, Jacob, assumed that Joseph was dead and became very protective of Benjamin. Later, with Joseph controlling the plot, Benjamin was used in the reunion in Egypt of Jacob and his 12 sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.1-45.28">Gn 42–45</a>). When prophesying concerning each of his sons, Jacob spoke of Benjamin’s skill as a warrior or prophesied of the military fame of his descendants by saying, “Benjamin is a wolf that prowls. He devours his enemies in the morning, and in the evening he divides the plunder” (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.27">49:27</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BenjaminTribeof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Benjamin, Tribe of</a>.</p>
