<p class="h1">BASEMATH</p>
<p class="list">1. Daughter of Elon the Hittite. Basemath was a Canaanite woman whom Esau married against his parents’ wishes (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.34">Gn 26:34</a>). Basemath may be the same as Elon’s daughter Adah, or perhaps was her sister (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">36:2</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ishmael’s daughter, who married Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.3">Gn 36:3</a>) and bore Reuel to him (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.36.4,10">4, 10</a>). This Basemath is probably the same as Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.9">28:9</a>). Since Ishmael was the son of the patriarch Abraham, this marriage would have been more acceptable to Isaac and Rebekah (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.6-8">36:6-8</a>).</p>

<p class="sp">Identifications of #1 and #2 above are somewhat confused. Most scholars suspect that Esau married Elon’s daughter Adah (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.2-4">Gn 36:2-4</a>), who was also called Basemath (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.34">26:34</a>). Later, Esau married Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.9">28:9</a>), who was likewise called Basemath (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.3-4">36:3-4</a>). That two of Esau’s wives should be named Basemath could be because Esau chose to give both the same affectionate name, which means “fragrant.”</p>
<p class="list-space">3. King Solomon’s daughter who married Ahimaaz, the king’s administrator in Naphtali (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.15">1 Kgs 4:15</a>).</p>
