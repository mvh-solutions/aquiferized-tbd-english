<p class="h1">BURNING BUSH</p>
<p class="fl">Flaming bush on Mt Horeb, where Moses experienced God’s presence and received the commission to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-15">Ex 3:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.26">Mk 12:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.37">Lk 20:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.30-34">Acts 7:30-34</a>). The enigma of a plant burning without being consumed provided the opportunity for God to reveal his name, “<span class="divine-name">I Am Who I Am</span>.” The burning bush was a theophany, a visible revelation of God’s glory. Association of clouds, fire, and smoke with the manifestation of God’s glory is a common biblical theme (see <a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">Ex 13:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.12">2 Kgs 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.11">2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-6">Is 6:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7">2 Thes 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.14">Rv 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.12">19:12</a>).</p>
<p>The burning bush was also symbolic of God’s holiness. Moses was commanded not to approach, but to remove his shoes because the place where he was standing was holy ground (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.5">Ex 3:5</a>). Unlike the gods of Egypt, who were pictured as living in gloomy darkness, Israel’s God revealed himself as one who lives in unapproachable light (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.16">1 Tm 6:16</a>). The burning bush evidently symbolized his intent not to consume or destroy his people, but to be their savior, to lead them out of bondage in Egypt and into the Promised Land.</p>
