<p class="fl">One of a pair of distinctive rocks (Seneh was the other) flanking the road between Michmash and Gaba. Jonathan and his armor bearer scaled one of these crags to take on a Philistine outpost (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.4">1Â Sm 14:4</a>). The two rocks are still visible in the modern Wadi Suweinet. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Seneh_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Seneh</a>.</p>
