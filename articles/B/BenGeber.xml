<p class="h1">BEN-GEBER</p>
<p class="fl">Literally, “Geber’s son,” an official in King Solomon’s court who administered the sixth of 12 districts. Ben-geber’s area of responsibility began at Ramoth-gilead in northern Transjordan and extended north as far as Argob in Bashan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">1 Kgs 4:13</a>). His identification with Geber, son of Uri (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.19">19</a>), is debatable.</p>
