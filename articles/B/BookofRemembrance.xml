<p class="h1">BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE*</p>
<p class="fl">Divine record of the names of those who fear God, referred to once in the OT (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.16">Mal 3:16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> “scroll”). The prophet Malachi was struggling against moral decline in his day. Arrogant individuals were seemingly justified in their haughtiness, and evildoers were blessed materially rather than being brought to judgment. His reference to a book of remembrance suggests that God in due time would turn things around, so that there would be a proper distinction between the righteous and the wicked. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BookofLife_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Book of Life</a>.</p>
