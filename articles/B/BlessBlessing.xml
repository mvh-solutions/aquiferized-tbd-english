<p class="h1">BLESS, BLESSING</p>
<p class="fl">Pronouncement of the favor of God upon an assembled congregation. Worship services, especially observances of Holy Communion in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestant churches, usually end with a blessing spoken by the senior clergyman present. This pronouncement (called “blessing” in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches and “benediction” in most Protestant churches) is based upon the widespread biblical precedent of blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.27-29">Gn 27:27-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.22-27">Nm 6:22-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.50">Lk 24:50</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.11,14">2 Cor 13:11, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.7">Phil 4:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.16-17">2 Thes 2:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20-21">Heb 13:20-21</a>).</p>
<p>The practice of benediction or blessing is often regarded merely as a ritual of dismissal, but it is actually a pronouncement of God’s gracious favor, to be given only by his ministers on the authority of Holy Scripture to faithful believers. In this action Christians are assured that the grace of God the Father, the love of the Son, and the communion of the Holy Spirit are with them.</p>
<p>The term “blessing” is also applied to thanksgiving for food and drink (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.19">Mt 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.7">Mk 8:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.30">Lk 24:30</a>).</p>
