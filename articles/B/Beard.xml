<p class="h1">BEARD</p>
<p class="fl">Hair growing on the lower part of a man’s face, worn as a sign of maturity among all ancient Semitic peoples, including the Israelites. Among the Israelites, care of the beard took on religious significance (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.27">Lv 19:27</a>). Levitical law prohibited priests from shaving their heads or clipping their beards (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.5-6">21:5-6</a>). David’s ambassadors to an Ammonite king were humiliated by having one side of their beards shaved off by the Ammonites. That indignity and others led to war (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-8">2 Sm 10:1-8</a>). Removal of an Israelite’s beard, however, was considered appropriate under certain circumstances. Suspicion of leprosy on the head or face required shaving around the suspected spot to permit better diagnosis (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.29-37">Lv 13:29-37</a>). A shaven head, along with wailing and the wearing of sackcloth, was a way of proclaiming impending or prevailing doom (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.1-3">Is 15:1-3</a>). Ezra dramatized Israel’s spiritual disaster by pulling hair out of his head and beard (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.3">Ezr 9:3</a>).</p>
