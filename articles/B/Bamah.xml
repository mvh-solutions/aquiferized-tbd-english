<p class="h1">BAMAH</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word meaning height, ridge, or elevation in the topography of the land (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.19,25">2 Sm 1:19, 25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.22.34">22:34</a>); transliterated into English once (<a href="?bref=Ezek.20.29">Ez 20:29</a>; see <span class="sc">nlt</span>). It is a term designating hills or mountains overlooking the Arnon River (<a href="?bref=Num.21.28">Nm 21:28</a>). The plural form (Bamoth) alone or as the first part of a compound is used for the name of towns in Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.21.19-20">Nm 21:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.22.41">22:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.17">Jos 13:17</a>).</p>
<p>Metaphorically, the word connotes a place of security (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.13">Dt 32:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.3.19">Hb 3:19</a>), as well as the high ground that a military commander wished to control in battle. Possession of an enemy’s “heights” was synonymous with subjection of that enemy (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.29">Dt 33:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.2">Ez 36:2</a>). The word seems to combine both literal and figurative connotations in several references to Jerusalem, a “high place” in ruin overgrown with scrub vegetation (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.12">Mi 3:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Jer.26.18">Jer 26:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.1-2">Ez 36:1-2</a>). “High place” was also a special, or technical, term in Canaanite religion, designating a local shrine on a hill near a town or village, in contrast to the large temples located throughout the land.</p>
