<p class="h1">BAR-JESUS</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish sorcerer, a “false prophet” who worked with the governor of Paphos on the island of Cyprus (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.6">Acts 13:6</a>). When the governor, Sergius Paulus, took an interest in the message of Paul and Barnabas, Bar-Jesus tried to influence him against their teachings. Paul confronted Bar-Jesus, denounced him as a “son of the devil,” and predicted that a temporary blindness would come upon him as a punishment from God. Bar-Jesus was instantly blinded (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.7-12">Acts 13:7-12</a>), and the governor apparently became a Christian.</p>
<p>The many superstitious people of that day were easy prey for wonder-workers like Bar-Jesus (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.8.9-11">Acts 8:9-11</a>). The term “sorcerer” applied to him, however, connoted more than just a magician. It often referred to a wise man whose scientific understanding supposedly exceeded that of most others in that society.</p>
<p>Bar-Jesus was also called Elymas, which was his Greek name (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.8">Acts 13:8</a>). It was common practice for Jews with contacts in both cultures to adopt a Greek name. According to one view, Elymas is based on an Aramaic word for “strong” and an Arabic word for “wise,” which actually means “magician.”</p>
