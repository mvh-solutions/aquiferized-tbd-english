<p class="h1">BAAL-ZEPHON</p>
<p class="fl">Area opposite the Israelites’ encampment just before they crossed the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.2,9">Ex 14:2, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.7">Nm 33:7</a>). The exact location of Baal-zephon is unknown but probably was in northeast Egypt. The name means “lord of the north,” and a shrine to a Semitic deity was presumably located there. The god Baal-zephon is mentioned in Ugaritic, Egyptian, and Phoenician writings as a sea and storm god.</p>
