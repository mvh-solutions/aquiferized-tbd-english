<p class="h1">BABA BATHRA*</p>
<p class="fl">Tractate, or treatise, in the Talmudic Mishnah (a body of Jewish traditional lore relating to Hebrew law). The Mishnah is divided into six main sections called orders, with each order containing from 7 to 12 tractates. A tractate is divided into chapters, the chapters into sections of legal paragraphs. <span class="ital">Baba Bathra,</span> which means “last gate,” is the third tractate in the fourth order, <span class="ital">Nezikin</span> (“damages”). It is preceded by <span class="ital">Baba Kamma</span> (“first gate”) and <span class="ital">Baba Metzia</span> (“middle gate”). The three (originally one tractate) deal with various issues concerning property. Specifically, <span class="ital">Baba Bathra</span> covers the ownership of real estate and problems relating to it. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Mishnah_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Mishnah</a>.</p>
