<p class="h1">BAHARUM*, BAHARUMITE*, BAHURIM </p>
<p class="fl">Village in Benjamin’s territory on the old road connecting Jericho and Jerusalem, east of the Mt of Olives. Bahurim was located at the site of the present Ras et-Temim. Palti parted from his wife, Michal, there at Abner’s command when Michal was being returned to King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.16">2 Sm 3:16</a>). At Bahurim, Shimei cursed David and threw stones at him and his servants (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.5">2 Sm 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.16">19:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.8">1 Kgs 2:8</a>). Jonathan and Ahimaaz, spying for David, were hidden from Absalom’s soldiers in a well there (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.18">2 Sm 17:18</a>). One of David’s mighty men, Azmaveth, came from Bahurim (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.31">2 Sm 23:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.33">1 Chr 11:33</a>).</p>
