<p class="h1">BERIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Asher’s son, who migrated to Egypt with his family, relatives, and grandfather Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.17">Gn 46:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.30">1 Chr 7:30</a>). His descendants were called Beriites (<a href="?bref=Num.26.44">Nm 26:44</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ephraim’s youngest son, born after several of his brothers were killed at Gath for cattle rustling (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.20-23">1 Chr 7:20-23</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Elpaal’s son, head of a family in Benjamin’s tribe. This Beriah lived at Aijalon and helped repel invaders from Gath (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.13">1 Chr 8:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Shimei’s son, a Levite of Gershon’s clan who served in the temple at Jerusalem. Because neither Beriah nor his brother Jeush had many sons, their families were counted as a single subclan in the Levitical system (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.10-11">1 Chr 23:10-11</a>).</p>
