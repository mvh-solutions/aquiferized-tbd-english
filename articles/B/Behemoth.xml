<p class="h1">BEHEMOTH</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word in plural form usually translated “beasts” or “wild animals” (as in <a href="?bref=Deut.28.26">Dt 28:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.24">32:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.50.10">Ps 50:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.18.6">Is 18:6</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.6.49,51">2 Esd 6:49, 51</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.2.17">Hb 2:17</a>). Most English versions refer only once to “behemoth,” where the context seems to refer to a specific animal, large and powerful, believed by many biblical scholars to be the hippopotamus (<a href="?bref=Job.40.15">Jb 40:15</a>). In ancient times, the hippopotamus was well known in Egypt and may have inhabited the Jordan Valley. <a href="?bref=Job.40.23">Job 40:23</a> may, however, refer to any river swollen like the Jordan in flood season.</p>
