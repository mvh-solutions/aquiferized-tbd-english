<p class="h1">BELIEVERS</p>
<p class="fl">Those who believe; in the NT, specifically, those who believe in Jesus as Lord and follow him (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.14">Acts 5:14</a>). One would expect the term “believers” (sometimes translated “faithful”) to be a title for Christians, since the NT stresses belief in Jesus. Although NT authors emphasized believing, they rarely used the term “believer” as a name for Christians. There are a few clear examples (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.32">Acts 4:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.45">10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.12">1 Tm 4:12</a>), but in other places the term is a description, not a name (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.44">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">15:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.27">18:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.3">1 Tm 4:3</a>). As a name, “believer” points to the personal commitment of Christians to Jesus. Christians were called not merely to believe something but to give themselves to someone.</p>
