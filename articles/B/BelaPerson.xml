<p class="h1">BELA (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Beor’s son, a king of Edom who ruled before Israel had a king (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.31-33">Gn 36:31-33</a>). Because Balaam, the pagan prophet from north Syria, also had a father named Beor (<a href="?bref=Num.22.5">Nm 22:5</a>), some ancients and a number of modern critical scholars have confused the Edomite Bela with Balaam.</p>
<p class="list">2. Benjamin’s oldest son (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.21">Gn 46:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.8.1">1 Chr 8:1</a>), whose descendants were called Belaites (<a href="?bref=Num.26.38">Nm 26:38</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Azaz’s son, a descendant of Reuben who lived in Gilead in Transjordan. So vast were his family’s holdings that they pastured their cattle as far east as the Euphrates River (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.8-9">1 Chr 5:8-9</a>). In the reign of Saul, his family successfully held their land against Hagrite opposition.</p>
