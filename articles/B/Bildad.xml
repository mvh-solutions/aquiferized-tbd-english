<p class="h1">BILDAD</p>
<p class="fl">One of three friends who came to comfort Job in his anguish, identified as a Shuhite (<a href="?bref=Job.2.11">Jb 2:11</a>). That term suggests that he was a descendant of Shuah, son of Abraham and his second wife Keturah (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.1-2">Gn 25:1-2</a>). Bildad spoke to Job on three occasions. In his first speech he asserted that God upholds the just and punishes the wicked (<a href="?bref=Job.8.1-22">Jb 8</a>). Job must therefore be a hypocrite to say that he is right with God. In his second speech Bildad emphasized the immediate punishment of the wicked in this life (ch <a href="?bref=Job.18.1-21">18</a>). Job must therefore be wicked because of his intense suffering. In his third speech Bildad proclaimed the majesty of God and called man a worm by comparison (ch <a href="?bref=Job.25.1-6">25</a>). He implied that Job was foolish to claim to be righteous before such a holy God.</p>
