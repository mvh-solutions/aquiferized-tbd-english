<p class="h1">BETH-LEAPHRAH</p>
<p class="fl">Town mentioned by the prophet Micah. Since Beth-leaphrah (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “house of Aphrah”) means “house of dust,” Micah made a sarcastic pun by telling its idolatrous inhabitants to “roll in the dust” (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.10">Mi 1:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
