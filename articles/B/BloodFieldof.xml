<p class="fl">Name given to the field purchased with the “blood money” Judas accepted to betray Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.8">Mt 27:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.19">Acts 1:19</a>). The field was purchased by the chief priests as a burial ground for strangers (formerly, the potter’s field). Judas hanged himself and his intestines burst open there. This account uses the Aramaic expression <span class="ital">Akeldama</span> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Aceldama”), translated “field of blood.” The Akeldama is situated on the southern slope of the valley of Hinnom near the Kidron Valley.</p>
