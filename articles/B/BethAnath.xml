<p class="h1">BETH-ANATH</p>
<p class="fl">Town assigned to Naphtaliâ€™s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.38">Jos 19:38</a>) from which the tribe failed to drive out the original inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.33">Jgs 1:33</a>). The Israelites, who often made slaves of the remaining Canaanite people, were in many cases eventually corrupted by their pagan religious practices.</p>
