<p class="h1">BEAM</p>
<p class="list">1. Weaver’s beam—round wooden roller on which the cloth or carpet was wound during the weaving process in Bible times. The spears of the giant Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.7">1 Sm 17:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.19">2 Sm 21:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.5">1 Chr 20:5</a>) and an Egyptian killed by Benaiah, one of David’s mighty men (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.23">1 Chr 11:23</a>), were compared to a weaver’s beam.</p>
<p class="list">2. Tree trunk or log that has been squared and used for building purposes. King Solomon used beams and planks of cedar to build the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.9">1 Kgs 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.7">2 Chr 3:7</a>) and his “House of the Forest of Lebanon” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.2,12">1 Kgs 7:2, 12</a>). Another mention of cedar beams probably refers to their aroma (<a href="?bref=Song.1.17">Sg 1:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Crossbeam of a Hebrew balance from which the scales were hung by cords.</p>
<p class="list">4. Beam (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or log (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) referred to by Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.3-5">Mt 7:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.41-42">Lk 6:41-42</a>). Jesus contrasted the beam in an accuser’s eye with the mote (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or speck (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) in his brother’s eye.</p>
