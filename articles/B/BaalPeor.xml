<p class="h1">BAAL-PEOR</p>
<p class="fl">Moabite god worshiped on Mt Peor. It is probable that this god was Chemosh, the national deity of Moab. While camped in Shittim, the Israelites were seduced by Moabite women who persuaded them to worship “Baal of Peor” (<a href="?bref=Num.25.3">Nm 25:3</a>). For that act of idolatry, God struck Israel with a plague that killed 24,000 persons (<a href="?bref=Num.25.9">Nm 25:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.28-31">Ps 106:28-31</a>). Baal-peor is also spoken of as the place where Israel worshiped “the Baal of Peor” (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.3">Dt 4:3</a>).</p>
