<p class="h1">BEAUTIFUL GATE</p>
<p class="fl">Gate of Herod’s temple in Jerusalem where a man born lame was miraculously healed through the ministry of Peter and John (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.2,10">Acts 3:2, 10</a>). The location of this gate is uncertain, but it was probably the gate leading from the Court of the Gentiles into the Women’s Court, called the Corinthian Gate (for its Corinthian bronze) by the Jewish historian Josephus. According to him, it measured 75 feet (22.9 meters) high by 60 feet (18.3 meters) wide. A burial inscription found on Mt Olivet attributes the building of the gate to an Alexandrian Jew named Nicanor.</p>
