<p class="h1">BAALATH-BEER</p>
<p class="fl">Place-name meaning “mistress” or “lady of the well.” Like the masculine counterpart Baal, Baalath often appears in a compound place-name. It seems to suggest that the Canaanite goddess Baalath, patron of Byblos, was associated with the particular place or well. Baalath-beer was the name of a town in Simeon’s tribe, also identified as Baal or Baalath (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.33">1 Chr 4:33</a>), Ramah of the Negev (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.8">Jos 19:8</a>), and Ramoth of the Negev (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.27">1 Sm 30:27</a>). It may have marked the southern limits of Simeon’s inheritance.</p>
