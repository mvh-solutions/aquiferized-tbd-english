<p class="h1">BARACHIAH, BARACHIAS*</p>
<p class="fl">Name attributed in the NT to Zechariah’s father (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.35">Mt 23:35</a>). Zechariah, executed in the temple by order of King Joash, was said to be the son of Jehoiada (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20-22">2 Chr 24:20-22</a>). “Son of Barachiah” could be a copyist’s addition, since in the parallel passage in Luke’s Gospel (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.51">Lk 11:51</a>) the name does not appear in the most reliable manuscripts. A copyist may have confused the martyred Zechariah with the postexilic prophet Zechariah, whose father was Berechiah (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1,7">Zec 1:1, 7</a>).</p>
