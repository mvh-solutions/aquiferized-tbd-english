<p class="h1">BEMA*</p>
<p class="fl">Greek term for a judgment seat or tribunal of a Roman official. Although the term also means “to step” or “stride,” it was used in the first century <span class="era">AD</span> primarily to denote an elevated area or platform (reached by steps) from which political orations or judicial decisions were made. Excavations in the city of Corinth have revealed a large, elaborately decorated <span class="greek">bema</span> located in the center of the marketplace.</p>
<p>In the NT, Jesus was questioned before the judgment seat of Pilate (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.19">Mt 27:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.13">Jn 19:13</a>). Herod Agrippa I addressed the people of Tyre and Sidon from a <span class="greek">bema</span> (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.21">Acts 12:21</a>). The apostle Paul was brought before the tribunal of Gallio in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">18:12-17</a>) and again before Festus’s tribunal in Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.6,10,17">25:6, 10, 17</a>).</p>
<p>In two passages, Paul used the term to refer to God’s judgment seat. In <a href="?bref=Rom.14.10">Romans 14:10</a> he warned those who would arrogantly judge others that all must stand before the tribunal of God. According to <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, the merits of each person’s work will be determined before the judgment seat of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.13-15">1 Cor 3:13-15</a>).</p>
