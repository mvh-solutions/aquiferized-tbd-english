<p class="h1">BASKAMA</p>
<p class="fl">Site where Trypho, commander of the Seleucid army, killed his captive, Jonathan Maccabeus. Trypho was holding Jonathan hostage, and when Jonathan was no longer useful, Trypho put him to the sword (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.42-13.23">1 Macc 12:42–13:23</a>). Exactly where Baskama is located is unknown. The most popular suggestion is Tell el-Jummeizeh (“sycamore tree”) near the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee. That Arabic name is perhaps related to Baskama, which can mean “house of the sycamore.” Ancient ruins there might have been a shrine to Jonathan, a great hero. The Jewish historian Josephus calls the spot Basaca.</p>
