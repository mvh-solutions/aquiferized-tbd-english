<p class="h1">BETH-PEOR</p>
<p class="fl">Moabite city given to Reuben’s tribe in the partitioning of the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.20">Jos 13:20</a>). Prior to the Israelites’ entrance into the land of Canaan, they made camp in a valley opposite Beth-peor. Here the people assembled to hear Moses’ final message after he had viewed the land from the top of Mt Pisgah (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.29">Dt 3:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.46">4:46</a>). It was here that Moses was buried, having been forbidden to enter the territory promised the descendants of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.6">Dt 34:6</a>). Baal-peor (or Baal of Peor) was the name of a local deity worshiped in this region (<a href="?bref=Num.25.3-5">Nm 25:3-5</a>).</p>
