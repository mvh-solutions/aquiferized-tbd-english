<p class="h1">BETHANY</p>
<p class="list">1. Village on the eastern slope of the Mt of Olives about a mile and a half (2.4 kilometers) east of Jerusalem. Jesus and his disciples sometimes stayed in Bethany when in Judea, as when they attended temple observances during Passover (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.17">Mt 21:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.11">Mk 11:11</a>). Jesus was eating at the home of Simon the leper in Bethany when a woman came and anointed his head with costly perfume (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">Mt 26:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9">Mk 14:3-9</a>). Bethany was also the home of Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus, where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.1,18">Jn 11:1, 18</a>). The village was near Bethphage on an approach to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.1">Mk 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.29">Lk 19:29</a>) that Jesus followed in preparation for his triumphal entry into Jerusalem. In Bethany Jesus blessed his disciples after the resurrection and parted from them (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.50">Lk 24:50</a>). Today the town is called el-Azariyeh (the place of Lazarus).</p>
<p class="list">2. Village on “the other side of the Jordan” (the east side), where John the Baptist baptized (<a href="?bref=John.1.28">Jn 1:28</a>).</p>
