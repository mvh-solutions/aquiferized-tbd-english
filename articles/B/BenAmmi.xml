<p class="h1">BEN-AMMI</p>
<p class="fl">Son born to Lot and his younger daughter. A similar incestuous liaison between Lot and his older daughter produced a son named Moab. The two sons are identified as the ancestral heads of the Ammonite and Moabite peoples (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.38">Gn 19:38</a>).</p>
<p>Although the promise made to Abraham could have been enjoyed by Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">Gn 11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-4">12:1-4</a>), Lot went his own way (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.2-12">13:2-12</a>) and failed to trust the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.15-23">19:15-23</a>). Lot’s relationship to Abraham, however, evoked deferential treatment by the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.8-19">Dt 2:8-19</a>) toward these occasionally powerful enemies (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.1-12">2 Chr 20:1-12</a>).</p>
