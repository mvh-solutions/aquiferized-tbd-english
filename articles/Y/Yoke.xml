<p class="h1">YOKE</p>
<p class="fl">The wooden bar that allowed two (or more) draft animals to be coupled (yoked) so that they might effectively work together (<a href="?bref=Num.19.2">Nm 19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.19">1 Kgs 19:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.1.3">Jb 1:3</a>). In addition to this literal usage, the Bible frequently uses the term metaphorically to refer to work or bondage (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.13">Lv 26:13</a>). The yoke of bondage was applied not only by foreign oppressors but often by Israel’s own kings as well (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.4-14">1 Kgs 12:4-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.10.4-14">2 Chr 10:4-14</a>). In prophetic writings, the yoke of bondage was generally associated with divine judgment (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.14">Lam 1:14</a>), so that deliverance was represented as God breaking the yoke that had enslaved Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.4">Is 9:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.27">10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.25">14:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.6">58:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.20">Jer 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.5.5">5:5</a>). The yoke of bondage figured prominently in Jeremiah’s dispute with Hananiah’s prophecy concerning Judah’s imminent release from Babylonian captivity (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.8-11">Jer 27:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-17">28:1-17</a>). In the NT, Jesus transforms “yoke” into a positive term by calling on people to take up his yoke, which is not burdensome, and he will give them rest for their souls (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29-30">Mt 11:29-30</a>).</p>
