<p class="h1">REPHIDIM</p>
<p class="fl">Camping place of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, following their exodus from Egypt. <a href="?bref=Exod.17.1">Exodus 17:1</a> lists Rephidim as Israel’s stopping place after the wilderness of Sin. <a href="?bref=Num.33.12-15">Numbers 33:12-15</a>, however, specifies that after the wilderness of Sin, they camped at Dophkah and Alush, then Rephidim, before they journeyed on to the Sinai wilderness.</p>
<p>Several incidents occurred at Rephidim during the wilderness travels of Israel. Upon arriving at Rephidim, the Israelites learned that there was no water to drink. The thirsty, disgruntled people complained to Moses. In reply, Moses struck a rock in Horeb with his staff (according to the Lord’s instruction) and water flowed out to satisfy the nation. Moses, however, named Rephidim Massah (meaning testing) and Meribah (meaning quarreling) because of Israel’s doubt of the Lord’s presence and provision (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1-7">Ex 17:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>Rephidim was the site near which the Israelites, led by Joshua, engaged the Amalekites in battle. The Lord promised to grant Israel victory as long as Moses kept his hands in the air. With the assistance of Hur and Aaron, Moses held up his hands for the duration of the day, and the Israelites prevailed over the Amalekites.</p>

<p>The location of Rephidim is uncertain. Some suggest Wadi Refayid in southwest Sinai. Others variously place it near modern Jebel Musa at Wadi Feiran or at Wadi es-Sheykh.</p>
