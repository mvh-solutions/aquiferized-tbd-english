<p class="h1">REHOBOTH</p>
<p class="list">1. KJV name for Rehoboth-Ir, a city built by Nimrod, in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.11">Genesis 10:11</a>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=RehobothIr_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Rehoboth-Ir</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Site of the third well dug by Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.22">Gn 26:22</a>). This time Abimelech and the herdsmen of Gerar did not lay claim to it, and Isaac named the well “broad places” or “room.” The well was located about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) southwest of Beersheba.</p>
<p class="list">3. Home of Shaul, an Edomite ruler (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.37">Gn 36:37</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.48">1 Chr 1:48</a>). The place is identified as “on the river,” a frequent biblical reference to the Euphrates. Hence, versions such as the <span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>, and <span class="sc">nlt</span> insert “Euphrates” into the text.</p>
