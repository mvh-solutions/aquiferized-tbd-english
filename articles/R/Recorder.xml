<p class="h1">RECORDER</p>
<p class="fl">The title of a high public official from David’s reign until the end of the Israelite monarchy. Though precise duties are never specified in the OT, the recorder probably kept the official log or ledger and advised the king from the information available to him. A recorder is mentioned with other leading officers in <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.16">2 Samuel 8:16</a>, <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.24">20:24</a>, and <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.3">1 Kings 4:3</a>. The recorder spoke for Hezekiah in his dealings with Rabshekah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.18">2 Kgs 18:18</a>), and during Josiah’s reign, supervised temple repairs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.8">2 Chr 34:8</a>).</p>
