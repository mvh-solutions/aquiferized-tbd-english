<p class="h1">RAAMA*, RAAMAH</p>
<p class="fl">One of Cush’s five sons and a descendant of Ham’s line. He was the father of Sheba and Dedan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.7">Gn 10:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.9">1 Chr 1:9</a>). <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.22">Ezekiel 27:22</a> mentions the people of Sheba and Raamah trading spices and precious stones with the merchants of Tyre. Raamah’s name was later given to a town perhaps identifiable with Ma’in in southwest Arabia.</p>
