<p class="h1">RAISIN CAKE</p>
<p class="fl">Culinary delicacy of ancient peoples (<a href="?bref=Isa.16.7">Is 16:7</a>). The cakes resisted deterioration and thus were useful for soldiers and travelers (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.19">2Â Sm 6:19</a>). They were used as cultic offerings (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.1">Hos 3:1</a>) and sometimes served as aphrodisiacs (<a href="?bref=Song.2.5">Sg 2:5</a>).</p>
