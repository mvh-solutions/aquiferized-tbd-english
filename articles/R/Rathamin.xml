<p class="h1">RATHAMIN*</p>
<p class="fl">A territory transferred from the dominion of Samaria to Judah by Demetrius of Syria. A letter from Demetrius to his adjutant Lasthenes authorizing the transfer is mentioned in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.34">1 Maccabees 11:34</a>. The word is sometimes translated Ramathaim (<span class="sc">nlt</span>), the birthplace of Samuel and home of Elkanah and Hannah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1,19">1 Sm 1:1, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.19">2:19</a>). In that case, it figures prominently in OT history, for there Saul first made acquaintance with Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.6,10">9:6, 10</a>), there Samuel retreated after his last break with Saul, and there Samuel’s grave is located (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">25:1</a>). Textual variants Armathaim (<span class="sc">tev</span> “Arimathea”) and Ramatha are partly explained by the transposition of <span class="ital">m</span> and <span class="ital">th</span> in the Septuagint version. Two modern sites are recommended for the ancient district: Beit Rime, 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) east and north of Lydda, and Ramallah, 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) north of Jerusalem.</p>
