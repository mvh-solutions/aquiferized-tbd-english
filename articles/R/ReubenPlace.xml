<p class="fl">Territory east of the Jordan given to Reuben’s tribe on the condition that they assist in taking Canaan west of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>). Moses agreed to the Reubenites’ request for lands suitable for cattle grazing. The area was bordered on the south by the Arnon River, on the north and east by the wadi of Heshbon and the Ammonite kingdom, and on the west by the Jordan and Dead Sea. Reubenites dwelt there until taken into captivity by Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria around 732 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
