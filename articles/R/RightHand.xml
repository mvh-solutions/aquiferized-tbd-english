<p class="h1">RIGHT HAND</p>
<p class="fl">The word “right” in the Bible is often used in the sense of “being straight”; it is used to describe that which is just or righteous (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.18.25">Gn 18:25</a>). Figuratively speaking, God’s right hand is the means whereby victories are obtained for the people of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.17.7,98">Pss 17:7, 98:1</a>); it is also an instrument of punishment for the ungodly (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.16">Hb 2:16</a>). While the right hand of man is impotent to save (<a href="?bref=Job.40.14">Jb 40:14</a>), God’s right hand sustains his children in the hour of need (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.10">Ps 139:10</a>). Furthermore, God promises to strengthen the right hand of the person he purposes to help (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.13">Is 41:13</a>).</p>
<p>To be at the right hand of God is to occupy a place of the choicest blessings (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.11">Ps 16:11</a>); it is the place where the Lord Jesus Christ now reigns in glory and intercedes for those he has redeemed (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.34">Rom 8:34</a>).</p>
<p>To offer the right hand of fellowship is to extend the warmest and most accepting type of camaraderie (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>). Giving the right hand as the sign of a pledge also has a biblical antecedent (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.15">2 Kgs 10:15</a>).</p>
<p>Although the left hand is often linked to blessings (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.16">Prv 3:16</a>), it may also be associated with treachery or other undesirable activity (<a href="?bref=Eccl.10.2">Eccl 10:2</a>).</p>
