<p class="h1">REHOBOTH-IR</p>
<p class="fl">Name meaning “broad places of the city.” It was the second city built by Nimrod the hunter (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Asshur”) in Assyria (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.11">Gn 10:11</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Rehoboth”). Opinion differs as to whether it was a distinct municipality (a suburb of Nineveh) or, since the name of the town is not mentioned in Assyrian literature, open squares or broad streets within Nineveh itself.</p>
