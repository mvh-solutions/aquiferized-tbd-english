<p class="h1">RECAB</p>
<p class="list">1. Rimmon’s son who, with his brother Baanah, commanded bands of raiders under Saul’s son Ishbosheth. Hoping to please David, they killed Ishbosheth. David, however, angered with this killing, had the two put to death (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.1-3,5-12">2 Sm 4:1-3, 5-12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Father of Jehonadab (or Jonadab), the violent supporter of Jehu who killed Ahab’s supporters in Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.15-27">2 Kgs 10:15-27</a>). Jeremiah refers to the followers and descendants of Recab as Recabites. These were nomadic people who lived by Jonadab’s command that his descendants not drink wine, live in houses, sow seed, or plant vineyards. Jeremiah applauded the Recabites’ loyalty to their forebear, contrasting them with Judah and Jerusalem’s unfaithfulness to God. Jeremiah predicted doom for Judah and Jerusalem but promised that Recabites would be preserved (<a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-19">Jer 35:1-19</a>).</p>
