<p class="h1">WATCHTOWER</p>
<p class="fl">Platform from which farmers protected their land and livestock and from which soldiers guarded their cities. Watchtowers were built in the vineyards of Palestine. From the tower the watchman was assigned to oversee the vineyard, protecting it from wild animals and thieves (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.2">Is 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.33">Mt 21:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.1">Mk 12:1</a>). Such structures are still used for similar purposes in Palestine and serve as the living quarters for the vineyard workers. Some watchtowers, like the tower of Eder (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.21">Gn 35:21</a>), were constructed in wilderness areas. They provided a protected shelter for shepherds to watch their flocks and a fortified outpost for sentinels to guard a city and to safeguard its commerce from marauding bandits (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.8">2 Kgs 18:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.24">2 Chr 20:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.14">Is 32:14</a>).</p>
