<p class="h1">WITNESS, Altar of</p>
<p class="fl">Altar built by the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the frontier of Israel near the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.10-34">Jos 22:10-34</a>). The building of the altar incited the remainder of Israel to threaten war for the presumed treachery. After the Transjordanian tribes explained their motives and Phinehas mediated the conflict, the altar was called “Witness” as a memorial of the resulting treaty.</p>
