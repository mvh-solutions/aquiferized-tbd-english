<p class="h1">WATCH</p>
<p class="fl">Time unit for the division of the night in both the OT and NT. During the OT period, the night was divided into three military watches. The beginning or evening watch ran from sunset to roughly 10:00 <span class="sc">pm</span> (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.19">Lam 2:19</a>); the middle or night watch was from 10:00 <span class="sc">pm</span> to 2:00 <span class="sc">am</span> (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.19">Jgs 7:19</a>); and the morning watch was from approximately 2:00 <span class="sc">am</span> until sunrise (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.24">Ex 14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.11">1Â Sm 11:11</a>). During the Roman period, the number of watches was increased from three to four. These were either described by number (first, second, etc.) or as evening, midnight, cock-crowing, and morning (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.25">Mt 14:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.48">Mk 6:48</a>). The respective watches ended at roughly 9:00 <span class="sc">pm</span>, midnight, 3:00 <span class="sc">am</span>, and 6:00 <span class="sc">am</span>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Night_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Night</a>.</p>
