<p class="h1">WADI*</p>
<p class="fl">Intermittent stream or torrent in the arid and semiarid regions of the Middle East. Although the streambeds were usually dry, they could attain flood stage during spring runoff or after heavy rainfalls. The most significant wadi in the Bible was the Wadi of Egypt (“Brook of Egypt” in modern versions), which served as the southwestern border of Canaan according to God’s instructions to Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.34.5">Nm 34:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.15.4,47">Jos 15:4, 47</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.65">1 Kgs 8:65</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.12">Is 27:12</a>). During the dry periods, wadis were important as roadways.</p>
