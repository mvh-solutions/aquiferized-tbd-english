<p class="h1">WISDOM OF JESUS BEN SIRACH</p>
<p class="fl">Deuterocanonical book that is also known as Ecclesiasticus (to be distinguished from the canonical book Ecclesiastes). The author is generally referred to as Jesus ben Sirach; however, in recently discovered Hebrew manuscripts, his name is given as Simon son of Jesus son of Eleazar ben Sirach. He was a Hebrew sage who lived in the beginning of the second century <span class="era">BC</span> and who taught in Jerusalem (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.50.27">Ecclus 50:27</a>; cf. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.51.23">51:23ff</a>.). The work bears the imprint of a man steeped in a tradition later known as Sadducean.</p>
<p>This work was valued highly by both Jews and Christians. The author was a scribe who wished to give his teachings a more permanent form, for which he utilized the canonical Proverbs as a model. His instruction adheres closely to Jewish orthodoxy. The book was probably written about 180 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
