<p class="h1">FIERY SERPENT*</p>
<p class="fl">Bronze symbol of a snake made by Moses on God’s instruction to save the Israelites.</p>
<p>Deadly snakes were sent by God to punish the Israelites for their rebellious grumblings, many of whom died from the poisonous bites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Nm 21:4-9</a>). Recognizing their sin, they cried out to God for deliverance, and he instructed Moses to make a fiery (bronze) serpent and set it on a pole. Healing was granted to those who gazed at the uplifted figure.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ referred to the bronze serpent incident as a symbol of the saving power of his crucifixion. A person who looks in faith to the uplifted Christ will receive deliverance from sin and have eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-15">Jn 3:14-15</a>). The apostle Paul also drew upon the OT event as a warning to those who might arrogantly test God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.9">1 Cor 10:9</a>).</p>
