<p class="fl">Small harbor, identifiable with modern Limenes Kali, positioned along Crete’s southern coast about five miles (8.1 kilometers) east of Cape Matala near the city of Lasea. Here Paul’s ship sought shelter from contrary winds on his voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.8">Acts 27:8</a>).</p>
