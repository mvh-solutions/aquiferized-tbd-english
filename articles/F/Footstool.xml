<p class="h1">FOOTSTOOL</p>
<p class="fl">Low stool used to support one’s feet. Part of King Solomon’s great revenue of gold was used to fashion a footstool for his ivory throne (<a href="?bref=2Chr.9.18">2 Chr 9:18</a>). The word is frequently used metaphorically. Both the ark of the covenant and the temple are referred to as God’s footstool because they were places where God rested (his glory resided there) and reigned (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.2">1 Chr 28:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.5">Pss 99:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.7">132:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.2.1">Lam 2:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">Is 60:13</a>). The enemies of the Messiah were to become his footstool; that is, they would be fully subjected to him by the power of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Ps 110:1</a>). Many of the NT references to a footstool (lit. “something under the foot”) parallel the OT expectation of the final conquest of Messiah’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.44">Mt 22:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.36">Mk 12:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.43">Lk 20:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.35">Acts 2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">Heb 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.13">10:13</a>).</p>
