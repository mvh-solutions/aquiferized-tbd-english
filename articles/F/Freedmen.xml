<p class="h1">FREEDMEN*</p>
<p class="fl">Members of a Jewish synagogue in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>), descended from Jews who had been captured and taken to Rome by the general Pompey (106–48 <span class="era">BC</span>), then later released. Pompey found that the Jews adhered so strictly to their religious and national customs that they were worthless as slaves.</p>
<p>Not all the freedmen returned to Jerusalem; some stayed in Rome. In the time of the Roman writer Pliny, a freedman was described as a “mean commoner.” The freedmen (or “Freed Slaves,” <span class="sc">nlt</span>) derived their name from a Latin term for one manumitted, or the son of such a former slave. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Libertines_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Libertines</a>.</p>
