<p class="h1">FRONTLET*</p>
<p class="fl">Translation of a Hebrew word referring to anything bound on the forehead (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.16">Ex 13:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.8">Dt 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.18">11:18</a>). The phylacteries of Jesus’ day (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Mt 23:5</a>) were worn daily at morning prayer by every male Israelite over the age of 13. They consisted of four Scripture passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.1-10">Ex 13:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.11-16">13:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Dt 6:4-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.13-21">11:13-21</a>) written on parchment and placed in small leather boxes tied to the forehead and the left arm. Whether the phylacteries were the parchments or the leather boxes is debated. There is no evidence that the Israelites in Moses’ day made such phylacteries. It is probable that the commands were to be understood figuratively, portraying the memorial value of the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the importance of the Law in the people’s lives. For the Pharisees, the outward observance had replaced the obligation to apply the power of God’s Word to the heart (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Mt 23:5</a>).</p>
