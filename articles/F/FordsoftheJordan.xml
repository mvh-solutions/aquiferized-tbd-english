<p class="h1">FORDS OF THE JORDAN</p>
<p class="fl">Shallow places where people and animals could wade through the Jordan River. Many OT personalities crossed over the Jordan at its two main fords: these people include Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.10">Gn 32:10</a>), Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.4">Jgs 8:4</a>), David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.17">2 Sm 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.22">17:22</a>), Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.24">17:24</a>), Abner and his men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.29">2:29</a>). Joshua led his followers across the Jordan on dry land during a flood, truly a God-given miracle (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.15-16">Jos 3:15-16</a>). Jesus crossed the Jordan on several occasions on his trips between Galilee and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The two main fords of the Jordan were at Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.7">Jos 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.28">Jgs 3:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.15">2 Sm 19:15</a>) and at Bethabara, where John baptized (<a href="?bref=John.1.28">Jn 1:28</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). In certain places and at certain times the Jordan was not fordable: after the melting of the snows in the Lebanon Mountains, and near the Dead Sea, where the Jordan is about 100 feet (30.5 meters) wide and from 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) deep (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.15">Jos 3:15</a>).</p>
