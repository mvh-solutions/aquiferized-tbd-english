<p class="h1">ONYCHA*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the sweet spices used in the sacred incense of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.34">Ex 30:34</a>). Its identification is uncertain. Some suggest that onycha was derived from the shell of a certain mussel found in India that exuded a musklike fragrance when burned.</p>
