<p class="h1">OPHNI</p>
<p class="fl">Village allotted to Benjamin after Israel had taken possession of Palestine (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.24">Jos 18:24</a>). Its precise location is unknown, but some early writers suggest the town of Gophna (modern Jifna) on the highway from Samaria to Jerusalem, a dayâ€™s march north of Gibeah. This identification assumes that the boundary of Benjamin turned north near Bethel on the northern boundary. The modern Jifna is located three miles (4.8 kilometers) northwest of Bethel.</p>
