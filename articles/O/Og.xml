<p class="h1">OG</p>
<p class="fl">King whose fame partly came from his being a giant. “King Og of Bashan was the last of the giant Rephaites. His iron bed was more than thirteen feet [4.1 meters] long and six feet [1.8 meters] wide” (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">Dt 3:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Og, king of Bashan, fell before Moses’ assault immediately after the defeat of King Sihon the Amorite (<a href="?bref=Num.21.33-35">Nm 21:33-35</a>). Bashan lay along the northern part of the Transjordan. Og’s land stretched northeastward from the lower course of the Jarmuk (Yarmuk) River, and lofty mountain ranges protected him on the east from scorching desert winds.</p>
<p>Og and his people had several settlements, primarily Ashtaroth and Edrei (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.12">Jos 13:12</a>). Og had fortified his land with 60 walled cities and was probably overconfident before Moses’ army. Moses completely destroyed the populace of those cities; he spared only the livestock and the spoils of war (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.5-6">Dt 3:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>Three tribes of Israel found the Transjordan particularly suitable for grazing their herds. So at the defeat of Sihon and Og, Moses assigned the newly won lands to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Num.32.33">Nm 32:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.4-6">Jos 12:4-6</a>).</p>
