<p class="h1">OVENS, Tower of the</p>
<p class="fl">Structure in the Jerusalem wall restored by Nehemiah and his workmen after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.11">Neh 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.38">12:38</a>). Malkijah, son of Harim, and Hasshub, son of Pahath-moab, are named as its builders. The tower was likely a defensive work on the northwest section of the wall, named for its proximity to nearby baking ovens.</p>
