<p class="h1">OPHRAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. City in Benjamin, probably identical with Ephraim (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23">2 Sm 13:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.19">2 Chr 13:19</a>, “Ephron”; <a href="?bref=John.11.54">Jn 11:54</a>). Ophrah is usually identified with the modern et-Taiyibeh, five miles (8 kilometers) north of Michmash and four miles (6.5 kilometers) northeast of Bethel.</p>
<p class="list">2. City in Manasseh owned by Gideon’s father, Joash the Abiezrite, and Gideon’s home (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.11">Jgs 6:11</a>). There the angel appeared to Gideon, commissioning him as God’s agent of relief from the Midianites (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.6.12-24">12-24</a>). Following his spectacular victory, Gideon was nominated for kingship, but he refused. Strangely, he constructed an ephod from the spoils of battle (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.22-28">8:22-28</a>), which Israel worshiped. The idol at Ophrah became a snare to Gideon and his family. Gideon died at Ophrah, an old man (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.8.29-32">29-32</a>). His son Abimelech, ambitious for power, slaughtered his sibling rivals at Ophrah; only one of the 70, Jotham, escaped (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.1-6">9:1-6</a>).</p>
