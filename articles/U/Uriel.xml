<p class="h1">URIEL</p>
<p class="list">1. Levite of the Kohathite branch who is listed as the son of Tahath and the father of Uzziah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.24">1 Chr 6:24</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Levite who officiated over the moving of the ark from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.5-11">1 Chr 15:5-11</a>). He was a Kohathite clan chief in charge of 120 men who participated in the ceremony, and he was personally sanctified for the purpose of carrying the ark.</p>
<p class="list">3. Grandfather of King Abijah of Judah, and the father of the queen mother, Maacah (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">Micaiah</span>), the favored wife of Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.2">2 Chr 13:2</a>). There is potential difficulty in that Absalom is also called the father of Micaiah (Maacah) in <a href="?bref=2Chr.11.20">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>. Josephus explained this discrepancy by suggesting that Maacah’s mother may have been Absalom’s daughter Tamar, so that Uriel would be the father of Maacah and Absalom the maternal grandfather. While many adopt this suggestion, others have posited that Absalom was known by two different names, particularly after he had been disgraced.</p>
