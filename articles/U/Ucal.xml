<p class="h1">UCAL*</p>
<p class="fl">Disciple of Agur, the wise man whose sayings are recorded in the book of Proverbs (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.1">Prv 30:1</a>; see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The meaning of the passage is obscure. Many have suggested that the names Ithiel and Ucal are not proper nouns but should be translated, “I am weary and worn out, O God.”</p>
