<p class="fl">River near the Persian capital city of Susa where Daniel received a vision concerning the end times (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.2-16">Dn 8:2-16</a>). It is likely the same as the Eulaeus, which is described by both Greek and Roman geographers as a stream that flowed to the west of the citadel of Susa.</p>
