<p class="h1">LASHARON</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Canaan conquered by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.18">Jos 12:18</a>). Another early manuscript reads “the king of Aphek in Sharon,” perhaps indicating that Lasharon was not the name of a town but part of a phrase distinguishing this city from the other Apheks mentioned in the Bible.</p>
