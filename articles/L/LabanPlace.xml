<p class="fl">Israelite camping place in Sinai (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.1">Dt 1:1</a>). Some equate it with the Libnah of <a href="?bref=Num.33.20-21">Numbers 33:20-21</a>. Proposals for its location have ranged from just south of Rabbath-ammon to the Arabian coast south of Elath. Its site is still unknown.</p>
