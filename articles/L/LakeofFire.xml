<p class="h1">LAKE OF FIRE</p>
<p class="fl">Final abode of Satan, his servants, and unrepentant human beings.</p>
<p>This place is mentioned only in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.20">Rv 19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10,14-15">20:10, 14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">21:8</a>), but its terrible nature is abundantly clear. It is described as a lake of fire or lake of burning sulphur into which are cast (1) the “beast” and his “false prophet” after the Lamb defeats them, (2) Satan after his last rebellion, (3) Death and Hades, and (4) all whose names are not found in the “Book of Life.” It is called the second death, for it is the ultimate separation from God beyond the resurrection and final judgment.</p>
<p>The lake of fire is probably the same place that Jesus calls Gehenna (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">Mt 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.43">Mk 9:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">Lk 12:5</a>), the “outer darkness” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.12">Mt 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.13">22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.30">25:30</a>), and the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.66.24">Is 66:24</a>). The imagery is drawn from the fires in the valley of Hinnom outside of Jerusalem and perhaps the stream of fire issuing from God’s throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.33">Is 30:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.10">Dn 7:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.34.9-10">Is 34:9-10</a>). The picture was known to Jewish as well as Christian writers (Assumption of Moses 10:10; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.7.36">2 Esd 7:36</a>). Whatever the image or name, they all point to a place of eternal torment and separation from God where the unrepentant will suffer forever.</p>
