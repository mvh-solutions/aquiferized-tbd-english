<p class="fl">Horizontal beam placed above a doorway, supported by structures called “jambs” or simply “doorposts.”</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-51">Exodus 12</a>, the Israelites are instructed to prepare for the tenth plague, the plague of death, and for the first Passover. After killing a lamb, the people were to take the blood and “put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses” (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.7">Ex 12:7</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.31">First Kings 6:31</a> describes Solomon’s building of the temple. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> says, “He made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.” The meaning in the Hebrew is a little difficult to determine. The <span class="sc">nasb</span> translates it as “the lintel and five-sided doorposts.” The <span class="sc">neb</span> replaces the word “lintel” with “pilasters.” It may be that the top of the doorway was slanted, formed by beams leaning toward each other (archlike) instead of one horizontal beam.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Amos.9.1">Amos 9:1</a> the <span class="sc">kjv</span> has “lintel,” whereas the <span class="sc">rsv</span> has “capital.” The Hebrew word here appears to mean the capital of a column. The same is true in <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.14">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, where the <span class="sc">kjv</span> has “lintels” and the <span class="sc">nasb</span> has “tops of her pillars.” <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Architecture_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Architecture</a>.</p>
