<p class="h1">LOGOS*</p>
<p class="fl">English transliteration of a Greek term for “word.” The term is significant because in John’s writings it refers to Jesus. The prologue of John’s Gospel (<a href="?bref=John.1.1,14">Jn 1:1, 14</a>) and the beginning of 1 John (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1">1 Jn 1:1</a>) use <span class="greek">logos</span> to show how Jesus can be God and yet be an expression of God in the world. The divine Word took on human form and became a historical personage. Logos is also the title of Christ in the vision of his divine glory (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.13">Rv 19:13</a>). Writers outside the NT, such as Philo of Alexandria, used the term but with a different meaning.</p>
