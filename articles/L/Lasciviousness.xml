<p class="h1">LASCIVIOUSNESS*</p>
<p class="fl">Extreme indulgence in sensual pleasures. Modern Bible translations commonly use the words “licentiousness,” “debauchery,” or “sensuality” instead. Lasciviousness occurs when the pursuit of pleasure is carried to the extreme of complete disregard for the integrity of others and for the environment.</p>
<p>Among biblical examples of lasciviousness are the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, who filled their lives with lawless deeds (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.7">2 Pt 2:7</a>); the false teachers, who promised freedom but were themselves slaves of corruption (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.2,18-19">2 Pt 2:2, 18-19</a>; compare <a href="?bref=Jude.1.4">Jude 4</a>); and the Gentiles, who were greedy to practice every kind of uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.19">Eph 4:19</a>). The apostle Paul used “lasciviousness” to refer to sexual excesses (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.13">Rom 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.21">2 Cor 12:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19">Gal 5:19</a>), which is likely the word’s sense in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.22">Mark 7:22</a>.</p>
