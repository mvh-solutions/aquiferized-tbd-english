<p class="h1">LOINS</p>
<p class="fl">Region of the body from the chest to the lower part of the hip; an expression in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> (“out of his loins”) for that part of the body that involved procreation (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.11">Gn 35:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.46.26">46:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.1.5">Ex 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.19">1 Kgs 8:19</a>). In most instances, the word describes physical features, although occasionally emotion, power, or strength is meant (see <a href="?bref=Nah.2.1">Na 2:1</a>). As was the custom of the Hebrews and other Near Eastern peoples, a man would tie up his clothes around the loins before traveling a long distance on foot (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.11">Ex 12:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.46">1 Kgs 18:46</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1">2 Kgs 9:1</a>). In the NT girded loins signified that a man was ready for service or heavy battle (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.35">Lk 12:35</a>). Metaphorically, girding the loins is a symbolic way of saying that one is standing firm and/or exercising self-control (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.14">Eph 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13">1 Pt 1:13</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
