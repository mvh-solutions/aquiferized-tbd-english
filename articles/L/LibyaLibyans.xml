<p class="h1">LIBYA, LIBYANS</p>
<p class="fl">Country and its inhabitants to the west of Egypt. Three different Hebrew words are so rendered, but there is some confusion of meaning, partly because of textual uncertainties and partly because classical writers tended to use “Libya” to describe non-Egyptian Africa in general.</p>
<p>From the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span>, Libyans served in the armies of Egypt and Ethiopia (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.3">2 Chr 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.8">16:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.3.9">Na 3:9</a>). The great invader Shishak himself was of Libyan origin. Ezekiel prophesied that Libya would share in the doom of the nations (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.5">Ez 30:5</a>), and Libyans are counted among the peoples forced into submission in <a href="?bref=Dan.11.43">Daniel 11:43</a>. There is passing reference to the Libyans (Hebrew, “Pul”) in <a href="?bref=Isa.66.19">Isaiah 66:19</a>.</p>
<p>Simon, “a man from Cyrene” in eastern Libya, was forced to carry the cross of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.32">Mt 27:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.21">Mk 15:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.26">Lk 23:26</a>). Libyans are listed among those who thronged Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>).</p>
