<p class="h1">LIBNAH</p>
<p class="list">1. One of the stations at which the Israelites encamped during the wilderness journey. It was situated between Rimmon-perez and Rissah (<a href="?bref=Num.33.20-21">Nm 33:20-21</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=WildernessWanderings_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Wilderness Wanderings</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Canaanite city-state in southern Palestine, conquered and destroyed by the Israelites under Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.29-31">Jos 10:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.15">12:15</a>). It was located within Judah’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.42">15:42</a>) and later given to the Levites for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.13">Jos 21:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.57">1 Chr 6:57</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Three details in the city’s subsequent history are noted in Scripture: (1) During the reign of King Jehoram of Judah, at the time of Edom’s uprising, Libnah joined in the revolt but was subdued (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.22">2 Kgs 8:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.10">2 Chr 21:10</a>). (2) After King Sennacherib of Assyria took the city of Lachish, he proceeded to attack Libnah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.8">2 Kgs 19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.8">Is 37:8</a>). Earlier Isaiah had affirmed to King Hezekiah that a rumor would cause the invading king to interrupt his military campaign against Judah and return to his own land; it was while Sennacherib was besieging Libnah that Isaiah’s affirmation was confirmed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.7-8">2 Kgs 19:7-8</a>). (3) The mother of Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, two of Judah’s last kings, was a native of Libnah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.31">2 Kgs 23:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.18">24:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1">Jer 52:1</a>).</p>
