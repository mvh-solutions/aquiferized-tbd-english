<p class="h1">CLEMENT OF ROME*</p>
<p class="fl">A presbyter and bishop in Rome who wrote a letter to the church at Corinth (<span class="era">AD</span> 96), probably the earliest Christian writing outside the NT. Dionysius of Corinth (<span class="era">AD</span> 170) was the first to name Clement as the author of that letter. Origen, an Alexandrian theologian, and Eusebius, the first church historian, identified the writer as the Clement listed in the <span class="ital">Shepherd of Hermas,</span> a Christian writing from the mid-second century.</p>
