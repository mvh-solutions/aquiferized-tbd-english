<p class="fl">Leader of the Athenian Stoic school of philosophy from 269 to 232 <span class="era">BC</span>. Cleanthes’ poem “Hymn to Zeus” was adapted in part by another Stoic poet, Aratus, in his own creation “Phaenomena.” Centuries later the apostle Paul quoted the fifth line of “Phaenomena” as he spoke to a crowd on the Areopagus in Athens: “We are his offspring” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">Acts 17:28</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
