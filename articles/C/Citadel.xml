<p class="h1">CITADEL</p>
<p class="fl">A city’s stronghold, tower, or fortification of last resort where people sought safety during an attack. The citadel of Penuel was destroyed by Gideon after he captured two Midianite kings (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.17">Jgs 8:17</a>). The citadel of El-berith at Shechem was burned to the ground by Abimelech and his men (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.46-49">9:46-49</a>). Abimelech was killed shortly thereafter when a woman in the citadel at Thebez dropped a millstone on his head and crushed his skull (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.9.50-54">50-54</a>). David conquered Jerusalem by capturing its citadel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.7-9">2 Sm 5:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.5-8">1 Chr 11:5-8</a>).</p>
<p>During the Maccabees’ struggle for independence in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the citadel in Jerusalem often aided the party in power (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.29-33">1 Macc 1:29-33</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.41-42">11:41-42</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.13.49-51">13:49-51</a>). The Fortress of Antonia, the Jerusalem citadel in the day of Jesus, fell to the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
