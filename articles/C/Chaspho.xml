<p class="h1">CHASPHO</p>
<p class="fl">Town east of the Sea of Galilee mentioned in 1 and 2 Maccabees. Judas and Jonathan Maccabeus led their army into Transjordan and “took Chaspho, Maked, and Bosor, and the other cities of Gilead” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.36">1 Macc 5:36</a>). Caspin, which appears in a similar passage in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.12.13">2 Maccabees 12:13</a>, is considered to be the same as Chaspho by most scholars. Chaspho has been identified as el-Muzeirib in the Hauran plain and Tell el-Jamid on the Yarmuk River. But most today locate it at Khisfin, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
