<p class="h1">CONSUMPTION*</p>
<p class="fl">Medical term historically referring to pulmonary tuberculosis. The word “consumption” appears twice in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.16">Lv 26:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.22">Dt 28:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). However, it does not specifically mean tuberculosis; rather, it specifies any chronic wasting disease process, perhaps including cancer, diarrhea, malnutrition, malaria, kidney failure, and other disorders. In the biblical references, consumption is listed as one of many medical symptoms threatening those who do not follow the commandments of the Lord.</p>
