<p class="h1">CARPENTER</p>
<p class="fl">One who worked with timber, setting up the framework of houses, the roofing, windows, and doors. Often small structures were erected by the householder, but temples and palaces required specialized artisans where carpenters worked alongside stonemasons (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.11">2 Kgs 12:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.6">22:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.1">1 Chr 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.22.15">22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.12">2 Chr 24:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.11">34:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.7">Ezr 3:7</a>). Carpentry is seldom referred to in the NT, though it was the profession of Jesus and his father Joseph (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>).</p>
