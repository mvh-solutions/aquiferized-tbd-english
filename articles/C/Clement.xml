<p class="h1">CLEMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Coworker with Paul at Philippi who worked side by side with him in the furtherance of the gospel there (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.3">Phil 4:3</a>). Paul includes him in the group of those whose names are written in the Book of Life. Even though some early church fathers identified this Clement with the third bishop of Rome, there is no evidence to substantiate their claims.</p>
