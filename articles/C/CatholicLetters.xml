<p class="h1">CATHOLIC LETTERS*</p>
<p class="fl">Traditional name for seven NT books (letters): James; 1 and 2 Peter; 1, 2, and 3 John; and Jude. The term “catholic” has been given various interpretations: (1) These letters express the views of all the apostles. (2) They are canonical or genuine. (3) Thus they were distinguished from contemporaneous heretical works. (4) They are encyclical, that is, addressed to general audiences of believers rather than to specific congregations, as were some of the apostle Paul’s letters. Of course, 2 John and 3 John are exceptions to this, for 2 John is addressed to a lady or a local church and 3 John is addressed to an individual.</p>
