<p class="h1">CAUDA</p>
<p class="fl">Small island south of Crete. The ship carrying the apostle Paul to Rome sought temporary refuge at Cauda during a storm (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.16">Acts 27:16</a>). In the lee (calmer waters) behind the island the sailors hoisted on board a boat being towed by the ship and made efforts to strengthen the ship’s hull. Even after lowering the sails, they were driven past the island and eventually wrecked.</p>
<p>Cauda is the modern island of Gaudos (Gozzo). Ancient manuscripts are divided on the spelling of the name, some reading “Cauda” (as in most modern versions) and others, “Clauda” (as in <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>).</p>
