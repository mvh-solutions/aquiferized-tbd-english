<p class="h1">COVENANT OF SALT*</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical phrase for a two-way agreement, the inviolability of which was symbolized by salt. A Middle Eastern saying, “There is bread and salt between us,” meant that a relationship had been confirmed by sharing a meal. Salt symbolized the life and enduring nature of the alliance. In the OT salt appears in the relationship between God and Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.13">Lv 2:13</a>). As a purifying agent and preservative in the cereal offering, salt symbolized the indissoluble nature of the covenant between God and Israel.</p>
<p>An everlasting “covenant of salt” (<a href="?bref=Num.18.19">Nm 18:19</a>) was made between God and Aaron, who represented the whole priesthood of Israel. Since the Levites received no inheritance in the Promised Land, God himself was to be their special portion forever. God’s covenant with King David and his sons was also called a covenant of salt (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.5">2 Chr 13:5</a>).</p>
