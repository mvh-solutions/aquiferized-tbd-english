<p class="fl">Water tunnel or channel. In the OT the Hebrew word can mean rivulets in the ground made by rain (<a href="?bref=Job.38.25">Jb 38:25</a>, “channel”; <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.4">Ez 31:4</a>, “stream”) or a simple trench such as Elijah dug around the altar in his encounter with the prophets of Baal, a Canaanite fertility god (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.31-38">1 Kgs 18:31-38</a>).</p>
<p>A water tunnel was constructed during King Hezekiah’s reign to bring water from the Gihon Spring, once located outside the walls of Jerusalem, to inside the city proper (“pool,” <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17">2 Kgs 18:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.14">Neh 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Is 7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.22.9-11">22:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.2">36:2</a>). The mouth of the spring was sealed and its water diverted into the city through the conduit to keep Israel’s enemies from using the spring during a siege of the city. That tunnel expanded a tunnel begun by earlier inhabitants of the city, the Jebusites. David and his men may have entered Jerusalem through that first tunnel to overthrow the Jebusites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.8">2 Sm 5:8</a>).</p>
