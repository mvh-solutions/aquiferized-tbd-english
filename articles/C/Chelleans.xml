<p class="h1">CHELLEANS</p>
<p class="fl">People mentioned in the book of Judith. There is little agreement about the identity of the Chelleans, who are listed in connection with a campaign of Holofernes, chief general of Nebuchadnezzarâ€™s army (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.23">Jdt 2:23</a>). Geographical considerations make it unlikely that they were from the town of Chelous, modern Khalasa. More probable is an identification with ancient Cholle, located between Palmyra (Tadmor) in the Syrian Desert and the Euphrates River. That site, modern el-Khalle, fits well with the other geographic references in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.21-25">Judith 2:21-25</a>.</p>
