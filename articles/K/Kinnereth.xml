<p class="h1">KINNERETH</p>
<p class="list">1. Fortified town in the territory allotted to Naphtali’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.35">Jos 19:35</a>). It is also mentioned in an Egyptian list of towns conquered by Thutmose III in the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>. The site has been identified as Tell el-’Oreimeh on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Archaeological evidence suggests that the site was inhabited from about 2000 to about 900 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list">2. A district in Naphtali’s territory that included #1 above. It was conquered by Ben-hadad, king of Syria, in the reign of Baasha, king of the northern kingdom of Israel in the early ninth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.20">1 Kgs 15:20</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Early name for the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Num.34.11">Nm 34:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.17">Dt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.2">Jos 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.27">13:27</a>). It is hard to say whether the city (see #1 above) was named after the sea or vice versa. The name, however, means “lyres,” which could be an allusion to the Sea of Galilee’s shape, which roughly resembles that of a lyre. In NT times the pronunciation of the name was corrupted to Gennesaret (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1">Lk 5:1</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=SeaofGalilee_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Sea of Galilee</a>.</p>
