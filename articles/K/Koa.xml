<p class="h1">KOA</p>
<p class="fl">People probably living northeast of Babylonia. They are named along with Babylon, Pekod, and Shoa as people who would come against Jerusalem as instruments of God’s judgment on Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.23">Ez 23:23</a>). They are perhaps identifiable with the Kutu, mentioned frequently in Assyrian inscriptions.</p>
