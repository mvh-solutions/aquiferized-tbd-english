<p class="h1">KETURAH</p>
<p class="fl">Second wife of Abraham. It is unclear whether he married her before or after Sarah’s death (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.1">Gn 25:1</a>). He had six sons with her: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah (v <a href="?bref=Gen.25.2">2</a>). Keturah’s status was not identical to that of Sarah. She is called a concubine (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.6">Gn 25:6</a>, cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.32">1 Chr 1:32</a>), and her sons were presented with gifts instead of receiving a share in the inheritance. Keturah’s sons were the ancestors of tribes with which Israel came into contact after the Conquest, especially Midian and Jokshan’s sons Sheba and Dedan (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.3">Gn 25:3</a>). As far as can be determined, the tribes settled in the north and central regions of the northern Euphrates, as far as the central sections of the Arabian Desert. They were merchants (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.37.1-36">37</a>) and shepherds (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16">Ex 2:16</a>). They were involved in international trade (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.6">Is 60:6</a>). For example, the queen of Sheba, a descendant of Jokshan (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.3">Gn 25:3</a>), came to Solomon to initiate trade relations (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2">1 Kgs 10:2</a>).</p>
