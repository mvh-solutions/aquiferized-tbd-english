<p class="h1">KISH</p>
<p class="list">1. Benjamite of Gibeah, father of King Saul and a man of some position in the community (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1">1 Sm 9:1</a>). His genealogy is traced for four generations, as is that of Elkanah, the father of Samuel, who would anoint Saul king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is some obscurity in the genealogical information about Kish. His father’s name is listed as Abiel in <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1">1 Samuel 9:1</a>. If the Kish mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Chr.8.30">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> is the same person, then we must conclude that Abiel was also known as Jeiel. But it may be that this second Kish was an uncle of Saul’s father. A further obscurity results from <a href="?bref=1Chr.8.33">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.39">9:39</a>, where Ner, not Abiel, is said to be the father of Kish. Yet in <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.51">1 Samuel 14:51</a> Abiel is said to be the father of two sons whose names were Ner and Kish. The solution probably lies in the assumption that Ner in the Chronicles references was an earlier ancestor, probably Abiel’s father or grandfather. If that should be the case, then the father-son relationship between Ner and Kish should be taken in an extended sense, as elsewhere in the OT. No other details of Kish’s life are available. His grave was in Zela of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.14">2 Sm 21:14</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> of <a href="?bref=Acts.13.21">Acts 13:21</a> spells his name Cis.</p>
<p class="list">2. Levite, grandson of Merari, Mahli’s son and the father of Jerahmeel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.21-22">1 Chr 23:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.29">24:29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Abdi’s son, another Levite of the family of Merari. He was one of the Levites who assisted Hezekiah in the cleansing of the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12">2 Chr 29:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Benjamite and the great-grandfather of Mordecai. Mordecai was carried into exile by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.5">Est 2:5</a>), together with King Jehoiachin and the prophet Ezekiel.</p>
