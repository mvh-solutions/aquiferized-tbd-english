<p class="h1">KORAZIN</p>
<p class="fl">Palestinian city on which Jesus pronounced woe (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.21-24">Mt 11:21-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.13-14">Lk 10:13-14</a>). It was in Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum that “most of his miracles” had been done, but the people were generally unresponsive and had not repented (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.20">Mt 11:20</a>).</p>
<p>From the biblical references, Korazin was probably in the vicinity of Capernaum and Bethsaida. The church father Jerome (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 400) located it two miles (3.2 kilometers) from Capernaum, which is on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Scholars generally agree that the ruins of Khirbet Kerazeh on the basalt hills north of Capernaum are those of Korazin. The ruins indicate that it was a fairly important city. Remains of a synagogue, probably from the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>, include a carved seat with an inscription, an example of a “Moses’ seat” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.2">Mt 23:2</a>). According to the Jewish Talmud, Korazin was known for its wheat.</p>
