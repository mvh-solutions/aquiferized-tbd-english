<p class="h1">KIDNEY</p>
<p class="fl">One of the body parts of sacrificial animals used for offerings to God. The kidneys, along with their fat, were to be burned on the altar (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.13">Ex 29:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.3.4-15">Lv 3:4-15</a>) and represented the blood that the Israelites were not permitted to eat.</p>
<p>In a more figurative sense the kidneys are thought of as the seat of human emotions (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.21">Ps 73:21</a>) and the rational and moral faculties (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.7">Ps 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.2">Jer 12:2</a>). They are closely associated with the “heart” and “soul,” standing for one’s innermost self-consciousness. The <span class="sc">nlt</span> translates the Hebrew word as “mind,” “heart,” and “soul” in several passages.</p>
<p>As in the OT Jehovah had knowledge of man’s inmost thoughts (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.7.9">Pss 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.26.2">26:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.12">Jer 20:12</a>), so Christ was identified in the book of Revelation as the one who “searches the minds and hearts” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.23">Rv 2:23</a>), making an indirect but clear identification of Jesus with Jehovah. This is the only reference to the kidneys in the NT.</p>
