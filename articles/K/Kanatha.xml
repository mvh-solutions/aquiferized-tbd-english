<p class="h1">KANATHA*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the original 10 Greek cities rebuilt by Rome after Pompeyâ€™s conquest of Palestine and Syria around 63 <span class="era">BC</span>. The region of these cities became known as the Decapolis. Kanatha (also spelled Canatha), positioned about 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee, formed the easternmost boundary of the Decapolis. Some suggest that the city is identifiable with Kenath of <a href="?bref=Num.32.42">Numbers 32:42</a> and the subsequent modern town of Qanawat, a short distance northeast of es-Suweideh in the Hauran region.</p>
