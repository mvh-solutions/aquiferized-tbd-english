<p class="h1">KAMON</p>
<p class="fl">City in Gilead where Jair the judge was buried (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.5">Jgs 10:5</a>). While the place has not been identified with certainty, modern Kameim, a small village southeast of the Sea of Galilee, probably reflects the original name, if not the exact location.</p>
