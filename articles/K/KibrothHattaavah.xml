<p class="h1">KIBROTH-HATTAAVAH</p>
<p class="fl">Location in the wilderness where the Israelites who were killed by plague for craving meat from Egypt were buried (<a href="?bref=Num.11.34-35">Nm 11:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.16-17">33:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.9.22">Dt 9:22</a>). It was situated between Mt Sinai and Hazeroth, but its exact site is unknown. The name, meaning “graves of craving,” accords with the account of the quails.</p>
