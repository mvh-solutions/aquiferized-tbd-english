<p class="h1">KELAIAH</p>
<p class="fl">A Levite who was guilty of marrying a pagan wife (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.18">Ezr 10:18</a>). According to verse <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.23">23</a> Kelaiah is also called Kelita. A Levite named Kelita is also found in <a href="?bref=Neh.8.7">Nehemiah 8:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Neh.10.10">10:10</a>, and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.9.48">1 Esdras 9:48</a>, where he is one who helped Ezra in expounding the law and who set his seal on Ezra’s covenant. It cannot be determined with certainty whether Kelaiah and Kelita are the same individual.</p>
