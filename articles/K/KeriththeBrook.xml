<p class="h1">KERITH, The Brook</p>
<p class="fl">Also rendered the “Kerith Ravine” (<span class="sc">niv</span>), it was the place where the Lord told the prophet Elijah to hide from King Ahab during a famine Elijah had predicted. There he had sufficient water to drink and was fed by ravens each morning and evening (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.2-6">1 Kgs 17:2-6</a>). The brook, or gorge, has traditionally been identified as the Wadi Qelt, west of the Jordan River near Jericho. More likely Kerith, indicated in Scripture as “east of the Jordan River,” was located in Gilead, Elijah’s homeland (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.3">3</a>).</p>
