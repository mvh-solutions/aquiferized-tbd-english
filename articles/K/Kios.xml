<p class="h1">KIOS</p>
<p class="fl">Rocky, mountainous island in the east-central area of the Aegean Sea. On his third missionary journey, Paul’s ship anchored opposite Kios between stops at Mitylene and Samos en route to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.15">Acts 20:15</a>). Though not particularly fertile, Kios was nevertheless noted for its wine, figs, and gum mastic. It is separated from the mainland by a five-mile (8-kilometer) strait. In Paul’s day its principal city, Kios (modern Scio), was a free city in the Roman province of Asia.</p>
