<p class="h1">ETHAM</p>
<p class="fl">First encampment of the Hebrews after leaving Succoth (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.20">Ex 13:20</a>), perhaps located on the border of the wilderness of Shur (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.22">Ex 15:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.6-8">Nm 33:6-8</a>). The suggestion that it was an Egyptian fortress is improbable.</p>
