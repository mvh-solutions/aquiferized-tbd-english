<p class="h1">EN-EGLAIM</p>
<p class="fl">Place mentioned in <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.10">Ezekiel 47:10</a> where, in a description of the millennial age, it is said that “fishermen will stand beside the sea; from En-gedi to En-eglaim it will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). This condition will be in sharp contrast to the present lack of marine life in the Dead Sea. The location is on the shore of the Dead Sea, probably south of Khirbet Qumran, perhaps ’Ain Feshkha.</p>
