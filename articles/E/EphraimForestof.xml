<p class="h1">EPHRAIM, Forest of</p>
<p class="fl">Rocky, wooded stretch of country east of the Jordan in the area of Mahanaim. It was here that David’s army defeated Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.6">2 Sm 18:6</a>). The connection of this location with the territory of Ephraim is difficult. The most probable explanation is that Ephraim once extended farther to the east but that this area was lost by the tribe after its defeat by Jephthah and the Gileadites near Zaphon (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-6">Jgs 12:1-6</a>). The name may have been used while the Ephraimites held the land, or perhaps been given at a later date as a reminder of Ephraim’s defeat. Some speculate that Ephraimites once established a colony in the area (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.14-18">Jos 17:14-18</a>).</p>
