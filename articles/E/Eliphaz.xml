<p class="h1">ELIPHAZ</p>
<p class="list">1. Oldest son of Esau and his wife Adah (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.4-16">Gn 36:4-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.35-36">1 Chr 1:35-36</a>). He was the ancestor of a number of Edomite clans.</p>
<p class="list">2. One of Job’s friends, called the Temanite (see <a href="?bref=Jer.49.7">Jer 49:7</a>). Teman was traditionally associated with wisdom; hence Eliphaz’s speech depicts the orthodox view of sin and punishment. His three addresses (<a href="?bref=Job.4.1-21">Jb 4</a>, <a href="?bref=Job.15.1-35">15</a>, <a href="?bref=Job.22.1-30">22</a>) failed to grapple with the essence of Job’s problem because he assumed previous major sin in Job’s life.</p>
