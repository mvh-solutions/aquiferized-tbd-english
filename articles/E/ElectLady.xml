<p class="h1">ELECT LADY*</p>
<p class="fl">Greeting found in <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.1">2 John 1:1</a>. The phrase has been interpreted two ways.</p>
<p>Some interpreters regard 2 John as addressed to a particular woman. Ancient Greek manuscripts show that the word <span class="greek">kuria</span> (translated as “lady” or “mistress”) was used by letter writers as a personal term for family members or close friends of either sex. Thus, the phrase could be translated, “to my dear friend, Eklete.” Some scholars associate the elect lady with Martha of Bethany (whose name in Aramaic also means “mistress”).</p>
<p>Other interpreters regard the phrase as signifying a local congregation. John possibly portrayed this Christian community as a mother, the members as her children, and other congregations as sisters (<a href="?bref=2Jn.1.13">2 Jn 1:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Pt 5:13</a>). The phrase could thus be translated, “the lady elect.”</p>
