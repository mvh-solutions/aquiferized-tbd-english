<p class="h1">ELIHOREPH</p>
<p class="fl">Prominent official in the time of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.3">1Â Kgs 4:3</a>) who, with his brother Ahijah, was a royal secretary. Attempts to regard Elihoreph as the title of an official and not a personal name find no support in the Hebrew text.</p>
