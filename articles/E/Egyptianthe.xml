<p class="h1">EGYPTIAN, The</p>
<p class="fl">Unidentified antagonist of Rome who led a revolt into the wilderness with a host of barbarous assassins (the Sicarii). After an uproar at the Jerusalem temple, the tribune Claudius Lysias challenged the apostle Paul, asking if he were the Egyptian insurrectionist (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.38">Acts 21:38</a>). According to Josephus, the Egyptian led a Jewish rebellion that was suppressed by the procurator Felix. Accounts vary as to the number of assassins involved, but all point to a revolt led by an Egyptian who apparently escaped.</p>
