<p class="h1">ELYMAIS</p>
<p class="fl">Formerly thought to be a city in Persia, greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.6.1">1 Macc 6:1</a>), but now generally regarded as a district of Persia. Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.9.1), following 1 Maccabees, alludes to it as a city, but it is otherwise unknown.</p>
