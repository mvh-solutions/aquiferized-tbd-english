<p class="h1">EZRAHITE</p>
<p class="fl">Word occurring only three times in the OT. Twice it is used as a title for Ethan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.31">1Â Kgs 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1">Ps 89 title</a>) and once as a name given to Heman (<a href="?bref=Ps.88.1">Ps 88 title</a>). It is no longer thought to be a family name, but instead signifies a member of a pre-Israelite family.</p>
