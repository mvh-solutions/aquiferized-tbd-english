<p class="h1">EPHES-DAMMIM</p>
<p class="fl">Location between Socoh and Azekah in Judah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1">1 Sm 17:1</a>) where the Philistines encamped. It was called Pas-dammim in <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.13">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>. The reference to blood (dammim) in the name probably has to do with the number of battles fought there, or it may refer to the red earth of the area. Traditionally identified with the ruins of Damun, about four miles (6.5 kilometers) northeast of Socoh, the exact location of the site is unknown.</p>
