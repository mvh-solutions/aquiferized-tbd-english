<p class="h1">ELIM</p>
<p class="fl">Early encampment of the Israelites after their passage through the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.27">Ex 15:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.16.1">16:1</a>). Elim was situated between Marah and the desert of Sin. It had 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees (<a href="?bref=Num.33.9-10">Nm 33:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>Most scholars identify Elim with Wadi Gharandel, 63 miles (101.4 kilometers) from Suez. At this wadi the vegetation consists of palm trees, tamarisks, and acacias. But if Mt Sinai is to be located somewhere in Arabia, Elim would be much closer to the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
