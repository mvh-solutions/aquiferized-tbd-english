<p class="h1">ELIMELECH</p>
<p class="fl">Man from Bethlehem who took his wife, Naomi, and his sons, Mahlon and Chilion, to sojourn in Moab because of famine in Judah (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.2-3">Ru 1:2-3</a>). While in Moab, he died; then his sons also died; and Naomi decided to return to Judah. One daughter-in-law, Orpah, preferred to remain in Moab; the other, Ruth, chose to accompany Naomi. Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, bought Elimelechâ€™s land and married Ruth (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.9-10">4:9-10</a>). From this union came a great-grandson, David, and the royal line in which the Messiah would eventually be born. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=RuthBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Ruth, Book of</a>.</p>
