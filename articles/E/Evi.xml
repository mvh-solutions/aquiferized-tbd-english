<p class="h1">EVI</p>
<p class="fl">One of five Midianite kings killed in a battle against Israel under the leadership of Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.31.8">Nm 31:8</a>). Apparently, God directed Moses to go to battle against Midian because the Midianites had led the Israelites into pagan religious practices. In <a href="?bref=Josh.13.21">Joshua 13:21</a>, Evi is called a prince of Sihon, the Midianite king.</p>
