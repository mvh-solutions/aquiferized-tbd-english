<p class="list">1. Site where the Israelite army encamped before a battle with the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-11">1 Sm 4:1-11</a>). It is thought to have been near Aphek, where the Philistines were encamped. The Israelite army was badly defeated in the battle, and 4,000 of its men were slain on the field. The elders of Israel tried to change their fortunes by bringing the ark of the covenant into their camp, but Israel was again defeated with a loss of 30,000 foot soldiers, and the ark of God was captured (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.3-11">1 Sm 4:3-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1">5:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Site near Mizpah, where God gave Israel a great victory over the Philistines. To commemorate the victory Samuel set up a stone between Mizpah and Jeshanah and called its name Ebenezer, meaning “the stone of help,” for the Lord had helped them get the victory (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.12">1 Sm 7:12</a>).</p>
