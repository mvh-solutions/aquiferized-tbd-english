<p class="h1">EPILEPSY*, EPILEPTIC</p>
<p class="fl">Disease of the central nervous system, and one afflicted with the disease, characterized by unconsciousness and convulsions. Seizures can be either petit mal (twitching of the face or hands, brief but sharp abdominal pain, and possible momentary unconsciousness) or grand mal (convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and unconsciousness lasting from 5 to 20 minutes). Although the causes of epilepsy are still not known, drugs are available to prevent or control the seizures.</p>
<p>In biblical times, epilepsy (known as the “falling sickness”) could not be treated effectively. Jesus healed a boy evidently suffering from that affliction (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.14-18">Mt 17:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.17-27">Mk 9:17-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.37-42">Lk 9:37-42</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> description of the boy as a “lunatic” (from Latin <span class="ital">luna,</span> “moon”) is an incorrect usage. The Greek word in Matthew (literally “moonstruck”) reflected ancient belief in a connection between certain diseases and the lunar phases. According to the biblical account, the youth was healed when Jesus called forth a demon, or “unclean spirit,” from him. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MedicineandMedicalPractice_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Medicine and Medical Practice</a>.</p>
