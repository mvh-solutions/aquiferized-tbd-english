<p class="h1">EXORCISM*, EXORCIST*</p>
<p class="fl">Art of expelling demons and evil spirits, and the practitioner of this art.</p>
<p>The ability to expel or control demons was claimed by many in the ancient Near East. Aside from the miracles of Jesus recorded in the Gospels, only in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.13">Acts 19:13</a> is there a biblical reference to exorcism among the Jews. However in <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14-23">1Â Samuel 16:14-23</a> David functioned as an exorcist by playing a lyre to cast out an evil spirit from Saul.</p>
