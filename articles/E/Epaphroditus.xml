<p class="h1">EPAPHRODITUS</p>
<p class="fl">Leader in the Philippian church. Epaphroditus was sent to the apostle Paul during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment; his mission was to deliver gifts (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.18">Phil 4:18</a>) and to assist the apostle in his work (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.25">2:25</a>). While in Rome, Epaphroditus became seriously ill and nearly died. After a period of convalescence, he returned to Philippi with Paul’s letter instructing the church to receive him (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.29">29</a>). Epaphroditus’s devoted service endeared him to the Philippian believers and to Paul, who termed him “brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier” (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.25">25</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
