<p class="fl">Javan’s son (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.4">Gn 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.7">1 Chr 1:7</a>). The Hebrew term for Greece is Javan; hence, Elishah could be the term for the western Aegean islands or coastlands (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.5">Gn 10:5</a>) that supplied dye stuffs to the inhabitants of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.7">Ez 27:7</a>). The Jewish historian Josephus identified Elishah with the Aeolians; other suggestions are Carthage in North Africa, Hellas, Italy, and Elis. A Mediterranean site seems probable from the context of <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.6-7">Ezekiel 27:6-7</a>, perhaps an area of Cyprus that exported copper.</p>
