<p class="h1">EMIM*, EMITES</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to the original inhabitants of Moab (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>) by the Moabites who ousted them from their land. They were a tall people, known also as Rephaim (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.10-11">Dt 2:10-11</a>), and were compared with the Zuzites, Anakim, and Horites for their size. This phenomenon is evidently an indication of genetic isolation. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Giants_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Giants</a>.</p>
