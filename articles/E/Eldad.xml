<p class="h1">ELDAD</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 70 elders of Israel who were commissioned to assist Moses in governing the people (<a href="?bref=Num.11.26-27">Nm 11:26-27</a>). Though Eldad and another elder, Medad, were not among the 68 elders who had gathered around the tabernacle at Moses’ command, they too received the Spirit and prophesied. When Joshua, out of concern for Moses’ authority, asked Moses to stop them, Moses showed great humility and sensitivity to God’s will by answering, “I wish that all the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s people were prophets” (<a href="?bref=Num.11.29">Nm 11:29</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
