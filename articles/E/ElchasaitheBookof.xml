<p class="h1">ELCHASAI*, The Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Lost Jewish work composed in Aramaic by Elchasai during the reign of Emperor Trajan (<span class="era">AD</span> 98â€“117). It was intended for his followers, the Elchasaites (or Sabai), but was read by both Jews and Jewish Christian groups. Portions of the book are quoted by early church fathers Hippolytus, Epiphanius, and Origen (quoted in Eusebius).</p>
<p>The book is a syncretism of Jewish, Christian, gnostic, and pagan ideas. Baptism is linked to forgiveness of sins and is a way a person can be healed. It prescribes a form of Jewish legalism but rejects the need for sacrifices and a priesthood.</p>
