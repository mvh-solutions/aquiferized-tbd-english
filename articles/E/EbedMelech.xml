<p class="h1">EBED-MELECH</p>
<p class="fl">Ethiopian eunuch in King Zedekiah’s court. He secured the king’s permission to rescue the prophet Jeremiah out of a cistern where he had been thrown to die (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.6-13">Jer 38:6-13</a>). For this righteous act, Ebed-melech was promised God’s safety at the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.39.16">39:16</a>).</p>
