<p class="h1">EUNUCH</p>
<p class="fl">Officer or chamberlain in the court or household of a ruler, often assigned to the women’s quarters. Many of these men were emasculated, though not always (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.39.1">Gn 39:1</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>). Eunuchs were public officials in Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.15">1 Sm 8:15</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.1">1 Chr 28:1</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>), Persia (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.3">Est 2:3</a>), Ethiopia (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.7">Jer 38:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.27">Acts 8:27</a>), and Babylon (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.3">Dn 1:3</a>). Eunuchs were not included in public worship in Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.1">Dt 23:1</a>), but the prophet Isaiah referred to their restoration in the messianic kingdom (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.3-5">Is 56:3-5</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-40">Acts 8</a>).</p>
<p>The Ethiopian eunuch of <a href="?bref=Acts.8.27-39">Acts 8:27-39</a> was probably minister of the treasury and has been credited with founding Christianity in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Jesus mentioned three classes of eunuchs (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.12">Mt 19:12</a>), including those who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom. This is generally understood in a metaphorical sense of voluntarily forgoing marriage in order to serve the kingdom (e.g., John the Baptist, Jesus, and the apostle Paul).</p>
