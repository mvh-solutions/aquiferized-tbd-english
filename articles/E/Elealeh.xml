It was taken back by the Moabites and is associated with Heshbon in the prophetic denunciations of Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.4">Is 15:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.9">16:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.34">Jer 48:34</a>).</p>
<p>Eusebius refers to it in the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span> as a large village. It is identified with the modern el-â€™Al, a village 2,986 feet (910.1 meters) above sea level in a region rich in vineyards. The remains of walls from the prepatriarchal period have been uncovered by archaeologists.</p>
