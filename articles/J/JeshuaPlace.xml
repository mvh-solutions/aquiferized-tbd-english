<p class="h1">JESHUA (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Town in the Negev listed before Moladah among the towns where Judeans returned after exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.26">Neh 11:26</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Neh.11.20">20</a>). It may be identical with the Shema mentioned next to Moladah in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.26">Joshua 15:26</a>. The name is perhaps preserved in Tell es-Saâ€™weh, northeast of Beersheba.</p>
