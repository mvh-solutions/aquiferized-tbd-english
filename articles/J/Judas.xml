<p class="h1">JUDAS</p>
<p class="list">1. Simon’s son, surnamed Iscariot; one of the 12 disciples of Jesus. The derivation of Iscariot is uncertain. In all probability it designated the place of his birth, the town of Kerioth. His childhood home was perhaps Kerioth of Moab, east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.24">Jer 48:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.2">Am 2:2</a>), or Kerioth-hezron of southern Judah, also known as Hazor (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.25">Jos 15:25</a>). A less feasible suggestion identifies Iscariot with an Aramaic word meaning “assassin,” a word eventually attached to Judas’s name because of his betrayal of Jesus.</p>
<p class="list-text">Judas Iscariot’s name appears last in the list of disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.4">Mt 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.19">Mk 3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.16">Lk 6:16</a>), perhaps indicating his ignominy in the minds of later believers rather than his original importance among the Twelve. During Jesus’ public ministry, he managed the treasury of the group (<a href="?bref=John.13.29">Jn 13:29</a>), from which he was known to pilfer money (<a href="?bref=John.12.6">12:6</a>). As a betrayer, Judas contracted to turn Jesus over to the chief priests for 30 pieces of silver. He accomplished this act of treachery by singling out Jesus with a kiss in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.14-47">Mt 26:14-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.10-46">Mk 14:10-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.3-48">Lk 22:3-48</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.2-5">Jn 18:2-5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Various suggestions have been offered to explain Judas’s traitorous deed. (1) In keeping with his patriotic zeal, Judas turned Jesus over to the authorities after realizing that his Master did not intend to overthrow the Roman order and establish a Jewish state. (2) Judas believed Jesus to be the Messiah and planned his arrest in hope of urging Jesus to usher in his kingdom. (3) He was a scoundrel who had plotted wickedness since the start of Jesus’ public ministry. (4) Prompted by a satanic impulse, Judas betrayed Jesus; however, after recognizing that he was deceived, out of remorse he took his own life. (5) With damaged pride and humiliated ego from Jesus’ caustic rebukes, Judas, originally a loyal disciple, turned against him. (6) Judas, moved by his own greed, yielded to his selfish instincts, not realizing that Jesus would consequently be tried and killed; upon learning the outcome of his betrayal, he repented in despair and committed suicide.</p>
<p class="list-text">Judas, despondent over his act of betrayal, went out and hung himself in a field bought with his 30 pieces of silver (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-10">Mt 27:3-10</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.1.18">Acts 1:18</a> gruesomely adds that his body burst open, spilling out his intestines; for this reason the field was called the “Field of Blood” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.19">Acts 1:19</a>). Matthias later took Judas Iscariot’s place among the Twelve (v <a href="?bref=Acts.1.26">26</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Joseph and Mary, and the brother of Jesus, James, Joseph, and Simon (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>). Evidently Judas and his brothers rejected Jesus as Messiah (<a href="?bref=John.7.5">Jn 7:5</a>) until after his resurrection (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.14">Acts 1:14</a>). Later, it is thought, Judas (English “Jude”) authored the epistle named Jude.</p>
<p class="list">3. Son of James and one of the 12 disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.16">Lk 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.22">Jn 14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>). He is identifiable with Thaddeus in <a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Matthew 10:3</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mark 3:18</a>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=ThaddaeustheApostle_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Thaddaeus, The Apostle</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. Galilean who led a Jewish revolt against the Romans because of the census taken by Quirinius in <span class="era">AD</span> 6. In <a href="?bref=Acts.5.37">Acts 5:37</a> the Pharisee Gamaliel mentioned Judas as an example of one who unsuccessfully tried to gain the support of the Jewish people. Josephus credited him with founding the Jewish Zealot party, an extreme revolutionary movement that attempted to throw off Roman rule and to reestablish Jewish autonomy (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.8.1).</p>
<p class="list">5. Owner of a house along the street called Straight in Damascus. Here, following his conversion, Saul (Paul) found lodging and had his vision restored by Ananias (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.11">Acts 9:11</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. Prophet and leader in the early Jerusalem church. Judas, surnamed Barsabbas, was selected with Silas to accompany Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, where they confirmed the Jerusalem Council’s decision regarding the gentile church and subsequently encouraged its believers (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.22-32">Acts 15:22-32</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Joseph_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Joseph #12</a>.</p>
<p class="list">7. KJV spelling of Judah, Jacob’s son (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.2-3">Mt 1:2-3</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=JudahPerson_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Judah (Person) #1</a>.</p>
