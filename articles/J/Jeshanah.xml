<p class="h1">JESHANAH</p>
<p class="fl">Border city in the hill country of Ephraim that King Abijah of Judah (913–910 <span class="era">BC</span>) seized from King Jeroboam I (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the northern kingdom during a civil war (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.19">2 Chr 13:19</a>). The Greek and Syriac reading of “Jeshanah” as one of the towns between which Samuel erected the Ebenezer stone may be preferred to the Hebrew “Shen” in <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.12">1 Samuel 7:12</a>. Its location is perhaps near Burj el-Isaneh, four miles (6.4 kilometers) north of Bethel.</p>
