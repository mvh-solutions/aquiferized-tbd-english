<p class="h1">JESHIMON</p>
<p class="list">1. Desolate wilderness at the end of the Dead Sea, not far from Pisgah and Peor (<a href="?bref=Num.21.20">Nm 21:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.23.28">23:28</a>). In both passages the <span class="sc">nlt</span> renders it “wasteland” in the text but has “Jeshimon” in the margin, allowing it to be translated as a specific area. The <span class="sc">rsv</span> uses “desert.”</p>
<p class="list">2. Wilderness to the north of the hill of Hakilah and of Maon (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.19,24">1 Sm 23:19, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1-3">26:1-3</a>); this location was probably just a few miles south of Hebron.</p>
