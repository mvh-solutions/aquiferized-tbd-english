<p class="h1">JEHUDI</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Nethaniah and a messenger of King Jehoiakim of Judah. He was sent by a number of princes to summon Baruch to read Jeremiahâ€™s scroll privately to them. Later, Jehoiakim ordered Jehudi to read the same scroll publicly before him and all the court, after which the writing was burned (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.14-23">Jer 36:14-23</a>).</p>
