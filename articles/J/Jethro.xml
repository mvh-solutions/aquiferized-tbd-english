<p class="h1">JETHRO</p>
<p class="fl">Father-in-law of Moses. Zipporah, Jethro’s daughter, became Moses’ wife while he was a fugitive in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.21">Ex 2:21</a>). When Moses departed for Egypt, he took Zipporah and his sons with him (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.20">4:20</a>), but he must have sent them back. Jethro brought them to Moses after the Israelites arrived in Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.1-7">18:1-7</a>). Through this familial relationship with Moses, Jethro became involved with Israel.</p>
<p>Jethro’s relationship with Israel has been variously interpreted. Jethro was a priest of Midian (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16">Ex 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">3:1</a>). It is not definitely known what the religion of the Midianites was, but some scholars have suggested that the Kenites, who were a tribe included in the nation of Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>), had a tribal god named Yahweh whom Jethro served as priest. Scholars who have suggested that Jethro’s tribal god, Yahweh, was introduced to Israel by Moses have not been able to establish their case. Biblical evidence does not support this interpretation. That Jethro was a god-fearing and god-serving man is quite clear. The biblical record could be understood to teach that Jethro knew of Israel’s God because he was a descendant of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.2">Gn 25:2</a>). Having heard of Yahweh’s deliverance of his people from Egypt, Jethro acknowledged him as God, greatest of all gods. He also brought a burnt offering and sacrifices, thereby worshiping Yahweh and identifying with Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.11">Ex 18:11</a>). This action has been interpreted as Jethro’s acceptance of a covenant with Israel, but the interpretation rests upon a faulty reading of what Jethro actually did and the meaning of sacrifice and a fellowship meal. Upon receiving Jethro’s good counsel concerning procedures for judging disputes among the people, Moses appointed able men as heads and judges over the people (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-27">13-27</a>). Jethro departed to his own land and seems to have had no further interaction with Israel, but his son (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29-33">Nm 10:29-33</a>) and other descendants later became a part of Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">4:11</a>).</p>
<p> Jethro is referred to by other names, both in the Scriptures and later. The Talmud records that his name was Jether originally, but after his conversion it became Jethro; there is no definite evidence to support this. He is called Reuel, the father of seven daughters whom Moses met at a well (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16-18">Ex 2:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>). He is also referred to by the name Hobab (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Jgs 4:11</a>); and he is said to be the son of Reuel (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>). The Scriptures do not explain the use of the different names. Suggestions include the following: (1) each Midianite tribe he served as a priest knew him by a different name; (2) Reuel was a tribal name, not personal; (3) Hobab, the son’s name, was used to refer to the father; (4) a gloss appears in the text at <a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">Exodus 2:18</a> and <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a>. It can be quite clearly established, however, that Jethro had a son named Hobab.</p>
