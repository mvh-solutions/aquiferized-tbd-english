<p class="h1">JEHOVAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Name for God formed by adding the vowels of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> to the consonants of the Hebrew divine name, <span class="hebrew">YHWH</span><span class="ital">.</span> Out of their respect for God and their fear of defiling his name, the postexilic Jews refused to pronounce the divine name when reading Scripture. Instead, they substituted <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> a word meaning “my Lord.” Prior to the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>, the Hebrew text had no vowels. These were supplied during the reading of the Scripture by one who was familiar with the language. When vowel points were added to the text (<span class="era">AD</span> 660–700), the vowels of <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> were placed below the consonants of <span class="hebrew">YHWH</span> to indicate that <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> should be read.</p>
<p>It is thought that about <span class="era">AD</span> 1520 Petrus Galatinus conceived the idea of combining the two names, thus creating the new form <span class="ital">YeHoWaH,</span> from which the English term Jehovah comes. Although this form was foreign to the Hebrew language, it gained wide acceptance and was included as the translation for God’s name in various verses in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> and <span class="sc">asv</span>. Biblical scholars now agree that the original pronunciation of the divine name was <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> or <span class="hebrew">Jahveh</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
