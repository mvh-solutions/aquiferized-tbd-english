<p class="h1">JAAZIEL</p>
<p class="fl">One of the eight men appointed to play harps or lyres when the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.18-20">1 Chr 15:18-20</a>; and probably <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.5">16:5a</a>, “Jeiel,” which is most likely a copyist’s error). He is called Aziel in verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.20">20</a>.</p>
