<p class="fl">Names of two pillars Solomon set up before the temple vestibule. He named the south pillar Jachin and the north pillar Boaz (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.21">1 Kgs 7:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.17">2 Chr 3:17</a>). These hollow pillars were cast of bronze and measured about 27 feet (8.2 meters) in height and about 18 feet (5.5 meters) in circumference (nearly 6 feet, or 1.8 meters, in diameter). They were crowned with a capital (ornate cap or top) about 7½ feet (2.3 meters) high that consisted of cast lily work, chains, and 200 pomegranates each (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.15-20">1 Kgs 7:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.15-16">2 Chr 3:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.13">4:13</a>).</p>
