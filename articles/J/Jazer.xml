<p class="h1">JAZER</p>
<p class="fl">Town east of the Jordan River in southern Gilead, taken with its surrounding villages by the Israelites under Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.21.32">Nm 21:32</a>). The tribes of Gad and Reuben asked for the lands of Jazer and Gilead. They had large flocks and herds and saw that the east side of the Jordan was fertile and best suited for livestock grazing (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-5">32:1-5</a>). They promised to build protection for their women and children, then go with the other tribes to fight in Canaan (vv <a href="?bref=Num.32.6-27">6-27</a>). Jazer became a border point marking the inheritance of Gad (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.25">Jos 13:25</a>) and was given to the Levites (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.39">Jos 21:39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.81">1 Chr 6:81</a>). When Joab was sent to number the people, he reached the city of Jazer in Gad (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.5">2 Sm 24:5</a>). This town was later recognized during a search for “capable men” under King David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.31">1 Chr 26:31</a>). Just over 200 years later, however, it was occupied by Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.16.6-9">Is 16:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.32">Jer 48:32</a>).</p>
