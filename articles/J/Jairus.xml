<p class="h1">JAIRUS</p>
<p class="fl">Leader of the synagogue, perhaps at Capernaum. Jairus sought Jesus among the crowds and petitioned him to come and heal his critically ill daughter. While delayed by another healing, Jesus learned that Jairus’s daughter had died. Encouraging Jairus not to fear but to believe, Jesus went on to the leader’s house, dismissed the mourners, and brought the child back to life (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.22,35-42">Mk 5:22, 35-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.41,49-55">Lk 8:41, 49-55</a>).</p>
