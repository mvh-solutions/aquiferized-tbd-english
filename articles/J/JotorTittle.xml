<p class="h1">JOT OR TITTLE*</p>
<p class="fl">An expression Jesus used in the Sermon on the Mount. In <a href="?bref=Matt.5.18">Matthew 5:18</a> <span class="ital">jot</span> is a transliteration of the Greek letter <span class="ital">iota.</span> In this context it originally referred to the Hebrew letter <span class="ital">yod,</span> the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet. <span class="ital">Tittle</span> is a Middle English word referring to the diacritical dot placed over abbreviated words. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> translators used it to render a Greek word meaning “little horn.” The Jews used that word to refer to the small marking that distinguished certain Hebrew letters from one another. Jesus used the two terms to emphasize the importance of the law when he said not one jot or tittle would pass from the law until all was fulfilled.</p>
