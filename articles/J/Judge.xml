<p class="h1">JUDGE</p>
<p class="fl">An official authorized to decide matters brought before a court. The judge undertook a variety of tasks, mostly in legal and judicial areas, but at times in political areas. In the patriarchal period the elders of the tribes decided disputes. Moses appointed other judges to assist him, taking only the difficult cases himself (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-26">Ex 18:13-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.9-17">Dt 1:9-17</a>). Samuel went on circuit judging cases (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.16-17">1 Sm 7:16-17</a>); his sons became judges too (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1">8:1</a>). During the monarchy period, the office of judge was well established.</p>
<p>In the NT era two kinds of courts operated in Palestine, the Jewish and the Roman. Capital cases were tried before a Roman judge. Witnesses were produced at trials (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.16">Mt 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.1">2 Cor 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.19">1 Tm 5:19</a>). Jesus himself was tried before Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.11-25">Mt 27:11-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.2-5">Mk 15:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.2-3">Lk 23:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.29-40">Jn 18:29-40</a>), and Paul before Felix (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.1-26">Acts 24:1-26</a>) and Festus (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-26">25:1-26</a>).</p>
