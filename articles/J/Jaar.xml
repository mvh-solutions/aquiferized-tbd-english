<p class="h1">JAAR</p>
<p class="fl">Most common word in Hebrew for “forest.” It refers to forests generally (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.18">Is 10:18</a>) and to specific forests, such as the “forest of Ephraim” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.6">2 Sm 18:6</a>) and the “forest of Hereth” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.5">1 Sm 22:5</a>), both associated with King David. It also occurs as the name of one of Solomon’s buildings, “the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.2">1 Kgs 7:2</a>), apparently because of its extensive use of cedar. Only one occurrence of “Jaar” seems to be a proper name. <a href="?bref=Ps.132.6">Psalm 132:6</a> alludes to the transfer of the ark from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem. Here it is called the field of Jaar (or “the wood,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>), perhaps a poetic abbreviation.</p>
