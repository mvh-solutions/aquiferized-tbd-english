<p class="fl">Name of the righteous king of David’s line who God promised would rule over his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>). The name means “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> (Yahweh or Jehovah) is our righteousness.” It was also applied to the king’s subjects, who will profit by his reign (<a href="?bref=Jer.33.16">33:16</a>). To Christians, God’s promise finds its fulfillment in Christ, who is Lord of all and the believer’s righteousness.</p>
