<p class="h1">JUPITER*</p>
<p class="fl">Supreme Roman deity, equivalent to Zeus in Greek mythology. He was Saturn’s son and Juno’s husband and brother. Jupiter (also called Jove) was the god of destiny. His weapon was the thunderbolt; the eagle and the oak and olive trees were considered sacred in his worship. A temple of Jupiter stood in Rome on the Capitoline Hill. During Hadrian’s reign (<span class="era">AD</span> 117–138), a temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was erected on the foundation of the Jewish temple ruins in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>As a result of Barnabas and Paul’s ministry in Lystra during their first missionary journey, the people of Lystra thought they were Zeus and Hermes (Jupiter and Mercury) come down to visit them (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.12-13">Acts 14:12-13</a>).</p>
