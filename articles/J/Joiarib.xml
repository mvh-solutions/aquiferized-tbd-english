<p class="h1">JOIARIB</p>
<p class="list">1. One of the Jewish leaders whom Ezra sent to Iddo at Casiphia to gather Levites and temple servants for the caravan of Jews returning to Palestine from Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.16">Ezr 8:16</a>). He is alternately called Jehoiarib in <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.10">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Zechariah’s son, the father of Adaiah, and an ancestor of a Judahite family that resettled in Jerusalem during the postexilic era under Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.5">Neh 11:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Father of Jedaiah, a priest who served in the temple during the days of Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.10">Neh 11:10</a>). Perhaps Joiarib’s forefather was Jehoiarib, who was the head of the first course of priests ministering in the sanctuary during David’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Chr.24.7">1 Chr 24:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.10">9:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. One of the leaders of the priests who returned with Zerubbabel and Jeshua to Judah after the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.6">Neh 12:6</a>). His family in the next generation was headed by Mattenai (v <a href="?bref=Neh.12.19">19</a>).</p>
