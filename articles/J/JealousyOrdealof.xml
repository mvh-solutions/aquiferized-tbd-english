<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Num.5.11-28">Numbers 5:11-28</a> contains a provision by which a man who suspected his wife of adultery could bring her to the priest to determine her guilt or innocence. She had to appear with a grain offering, take an oath, and then drink “bitter” water mixed with dust taken from the tabernacle floor. As the woman drank the water, the priest offered the jealousy offering. If she were guilty, “her abdomen [would] swell and her thigh [would] waste away” (<a href="?bref=Num.5.27">Nm 5:27</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), and she would be a curse among the people. If she were innocent, no ill effects would result. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BitternessorJealousyWaterof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bitterness or Jealousy, Water of</a>.</p>
