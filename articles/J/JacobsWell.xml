<p class="h1">JACOB’S WELL</p>
<p class="fl">Place mentioned only in John’s Gospel (<a href="?bref=John.4.5-29">Jn 4:5-29</a>). It was here that Jesus sat and talked with the unnamed woman of Samaria, who readily accepted Jesus’ words. This well is located in a plot of ground acquired by the patriarch Jacob, about 300 yards (274 meters) southeast from the traditional tomb of Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.19">Gn 33:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.5-6">Jn 4:5-6</a>). The site is about two miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of modern Nablus, 600 yards (549 meters) southeast of the site of ancient Shechem (modern Balata), and 1,000 yards (914 meters) south of Sychar (modern Askar). Towering over the site on the northwest is Mt Ebal (at the foot of which lies Askar), and on the southwest Mt Gerizim, mountains of cursing and blessing, respectively (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.12-13">Dt 27:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-33">Jos 8:30-33</a>). Near here Abraham built his first altar, and Jacob his second (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.6-7">Gn 12:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.33.18-20">33:18-20</a>). Thus the site is one of the most ancient and sacred in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The well is about 100 feet (30.5 meters) in depth and one yard (.9 meter) in diameter, cut through limestone. Fed by subterranean streams from the adjacent mountain slopes, the water is pure and plentiful, the pride of the villagers. A church has existed on the site from at least <span class="era">AD</span> 380. The Greek Orthodox Church acquired the site in 1885 and built a structure on the site. Access to the well is by steps leading from either side of the church altar to the well curb below.</p>
