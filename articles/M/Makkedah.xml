<p class="h1">MAKKEDAH</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Shephelah towns conquered during the southern campaign led by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.10-29">Jos 10:10-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.16">12:16</a>). It belonged to the same district as Lachish (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.41">15:41</a>). Eusebius placed it eight Roman miles east of Eleutheropolis (Beth-guvrin), which would lead to Beit-Maqdum, a Roman-Byzantine ruin beside the Roman road from Eleutheropolis to Hebron. The biblical site may have been at Khirbet el-Qom about one-half mile (.8 kilometer) to the southwest.</p>
