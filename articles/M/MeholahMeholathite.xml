<p class="h1">MEHOLAH, MEHOLATHITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Location used to describe Adriel the son of Barzillai, who was the husband of Merab, Saul’s eldest daughter (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.19">1 Sm 18:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.8">2 Sm 21:8</a>). He was probably from Abel-meholah, an important city of Gilead. The marriage of Adriel and Merab was probably a political move by Saul, agreed to by David, who was to have married Merab himself (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.17-19">1 Sm 18:17-19</a>).</p>
