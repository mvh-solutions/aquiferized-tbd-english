<p class="h1">MACCABEES, 1 and 2</p>
<p class="fl">Two deuterocanonical books that cover the period of Israel’s history from 167 <span class="era">BC</span> to 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. The books are named after Judas Maccabeus, who initiated the Jewish revolt in 166 <span class="era">BC</span> against Rome. The chief value of these books is that they provide historical accounts of Israel’s struggles during the time between Malachi (the last book of the Jewish canon) and the time of Christ (6/5 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 30).</p>
<p class="h2">1 Maccabees</p>
<p class="fl">This work was written, much as Chronicles was, to record a “spiritual” history of the nation, except that it deals exclusively with the Maccabean period up to 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. The author, who is unknown, drew upon some genuine literary sources, although the authenticity of parts of the work has been questioned.</p>
<p class="h2">2 Maccabees</p>
<p class="fl">This book (written c. 100 <span class="era">BC</span>) is even more theologically oriented than 1 Maccabees. Whereas 1 Maccabees endeavors to present a reasonably objective account of the Hasmoneans, 2 Maccabees comprises a rhetorical summary of a considerably larger work on the subject of the Maccabean era. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MaccabeanPeriod_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Maccabean Period</a>.</p>
