<p class="fl">Abraham’s first recorded stopping place upon entering Palestine after leaving Mesopotamia. Here he built an altar to God (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.6">Gn 12:6</a>). Later, Moses mentioned this place as a geographical landmark to identify the whereabouts of Mt Gerizim and Mt Ebal (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.30">Dt 11:30</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> improperly reads “plain” of Moreh. The oak of Moreh was located near Shechem.</p>
