<p class="h1">MAKTESH*</p>
<p class="fl">Locality within the topography of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.11">Zep 1:11</a>). Since the word means “mortar,” the expression here should refer to some basinlike depression. It is probably the Tyropeon Valley opposite the temple mount, though the Targum equates it with the Kidron.</p>
