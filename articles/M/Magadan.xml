<p class="h1">MAGADAN</p>
<p class="fl">Locality visited by Jesus after he crossed the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.39">Mt 15:39</a>). The correct spelling was most likely Magdala. The only NT reference to this town is in the name of one of the Marys, namely, <span class="ital">Magdalene.</span> Magadan was known by several names; many Greek sources have Taricheae, “factories for salting fish” (Strabo 16.2.45; Pliny 5.71). Rabbinic sources have Migdal Nunnayah or Migdal Sab’aiyah, “Tower of the Fishes/ Dyers.” It was el-Mejdel about three miles (4.8 kilometers) northwest of Tiberias, on the southern end of the great plain of Gennesaret, famous for its fertile soil and year-round tropical climate.</p>
