<p class="list">1. Joseph’s grandson and the firstborn son of Manasseh through his Aramean concubine (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.23">Gn 50:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.14">1 Chr 7:14</a>). Machir was the father of Gilead and the founder of the Machirite family (<a href="?bref=Num.26.29">Nm 26:29</a>). His descendants dispossessed the Amorites living in the land of Gilead east of the Jordan during the days of Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.32.39">Nm 32:39</a>); later, they were assigned this land along with Bashan for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.15">Dt 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.1-3">Jos 17:1-3</a>). In <a href="?bref=Judg.5.14">Judges 5:14</a>, the whole tribe of Manasseh is called by this name.</p>
<p class="list">2. Ammiel’s son living at Lo-debar, a town east of the Jordan. Machir provided shelter for Mephibosheth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.4-5">2 Sm 9:4-5</a>) and later, with Shobi and Barzillai, took care of David’s domestic needs during his flight from Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.27">2 Sm 17:27</a>).</p>
