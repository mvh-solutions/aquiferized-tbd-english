<p class="h1">MAMRE (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Important oak grove near which Abraham lived, and named for an Amorite who helped him defeat Chedorlaomer and rescue Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.13,24">Gn 14:13, 24</a>). Abraham erected an altar under the oak of Mamre (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">13:18</a>). Abraham was sitting by the sacred tree when he welcomed three mysterious guests (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">18</a>). Mamre is also a possible site for the scene of Abrahamic covenant ceremonies (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">15</a>). Isaac and Jacob also lived there (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.27">35:27</a>).</p>
