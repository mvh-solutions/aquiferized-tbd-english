<p class="h1">MAHAVAH, MAHAVITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Term used in <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.46">1 Chronicles 11:46</a> to designate Eliel, one of David’s mighty men. The word was probably added to indicate where he came from so as to distinguish him from the Eliel in verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.47">47</a>.</p>
