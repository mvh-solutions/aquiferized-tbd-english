<p class="fl">Chief town in the hill country of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.55">Jos 15:55</a>), about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) south of Hebron. David and his men hid in this area while fleeing from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.24-25">1 Sm 23:24-25</a>), and David’s wife Abigail was from this town (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.2-3">25:2-3</a>). It has been identified with modern Tell Ma’in, where pottery was found dating from the time of David.</p>
