<p class="h1">MEREMOTH</p>
<p class="list">1. Priest, son of Uriah, grandson of Hakkoz (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.33">Ezr 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.3.4,21">Neh 3:4, 21</a>). The family of Hakkoz was unable to prove its descent; therefore, they were excluded from the priesthood. Meremoth appears to be an exception. He weighed silver and gold (a priestly function [<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.24-30">Ezr 8:24-30</a>]), repaired part of the Jerusalem wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.4,21">Neh 3:4, 21</a>), and sealed the covenant (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.5">10:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Priest and Bani’s son, who severed ties with his foreign wife and children at Ezra’s request (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.36">Ezr 10:36</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.3">Neh 12:3</a>) and established the house of priests called Meraioth in <a href="?bref=Neh.12.15">Nehemiah 12:15</a> (though some identify the two references as the same person).</p>
