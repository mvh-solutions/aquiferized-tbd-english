<p class="h1">ME-JARKON</p>
<p class="fl">Topographical designation in the description of Dan’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.46">Jos 19:46</a>). It is probably not a settlement; Jarkon seems to be the name of the river (el-’Awjah) flowing across the coastal plain from the springs at Aphek to the coast four miles (6.4 kilometers) north of Joppa. It was a formidable obstacle to north–south travel, but the numerous ancient sites along its banks testify to its importance as an entryway from the sea to the interior of the country.</p>
