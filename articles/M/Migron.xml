<p class="h1">MIGRON</p>
<p class="fl">Site where Saul rested under a pomegranate tree, near Gibeah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.2">1Â Sm 14:2</a>); also mentioned as part of the line of march of the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.28">Is 10:28</a>). The first reference is to a site south of Michmash, the second is probably north of Michmash. Some scholars, however, try to identify both with the site south of Michmash, though this is doubtful.</p>
