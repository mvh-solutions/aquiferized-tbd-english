<p class="h1">MATTANAH</p>
<p class="fl">Place of encampment for Israel following the exodus as the company moved east of the Dead Sea from the Arnon River northward into the territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.18-19">Nm 21:18-19</a>). Its exact location is unknown, but Khirbet el-Medeiyineh on the left bank of Wadi eth-Themed is considered its most likely setting.</p>
