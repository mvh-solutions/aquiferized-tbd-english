<p class="h1">MIGDOL</p>
<p class="fl">Town in the eastern delta of Lower Egypt. In the narrative of the exodus it appears between the place called Pi-hahiroth and Baal-zephon (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.2">Ex 14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.7">Nm 33:7</a>). Some scholars who think the exodus route must have taken the Israelites south into the Sinai Mountains think these three sites were somewhere near Suez. Others who think the Serbonitic Lake is the Reed Sea accept the identification of this Migdol with that mentioned by Jeremiah as the dwelling place of exiled Jews in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.1">Jer 44:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.14">46:14</a>). That place must be identical with the Migdol that represents the north (eastern) extremity of Egypt in juxtaposition to Syene in the far south (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.10">Ez 29:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.6">30:6</a>). Not all scholars agree on whether Migdol is a single location or two separate locations. Nonbiblical sources refer to Migdol—for example, Papyrus Anastasi 5.19, where it appears in association with Succoth in a message about runaway slaves. It also appears on the wall relief of Seti I as a fortress between Sillo (Sele) and the other northern Sinai forts. The Antonine Itinerary places Magdolo between Pelusium and Sele, which would make the equation with Tell el-Heir, 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) north, most likely.</p>
