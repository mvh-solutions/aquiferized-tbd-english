<p class="h1">MEMUCAN</p>
<p class="fl">One of the seven princes of Persia and Media under King Ahasuerus (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.14-21">Est 1:14-21</a>). He brought charges against Vashti, the Persian queen, who had refused to make a royal appearance that the king had commanded (v <a href="?bref=Esth.1.16">16</a>). Memucan proposed that she be divested of her position and the queenship given to another; the king took his counsel and issued a decree to that effect (v <a href="?bref=Esth.1.21">21</a>). Hence Esther was chosen as queen over Media and Persia.</p>
