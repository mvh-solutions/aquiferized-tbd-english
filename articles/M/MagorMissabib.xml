<p class="h1">MAGOR-MISSABIB*</p>
<p class="fl">Name given by Jeremiah to Pashhur, the chief officer in the house of the Lord. Jeremiah did this because Pashhur put him in stocks for prophesying judgment upon Judah (<a href="?bref=Jer.19.14-20.2">Jer 19:14–20:2</a>). The name Pashhur means “prosperity round about” and was changed to “terror on every side” (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.3">20:3</a>) because Pashhur was to see the horrors of the Babylonian invasion.</p>
