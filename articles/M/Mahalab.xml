<p class="h1">MAHALAB*</p>
<p class="fl">Reconstructed name of a town in Asher’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.29">Jos 19:29</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> “Mehebel”); the Hebrew text has a transposition of the last two consonants, but the town is probably the same as Ahlab and Helbah of <a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Judges 1:31</a>. The correct name is preserved in the Assyrian annals of Sennacherib as Mahalliba; another text has Mahalab. The town is sometimes identified with Khirbet el-Mahalib, northeast of Tyre.</p>
