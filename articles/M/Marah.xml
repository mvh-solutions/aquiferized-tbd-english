<p class="h1">MARAH</p>
<p class="fl">Spring of water in the wilderness of Etham, the first camping place of the Israelites after crossing the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.23">Ex 15:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.8-9">Nm 33:8-9</a>). The accepted identification is with ‘Ain Hawarah, a pool of bitter water on the eastern coastal plain of the Gulf of Suez, about 44 miles (70.8 kilometers) southeast of Suez, and about 5 miles (8 kilometers) northwest of ‘Ain Gharandel, south of Wadi Amarah (which may preserve an echo of the ancient name).</p>
