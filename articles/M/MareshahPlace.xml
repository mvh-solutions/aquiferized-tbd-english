<p class="fl">City (Greek <span class="greek">Marisa</span><span class="ital">;</span> Josephus, “Marissa”) on the road from the coastal plain of Judah toward Hebron and Jerusalem.

<p>At Israel’s occupation of Canaan, Mareshah was allotted by Joshua to Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.44">Jos 15:44</a>). Later, at the division of the kingdom, Rehoboam fortified it as a protective outpost covering Jerusalem from the southwest, from which many invaders were to approach (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.8">2 Chr 11:8</a>). Zerah the Ethiopian, with a million men and three hundred chariots, penetrated as far as Mareshah and was defeated there by Asa (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.9">14:9</a>). In the following reign, that of Jehoshaphat, the prophet Eliezer, born at Mareshah, foretold the destruction of the proud fleet the king had built (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.37">20:37</a>).</p>
<p>The prophet Micah, who was born at Moresheth-gath (a few miles to the north), uttered a moving elegy upon the fate of the regions he knew from boyhood, as the Assyrians approached (whether under Sennacherib, 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, or Sargon, 711 <span class="era">BC</span>). Punning upon each familiar place-name, he warned Mareshah of a coming “possessor” (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.15">Mi 1:15</a>).</p>
