<p class="h1">MORTAR*, The</p>
<p class="fl">Name given by Zephaniah to a hollow place or depression resembling a mortar in Jerusalem. The “mortar” (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">Maktesh</span>) was a place of business whose merchants were soon to grieve for their loss of trade (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.11">Zep 1:11</a>). Its location is variously identified with the Phoenician quarter, the Kidron Valley, or the Tyropoeon Valley.</p>
