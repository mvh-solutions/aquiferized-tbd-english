<p class="h1">MACHBENAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Evidently a place-name among the geographical names in the genealogy of Caleb and Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.49">1Â Chr 2:49</a>). It is followed by Gibea, which is probably the same town mentioned in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.57">Joshua 15:57</a>; thus, Machbenah was probably located in the eastern district of the hill country south of Hebron, an area where Calebites were to be expected.</p>
