<p class="h1">MARKET, MARKETPLACE</p>
<p class="fl">Place for the buying and selling of goods in antiquity. Generally, the marketplaces of the ancient Near East would be much like the open air bazaars one can still see in any city throughout Israel, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>The marketplace of NT times known as the <span class="greek">agora</span> was a place for buying and selling goods (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.4">Mk 7:4</a>); a place for children to play (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.16">Mt 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.32">Lk 7:32</a>); a place for idlers and for men seeking work (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.3">Mt 20:3</a>); a place where public events, including healings, occurred (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.56">Mk 6:56</a>); the center of public life and debate (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.17">Acts 17:17</a>); and a place where trials were held (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.19">16:19</a>).</p>
