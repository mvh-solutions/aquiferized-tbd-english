<p class="h1">PAHATH-MOAB</p>
<p class="fl">Head of a family of Israelites who returned with Zerubbabel to Palestine after the Babylonian captivity (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.6">Ezr 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.11">Neh 7:11</a>). Other members of his family, about 200 men, came with Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.4">Ezr 8:4</a>). After the return, certain of his sons were included among the Israelites who vowed to sever their relationships with foreign wives (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.30">10:30</a>). Hasshub, Pahath-moab’s son, helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall and the tower of furnaces in Nehemiah’s day (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.11">Neh 3:11</a>). Pahath-moab, called a chief of the people, set his seal on Ezra’s covenant (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.14">10:14</a>).</p>
