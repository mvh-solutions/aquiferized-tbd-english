<p class="h1"><span class="lc">PERAZIM, Mount</span></p>
<p class="fl">Mountain mentioned in <a href="?bref=Isa.28.21">Isaiah 28:21</a>, apparently near Baal-perazim, the “Baal of Breaches,” where David defeated the Philistines. From the context of <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.20">2 Samuel 5:20</a>, this battleground was evidently located in the valley of Rephaim, southwest of Jerusalem.</p>
