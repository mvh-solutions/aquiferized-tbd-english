<p class="h1">PSYCHICS</p>
<p class="fl">People who have contact with supernatural forces and who claim to be able to interpret their intentions. In the OT, such people are grouped with “mediums”—that is, people who claim to mediate between supernatural forces and human beings. The Scriptures everywhere prohibit God’s people to use the services of psychics or mediums (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.31">Lv 19:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.6,27">20:6, 27</a>).</p>
