<p class="h1">PRESENCE OF GOD, T<span class="lc">he</span></p>
<p class="fl">God’s manifestation of his spiritual being. Since God is spirit, believers experience him by sensing his invisible presence. God also makes himself known in other ways. He appears in nature, particularly in catastrophic forces—fire, lightning, and earthquake (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.11-13">1 Kgs 19:11-13</a>). He also appears in human form (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">Gn 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.32.22-32">32:22-32</a>). So God, who cannot be seen, has chosen ways to reveal himself.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="h3">The Angel of the Lord</p>
<p class="fl">The angel of the Lord was God’s emissary and Israel’s special helper, although it is not said that the same angel is meant in every instance (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.19">Ex 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.20">23:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.2">33:2</a>). After the angel vanishes, Hagar insists that she had seen God himself (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.13">Gn 16:13</a>). In Jacob’s experience the angel identifies himself with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.11-13">31:11-13</a>); while in <a href="?bref=Gen.21.18">Genesis 21:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.22.11">22:11</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.22.35">Numbers 22:35</a>, the “I” of deity signified God’s presence in the angel. There is also oscillation between God and the angel in <a href="?bref=Exod.12.23">Exodus 12:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.48.15-16">Genesis 48:15-16</a>. Here God was temporarily incarnating himself within the form of the angel, assuring his own that he was immediately present with them.</p>
<p class="h3">The Glory of God</p>
<p class="fl">Glory is what God possesses in his own right, a visible extension of his nature, a “concrete” form of his divine presence. The heavens are a visible form of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Pss 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">19:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.5">136:5</a>), for they are his glory. The glory that appeared to Israel as devouring fire on Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.43">Ex 29:43</a>) filled the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">40:34-38</a>). By it God consecrated the tabernacle as the place of his presence. In <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Isaiah 6</a> the glory appears as the normal expression of the divine presence. In Ezekiel the glory is identical with God (<a href="?bref=Ezek.9.3-4">Ez 9:3-4</a>). Throughout the OT the glory of God is the transcendent God making his presence and nearness visible to his own.</p>
<p class="h3">The Face of God</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT “presence” is used to represent the Hebrew word for “face”; when “face” is conjoined with a preposition, it means “in the presence of.” In <a href="?bref=Gen.32.30">Genesis 32:30</a> Jacob saw God “face to face.” A man’s personality and character are made visible on his face. In this sense a man’s face is the man. So, “the angel of his presence [face]” (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.9">Is 63:9</a>) may mean “the angel who is his face,” since the prophet may have intended the identification. The face of God is the revelation of the grace of God. So, when he hides his face, he is withholding his grace. But when he makes his face shine (<a href="?bref=Ps.31.16">Ps 31:16</a>), there is blessing (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.3">44:3</a>). The face of God, then, is the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.14">Ex 33:14</a>). To pray to God in a holy place was to “seek God’s face” (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.6">Ps 24:6</a>), his personal presence. Indeed, this sums up temple worship and private prayer in Israel (<a href="?bref=Ps.63.1-3">63:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.100.2">100:2</a>). The blessing of God consisted in his face shining upon them (<a href="?bref=Num.6.25">Nm 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.3,7,19">Ps 80:3, 7, 19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Name of God</p>
<p class="fl">Among Semites, the equation of the name and the person was a common idea. So also, the name of God was an interchangeable term for God himself, a symbol of his activity in revelation. The linking of man’s worship of God with the divine name of God was the medium of his operation (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.5">Pss 44:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.24">89:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.27">Is 30:27</a>), a designation for the power of God that radiates help and energy universally. God could act by his name. The angel of the Lord’s authority and power functioned because God’s name was in him (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.20-21">Ex 23:20-21</a>). As bearer of the divine name, he made real the hidden presence of God. The temple was the dwelling place of the name (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.36">1 Kgs 11:36</a>), not only because God’s name was invoked there but also because God’s presence—God himself—dwelt there.</p>
<p class="h3">The Spirit of God</p>
<p class="fl">In the Holy Spirit the transcendent God draws near to his people. The Spirit is the medium through whom God’s presence becomes real among his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.11-14">Is 63:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.12">Zec 7:12</a>) and by whom God’s gifts and powers operate among them (<a href="?bref=2Chr.15.1">2 Chr 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.14">20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20">24:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6">Zec 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>). The Spirit was the presence and power of God with his people—God himself acting in accordance with his essential nature. The sinner cannot be in the presence of God without the aid of God’s Holy Spirit; to be deprived of the Holy Spirit is to be deprived of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.11">Ps 51:11</a>). Without the Spirit, communion between God and humans is not possible.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT a new mode of God’s presence is revealed. It is in Jesus Christ the incarnate Word that God is present among his own (<a href="?bref=John.1.14-18">Jn 1:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.6,26">17:6, 26</a>). Jesus’ mission was to reveal God to humanity. This he did through his whole life’s work as well as through his words. His revelation of the name of God was expressed in his own name—Jesus (“The Lord Is Salvation”). And in the person of Jesus the function of the name of God found fulfillment. Christ was the new temple (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.21">2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">Col 2:9</a>). He was the locus of the tabernacling presence of God. But that was only a first installment of the unveiling of God’s presence.</p>
<p>The church now constitutes the temple of God in the NT. Christianity is essentially the religion of the presence of God and of communion with God. The body of Christ, “the spiritual temple” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.22">Eph 2:22</a>), made of “living stones” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>), is the residence of the presence of the glorious God.</p>
<p>And now, the individual Christian is also a temple of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16">2 Cor 6:16</a>). God is especially present in the Christian’s spirit; there God reigns, for there is his kingdom; there he is worshiped, for there his glory and his presence have consecrated the inner being into a temple (see <a href="?bref=John.14.23">Jn 14:23</a>).</p>
