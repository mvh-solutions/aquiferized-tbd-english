<p class="h1">PENUEL* (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to the place near the Jabbok River where Jacob strove all night with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.31">Gn 32:31</a>); alternately called Peniel in verse <a href="?bref=Gen.32.30">30</a>. During the period of the judges, Gideon destroyed the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city for refusing to join him in war against the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.8-9,17">Jgs 8:8-9, 17</a>). Later, King Jeroboam rebuilt the town (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.25">1Â Kgs 12:25</a>). It was positioned near Succoth east of the Jordan River, though its exact location remains uncertain.</p>
