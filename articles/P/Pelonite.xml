<p class="h1">PELONITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Designation given to two of David’s mighty men, Helez and Ahijah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.27,36">1 Chr 11:27, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.10">27:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> “from Pelon”). No sources for the designation are known, which has led some scholars to consider it a textual corruption. In <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.26">2 Samuel 23:26</a>, Helez is called a Paltite, and Ahijah is probably identical to Eliam the Gilonite in <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.34">2 Samuel 23:34</a>. The latter are preferred over “Pelonite” in both cases. Others suggest that Pelonite is derived from the town Beth-pelet (see <a href="?bref=Josh.15.27">Jos 15:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.26">Neh 11:26</a>).</p>
