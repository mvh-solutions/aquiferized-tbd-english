<p class="h1">PASTORAL LETTERS*</p>
<p class="fl">Descriptive phrase used in modern biblical study to designate the letters known as 1 and 2Â Timothy and Titus. In Christian tradition these three writings have been grouped together since the second century. They are addressed to individuals rather than to churches. The benediction at the end of each letter assumes a group of readers, however. In general, the letters offer advice to their recipients about church order, false doctrine, leadership standards, and pastoral oversight of church life.</p>
