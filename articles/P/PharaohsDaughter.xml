<p class="h1">PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="list">1. Egyptian princess who rescued the infant Moses and adopted him as her own son (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.5-10">Ex 2:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.21">Acts 7:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.24">Heb 11:24</a>). If one accepts an early date for the exodus, this foster mother of Moses could have been Hatshepsut. Some scholars who accept a later date for the exodus believe the pharaoh of the oppression was Ramses II; if so, this princess may have been the daughter of Seti I or the daughter of a pharaoh of the later 18th dynasty. It is likely that she was born to a concubine from a royal harem near the region of Goshen.</p>
<p class="list">2. An Egyptian princess, one of the two wives of Mered (a descendant of Caleb) who gave birth to three children (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.17">1 Chr 4:17</a>). Her name, Bithiah (meaning “daughter of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>”), implies that she was converted to the worship of Israel’s God. It is not known which pharaoh was her father.</p>
<p class="list">3. Princess whom Solomon married in order to seal an alliance with Egypt. Her father was probably Siamun (978–959 <span class="era">BC</span>). He gave to Solomon the town of Gezer as a marriage dowry (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1">1 Kgs 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.16">9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1">11:1</a>). Solomon built her a palace in Jerusalem because he would not have her live in David’s house (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.8">1 Kgs 7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.24">9:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.11">2 Chr 8:11</a>).</p>
