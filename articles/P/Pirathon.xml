<p class="h1">PIRATHON</p>
<p class="fl">Home of Abdon, one of the minor judges (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.13-15">Jgs 12:13-15</a>). It is described as being in the land of Ephraim and in the hill country of the Amalekites. This may indicate that it originally belonged to the Amalekites or that it was seized by them during one of their invasions. Benaiah, one of David’s mighty men, is also called a Pirathonite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.30">2 Sm 23:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.31">1 Chr 11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.14">27:14</a>). It is generally identified with Ferata, situated on a high rock six miles (9.7 kilometers) southwest of Samaria.</p>
