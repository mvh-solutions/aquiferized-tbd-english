<p class="h1">PEARL</p>
<p class="fl">Gem formed within the shell of certain mollusks. The word appears only once in the OT (<a href="?bref=Job.28.18">Jb 28:18</a>). However, some think that the reference to a reddish stone in <a href="?bref=Lam.4.7">Lamentations 4:7</a> may be to the pink pearl found in the Red Sea. By the NT period, the pearl was a prized piece of feminine jewelry (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.9">1Â Tm 2:9</a>), an item of trade (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.45-46">Mt 13:45-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.12-16">Rv 18:12-16</a>), and an object of high price. Being familiar objects, pearls were frequently used by Jesus in his illustrations. A fine pearl was an object of such great value that a man might sell all his accumulated wealth to purchase it (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.45-46">Mt 13:45-46</a>). A pearl (used figuratively for the word of the Lord) would not be given to those who, like pigs, had no appreciation for its value (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.6">7:6</a>).</p>
