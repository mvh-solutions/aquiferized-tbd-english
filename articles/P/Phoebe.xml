<p class="h1">PHOEBE</p>
<p class="fl">Christian woman of the church at Cenchrea, the eastern port for the city of Corinth. In <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-2">Romans 16:1-2</a>, Paul commended Phoebe to the recipients of the letter on the basis of her valuable service to other Christians. He asked that they give her whatever assistance she needed.</p>
<p>The term “deacon” is applied to Phoebe. It probably designates an official position in the church, as in <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Philippians 1:1</a>, although it may mean “minister” in the same sense that Paul uses it elsewhere of himself and others (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.5">1 Cor 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">2 Cor 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.4">6:4</a>).</p>
