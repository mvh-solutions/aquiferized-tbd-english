<p class="h1">PAPHOS</p>
<p class="fl">Originally a Phoenician settlement in southwest Cyprus. “Old Paphos” was supplemented by a Greek settlement, “New Paphos,” some 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) distant; the new one became the administrative center when Cyprus became a senatorial province of Rome in 22 <span class="era">BC</span>. The combined city was famous for its temple, dedicated originally to the Syrian goddess Astarte, worshiped (according to Tacitus) with ancient Phoenician rites involving anointing of a conical stone (meteorite?). The Greeks identified her with Aphrodite, claiming she sprang from the sea.</p>
<p>At Paphos, Paul first met vigorous opposition to the gospel from Elymas. Here Paul performed his first recorded miracle. Mercifully, Elymas’s blindness was only “for a time” (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.11">Acts 13:11</a>).</p>
