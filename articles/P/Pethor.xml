<p class="h1">PETHOR</p>
<p class="fl">Hometown of Balaam (<a href="?bref=Num.22.5">Nm 22:5</a>). Pethor is located in Upper Mesopotamia at the confluence of the Sajur River and the Euphrates. Balaam the son of Beor is said to have come from Pethor of Mesopotamia (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.4">Dt 23:4</a>). Pethor is identified with Pi-it/ti-ru of the inscriptions of Shalmaneser III (859–824 <span class="era">BC</span>) as a site on the Sajur River. The city was known according to the inscriptions as Pethor by the Hittites (i.e., Syrians or Arameans). It went from Assyrian control to Aramean dominion, was taken again by Shalmaneser, and resettled with Assyrians.</p>
