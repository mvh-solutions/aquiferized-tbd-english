<p class="list">2. Laish’s son, to whom King Saul gave Michal, his daughter and David’s wife, after the break between Saul and David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.44">1 Sm 25:44</a>). Michal was recovered from him and returned to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.15">2 Sm 3:15</a>); in that reference he is called Paltiel.</p>
