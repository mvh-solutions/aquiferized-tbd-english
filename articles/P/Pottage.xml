<p class="h1">POTTAGE*</p>
<p class="fl">Red-colored vegetable stew commonly served in the OT (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.12">Hg 2:12</a>). Pottage was made of lentils, herbs, onions, and sometimes meat. Its aroma proved strong enough to shift a birthright from Esau to Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.29-34">Gn 25:29-34</a>). Elisha’s disciples relished its nourishment (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38-41">2 Kgs 4:38-41</a>).</p>
