<p class="h1">PENTATEUCH*</p>
<p class="fl">Word formed by two Greek words, <span class="greek">pente</span> (“five”) and <span class="greek">teuchos</span> (“case”) and commonly used to refer to the first five books of the OT (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), which were encased together, as in one book. This portion of God’s Word was written by Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.14">Ex 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">24:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.27">34:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.1-2">Nm 33:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31.9,22">Dt 31:9, 22</a>) and constitutes the foundation upon which all other Scripture rests. The Pentateuch begins with the creation of the universe and records God’s dealings with mankind in the Garden of Eden, his preparation of a seed-bearing line (the patriarchal stories), and the formation of the nation Israel. A substantial portion of the Pentateuch consists of laws governing the religious and civil life of the theocratic nation.</p>
