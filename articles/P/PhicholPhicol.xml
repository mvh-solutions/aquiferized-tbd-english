<p class="h1">PHICHOL*, PHICOL</p>
<p class="fl">Commander of Abimelech’s army, mentioned in connection with his ruler’s treaty negotiations with Abraham and Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.22,32">Gn 21:22, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.26">26:26</a>). The presence of an army commander should have indicated Abraham’s vulnerability, but the adversaries acknowledged the superior power of Abraham’s God and thus sought peaceful coexistence with him.</p>
