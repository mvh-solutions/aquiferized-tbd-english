<p class="h1">PARAN</p>
<p class="fl">Desert region in the northeast Sinai Peninsula west of the Arabah (Rift Valley). The settlement of Kadesh-barnea is its northernmost limit. Some scholars identify the great Et-Tih plateau of the central Sinai as a part of this wilderness.</p>
<p>The wilderness of Paran is a wild, arid expanse of tableland, mountains, gorges, and wadis. The lack of water and vegetation made it a most inhospitable place and a stark contrast to the land flowing with milk and honey that was promised to Israel.</p>
<p>This wilderness became the home of Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.20-21">Gn 21:20-21</a>). The nation of Israel camped there on the way from Egypt to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.10.12">Nm 10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.16">12:16</a>). From Kadesh-barnea, at the northern edge of the wilderness, Moses sent spies to reconnoiter the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.13.3,26">13:3, 26</a>). David is said to have led his band of men to this region after the death of Samuel so as to distance himself from King Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">1 Sm 25:1</a>).</p>
