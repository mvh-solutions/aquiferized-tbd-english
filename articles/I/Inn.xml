<p class="h1">INN</p>
<p class="fl">Place of lodging for travelers.</p>
<p>In the OT, the word “inn” occurs three times (<span class="sc">kjv</span>): twice in reference to overnight rests of Joseph’s brothers during their journeys between Egypt and Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.27">Gn 42:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.21">43:21</a>), and once in a similar situation when Moses was returning to Egypt from Midian to lead the children of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.24">Ex 4:24</a>). The <span class="sc">rsv</span> translates each of these instances as “lodging place” because in the time of the patriarchs and Moses the Near East had nothing to correspond to the inn as a public place with accommodations for hire to travelers. In a settled country a traveler could ordinarily expect hospitality from the inhabitants. Throughout the Near East, hospitality was viewed as a serious social responsibility (see <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-3">Gn 19:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.15-21">Jgs 19:15-21</a>). In deserted areas travelers would provide for their own shelter (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.28.11">Gn 28:11</a>) and sustenance (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.9.11-13">Jos 9:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>The beginning of real inns in Palestine is obscure. It has been argued that they had a foreign origin, since the rabbinic words for “inn” are borrowed from Greek and Latin. References to Rahab (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.1">Jos 2:1</a>) as innkeeper in the Targum and in Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 5.1.12) may be anachronistic, and they provide no reliable witness to the existence of inns during the time of Joshua, though there are parallels in the Near East of women keeping an establishment providing both lodging and sexual activity for travelers. Certainly there is evidence for Greek inns as early as the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, and they became common in the Hellenized Mediterranean. They were typically uncomfortable and dangerous.</p>
<p>Such an “inn” with an “innkeeper” sheltered the victim of robbers whom the Good Samaritan befriended (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.34-35">Lk 10:34-35</a>). This inn was probably much like the khan or caravansary, which has been common along the trade and pilgrimage routes of Syria since ancient times. It was built in the form of a square enclosing an open court where water and shelter were available, but the traveler typically supplied his own food and sometimes his own bedding. The Good Samaritan clearly expected the host to provide full care for the wounded man; it is difficult to tell whether this was customary or simply an accommodation to the emergency. The inn of Jesus’ story has long been identified with the Khan Hathrur, halfway between Jerusalem and Jericho, though the present structure is probably only one of many built in the same place.</p>
<p>Two other well-known passages in the NT allude, not to a real inn, but to other social customs and arrangements. First, Christians from the church at Rome met the prisoner Paul at Three Taverns, a stopping place 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Rome at the intersection of the Appian Way with the road from Antium (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.15">Acts 28:15</a>). Second, there is the “inn” from which Joseph and Mary were excluded (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.7">Lk 2:7</a>). The word is elsewhere translated “guestchamber” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) and “guest room” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.14">Mk 14:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.11">Lk 22:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The Jews of Jerusalem took pride in having enough such guest rooms to accommodate the huge influx of pilgrims keeping Passover in the city (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.6-11">Acts 2:6-11</a> on the crowd at Pentecost); evidently Joseph and Mary expected such accommodation in Bethlehem for the census, but found their place already taken.</p>
