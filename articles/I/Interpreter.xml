<p class="h1">INTERPRETER</p>
<p class="fl">One who facilitates communication between people who speak different languages, or one who explains the meaning of dreams. Joseph pretended to need an interpreter to speak to his brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.23">Gn 42:23</a>). Also, dreams needed to be interpreted (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.8">Gn 40:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.15-16">41:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">Dn 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.6-9,18-24">4:6-9, 18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.7-8,12-17">5:7-8, 12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.16">7:16</a>). The interpreter was sometimes one who acted as an intermediary (<a href="?bref=Job.33.23">Jb 33:23</a>). Ezra and Nehemiah functioned as interpreters or translators of the law of Moses when it was read to the Jews who had returned from exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.8-9">Neh 8:8-9</a>) and who must not have known Hebrew. In NT times the interpreter explained the utterances of those who spoke in tongues (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.28">1Â Cor 14:28</a>), translated foreign languages (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.6">Acts 2:6</a>), or expounded the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.27">Lk 24:27</a>).</p>
