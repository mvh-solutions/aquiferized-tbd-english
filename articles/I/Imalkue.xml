<p class="fl">An Arab chieftain who was in charge of Antiochus, the son of Alexander. Trypho, who had once supported Alexander, sought the aid of Imalkue to have Antiochus crowned king instead of Demetrius. Trypho succeeded and Antiochus became King Antiochus VI. Demetrius’s troops supported the new king and routed Demetrius (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.39-55">1 Macc 11:39-55</a>).</p>
