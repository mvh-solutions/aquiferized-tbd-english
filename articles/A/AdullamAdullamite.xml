<p class="h1">ADULLAM, ADULLAMITE</p>
<p class="fl">Old Canaanite city between Lachish and Hebron, as well as a cave region nearby. The first biblical mention of the city is in the word “Adullamite” (someone from Adullam), used of Hirah, a friend of Judah. After acting as a ringleader in selling his brother Joseph into slavery, Judah left home and lived in Adullam with Hirah (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.1,12,20">Gn 38:1, 12, 20</a>).</p>
<p>Adullam was in the lowlands of Judah’s tribal territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.35">Jos 15:35</a>). It was one of 31 Canaanite royal cities conquered by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.15">Jos 12:15</a>) and one of 15 cities later fortified by King Rehoboam of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.7">2 Chr 11:7</a>). After the exiles’ return from captivity in Babylon, Adullam was again resettled by Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.30">Neh 11:30</a>).</p>
<p>A cave near Adullam figured in several events in David’s life. It was a refuge when he fled from King Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.1">1 Sm 22:1</a>) and a stronghold in his war against the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.13-17">2 Sm 23:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.15-19">1 Chr 11:15-19</a>). The Hebrew superscriptions to <a href="?bref=Ps.57.1-11">Psalms 57</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.142.1-7">142</a> indicate that David wrote them at the time of his experiences in the cave. Adullam is identified as modern Tell esh-Sheikh Madhkur.</p>
