<p class="h1">ASHTEROTH-KARNAIM</p>
<p class="fl">City where a coalition of four kings led by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, defeated the tribe of Rephaim giants (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">Dt 3:11</a>). The area was part of the inheritance given to Abraham andÂ his descendants by the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.18-20">Gn 15:18-20</a>). It is probably identifiable with Ashtaroth. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=AshtarothAshterathite_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Ashtaroth, Ashterathite</a>.</p>
