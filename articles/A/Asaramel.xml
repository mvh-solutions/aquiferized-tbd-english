<p class="h1">ASARAMEL</p>
<p class="fl">Enigmatic Hebrew word found in the dedicatory inscription honoring Simon, ruling high priest of Israel and brother of Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.28">1 Macc 14:28</a>). Plausible translations of the term are “prince of the people of God” or “court of the people of God.” The Syriac version of the Apocrypha drops the “m” to give “Israel”—making the sentence read “in the third year of Simon the great high priest in Israel.”</p>
