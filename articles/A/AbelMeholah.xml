<p class="h1">ABEL-MEHOLAH</p>
<p class="fl">Birthplace of the prophet Elisha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16">1 Kgs 19:16</a>). Here Elijah found Elisha plowing and threw his coat over Elisha’s shoulders, symbolizing God’s call to Elisha to become a prophet (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.19-21">1 Kgs 19:19-21</a>). The town is earlier mentioned as one place to which the Midianites fled from Gideon’s 300 warriors (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.22">Jgs 7:22</a>). It is also mentioned in a list of administrative districts set up by King Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). The most likely modern identification is Khirbet Tell el-Hilu.</p>
