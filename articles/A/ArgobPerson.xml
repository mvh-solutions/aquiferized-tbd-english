<p class="h1">ARGOB (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Individual supposedly killed with King Pekahiah of Israel in Pekah’s revolt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.25">2 Kgs 15:25</a>). The early church father Jerome thought the name Argob (along with Arieh) referred to a place. Today some scholars think that Argob and Arieh may have been accidentally misplaced from a list of place names (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>) through scribal error.</p>
