<p class="h1">ACHIOR</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Judith introduces Achior as “leader of all the Ammonites” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.5.5">5:5</a>). The main part of <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.5.1-24">Judith 5</a> is devoted to Achior’s version of the history of Israel and culminates in his warning Holofernes that God would protect Israel. At this the hearers threatened to tear him limb from limb. Holofernes then handed Achior over to the Israelites and Uzziah provided his hospitality (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.6.1-21">Jdt 6:1ff</a>.). After Holofernes’ demise, Achior was brought to view the Assyrian general’s severed head. Seeing this he threw himself at the feet of Judith, proclaimed her praise, recognized the mighty works of God, accepted circumcision, and was incorporated in the house of Israel forever (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.14.6-10">Jdt 14:6-10</a>).</p>
