<p class="h1">AMASA</p>
<p class="list">1. Son of Ithra (Jether) and David’s sister Abigail (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.25">2 Sm 17:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.17">1 Chr 2:17</a>), and therefore David’s nephew. Amasa was a captain who supported Absalom in his rebellion against his father, David. After Absalom was killed by David’s general Joab, David pardoned Amasa and replaced Joab with him (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.13">2 Sm 19:13</a>). Greatly offended, Joab awaited his revenge and, as soon as he had opportunity, treacherously assassinated his unsuspecting rival (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.4-13">2 Sm 20:4-13</a>). David was unable to punish Joab but instructed his son Solomon to see that Joab was executed for murdering Amasa and another of David’s generals (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.5-6,28-34">1 Kgs 2:5-6, 28-34</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Hadlai’s son from Ephraim’s tribe. Amasa supported the prophet Oded’s opposition to making slaves of women and children captured from the southern kingdom of Judah in the time of King Ahaz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.8-13">2 Chr 28:8-13</a>).</p>
