<p class="h1">ATTALUS</p>
<p class="fl">Name or title of several kings of Pergamum. The one who received a “letter of recommendation” for the Jews from the Roman consul Lucius (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.22">1 Macc 15:22</a>) was probably Attalus II Philadelphus (reigned 159–138 <span class="era">BC</span>). This Attalus was succeeded by his nephew Philometor Evergetes (reigned 138–133 <span class="era">BC</span>), who bequeathed his kingdom to Rome, ending the history of Pergamum as an independent political entity. Rome, then, organized the kingdom into the province of Asia.</p>
