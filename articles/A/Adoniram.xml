<p class="h1">ADONIRAM</p>
<p class="fl">Important official in Israel during the reigns of David, Solomon, and Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.6">1 Kgs 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.14">5:14</a>). Adoniram is also referred to as Adoram, possibly a contraction of his name (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.24">2 Sm 20:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.18">1 Kgs 12:18</a>), and as Hadoram (<a href="?bref=2Chr.10.18">2 Chr 10:18</a>). While Solomon’s temple was under construction, Adoniram was overseer of a labor force of 30,000 men (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.13-14">1 Kgs 5:13-14</a>). Evidently David had instituted a system of forced Israelite labor that Solomon continued, not only for building the temple, but for many other projects.</p>
<p>When Rehoboam became king the people asked for relief, but Rehoboam announced that instead, he would increase the labor requirements (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-15">1 Kgs 12:1-15</a>). When Adoniram was sent to enforce the king’s orders, he was stoned to death by the rebellious people (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.16-19">12:16-19</a>).</p>
