<p class="h1">AHIMAAZ</p>
<p class="list">1. Father of Ahinoam, who was King Saul’s wife (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.50">1 Sm 14:50</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of the high priest Zadok and father of Azariah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.8-9,53">1 Chr 6:8-9, 53</a>). Ahimaaz remained loyal to King David at the time of Absalom’s rebellion. He and Jonathan, son of the priest Abiathar, served as couriers. News of Absalom’s movements was sent from Zadok and Abiathar in Jerusalem to Ahimaaz and Jonathan in En-rogel and then communicated by them to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.27-29">2 Sm 15:27-29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.15-23">17:15-23</a>). Ahimaaz was probably well known as a fast runner. He outran the official messenger bearing news to David of Absalom’s defeat (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.19-33">2 Sm 18:19-33</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. One of 12 officers appointed to requisition food for Solomon’s household. This Ahimaaz, of Naphtali’s tribe, married Basemath, one of Solomon’s daughters (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.15">1 Kgs 4:15</a>).</p>
