According to the Greek historian, Polybius, this governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia under Seleucus IV retired to Miletus when Antiochus IV began to rule. Apollonius’s diplomatic expertise, however, was later utilized when he served as ambassador to Egypt (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.21">2 Macc 4:21</a>). His son, another Apollonius (#4 below), served as governor under Demetrius II.</p>

Apollonius, cruel captain of the Mysians sent by Antiochus IV to slaughter all adult Jewish males (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.29">1 Macc 1:29</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.24">2 Macc 5:24</a>). He met his death at the hands of Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.10-12">1 Macc 3:10-12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Apollonius, Gennaeus’s son, petty governor who along with other local leaders continued to harass the Jews (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.12.2">2 Macc 12:2</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Apollonius, grandson of Menestheus. In 147 <span class="era">BC</span> he began to serve as governor of Coelesyria, an office his father had held.
