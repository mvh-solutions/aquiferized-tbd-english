<p class="h1">ALCIMUS</p>
<p class="fl">Treacherous high priest of the intertestamental period of Jewish history. A descendant of Aaron but not of the legitimate high-priestly family, Alcimus was declared high priest by the Syrian king Demetrius I, about 163 <span class="era">BC</span>. However, since he was a Hellenist, the Maccabeans who controlled Jerusalem were violently opposed to him. Alcimus thus persuaded Demetrius to send General Bacchides to subdue Judah. Bacchides did so and “placed Alcimus in charge of the country, but Judas Maccabeus and his brothers waged guerrilla warfare against the traitors” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.1-24">1 Macc 7:1-24</a>). When Alcimus again sought help, Demetrius sent an army under Nicanor that was wiped out by the Maccabeans (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.25-50">1 Macc 7:25-50</a>). Demetrius sent Bacchides back with an even stronger force. This time Judas Maccabeus was killed and Alcimus had free reign in Jerusalem (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.1-53">1 Macc 9:1-53</a>). He “gave orders to tear down the wall of the inner court of the sanctuary,” but before this sacrilege could be completed, he was stricken with paralysis; “Alcimus died at that time in great agony” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.54-57">1 Macc 9:54-57</a>), about 161 BC.</p>
