<p class="h1">ATHARIM</p>
<p class="fl">Place, according to the <span class="sc">nlt</span>, where the Israelites sought to enter Canaan when attacked by the king of Arad (<a href="?bref=Num.21.1">Nm 21:1</a>). The name means “tracks” and is generally thought to be located near Tamar or Hazazon-tamar several miles south of the Dead Sea. One possible reading of the text makes it identical with Tamar. The <span class="sc">kjv</span>, following the Targum and Vulgate, translates it “spies.”</p>
