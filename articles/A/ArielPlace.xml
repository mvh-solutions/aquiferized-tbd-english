<p class="h1">ARIEL (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Poetic designation for Jerusalem, used by the prophet Isaiah in a “woe” oracle warning people to turn from their wrongdoing (<a href="?bref=Isa.29.1-2,7">Is 29:1-2, 7</a>). Jerusalem, location of the altar of burnt offering, was called Ariel (“hearth of God”) by synecdoche, a poetic device in which a whole thing is referred to by naming one part. In a dramatic play on words Isaiah pronounced God’s judgment: Jerusalem, city of the hearth of God, would become an ariel, a pagan altar hearth, when destroyed by her enemies.</p>
