<p class="h1">ATAD</p>
<p class="fl">Site, probably in Canaan, where Jacob’s funeral cortege stopped on the way to Hebron. There, at the threshing floor, the household of Joseph and many Egyptians from the pharaoh’s house spent seven days mourning the death of the patriarch (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.10-11">Gn 50:10-11</a>). Impressed with their mourning the Canaanites called the place “Abel-mizraim.” The first word is a pun, involving the words “meadow” and “mourning,” and the second is the Hebrew word for Egypt.</p>
