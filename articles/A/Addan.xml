<p class="h1">ADDAN</p>
<p class="fl">Persian city from which Israelite exiles returned with Ezra to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.59">Ezr 2:59</a>), probably named after a Babylonian god called Addu. The exiles returning from this city were unable to give evidence of their Jewish descent, having lost their genealogical credentials. Also spelled Addon (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.61">Neh 7:61</a>).</p>
