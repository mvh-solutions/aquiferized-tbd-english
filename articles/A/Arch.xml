<p class="h1">ARCH*</p>
<p class="fl">Curved structure, usually of masonry, supporting the weight over a doorway or other open space. The capstone or keystone is the most important part of an arch and the last stone put in place. It ties the two curving sides together and distributes the weight evenly through them to the foundation.</p>
<p>Arches were not used in the architecture of ancient Israel and appear in the Bible only through mistranslation. The Hebrew word translated “arches” throughout Ezekiel’s vision of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-49">Ez 40</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) refers to porches rather than arches.</p>
