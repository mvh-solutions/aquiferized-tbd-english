<p class="h1">ABIHAIL</p>
<p class="fl">Name used for both men and women in the OT.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Zuriel’s father and a leader of the Merari family of Levites in Israel’s wilderness community (<a href="?bref=Num.3.35">Nm 3:35</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Abishur’s wife, and mother of Ahban and Molid (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.29">1 Chr 2:29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Huri’s son, a descendant of Gad, living in Gilead and Bashan (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.14">1 Chr 5:14</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Woman named in <a href="?bref=2Chr.11.18">2 Chronicles 11:18</a> whose relationship to King Rehoboam is not clear from the Hebrew text. In some translations, Abihail seems to be the second wife of Rehoboam. However, only one wife is mentioned at first, so Abihail was probably the mother of Rehoboam’s first wife, Mahalath. This Abihail was thus a daughter of Eliab, David’s eldest brother. She married her cousin Jerimoth, one of David’s sons.</p>
<p class="list">5. Esther’s father, and uncle of Mordecai (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.15">Est 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.9.29">9:29</a>).</p>
