<p class="h1">ABISHAI</p>
<p class="fl">David’s nephew, son of Zeruiah (by an unnamed father) and brother of Joab and Asahel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.16">1 Chr 2:16</a>). Abishai volunteered to accompany David to Saul’s camp one night and would have killed the sleeping Saul if David had not restrained him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.6-12">1 Sm 26:6-12</a>). He also helped Joab kill Abner, Saul’s general, in revenge for the death of another brother (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.30">2 Sm 3:30</a>). Later Abishai won a victory over the Edomites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.18.12-13">1 Chr 18:12-13</a>) and was second in command in a decisive battle against the Ammonites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.19.10-15">1 Chr 19:10-15</a>). Often vengeful and cruel, Abishai wanted to behead the spiteful Shimei during Absalom’s rebellion, but again David intervened (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.5-12">2 Sm 16:5-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.21-23">19:21-23</a>). When King David fled beyond the Jordan, Abishai was given command of one of David’s three divisions that crushed the rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-15">2 Sm 18:1-15</a>).</p>
<p>In a later battle with the Philistines, Abishai saved David’s life by killing the giant Ishbi-benob (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.15-17">2 Sm 21:15-17</a>). He ranked among David’s bravest warriors (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.18-19">2 Sm 23:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.20-21">1 Chr 11:20-21</a>).</p>
