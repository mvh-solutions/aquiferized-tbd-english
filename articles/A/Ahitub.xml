<p class="h1">AHITUB</p>
<p class="list">1. Member of the priestly line of Aaron’s youngest son, Ithamar. Ahitub was a descendant of Eli through Eli’s son Phinehas and father of Ahijah and Ahimelech, who were priests during Saul’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.3">1 Sm 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.9-12,20">22:9-12, 20</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Member of the priestly line of Aaron’s third son, Eleazar. Ahitub was Meraioth’s grandson, Amariah’s son, and father of Zadok (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.4-7">1 Chr 6:4-7</a>). Zadok was a chief priest during David’s reign (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sm 8:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Possibly the same as #2 above (the scribes sometimes mistakenly copied names twice), but more likely another member of the priestly line of Eleazar, seven generations after #2 (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.11-12">1 Chr 6:11-12</a>). This Ahitub’s father was also named Amariah and his son or grandson Zadok (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.11">1 Chr 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.11">Neh 11:11</a>), but his grandfather was Azariah. Ahitub is listed as an ancestor of Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.2">Ezr 7:2</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.8.2">1 Esd 8:2</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.1">2 Esd 1:1</a>).</p>
