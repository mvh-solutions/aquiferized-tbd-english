<p class="h1">ARISTARCHUS</p>
<p class="fl">Companion of the apostle Paul; Macedonian from Thessalonica, possibly of Jewish ancestry. He is first mentioned as one of those seized by an angry mob in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.29">Acts 19:29</a>). Later he accompanied Paul on the return from his third missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>) as well as to Rome to face Caesar (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-2">Acts 27:1-2</a>). Paul described him as a coworker (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>) and fellow prisoner from whom he received great comfort (<a href="?bref=Col.4.10-11">Col 4:10-11</a>). Tradition says that Aristarchus was martyred in Rome under Nero.</p>
