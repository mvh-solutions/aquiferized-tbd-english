<p class="h1">AMORITES, HILL COUNTRY (MOUNT*) OF THE</p>
<p class="fl">Central mountainous region between the plains of Philistia, Sharon, and Phoenicia on the west and the valley of the Jordan on the east. While the <span class="sc">kjv</span> uses “mount,” most modern translations use “hill country” because the phrase does not denote a single mountain but the range running north and south through Judah and Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.7,19-20">Dt 1:7, 19-20</a>).</p>
