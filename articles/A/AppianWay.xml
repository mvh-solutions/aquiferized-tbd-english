<p class="h1">APPIAN WAY</p>
<p class="fl">Main highway from Rome southward to the heel of the Italian peninsula. Originally the Appian Way terminated at Capua, but later it was extended to Brundisium, about 350 miles (560 kilometers) from Rome. It received its name from Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began its construction in 312 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Appian Way is referred to by the ancient writers Livy, Strabo, Horace, and others in a variety of contexts. Portions of the road still exist today south of Rome, with the original Roman paving intact in many places. Ruins of some structures built along the original road are also in evidence.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul traveled on the Appian Way on his journey to Rome after disembarking from a ship at Puteoli (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.13-15">Acts 28:13-15</a>). Christians from Rome came out to meet him in the vicinity of Three Taverns and the Appii Forum (“marketplace of Appius”). These were two of eight major stations known to have existed along the Appian Way. The Appii Forum was located 43 miles (70 kilometers) from Rome in the middle of the Pontine Marshes. Horace, writing in 65–68 <span class="era">BC</span>, complained of the noise and stench that assaulted those who stayed there. Three Taverns was located 10 miles (16 kilometers) closer to Rome.</p>
<p>As Paul traveled on, he would have passed Bovillae, a village located about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Rome. This village was the ancestral home and cult center of the family of Caesar Augustus. Much of the Appian Way from Bovillae to Rome was lined with tombs. Roman law forbade burials within the city of Rome, so it became common practice to bury the dead beside the major roads leading into the city.</p>
