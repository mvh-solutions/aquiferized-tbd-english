<p class="h1">AKRABATTENE</p>
<p class="fl">Place where Judas Maccabeus destroyed the strongholds of the “sons of Esau,” from which they were harassing the Jews (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.3">1 Macc 5:3</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.14-23">2 Macc 10:14-23</a>). “In Idumea, at Akrabattene” probably refers to a northern Edomite enclave at or near Acraba (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.7.18">Jdt 7:18</a>) rather than to an area in the Negev Desert as was formerly thought.</p>
