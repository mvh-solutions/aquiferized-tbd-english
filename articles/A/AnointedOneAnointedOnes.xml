<p class="fl">In the NT, Jesus Christ is portrayed as fulfilling the three offices of prophet, priest, and king. He is, supremely, God’s Anointed One. “Messiah” is the term for “anointed one” derived directly from the Hebrew word for anointed; “Christ” is the same title derived from the Greek word for “anointee.” The true anointing of Messiah (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.2">Ps 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.25-26">Dn 9:25-26</a>) is spiritual; that is, it is done by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Is 61:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1,18-19">Lk 4:1, 18-19</a>). That Jesus of Nazareth was indeed the Anointed One (Messiah) of OT prophecy was evidenced in his anointing by the Holy Spirit and by the miracles that followed (<a href="?bref=John.1.32-51">Jn 1:32-51</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.33-37">Lk 4:33-37</a>). By extension, Christians also are said to be anointed by the Holy Spirit, enabling them to understand their faith and to live godly lives (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.21-22">2 Cor 1:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.20,27">1 Jn 2:20, 27</a>).</p>
