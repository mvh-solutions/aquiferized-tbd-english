<p class="fl">Called Antiochus Sidetes (c. 159–129 <span class="era">BC</span>), was king of Syria from 139/138 to 129 <span class="era">BC</span>, son of Demetrius I and brother of Demetrius II. After the capture of Demetrius II, he became the third husband of his brother’s queen Cleopatra Thea and drove the usurper Trypho from the throne (139 <span class="era">BC</span>). Antiochus VII was at war with the Jews from 138 to 134, destroyed part of Jerusalem, and caused John Hyrcanus to submit to his rule. He died while fighting in the Parthian War.</p>
