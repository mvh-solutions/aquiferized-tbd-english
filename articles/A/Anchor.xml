<p class="h1">ANCHOR</p>
<p class="fl">Object used to keep a ship or boat stationary in the water. An anchor is attached to a ship by a cable or chain, and when thrown overboard, its weight and/or ability to dig into the sea bottom keeps the vessel from drifting. Anchors were used many centuries before the time of Christ, beginning as simple stone weights and evolving into wooden hooks weighted with lead or stone. Not long after the time of Christ, iron anchors of the familiar modern shape were used. Anchors are mentioned in Luke’s account of the apostle Paul’s voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.13,29-30,40">Acts 27:13, 29-30, 40</a>). <a href="?bref=Heb.6.19">Hebrews 6:19</a> uses “anchor” in a figurative sense to indicate the stability of God’s promise of salvation to those who believe in him.</p>
