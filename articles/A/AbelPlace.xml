<p class="fl">Fortified border city in upper Galilee to which King David’s general Joab pursued the rebel Sheba. After a wise woman of the city negotiated with Joab, the citizens executed Sheba and threw his head over the wall. Joab then called off the siege (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.13-22">2 Sm 20:13-22</a>). The city was later conquered by the Syrian Ben-hadad during a continuing war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel. When Asa persuaded Ben-hadad to break a treaty with Baasha, Ben-hadad took a large amount of territory, including Abel, or Abel-beth-maacah, as it was also called (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.16-20">1 Kgs 15:16-20</a>). Still later, Abel-beth-maacah (sometimes called simply Abel of Beth-maacah, or Abel of Beth-maachah) was conquered by Tiglath-pileser III, and its inhabitants were taken captive to Assyria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>). The same city is called Abel-maim (“meadow of water”), emphasizing the productivity of the region (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.4">2 Chr 16:4</a>). The town has been identified with modern Tell Abil-el-Qamh.</p>
