<p class="h1">ABADDON</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word that means “place of destruction.” The word occurs six times in the OT, generally referring to the place of the dead (<a href="?bref=Job.26.6">Jb 26:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.28.22">28:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.31.12">31:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.11">Ps 88:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.11">Prv 15:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.20">27:20</a>). It serves as a synonym for Sheol and is variously translated “hell,” “death,” “the grave,” or “destruction.” The same Hebrew word occurs once in the NT in its Greek equivalent, Apollyon (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">Rv 9:11</a>). Here the idea of destruction is personified as the “angel from the bottomless pit,” so the word is often translated “destroyer.” Abaddon (or Apollyon) was the angel reigning over the realm of the dead, who appeared after the fifth trumpet in John’s vision (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1">Rv 9:1</a>).</p>
