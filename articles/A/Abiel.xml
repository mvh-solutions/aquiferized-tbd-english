<p class="h1">ABIEL</p>
<p class="list">1. Father of Kish and Ner and grandfather of King Saul, according to <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1">1 Samuel 9:1</a> and <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.51">14:51</a>. Other genealogies in 1 Chronicles list Ner, instead of Abiel, as Kish’s father and Saul’s grandfather (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.33">1 Chr 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.39">9:39</a>). This confusion is due either to a copyist’s error or to the possibility that Saul had two relatives named Ner, a great-grandfather and an uncle.</p>
<p class="list">2. Warrior among David’s mighty men who were known as “the thirty” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.32">1 Chr 11:32</a>), also called Abi-albon the Arbathite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.31">2 Sm 23:31</a>).</p>
