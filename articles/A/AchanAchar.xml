<p class="h1">ACHAN, ACHAR*</p>
<p class="fl">Member of Judah’s tribe who kept some of the spoils from the Israelite victory at Jericho in violation of Joshua’s order and God’s command (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-7.1">Jos 6:1–7:1</a>). A subsequent Israelite defeat at Ai, a weaker city than Jericho, revealed God’s anger to Joshua. With God’s help, Joshua determined which of the Israelites had been guilty of disobedience. Achan confessed that he had buried a robe and some gold and silver from Jericho in his tent (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.20-22">Jos 7:20-22</a>). The recovered loot was taken to the valley of Achor (meaning “trouble,” “calamity”), where Achan and his family were stoned. In the Hebrew text, <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.7">1 Chronicles 2:7</a> gives Achan’s name as Achar (“disaster”) because he “brought disaster on Israel by taking plunder that had been set apart for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
