<p class="h1">ASHPENAZ</p>
<p class="fl">Official under Nebuchadnezzar in charge of palace personnel (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.3">Dn 1:3</a>). Ashpenaz was reluctant to grant the captives from Judah, Daniel and his friends, a reprieve from eating the kingâ€™s food, but eventually he did so (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.8-16">Dn 1:8-16</a>). (Eating food from the table of Gentiles would have forced Daniel and his friends to violate the law of God.) Three years later, Ashpenaz presented the young men before the king. Nebuchadnezzar found them outstanding in wisdom and good judgment in spite of their vegetarian diet and abstemious lifestyle (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.18-20">Dn 1:18-20</a>).</p>
