<p class="h1">ARPHAXAD</p>
<p class="fl">Shem’s son and Noah’s grandson, born two years after the Flood. Arphaxad’s descendants were probably the Chaldeans (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.22-24">Gn 10:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.11.10-13">11:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.17-18,24">1 Chr 1:17-18, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.36">Lk 3:36</a>). Arphaxad was born two years after the Flood when his father was one hundred years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.10">Gn 11:10</a>) and was the grandfather of Eber, whom some believe was ancestor of the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=1Chr.1.17-25">1 Chr 1:17-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.35-36">Lk 3:35-36</a>).</p>
