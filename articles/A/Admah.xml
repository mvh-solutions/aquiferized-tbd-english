<p class="fl">City associated with Sodom, Gomorrah, and Zeboiim (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.19">Gn 10:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.14.2,8">14:2, 8</a>) and thus probably destroyed in God’s judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.23">Dt 29:23</a>; not specifically mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gen.19.28-29">Gn 19:28-29</a>). A recent survey of the area east and south of the Dead Sea has revealed five early Bronze Age cities that probably correspond to the five “cities of the plain” spoken of in Genesis. Each city was located next to the valley of a river that flowed into the plain around the Dead Sea.</p>
