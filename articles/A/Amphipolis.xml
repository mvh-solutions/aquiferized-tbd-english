<p class="h1">AMPHIPOLIS</p>
<p class="fl">City in ancient Greece, once the home of the Thracian Edoni tribe. Amphipolis occupied a strategic location in a fertile area on the eastern bank of the Strymon River. Its name (“around city”) may refer to its being surrounded on three sides by the river. Located about 30 miles (48.2 kilometers) from Philippi, it eventually became an important station on the Roman Via Egnatia. On his second missionary journey Paul passed through this commercial center en route to Thessalonica (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.1">Acts 17:1</a>).</p>
