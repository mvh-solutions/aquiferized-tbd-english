<p class="h1">ANATHOTH (PLACE), ANATHOTHITE*</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Benjamin’s territory set aside for the Levites (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.18">Jos 21:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.60">1 Chr 6:60</a>). Anathoth may have been named by the Canaanites for their goddess Anath, or later by the Israelites for one of Benjamin’s descendants (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.8">1 Chr 7:8</a>). The town was probably located at Ras el-Karrubeh near the modern town of Anata three miles (4.8 kilometers) north of Jerusalem. Its residents were sometimes called Anethothites or Anetothites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.27">2 Sm 23:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.12">1 Chr 27:12</a>). Abiezer, one of David’s military leaders, was from Anathoth (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.28">1 Chr 11:28</a>, KJV “Antothite”) as was the soldier Jehu (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.3">1 Chr 12:3</a>) and the priest Abiathar (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26">1 Kgs 2:26</a>). It was also the hometown of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.1">Jer 1:1</a>), though some of its inhabitants violently opposed him (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.21,23">Jer 11:21, 23</a>). Just before Judah fell to Babylon, Jeremiah bought a field in Anathoth as a sign that Israel would be restored to her land (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.7-9">Jer 32:7-9</a>). Years later, 128 men of Anathoth returned from the exile, and the town was resettled (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.32">Neh 11:32</a>).</p>
