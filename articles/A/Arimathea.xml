<p class="h1">ARIMATHEA</p>
<p class="fl">Hometown of the Joseph who obtained Jesus’ crucified body and buried it in his own tomb (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.57">Mt 27:57</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.43">Mk 15:43</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.38">Jn 19:38</a>). The town’s location is unknown, though it may be identical to the hill town of Ramathaim-zophim, the prophet Samuel’s home (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1 Sm 1:1</a>), about 8 miles (12.9 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem. Luke described the place as a Jewish town, and Joseph was himself a Jewish official (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.50">Lk 23:50</a>).</p>
