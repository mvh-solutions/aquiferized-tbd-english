<p class="h1">ASSHUR</p>
<p class="fl"> Uncertain translation of a Hebrew word, appearing in English translations of the Bible as Assyria, Assyrian, Assyrians, or merely “Asshur.” These variants come from the Assyrian word <span class="ital">asshur.</span></p>
<p class="list-space">1. KJV translation of the word for Assyria in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.11">Genesis 10:11</a>. It is improperly translated as a person and should be understood as in the <span class="sc">nlt</span>: “He [Nimrod] extended his reign to Assyria.” In that country, east of the Tigris River, Nimrod built four cities: Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, and Resen.</p>
<p class="list">2. Shem’s son (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.22">Gn 10:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.17">1 Chr 1:17</a>). The reference may be merely a personification of the whole Assyrian people; however, since other names in the account (e.g., Arpachshad, <a href="?bref=Gen.10.24">Gn 10:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.11.12">11:12</a>) seem to indicate individual persons, perhaps Asshur should be taken in the same way. If so, this individual may have been the founder of the city Asshur to which he gave his name, the names of a god and nation being further derived from the city. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=AsshurPlace_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Asshur (Place)</a>.</p>
<p class="list">3. Patron god of the city of Asshur.</p>
