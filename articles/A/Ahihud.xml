<p class="list">2. According to some English versions (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), a leader in Benjamin’s tribe whose father, Gera (also called Heglam), was exiled to Manahath (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.7">1 Chr 8:7</a>). But according to the Hebrew Masoretic Text, this Ahihud’s father was Ehud (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.6">1 Chr 8:6</a>), while Gera was the one who exiled Ahihud and his mother to Manahath.</p>
