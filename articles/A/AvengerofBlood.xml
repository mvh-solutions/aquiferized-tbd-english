<p class="h1">AVENGER OF BLOOD</p>
<p class="fl">Person who performed the duty of pursuing and ultimately executing the murderer of a close relative (<a href="?bref=Num.35.1-34">Nm 35</a>). Such a “redeemer” was expected to act in instances of deliberate murder but not of accidental manslaughter. A person guilty of manslaughter could find asylum in any one of six designated cities throughout the land (<a href="?bref=Num.35.11">35:11</a>) so that regular judicial processes could be set in motion. The avenger of blood can be seen in the accounts of Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.18-21">Jgs 8:18-21</a>), Joab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.27,30">2 Sm 3:27, 30</a>), the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-22">2 Sm 21</a>), and Amaziah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.5-6">2 Kgs 14:5-6</a>). During the monarchy the king could evidently thwart the avenger (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.8-11">2 Sm 14:8-11</a>).</p>
<p>The custom was rooted in the ordinance of God that required a life for a life in any case of intentional homicide (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.6">Gn 9:6</a>). Unfortunately, the intent of the law—to impress upon humanity the sacredness of human life—has sometimes been greatly distorted, leading to blood feuds and the annihilation of whole families in some societies.</p>
