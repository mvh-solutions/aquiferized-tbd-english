<p class="h1">ARBELA</p>
<p class="fl">Site of a great slaughter when General Bacchides invaded Judea from Syria (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.1-2">1Â Macc 9:1-2</a>). The site has not been positively identified, although the historian Josephus called it a city of Galilee and noted that the caves of Arbela in lower Galilee were fortified against marauding robbers. Possible identifications include Beth-arbel in Gilead and the Galilean Khirbet Irbid overlooking the wadi el-Hamam, west of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
