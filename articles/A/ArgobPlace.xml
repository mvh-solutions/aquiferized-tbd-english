<p class="fl">Region in Bashan won by the Israelites when they defeated King Og at Edrei (<a href="?bref=Num.21.33-35">Nm 21:33-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.4">Dt 3:4</a>). Argob was located east of the Sea of Chinnereth (later called Sea of Galilee), beyond the regions of Geshur and Maacah (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Dt 3:14</a>). Moses assigned all of Bashan, including Argob, to half of Manasseh’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.13-14">Dt 3:13-14</a>). Jair, of that tribe, subdued the villages of Argob and named them Havvoth-jair (“the villages of Jair”). <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">First Kings 4:13</a> distinguishes between Argob and the villages of Jair, that are said to be in Gilead, south of Argob. <a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> may represent a textual difficulty, or perhaps the location of the villages of Jair on the border between Argob and Gilead was responsible for the apparent discrepancy. That border could have shifted during the three centuries between the conquests of Jair and the reign of Solomon. By then, the name Havvoth-jair could even have referred to a different set of cities.</p>
