<p class="h1">ACHAICUS</p>
<p class="fl">Early Christian convert in Corinth. Achaicus, Stephanas, and Fortunatus were visiting Paul in Ephesus when he wrote 1 Corinthians (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.17">1 Cor 16:17</a>). It was probably Achaicus and his companions who brought Paul a letter from the Corinthian church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1">1 Cor 7:1</a>) and returned with Paul’s reply.</p>
