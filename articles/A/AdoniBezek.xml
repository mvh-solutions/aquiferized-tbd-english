<p class="h1">ADONI-BEZEK</p>
<p class="fl">Title of the Canaanite king of Bezek, a city in northern Palestine. Soon after Joshuaâ€™s death, the tribes of Judah and Simeon defeated Adoni-bezek and amputated his thumbs and big toes. Adoni-bezek himself had treated many captured kings that way, so he regarded his fate as divine retribution (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.5-7">Jgs 1:5-7</a>). Some have suggested that he and Adoni-zedek (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1">Jos 10:1</a>) were the same person.</p>
