<p class="h1">ANTIOCH OF PISIDIA</p>
<p class="fl">City in Asia Minor between the districts of Phrygia and Pisidia to which the apostle Paul traveled to introduce the gospel. Paul was invited by the elders of the synagogue in Antioch to deliver any message of exhortation he might have at their Sabbath meeting (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.14-15">Acts 13:14-15</a>). According to the record in Acts, many begged to hear more (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.42">13:42</a>), but certain Jewish leaders envied Paulâ€™s popularity and began to revile him (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.45">13:45</a>). Paul then turned to gentile listeners (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.46-48">13:46-48</a>) until Jewish persecutors forced him to leave the city (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.50">13:50</a>). The same Jews from Antioch continued harassing Paul as he traveled to Lystra (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.19">Acts 14:19</a>). Paul passed through Antioch a second time while en route to Perga and Attalia (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.21">14:21</a>).</p>
<p>The city of Antioch was founded around 300 <span class="era">BC</span> by Seleucus Nicator and was named for his son, Antiochus I. As a result of the Roman conquest in 188 <span class="era">BC</span>, the area was declared free from the rule of the Seleucid kings, and deliberate steps toward Romanization followed. In about 36 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antony made Antioch part of the domain of the Galatian king, Amyntas. Upon the death of Amyntas 11 years later, the city was elevated to colony status and became Caesarea Antiochela, capital of southern Galatia.</p>
