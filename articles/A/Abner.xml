<p class="h1">ABNER</p>
<p class="fl">Ner’s son and Saul’s cousin. Abner was commander of Saul’s army (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.50">1 Sm 14:50</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.55">17:55</a>). Highly respected by Saul, he even ate at the king’s table together with David and Jonathan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.25">1 Sm 20:25</a>).</p>
<p>Five years after Saul’s death, Abner made Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, king over Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-9">2 Sm 2:8-9</a>). War between Ishbosheth and David, who then was king over Judah, lasted for two years. Abner was in command of Ish-bosheth’s army, Joab of David’s, in a series of skirmishes. David’s position was generally stronger, but Abner became a powerful figure among Saul’s followers.</p>
<p>Although only the king had a right to sexual relationships with the previous king’s concubines, Abner slept with Saul’s concubine Rizpah, perhaps planning to take over the kingdom himself at the first opportunity. When Ishbosheth rebuked him, Abner became so angry that he broke with Ishbosheth and came to terms with David. David showed him great respect, and in return, Abner promised to bring the whole of Israel over to David. Joab, however, feared Abner’s influence with the king and killed him, claiming revenge for the death of his brother at Abner’s hand in battle. Abner was honored with a public funeral and mourning, an honor given only to a ruler or great leader. King David wept aloud at the tomb, and even the people wept with him (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.7-34">2 Sm 3:7-34</a>). David condemned Joab for murdering Abner.</p>
