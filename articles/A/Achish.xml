<p class="h1">ACHISH</p>
<p class="fl">King of the Philistine city of Gath. Although David had killed Goliath, Gath’s champion (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Sm 17</a>), David later fled from Saul to Achish’s court. Realizing his mistake, David pretended to be crazy in order to preserve his life. His feigned madness caused Achish to throw him out (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.10-15">1 Sm 21:10-15</a>), but later when David came back to Gath with a band of 600 guerrilla fighters, Achish gave him the city of Ziklag as a base of operations (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.1-7">1 Sm 27:1-7</a>). Achish thought David’s men were raiding the Israelites, not realizing they were actually wiping out Philistine towns (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.8-12">1 Sm 27:8-12</a>).</p>
