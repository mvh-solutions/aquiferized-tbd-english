<p class="h1">ASSOS</p>
<p class="fl">Seaport of Mysia in the Roman province of Asia (Minor). The apostle Paul and Luke were reunited in Assos after Paulâ€™s journey by land from Troas (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.13-14">Acts 20:13-14</a>). The Roman writer Pliny identified the town as having been founded by the kings of Pergamum and called Apollonia. Assos was located on the top and terraced sides of an inactive volcanic cone 770 feet (234.6 meters) in height. The Greek philosopher Aristotle lived there for several years. It was also the birthplace of Cleanthes, a Stoic poet quoted by Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">Acts 17:28</a>). Today Assos is known as Behram Kevi.</p>
