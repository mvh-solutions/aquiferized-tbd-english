<p class="h1">ADRAMYTTIUM</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient port city in Asia Minor. En route to Rome as a prisoner, Paul embarked on a ship having Adramyttium as its home port (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.2">Acts 27:2</a>). Today Adramyttium is the Turkish city of Edremit. Coins found in the area indicate that Adramyttium may have been a center for the worship of Castor and Pollux (twin sons of the pagan god, Zeus).</p>
