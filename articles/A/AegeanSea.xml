<p class="h1">AEGEAN SEA*</p>
<p class="fl">Extension of the Mediterranean Sea between Greece on the west and north and Turkey on the east. The large island of Crete is its traditional southern limit. On the northeast, the Aegean connects with the Black Sea by way of the Strait of Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara. Approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) wide and 400 miles (640 kilometers) long, the Aegean Sea has hundreds of islands, including Lesbos and Patmos (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rv 1:9</a>). The sea was probably named for Aegeus, in Greek mythology a king of Athens and the father of Theseus.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul spent much time in the Aegean area on his second and third missionary trips. The three major modern cities on the Aegean are Athens (with its port of Pireaus), Salonika (biblical Thessalonica), both in Greece, and Izmir (biblical Smyrna) in Turkey.</p>
