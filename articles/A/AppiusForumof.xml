<p class="fl">Marketplace mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.28.15">Acts 28:15</a> as the place where Christians met the apostle Paul when he came to appear before the caesar. It was apparently named for Appius Claudius, builder of the Appian Way (major artery of western Italy). Around the forum was a region of swamp and marsh, notorious in the ancient world for bad water, mosquitoes, expensive taverns for travelers, nighttime noisy traffic of cargoes and passengers on mule-drawn barges along a canal cut through the area. The Appian Way passes through the Appius Forum about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Rome.</p>
