<p class="list">1. One of the cities in the extreme south assigned to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.24">Jos 15:24</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the cities in the hill country belonging to Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.55">Jos 15:55</a>), mentioned with Maon, Carmel, Jezreel, and most prominently with Hebron (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.42">1 Chr 2:42</a>). Ziph has been identified with a site three miles (4.8 kilometers) south of Hebron. The surrounding wilderness region is probably the “wilderness of Ziph” where David hid from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.14-15">1 Sm 23:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.2">26:2</a>). The Ziphites who betrayed David to Saul were residents of this city and the surrounding region (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.19">1 Sm 23:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1">26:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.54.1">Ps 54 title</a>). Ziph is later mentioned as one of the cities fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.8">2 Chr 11:8</a>).</p>
