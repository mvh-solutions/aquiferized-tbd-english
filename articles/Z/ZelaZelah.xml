<p class="h1">ZELA, ZELAH*</p>
<p class="fl">City of Benjamin’s tribe where the bones of Saul and Jonathan were buried (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.28">Jos 18:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.14">2 Sm 21:14</a>). Zela was probably the native town of Saul’s father, Kish, and may well have been Saul’s home before he was anointed king.</p>
