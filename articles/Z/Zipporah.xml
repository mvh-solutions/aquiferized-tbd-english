<p class="h1">ZIPPORAH</p>
<p class="fl">Wife of Moses and mother of his sons Gershom and Eliezer (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.21">Ex 2:21</a>). Though she is listed as the daughter of Reuel (v <a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">18</a>), Reuel was probably the father of Hobab (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>; also called Jethro, <a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">Ex 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.4.18">4:18</a>), who in turn was the father of Zipporah. Zipporah circumcised Gershom to prevent Mosesâ€™ death prior to his return to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.25">Ex 4:25</a>). Apparently at that point Zipporah and the children left Moses and went back to live with her father, returning later during the wilderness wanderings (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.2">18:2</a>).</p>
