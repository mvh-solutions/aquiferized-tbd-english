<p class="h1">ZARETHAN</p>
<p class="fl">City or region near the Jordan River north of Jericho. It is first mentioned in connection with the “cutting off” of the waters of the Jordan that occurred at Adam, “the city that is beside Zarethan” (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.16">Jos 3:16</a>). Its location is more precisely defined in the list of Solomon’s administrative districts as being in the vicinity of Beth-shan below Jezreel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). Bronze utensils for Solomon’s temple were cast near there (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.46">7:46</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.17">2 Chr 4:17</a>, “Zeredah”).</p>
