<p class="h1">ZANOAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. One of the cities “in the lowland” that was part of Judah’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.34">Jos 15:34</a>). The inhabitants of Zanoah worked with Hanun to rebuild the Valley Gate as well as about 1,500 feet (457.2 meters) of the city wall during the restoration of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.13">Neh 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.30">11:30</a>). The city is probably identifiable with Zanu’a, which is located approximately 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) west of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the cities in the Judean highlands south of Hebron that was part of Judah’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.56">Jos 15:56</a>). It was probably inhabited by the descendants of Zanoah, Jekuthiel’s son.</p>
