<p class="h1">ZIBA</p>
<p class="fl">Former servant of Saul whom David commissioned to find survivors of the house of Saul so that he might “show them kindness” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.2-12">2 Sm 9:2-12</a>). In the period following Saul’s death, Ziba apparently had not only gained his freedom but had also become a successful landowner. This status was lost as a result of the discovery of Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s crippled son. Ziba later became involved in a controversy with Mephibosheth concerning Mephibosheth’s failure to accompany David when he fled during Absalom’s rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1-4">2 Sm 16:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.17,24-29">19:17, 24-29</a>). Most commentators have blamed Ziba with duplicity and slander in the affair, but the text allows no certain conclusion as to who was guilty. On Mephibosheth’s behalf, it is unlikely that he would have believed that he could inherit the throne, as Ziba had claimed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.3">2 Sm 16:3</a>). Mephibosheth also seems to have been loyal to David (though it is possible that David brought him to Jerusalem to ensure that he would be under protective surveillance). In Ziba’s defense, it is notable that David did believe without question that Mephibosheth might have had aspirations for the throne. Ziba also appears consistently as a loyal supporter of David in spite of the fact that David’s decision had cost him his independent status (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1">2 Sm 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.17">19:17</a>). Of course, Ziba’s displeasure at his loss of independence might have motivated him to defame Mephibosheth. In any case, David appears to have had reason to doubt both versions of the truth. Rather than supporting either claim, he chose to divide the land between them (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.29">2 Sm 19:29</a>).</p>
