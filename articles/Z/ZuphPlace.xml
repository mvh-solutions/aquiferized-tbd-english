<p class="fl">Place where Saul looked for his father’s donkeys prior to his meeting with Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.5">1 Sm 9:5</a>). It was near the tomb of Rachel, which is traditionally placed near the northern border of Benjamin. Zuph is apparently linked with Samuel, as one of his ancestors bore the name (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1 Sm 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.35">1 Chr 6:35</a>), and his native town was called Ramathaim-zophim.</p>
