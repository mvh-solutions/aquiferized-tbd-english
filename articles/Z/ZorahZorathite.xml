<p class="h1">ZORAH, ZORATHITE</p>
<p class="fl">A city of the Shephelah and its people, attributed to both the tribe of Dan and of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.33">Jos 15:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.41">19:41</a>). It was part of Judah’s original allocation but was settled by Danites until they established their own territory near Laish (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-11">Jgs 18:1-11</a>). Originally Zorah and nearby Eshtaol seem to have been settled by residents of Kiriath-jearim (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.53">1 Chr 2:53</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.2">4:2</a>). The city was the home of Manoah, the father of Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.2">Jgs 13:2</a>). Samson’s ministry was focused in the region surrounding Zorah and Eshtaol, and he was ultimately buried there. Zorah is traditionally identified with Tell Sur’ah, which is strategically located at the entrance to a large valley leading toward the Mediterranean plain.</p>
