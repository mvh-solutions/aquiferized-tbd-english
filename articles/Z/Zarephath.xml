<p class="h1">ZAREPHATH</p>
<p class="fl">Village where the woman who provided food and lodging for Elijah lived (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.9-10">1 Kgs 17:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.26">Lk 4:26</a>). Obadiah later prophesied that the Israelite exiles of Halah would “possess Phoenicia as far as Zarephath” (<a href="?bref=Obad.1.20">Ob 1:20</a>). Zarephath was under the control of Sidon at the time Elijah visited, thus serving as a safe haven from King Ahab of Israel. Zarephath is likely identifiable with modern Surafend, where a chapel marks the traditional site for the widow’s house.</p>
