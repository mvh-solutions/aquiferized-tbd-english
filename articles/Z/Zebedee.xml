<p class="h1">ZEBEDEE</p>
<p class="fl">Father of the disciples James and John (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.37">Mt 26:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mk 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.35">10:35</a>). Zebedee was in the fishing business and may have been wealthy, considering that he had servants and apparent connections with the high priest (<a href="?bref=John.18.15">Jn 18:15</a>). Although he personally appears only once in the narrative (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.21">Mt 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.19-20">Mk 1:19-20</a>), his wife, Salome, appears frequently as one of the pious women who followed Christ.</p>
