<p class="h1">ZAANANNIM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the markers of the border of Naphtali listed between Heleph and Adami-nekeb (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.33">Jos 19:33</a>). <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a> puts it near Kedesh. There Sisera took refuge in the tent of Heber the Kenite and was killed by Jael (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11-21">11-21</a>). While the precise location is not known, it was west of Lake el-Huleh (modern Merom) in a region that was probably marshy in ancient times. Though the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates the text as “plain of Zaanaim,” it is more likely “Oak of Zaanannim” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Since many terebinth trees are located in the region, the text is probably referring to a terebinth set aside as a sacred tree.</p>
