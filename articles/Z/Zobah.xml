<p class="h1">ZOBAH</p>
<p class="fl">Aramean nation suffering military defeat from Israel during the early kingdom period. King Saul defeated the kings of Zobah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sm 14:47</a>). Soon after David became king of Israel, he defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3-5,12">2 Sm 8:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.3-10">1 Chr 18:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.60.1">Ps 60 title</a>). Later, the Ammonites hired 20,000 “Syrians of Zobah” for an anticipated attack by David’s forces. The coalition of Ammonites and hired mercenaries was defeated by soldiers led by Joab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.6-14">2 Sm 10:6-14</a>). When Hadadezer’s army counterattacked, they were again defeated decisively by David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.15-19">2 Sm 10:15-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.16-19">1 Chr 19:16-19</a>).</p>
