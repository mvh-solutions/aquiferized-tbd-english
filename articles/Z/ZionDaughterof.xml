<p class="h1">ZION, Daughter of</p>
<p class="fl">Term used primarily in prophetic literature to designate the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Zion) and its surrounding regions. The term was further applied to those in Babylon who had been exiled from Jerusalem and the Judean countryside (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.8">Is 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.31">Jer 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.2,23">6:2, 23</a>). Since ancient cities were considered metaphorically to be the mother of their inhabitants, referring to the people of Jerusalem as “daughters of Zion” was entirely appropriate, particularly in poetic literature. While Israel was to be the “virgin daughter” of spiritual Zion (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.21">2 Kgs 19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.22">Is 37:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.2.13">Lam 2:13</a>), many of the prophetic contexts proclaim judgment on the unfaithful “daughters” (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.16-17">Is 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.1.13">Mi 1:13</a>). Although the “daughters of Zion” were judged for their unfaithfulness, the ultimate promise was that God would deliver them (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.2">Is 52:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.62.11">62:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zec 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.5">Mt 21:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.15">Jn 12:15</a>).</p>
