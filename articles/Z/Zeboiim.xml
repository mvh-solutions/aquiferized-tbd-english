<p class="h1">ZEBOIIM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the “cities of the plain” that was destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.23">Dt 29:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.8">Hos 11:8</a>). Zeboiim is first mentioned, with Sodom, Gomorrah, and Admah, as one of the Canaanite cities in the “table of nations” in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.19">Genesis 10:19</a>. It later appears confederated with the same states (including Zoar) in the battle against Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.2,8">Gn 14:2, 8</a>).</p>
