<p class="h1">ZAMZUMMIM*, ZAMZUMMITES</p>
<p class="fl">Ammonite name for the Rephaim, who are described as a “people great and many, and tall as the Anakim” (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">Dt 2:20</a>). The Zamzummites were displaced by the Ammonites, just as the Horites were displaced by the Edomites and the Avvim by the Caphtorim. The comparison with the Anakim, the Rephaim, and the Emim makes it evident that the Zamzummites were a race of giants who lived in Transjordan. While their precise origin is unknown, they probably resided in the vicinity of Rabbath-ammon.</p>
