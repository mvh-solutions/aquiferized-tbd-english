  <title>Faith</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FAITH</p>
<p class="fl">Belief in that which has no tangible proof; trust in God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DefinitionofFaith">Definition of Faith</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT and NT, “faith” carries several meanings. It may mean simple trust in God or in the Word of God, and at other times faith almost becomes equivalent to active obedience. It may also find expression in the affirmation of a creedal statement. Thus, it also comes to mean the entire body of received Christian teaching or truth—“the truth.” In <a href="?bref=Col.2.7">Colossians 2:7</a>, the term suggests something to be accepted as a whole and embodied in personal life. In <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.7">2 Timothy 4:7</a>, Paul witnesses to having “kept the faith.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="FaithintheOldTestament">Faith in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The OT also strongly emphasizes faith as confidence in God’s covenant or in the covenant God made with Abraham and his descendants. The call of Abraham and the promise that his descendants would be used in the history of redemption became the basis of the narratives of the OT, being seen as the working out of that covenant. Once the nation Israel was brought into being, God sustained and protected it. The exodus from Egypt is a prominent indication that God was at work restoring his people to the Promised Land. The obedience of the people of God as the proper expression of faith is seen clearly in the OT. Without seeing God, his people believed and obeyed him. Abraham left his native land to go into unknown territory. The people of Israel left Egypt following the leadership of God to a land they could not see. The promise of God gave them courage to possess the land promised to them. After the exodus, the covenant of Abraham was confirmed with the people of Israel by the sprinkling of blood (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.6-7">Ex 24:6-7</a>). There was to be strict obedience to God’s commands as an expression of faith. This response of human faith to the Lord’s faithfulness was national and collective. There also were commands to, and instances of, personal faith.</p>
<p>Not only the narrative and legal portions of the OT but also the poetic and prophetic writings emphasize faith. The Psalms abound in expressions of personal confidence in the Lord even in dark times. Habakkuk points out that “the righteous shall live by his faith” (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Hb 2:4</a>). From such instances it is clear that, as the Lord’s education of Israel proceeded, the matter of faith in God’s faithfulness became more and more a matter of individual and personal response, and it is in the Prophets that several ingredients—such as trust, obedience, fear, and certainty—blend into the understanding of such personal faith.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FaithintheNewTestament">Faith in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">As over against the OT, where the accent is on the faithfulness of God, in the NT the emphasis is placed on the active, responding faith of the hearer to the promised, final revelation in the Messiah, Jesus. Both verb and noun regularly describe the adequate response of people to Jesus’ word and to the gospel.</p>
<p class="h3">The Synoptic Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">The most striking feature of the synoptic Gospels (quoted below from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>) is the use of faith without identifying its object: “If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed” (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.20">Mt 17:20</a>); “When Jesus saw their faith” (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.5">Mk 2:5</a>); “Your faith has saved you” (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.50">Lk 7:50</a>). Jesus is portrayed as one who by his work and word opens the door to faith and makes faith possible. The question is not whether the faith is in Jesus or in the Father; the implication is undoubtedly both, but as with every true bearer of the Word of God, the eye of faith is turned to the One who sends.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, Jesus denies the request for a miracle to substantiate his words (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.38-39">Mt 12:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>). Faith is response to the Word alone without any supporting props. No sign is to be given but the sign of Jonah. In the story of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>), Jesus denies the request for the spectacular and insists that the hearer must respond to the word given to him (cf. <a href="?bref=John.20.29">Jn 20:29</a>). The Word demands self-surrender and commitment. Hence, the very nature of the Word and of faith becomes an obstacle to the proud and the powerful.</p>
<p>Faith is the medium by which the power of God is made visible. It moves mountains, heals the sick, and is the means of entrance into the kingdom. It may be mingled with doubt, as with the father who sought healing for his son (“I believe; help my unbelief!” [<a href="?bref=Mark.9.24">Mk 9:24</a>]), or as with John the Baptist in prison, who, even with his doubts, was confirmed by Jesus as the greatest of the offspring of woman (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-15">Mt 11:2-15</a>). Peter’s (and the other disciples’) perception was faulty, but Jesus affirms Peter’s confession as the foundation stone of the church. The synoptic Gospels portray the early faith of the disciples in all its limitations and weaknesses, yet it is still faith in that it is their positive response to Jesus’ word and work.</p>
<p class="h3">The Fourth Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">Faith is an especially significant concept in the Gospel of John (quoted below from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>), though the word (in the Greek) occurs only as a verb. Quite often the reference has to do with the acceptance that something is true, that is, simple credence, or belief: “Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me” (<a href="?bref=John.14.11">Jn 14:11</a>); “If you believed Moses, you would believe me” (<a href="?bref=John.5.46">Jn 5:46</a>).</p>
<p>Even more significant is the special expression “to believe into” in the sense of putting one’s trust into another. The particular form of the expression is without parallel before the fourth Gospel and may well express the strong sense of personal trust in the eternal Word made flesh. In <a href="?bref=John.3.16">John 3:16</a>, whoever puts trust in him has eternal life. Those who put their trust in him are given power to become sons of God—to be born of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">Jn 1:12</a>). They will never thirst (<a href="?bref=John.6.35">6:35</a>); they will live, even though they die (<a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>).</p>
<p>In other places, John speaks of trust or faith in an absolute sense, that is, without referring to the one in whom trust is placed. In <a href="?bref=John.11.15">John 11:15</a> Jesus arrives after the death of Lazarus and is glad “in order that you might believe.” The outcome is going to be faith. Similarly, in the prologue (<a href="?bref=John.1.7">1:7</a>), John the Baptist bears witness in order that through him all might believe. As Jesus satisfies the doubt of Thomas concerning the resurrection, he says, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe” (<a href="?bref=John.20.29">20:29</a>). In these and other passages the fundamental outcome of Jesus’ witness to himself is trust.</p>
<p>Faith and knowledge are closely related. In <a href="?bref=John.6.69">John 6:69</a> Peter says, “We have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” In his priestly prayer Jesus says that eternal life is to “know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (<a href="?bref=John.17.3">Jn 17:3</a>). Also, God is seen through the eyes of faith. No one has ever seen God, but the Only Begotten has revealed him (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">1:18</a>). He who has seen Jesus has seen the Father (<a href="?bref=John.14.9">14:9</a>).</p>
<p>To believe is also expressed in the verb “receive.” Those who receive Christ are given power to become the sons of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">Jn 1:12</a>). Trust is that form of knowing or seeing by which the glory of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.4">17:4</a>) is made present.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Writings</p>
<p class="fl">In Paul’s letters (quoted below from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>), he writes about faith from a number of angles. He sets faith over against “works of the law” as the only and true basis for righteousness (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-4.25">Rom 1–4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.1-4.31">Gal 1–4</a>) and appeals to Abraham to prove his point: “Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness” (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gn 15:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.4.5">Rom 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6">Gal 3:6</a>). This is entirely apart from the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21">Rom 3:21</a>); righteousness is the gift of God through faith in Christ, specifically in his atoning work. Behind Paul’s conviction lies his awareness of the radical and pervasive sinfulness of humans that renders each one helpless. Humanity is dead in sin but is made alive by faith in the word and work of Jesus mediated through the gospel.</p>
<p>Faith, then, is faith in Jesus Christ. The number of metaphors Paul employs to describe the consequences of faith is staggering. It is by faith that believers are justified (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1">Rom 5:1</a>), reconciled (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.18">2 Cor 5:18</a>), redeemed (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>), made alive (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.5">2:5</a>), adopted into the family of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.15-16">Rom 8:15-16</a>), re-created (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>), transported into a new kingdom (<a href="?bref=Col.1.13">Col 1:13</a>), and set free (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.1">Gal 5:1</a>). Faith is, for Paul, the <span class="ital">sine qua non</span> of every aspect of salvation, from the grace that convicts to the receiving of the full inheritance at the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p>In Paul’s letters, faith is bound up with love so that the great exponent of justification by faith becomes also the articulate exponent of distinctive Christian love. To say that faith is indispensable to salvation is only part of the truth, for faith expresses itself through love: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">Gal 5:6</a>); “If I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.2">1 Cor 13:2</a>). Love is both the genesis and the ultimate expression of faith. Hence, even for Paul there can be no <span class="ital">total</span> separation between faith and works. This love of which Paul speaks is the essential fruit of the Spirit through whom the life of faith is lived. Only by virtue of the indwelling Spirit does faith find expression in love.</p>
<p class="h3">General Epistles</p>
<p class="fl">James speaks of faith as being completed by works (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.22">Jas 2:22</a>). He opposed that concept of faith that thinks primarily of creedal assent, of believing that something is true without acting upon it. James, like Paul, assumes the primacy of faith, but he is warning against those who would draw wrong conclusions. Faith apart from works is not faith; it is barren (v <a href="?bref=Jas.2.20">20</a>). The practical dimension of faith is the burden of much of this epistle.</p>
<p>The writer of Hebrews recognizes that faith has always been characteristic of the people of God and their specially called leaders. Faith makes substantial what is otherwise nebulous and uncertain; it makes evidential what is not visible. By faith the people of God have a more certain ground for their lives and their actions than the world is able to discern (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.1">Heb 11:1</a>). The great cloud of witnesses (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.1">12:1</a>) bear testimony by their faith to the faithfulness of God.</p>
<p>Faith is opened up by the Word of God, finds expression through the Holy Spirit who is given, and bears witness to the lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <title>Faithfulness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FAITHFULNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Maintaining faith or allegiance; showing a strong sense of duty or conscientiousness. In biblical Hebrew, “faith” and “faithfulness” are grammatically related. Although both concepts are important in the OT, there is no English word exactly equivalent to the Hebrew terms. The most relevant Hebrew verbal root (related to our word “amen”) carries such meanings as “strengthen,” “support,” or “hold up.” In a physical sense it is used of pillars that provide support for doors (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.16">2 Kgs 18:16</a>). Moses used the word when he disclaimed any role as supporter of the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Num.11.12">Nm 11:12</a>). God, however, is an eternally firm support for his people (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.9">Dt 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.7">Is 49:7</a>).</p>
<p>With that notion of firm support as the bedrock for faith, words such as “firmness,” “constancy,” or “trustworthiness” best convey the related concept of faithfulness. Trustworthiness, or steadfastness of character, is ascribed to the object of one’s trust. To be unfaithful is to be unworthy of confidence or belief. In the OT a synonym for “faithfulness” is “truth.” Since God is consistently true, he is the logical object of human trust (<a href="?bref=Ps.71.22">Ps 71:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.8">Is 61:8</a>). When used of God in the OT, the word “faithfulness” frequently refers to his unwavering commitment to his promises.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GodsFaithfulness">God’s Faithfulness</p>
<p class="fl">In spite of Israel’s faithlessness (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.20">Dt 32:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.3.3">Rom 3:3</a>), God showed himself to be absolutely reliable. His faithfulness is great (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.23">Lam 3:23</a>). He is loyal to his covenant and will always manifest his steadfast love to his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">Ps 136</a>).</p>
<p>The pinnacle of faithfulness in the Bible is seen in the work of Jesus Christ, who showed himself faithful to his Father (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.2">Heb 3:2</a>) and in his witness (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.5">Rv 1:5</a>). God calls men and women to be faithful by following Christ, relying on him for all things (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Hb 2:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="HumanFaithfulness">Human Faithfulness</p>
<p class="fl">Faith and faithfulness are logically and linguistically united in the OT and NT. That is, the major words for faith in both Testaments also connote the concept of faithfulness. This indicates that faith is more than momentary assent to the truth of God. It is commitment to that truth, and it manifests itself in continued obedience. Abraham’s life in this regard is instructive. He assented to, relied upon, and acted in conformity to the revealed word of God. He received God’s revelation as true (i.e., demonstrating faith), and his subsequent actions proved his faithfulness. He left home and country, settled in a strange land, and offered up his son Isaac as God commanded. His willingness to sacrifice his only son is an unparalleled expression of faithfulness in the OT. It is no surprise, therefore, that Abraham is commended for his steadfastness and is set forth in the NT as one whose behavior should be imitated by Christians (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-9">Gal 3:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.8-10">Heb 11:8-10</a>). Faithfulness, then, must not be viewed as an isolated act. Rather, it is an attitude that should characterize the entire life of those who say they have faith in God.</p>

<p class="h1">FALL OF MAN*</p>
<p class="fl">Transition from a condition of moral innocence and favor with God to a condition of being condemned to death, which occurred in the history of humankind with Adam’s eating of the forbidden fruit.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalEvidence">Biblical Evidence</p>
<p class="fl">The narrative of Creation in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">2</a> affirms the distinctiveness of both man’s nature and task. Man (used in this article as a generic term for male and female human beings) was created in the image of God for the purpose of communion and fellowship with God. As God’s representative, he was given dominion on the earth to cultivate and use its resources for the glory of God.</p>
<p>In addition to the cultural mandate, man also received a specific command. He was authorized to use the vegetation of the Garden of Eden for food, but he was expressly forbidden to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The purpose of this command was to introduce into the human consciousness the radical antithesis between good and evil and to confirm man in the service of the Creator. As a faithful and loyal servant, man was to enjoy all the blessings bestowed by his Father in heaven and at last be led into the fullness of eternal life with God.</p>
<p>Man was made a living creature, as were the animals, but the core of his life was to be union and communion with God. Fellowship with God was to become Adam’s conscious possession, in contrast to the animals that know neither the possibility of sin nor conscious communion with God. In full awareness of the evil of the alternative, man was to serve God willingly and lovingly. His life before God was therefore to be religious rather than instinctive.</p>
<p>The purpose of God in giving the command not to eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil was to establish humans in the ways of righteousness and faith, but Satan used the command as an occasion to tempt man to rebel against God. Although there was no evil for man in being tempted, it was evil for Satan to tempt man to sin. This means that there was evil in the universe prior to the fall of man. It was the apparent purpose of Satan to subject man to himself, and through man to extend his kingdom of darkness over the earth. The fall of man and the subsequent program of redemption must be understood in the context of the cosmic conflict between God and Satan, in which the ultimate triumph of God is assured. Satan approached Adam by way of Eve, using the serpent as his instrument to entice them to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The difference between good and evil was not concealed from man prior to the fall, though man’s experiential knowledge was only of the good. Adam was to receive instruction concerning the nature of this distinction and the consequences of eating or not eating only from God. As he had received life in the beginning from his Creator, so now he was to live in obedience to every word that proceeded from the mouth of God. The purpose of the temptation was to urge independence from God. Satan called into question the truth of God and challenged his authority. He led man to think that he could determine for himself the difference between good and evil and that he could control the consequences to his own advantage. It was the temptation for man to be a god to himself.</p>
<p>Adam fell when he yielded to the temptation of Satan and, together with his wife, ate of the forbidden fruit. The act of rebellion was an act of disobedience, disloyalty, faithlessness, and unbelief. As the command not to eat summarized and brought to a focus all that was involved in righteousness before God, so the transgression epitomized radical apostasy from God. Undivided obedience to God gave way to whole-souled rebellion and complete revolt: the authority of God was repudiated; the goodness of God was doubted; the wisdom of God was disputed; and the truth of God was contradicted. A whole new complex of affections and emotions took possession of the heart and mind of man.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EffectsoftheFall">Effects of the Fall</p>
<p class="fl">The immediate effects of the fall are visible in the loss of boldness and joy in the presence of God and the emergence of fear and shame. They are visible also in the alienation of Adam and Eve from God. This is exemplified in the curse in relation to man, but more pointedly in the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden. The Garden was the dwelling place of righteousness, the sphere of union and communion between man and God. Expulsion was inevitable once the communion was severed by unrighteousness. As God had warned, the consequence of sin was death. Since death intervenes at every point where there is life, it works itself out also in the dissolution of the body in the grave.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="ContemporaryUnderstandingOfTheFall"/>
<p>The consequences of the fall are not limited to Adam and Eve but extend to all those descended from the first pair by natural generation, because there is a unique relation of solidarity existing between Adam and the rest of the race. Some theologians accent the generic connection between Adam and his descendants, while others focus on the covenant relationship of Adam as the head and representative of his posterity. The consequences of Adam’s transgression for the human race are the imputation of his sin to all his descendants, their consequent liability to death, and their inheritance of a depraved nature.</p>
<p>The results of the fall are also manifest in the cosmos as the curse works itself out in the resistance offered to the accomplishment of the original cultural mandate. Only with the pain and danger attendant upon childbirth is the world populated, and only with arduous, toilsome labor are the food, clothing, and shelter necessary to sustain life provided.</p>
<p>However, the fact that death does not descend <span class="ital">immediately</span> upon man after the fall as <span class="ital">final</span> judgment is indicative of God’s saving purpose for man. Adam does not hear the curse of death pronounced until he has heard the promise of a Savior (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>).</p>
<p>After <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Genesis 3</a>, the Bible only infrequently refers to the fall of man, but this historical event is the indispensable presupposition of all that follows. The thrust of the Bible is toward the future—the widening effects of sin and the unfolding of God’s remedy.</p>

<p class="h1">FALSE CHRISTS*, FALSE MESSIAHS</p>
<p class="fl">Those who falsely claim to be the Christ or Messiah. False christs are mentioned only in the eschatological discourse of Jesus recorded by Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.24">24:24</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.22">13:22</a>).</p>
<p>In that discourse Jesus instructed his disciples about the future. He prophesied the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem and warned about the deception and persecution that would confront the disciples. He especially warned his disciples that during the terrible days surrounding the destruction of the temple they were not to be deceived by false christs and false prophets (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.21-23">Mk 13:21-23</a>). In this particular form of deception, some would claim that the Christ was in a particular location (v <a href="?bref=Mark.13.21">21</a>). Those deceivers would perform signs and wonders to try to deceive the elect. But Jesus prepared his disciples by instructing them that there will be cosmic signs preceding his return as the Son of Man (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.13.24-25">24-25</a>) and that his coming will be with great power and glory visible to all.</p>
<p>From history we know that Jesus’ instruction enabled Christians to flee the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, and to withstand the deception of false christs. The church still awaits Jesus’ return as the glorious Son of Man.</p>

  <title>Family Life and Relations</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FAMILY LIFE AND RELATIONS</p>
<p class="fl">In Bible times, the family comprised members of a household, including not only parents and children, along with other relatives and concubines, but also servants, travelers, aliens, and anyone else who happened to be within the house and was therefore under the protection of the head of the family. The family of Jacob, for example, comprised three generations (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.8-26">Gn 46:8-26</a>). Biblically, the term “family” is interchangeable with “house,” and “founding a house” can refer to setting up a separate dwelling as well as establishing a family. In the broader sense, “house” may refer to an entire nation (“house of Israel”). The heads of families returning from Babylon in the postexilic period controlled sometimes several hundred family members (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.1-14">Ezr 8:1-14</a>). The family was a smaller part of a clan and tribe. In nomadic times the responsibilities and allegiances centered on the larger family group.</p>
<p>Those who belonged to the clan knew that they had to work for common interests and accept responsibility for the whole group. All members of the family were to be protected and assisted in time of need.</p>
<p>As the life of the Israelites became more settled, families (in the wider sense of the term) lived in villages surrounded by fields of wheat, barley, and flax, with areas of grazing land for sheep and goats. Each group of villages consisted of an intermarried, interdependent family group, such as that of the Danites of Zorah and Eshtaol (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.11">Jgs 18:11</a>). The hard life of those days demanded a sharing of work and the loyal cooperation of the entire family for survival.</p>
<p>As crafts and trades developed, along with a more sedentary lifestyle, sons learned their fathers’ skills and continued the family trade. Consequently, the whole village might follow a particular craft (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.14">1 Chr 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.35">Neh 11:35</a>). By specializing in such trades, however, the villagers became less self-sufficient, depending more on farmers for food and on other specialized villages for the production of cloth or pottery (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.21-23">1 Chr 4:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>With the growth of cities, related groups lived together in specific areas. Many members of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah were listed in the census of Jerusalem by Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.4-8">Neh 11:4-8</a>), and by the writer of Chronicles (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.3-9">1 Chr 9:3-9</a>). One consequence of life in the cities was the fragmentation of the family group. As the bonds of the wider family were loosened, the unit consisted increasingly of a husband and wife with their children, living in one house. The size of houses that have been excavated precludes the idea of any larger family unit as the norm in OT societies.</p>
<p>During the kingdom period, King David’s sons Amnon and Absalom set up their own separate houses (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.7-8,20">2 Sm 13:7-8, 20</a>). At that time there were few slaves in Hebrew society, but they also were considered members of the family. As bonds of the wider family loosened, and the master of the household lost a degree of authority, the society became one in which the king was sovereign and all the people were his subjects.</p>
<p>The early kings of Israel promoted such a change in order to establish a central ruling authority for the entire country. The king’s subjects fell broadly into the categories of employers and employees, corresponding to the rich and poor of society. By the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, members of the wider family no longer worked for the communal good under the authority of the clan’s head; rather, individuals worked primarily for the good of their own immediate family. Hence one’s labor and devotion were focused more narrowly, and the greatest beneficiary was the king, the personal symbol of the nation.</p>
<p>Emphasis on the smaller family unit increased, and old duties that had been willingly accepted by the wider groups in former times came to be neglected. People did not always help relatives in times of need, and they frequently had to be reminded of their obligations, particularly toward widows and orphans (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.17">Is 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.6">Jer 7:6</a>). Family feuds also declined because members no longer felt responsible to take vengeance as a way to uphold the honor of the clan (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.27">2 Sm 3:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.8">16:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.26">2 Kgs 9:26</a>). Nevertheless, Nehemiah expected Israelites to fight for their family honor (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.14">Neh 4:14</a>). In NT times, the family was such a unit that it could be sold for a debt incurred by one of its members (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.25">Mt 18:25</a>).</p>
<p>The Hebrew religion’s emphasis on family participation in certain celebrations strengthened the small unit. The Passover, for example, was always celebrated as a family thanksgiving meal (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.3-4,46">Ex 12:3-4, 46</a>). The prophet Samuel’s parents made a traditional annual pilgrimage to the shrine at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.19">1 Sm 2:19</a>). In modern times, a young Jewish boy’s arrival at the threshold of manhood is celebrated with the Bar Mitzvah ceremony. Being so honored in the midst of a religious family preserves the ancient Hebrew tradition of family participation in religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>In his preaching Jesus used the family as a symbol for the relationship of God to his people (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.14">Mt 19:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.9">23:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.21">Lk 8:21</a>). From the cross he handed over responsibility for the care of his mother to his disciple John (<a href="?bref=John.19.27">Jn 19:27</a>).</p>
<p>In NT times, the communion meals in the Jerusalem church took place by households (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a>). Early Christian meetings were held in the homes of believers because of opposition by the authorities. The book of Acts contains examples of entire families being converted to Christianity (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.24,44-48">Acts 10:24, 44-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.15,31-32">16:15, 31-32</a>). Timothy learned the gospel from his grandmother and mother (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.5">2 Tm 1:5</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="StatusofFamilyMembers">Status of Family Members</p>
<p class="fl">From nomadic times, a father’s authority held the family group together in their encampment, and he became the symbol of their security. In ancient patriarchal societies, the father was an absolute master who had the power of life and death over family members, ruling with unchallenged authority. Although he had extensive responsibilities for those under his care, his power was awesome and his status unquestioned.</p>
<p>A man’s possessions included his wife, servants, slaves, and animals (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.21">Dt 5:21</a>). In fact, the phrase “to marry a wife” comes from a Hebrew root meaning “to become the master of a wife.” A husband was as much the master of his wife as he was of his home or his fields. Consequently, the wife addressed him in a subservient manner, as a slave would address a master (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.12">Gn 18:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.26">Jgs 19:26</a>). This low status for a woman extended to a daughter’s position in the ancient household. Females were always under the authority of a male relative: first, the father; then a husband. If a woman became a widow, she was subject to her husband’s nearest male relative, who became her “redeemer.” The bride price (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.18,27">Gn 29:18, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.22.16-17">Ex 22:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.25">1 Sm 18:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.14">2 Sm 3:14</a>) paid by her husband was not exactly a purchase of the woman from her father, but the exchange of money did stigmatize her. The amount of a bride price depended on the father’s status (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.12">Gn 34:12</a>). The usual price was probably 20 to 30 shekels of silver. The bride received gifts of jewelry, ornaments, and clothing from her future husband, and she occasionally enjoyed some sort of financial or material return from the bride price for her own use (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.19">Jos 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.15">Jgs 1:15</a>). When her father or husband died, the money frequently reverted to her.</p>
<p>An engaged woman was considered her fiancé’s property just as much as if she were already married to him (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.23-27">Dt 22:23-27</a>). The woman left her own family at marriage, to live with and become part of her new husband’s family. Normally, any succeeding marriages would be with members of that family.</p>
<p>Despite the low legal status of the mother of the family, her life was not as bad as one might suppose. She was the legal wife, not an unpaid servant, and she frequently took a strong role as adviser to her husband in family affairs. Her most important function, aside from childbearing, was organization of the household, of which she was generally the respected manager. Even though the wife might have been acquired through capture in war (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.10-14">Dt 21:10-14</a>), she could not be sold as a slave or daughter could (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.7">Ex 21:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.5.5">Neh 5:5</a>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, her position was precarious, in that she could be disowned or divorced by her husband as the result of a simple renunciation: “She is no longer my wife, and I am no longer her husband.” Perhaps he had found fault with her culinary skills, or possibly he was casting his eyes on another woman. In any event, a husband knew that if his wife did not obey even a signal or a glance, he was within his rights to obtain a divorce (cf. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.25.26">Ecclus 25:26</a>). The wife, however, obtained a certain degree of protection in the letter of repudiation, by which her freedom was formally restored. Under Jewish tradition, a wife could not divorce her husband.</p>
<p>In matters of domestic protocol, the Hebrew wife was not introduced to her husband’s guests, a tradition that subsequently led to considerable embarrassment for Abraham’s wife, Sarah, and for Rebekah (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.16">Gn 20:16</a>). A woman normally remained veiled in public (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.65">24:65</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.38.14">38:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.47.2">Is 47:2</a>).</p>
<p>The imagery in <a href="?bref=Pr.19.13">Proverbs 19:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Pr.27.15">27:15</a> draws a vigorous comparison between a contentious woman and water dripping from a leaky roof. The OT leaves little doubt about the type of behavior expected from a woman. She was expected to be charming, soft-spoken, discreet, and calm (<a href="?bref=Pr.9.13">Prv 9:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.16,22">11:16, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.21.9">21:9</a>). She was also to be responsible, well-organized, intelligent, thoughtful, reverent, and a good manager of both the household and the family purse (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.10-31">31:10-31</a>). A woman should also be pious and beautiful, and in NT tradition, submissive to her husband, as befitted a woman adorned with the priceless jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.4-5">Ti 2:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-6">1 Pt 3:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>The actions of a few women whose roles in life do not seem to fit the pattern of the meek, passive female pictured above, are recorded in the Bible and the Apocrypha. The books of Judith and Esther recount heroic tales of how national fortunes were saved by women. Deborah and Jael were renowned heroines (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">Jgs 4–5</a>), and the kingdom of Judah was ruled by a vicious woman, Athaliah, for several years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1-21">2 Kgs 11</a>). The women who stepped to the forefront of public life were exceptional and few in number. Judith was a rich widow, an unusual thing in Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MaritalSecurity">Marital Security</p>
<p class="fl">The security of a wife’s position improved considerably when she produced her first child, particularly if it was a son. A woman’s primary duty to her husband and his family was procreation (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Gn 1:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.9.1">9:1</a>), and until she gave birth to a son, she feared displacement by a second wife or a concubine. Polygamous marriages were by no means rare, especially in wealthy families. They resulted in two ill-defined family groups, controlled by the mothers but under the overall authority of fathers; there were inevitable jealousies and frictions.</p>
<p>The legal status of a woman was consistently poor in Bible times. With no evidence at all, a husband could accuse his wife of adultery, and she was compelled to face a trial by ordeal. She had to abase herself by taking an oath, eating dust and a cereal offering, and drinking bitter water. A priest, meanwhile, made pronouncements regarding the dire results that would come to her if she were guilty: she would become an outcast with no hope of survival. But if she maintained her serenity, and if her thigh did not rot nor her abdomen swell, she was considered to have “proved” her innocence. In such an event she would go free, and her husband bore no blame whatsoever for his false accusation (<a href="?bref=Num.5.12-31">Nm 5:12-31</a>).</p>
<p>If a woman took a vow, it was legal only as long as her father or husband approved it. If she became a widow, the vow still remained in force and could be used against her (<a href="?bref=Num.30.3-15">Nm 30:3-15</a>).</p>
<p>A woman in Israel was always under the protection of a male, be it her father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother, husband, or some other member of her husband’s family. She had few legal rights and, in contrast to Babylonian traditions, could not inherit at her husband’s death. It is small wonder that widows were classed with orphans and the poor. A childless widow could on occasion return to her father’s family (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.11">Gn 38:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.13">Lv 22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.1.8">Ru 1:8</a>), thus becoming subject again to the authority of her father. A Hebrew widow could also remain with her late husband’s family. She would then come under the protection of her “redeemer,” a male relative of her husband’s family who assumed responsibility for her. If a husband died leaving a woman childless, it was the responsibility of the husband’s brother to marry her. The first son born of such a union was then regarded as the heir of the first husband.</p>
<p>It was normal for a brother to accept the obligation for such a marriage (levirate). It could be refused on various grounds, but such refusal was considered dishonorable, for it was a man’s duty to perpetuate his brother’s name and to safeguard the family fortune.</p>
<p>A redeemer’s responsibilities were considerable. In addition to the marriage, he was perhaps involved in avenging the family reputation, and he had to ensure that family property increased and remained within family control.</p>
<p>If an Israelite fell into debt and was forced to sell himself into slavery, he would normally be “redeemed” by one of his relatives (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-49">Lv 25:47-49</a>). If in his penury an Israelite had to sell his land or his house, the redeemer had the right of first refusal over all other prospective purchasers. It was as much his duty as his right to prevent family property from passing into the hands of strangers (v <a href="?bref=Lev.25.25">25</a>). The prophet Jeremiah bought his cousin Hanamel’s field under similar circumstances (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-15">Jer 32:6-15</a>).</p>
<p>The most familiar OT story of a childless widow, her “redeemer,” and their levirate marriage is recorded in the book of Ruth. One of Naomi’s two sons married Ruth. When Ruth was widowed, her impoverished mother-in-law, Naomi, left her home in Moab and returned to Bethlehem to sell some of the family property. Although a close relative was prepared to buy the land and keep it in the family, he was not ready to marry Ruth as well (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.12">Ru 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.4">4:4</a>). He knew that a son of that union would be deemed a son of the deceased, bearing the dead husband’s name, and thus ultimately inheriting the land (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.4-6">4:4-6</a>). The next relative in order of kinship was Boaz, who became Ruth’s “redeemer.” He was prepared to accept the double obligation of purchasing the land and marrying Ruth (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.9-10">4:9-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PositionofChildren">Position of Children</p>
<p class="fl">Children were generally well loved, but their childhood was short and they were often regarded as laborers for the house or fields. According to the law of primogeniture, the eldest son received a double portion of the estate as his birthright (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>). Thus, he was assured of the position of family head. Even during his father’s lifetime, the eldest son took precedence over his brothers and sisters (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.33">Gn 43:33</a>). Where twins were born, the first to emerge from the womb was considered the elder, with all the attendant privileges (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.24-26">25:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.38.27-30">38:27-30</a>).</p>
<p>For a serious offense, the eldest son could lose the right of primogeniture (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.22">Gn 35:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.3-4">49:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.1">1 Chr 5:1</a>), or it could be surrendered voluntarily, as Esau did by selling his birthright to his brother Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.29-34">Gn 25:29-34</a>). There was a law protecting the eldest son from his father’s favoritism for a younger brother (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.15-17">Dt 21:15-17</a>). Nevertheless, King David gave his kingdom to Solomon, his youngest son (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.15">1 Kgs 2:15</a>).</p>
<p>In a family with no sons, a daughter could inherit property (<a href="?bref=Num.27.8">Nm 27:8</a>). Frequently, parents consulted neither sons nor daughters when marriage partners were arranged for them. Marriage was often an alliance or contract between two families, and thus the wishes and concerns of individuals were considered unimportant. Love matches were few, although occasionally a son would marry in defiance of his parents, as Esau did (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.34-35">Gn 26:34-35</a>). Although it was rare for young people to express their feelings and preferences about marriage in an open fashion, Saul’s daughter, Michal, made known her love for David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.20">1 Sm 18:20</a>).</p>
<p>There is no record of legal adoption among the Hebrews, but it was practiced from ancient times in Mesopotamia. It was especially useful as a means of ensuring a childless couple that their land would be tilled and that they would be cared for in their old age. All examples of adoption mentioned in the OT took place outside the land of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.10">Ex 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.20">1 Kgs 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.7,15">Est 2:7, 15</a>) and are not examples of true adoption as a lifetime member of a family.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRightsofChildren">The Rights of Children</p>
<p class="fl">The nature of patriarchal society made for unfortunate distinctions between male and female children. The position of a daughter, who could be sold into slavery or sold to be the concubine of a man and then possibly sold again (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.7-11">Ex 21:7-11</a>), was certainly inferior to that of a son. In the patriarchal period, however, both a son and a daughter could be put to death for disobeying the head of the family. One’s children could also be sacrificed in worship rituals (see <a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-24">Gn 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.1-40">Jgs 11</a>). It is probable that infant sacrifice was practiced by nations neighboring Israel, including Canaan and Ammon.</p>
<p>The rights of children were improved considerably with the promulgation of the code of Mosaic law. A father was no longer permitted to put his child to death without referring the case to the elders (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.18-21">Dt 21:18-21</a>). Both sons and daughters could be brought before such authorities and accused of being disobedient, gluttonous, or drunkards. A father’s absolute authority even extended to his married son and family if they were living under his roof. The law also prohibited children from being held responsible for the crimes of their parents (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.16">Dt 24:16</a>). In King David’s time a person convicted by the community had the right of appeal to the king (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.4-11">2 Sm 14:4-11</a>).</p>
<p>In Hebrew families both parents were held in high respect. Honor had to be given to both mother and father (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.12">Ex 20:12</a>), and the law condemned offenses against either parent (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.17">21:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.9">Lv 20:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.18">Dt 21:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.16">27:16</a>). Respect due to the mother is a recurrent theme in the Wisdom Literature (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.26">Prv 19:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.20">20:20</a>; cf. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.3.1-16">Ecclus 3:1-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DailyLifeoftheHebrewFamily">Daily Life of the Hebrew Family</p>
<p class="fl">In the everyday affairs of a Hebrew household, it was the father’s responsibility to maintain the family fortune and to be the provider. He might work in the fields, most probably with crops of flax, barley, or wheat. Or he would work at a trade, possibly as a weaver, builder, potter, dyer, fuller, or a worker in copper or bronze. If he lived near the shore, he might be a fisherman.</p>
<p>The father was also responsible for the religious well-being of the family. It was his duty to take over his sons’ education from the mother at an early age, teaching them the tenets of Hebrew religion (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.2">Ex 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.26">12:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.9">Dt 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.7">6:7</a>). He also explained all the facets of the law and the interwoven history of the nation.</p>
<p>The father was the disciplinarian of the family, with the rod being used to drive home the lessons taught (<a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">Prv 13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.15">22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.29.15-17">29:15-17</a>). Though children were loved and valued, they were not pampered (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.30.9-12">Ecclus 30:9-12</a>). In postexilic times education also took place within the precincts of the synagogue, and shortly before the time of Christ, a general elementary education was introduced. It was also imperative that a father teach his sons a trade, normally his own, for a man without a trade either starved or became a thief. Another important paternal responsibility was to provide wives for male offspring in the household.</p>
<p>The mother was responsible for her sons’ and daughters’ early education (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.8">Prv 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.20">6:20</a>), teaching them religious songs and prayers as soon as they could talk. A father took over the education of his sons, but the mother continued with the daughters, training them to spin, weave, cook, clean, trim the lamps, and generally to become competent in all the household duties (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.13-31">31:13-31</a>).</p>
<p>With little furniture, keeping a house clean meant sweeping the floors to keep them free from dust and dirt. Cooking was at once simple and difficult. It was simple in that much of the food was cooked in the form of a soup or stew, or else made into a cake and cooked on a griddle. It was difficult in that the corn had to be ground by hand and bread was baked daily.</p>
<p>A mother was expected to take wool, card it, spin it, and often weave and make clothes for her family. In addition, she would help her husband in the fields at harvesttime. Because many families had one or more olive trees, a few grapevines, and fig trees, the mother would also assist in picking the fruit. She would sometimes work at the press when the olives or grapes were being processed. Frequently the treading of grapes in the family vat would be done together by husband and wife. Drawing water from the well was considered a menial task and was generally the wife’s responsibility, although sometimes it was assigned to the children (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.15-16">Gn 24:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>As in all societies, there was a time when children laughed and played together (<a href="?bref=Zech.8.5">Zec 8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.16">Mt 11:16</a>), although childhood and adolescence were not recognized as specific stages of development. Children were considered as sucklings if under three, but were regarded as boys or girls when they were able to take care of themselves. A small child sat on his mother’s lap and was played with (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.12">Is 66:12</a>). There is no evidence of organized sports for children. Toys, including whistles, rattles, dolls, and miniature cooking utensils, have been excavated at Palestinian sites.</p>
<p>As soon as a boy was old enough, he took his place in the family and accepted his appointed task. Among other things, children were expected to gather fuel (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.18">Jer 7:18</a>). Young boys and girls tended the flocks. The sheep had to be protected from marauding wild beasts, guarded against their own folly when they wandered near crevices, steered toward good pasture and water, and carried home when sick or injured (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.6">Gn 29:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.2.16">Ex 2:16</a>). The care of cattle was also the responsibility of children (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.11">1 Sm 16:11</a>). Of necessity, boys were trained in the various arts of war.</p>
<p>Children sometimes joined their fathers in the fields, and their presence was always welcome. From earliest times, boys in particular would watch their fathers until they too picked up a tool or implement to try their skill; girls watched and learned from their mothers. Young children frequently listened to the talk of the elders at the city gates or in the villages. A visit to a sanctuary at festival time was a family affair, furnishing an ideal learning experience. As a child, Jesus accompanied his parents, Mary and Joseph, to the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.42-47">Lk 2:42-47</a>).</p>
<p>Young girls were surprisingly free to go about their appointed tasks. They were not secluded or veiled and could visit uninhibited with friends and neighbors (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.1">Gn 34:1</a>). They were also able to converse with men without embarrassment (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.15-25">24:15-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.29.11-12">29:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.11-13">1 Sm 9:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>Mealtimes were strictly family times. It is doubtful whether a meal comparable to a breakfast was eaten, and a farmer would probably have a light lunch in the fields. The main meal of the day was prepared by the mother, and it would be eaten in the early evening. Although the variety of food available was limited, its preparation was time-consuming.</p>
<p>Feast times were periods of great religious significance and were also the days when family members participated in the symbolic rituals of their faith. Among the Israelites several kinds of food were fundamental to their religious ritual. Family unity and the national religion were molded together by special meals in the home.</p>
<p>Daylight played an important part in the daily habits of the people in antiquity. Although oil lamps were readily available in later periods, it was customary to rise with the sun and go to bed relatively soon after dark. The wife would probably be up before sunrise and might continue her labor after dark.</p>
<p class="h2" id="InNewTestamentTimes">In New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">By NT times, for those who followed the Greek and Roman style, life became more elegant. Despite that, the status of many family members did not change substantially. Wealthier families had more slaves, and the children were more likely to have formal education, sometimes spending less effort on family chores. Even in Roman times, however, the father still had a legal right to accept or reject his child.</p>
<p>The status of the woman had definitely improved by the NT period. A Roman matron was highly respected and exerted a strong influence over her husband. She was not sequestered in a particular section of the house, as a Greek woman was, but managed and supervised tasks in any part of her home. She helped her husband in business, had her own place in theaters, games, and religious festivals, and sometimes managed her own property. Palestinian women began to enjoy a new status and dignity as the result of Jesus’ attitude toward women and its influence on the early Christian church.</p>

  <title>Famine</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FAMINE</p>
<p class="fl">Prolonged and extreme lack of food. Famine, along with other disasters (such as war and disease), has always been part of the human experience. Sometimes there was enough rainfall, properly timed, but occasionally rainfall was too early or late or insufficient (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.19">Lv 26:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.7-8">Am 4:7-8</a>). The Hebrews and other people in the Near East viewed famine as judgment from God. Since God is the Creator and Sustainer, he has power over the natural world. He could use his created order as he chose; it was no accident when there was famine. Whether a famine occurred through lack of rainfall, hailstorms, or any other event, God was the agent.</p>
<p>The most prevalent cause of famine in the ancient world was lack of rain. Such famines occurred in the time of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.10">Gn 12:10</a>) and Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.1">26:1</a>). Joseph was greatly concerned about overcoming the famines in Egypt (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.41.1-47.31">41–47</a>). The Nile River usually provided the Egyptians with enough water for their crops; a failure to receive adequate water supplies from upland regions meant famine for Egypt.</p>
<p>Besides lack of rainfall, famine could result from other causes, such as hail and thunderstorms (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.28">Ex 9:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.17">1 Sm 12:17</a>). Sieges on crops by locusts and other pests sometimes caused famine (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.15">Ex 10:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.9">Am 4:9</a>). Invasion by foreign armies also brought on famine (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.53">Dt 28:53</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.25">2 Kgs 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.3">25:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.9-10">Lam 4:9-10</a>). Disease often accompanied famine (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.37">1 Kgs 8:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.12">Jer 14:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.21.9">21:9</a>).</p>
<p>Famine brought changes to the lives of Naomi and Ruth (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.1">Ru 1:1</a>). God raised Joseph to a position of power in famine conditions. Famine also affected the lives of King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1">2 Sm 21:1</a>), Elijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-24">1 Kgs 17</a>), Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38">2 Kgs 4:38</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.25">6:25</a>), and Zedekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.2-3">25:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>Famine was used by God to warn (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>), correct (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1">2 Sm 21:1</a>), and punish his people or the heathen (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.12,15">Jer 14:12, 15</a>). The famines predicted by Jesus and the writer of the book of Revelation were signs of judgment (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.8">Mk 13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.8">Rv 18:8</a>).</p>

  <title>Fast, Fasting</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FAST, FASTING</p>
<p class="fl">Eating sparingly or abstaining from food altogether, either from necessity or desire. In medical terms, fasting is the detoxification of the body through the restriction of food.</p>
<p>Spiritual fasting entails setting aside activities as well as reducing the intake of food and replacing these activities with the exercise of prayer and preoccupation with spiritual concerns. The NT word that is translated “fasting” literally means one who has not eaten, one who is empty.</p>
<p>Three types of fast are generally recognized: <span class="ital">normal,</span> in which there is no intake of food for a prescribed period of time, though there may be an intake of liquids; <span class="ital">partial,</span> in which the diet is limited, though some food is allowed; and <span class="ital">absolute,</span> in which there is a total abstinence from food and liquids in all forms.</p>
<p>In the OT the fast was regarded as an act of self-renunciation designed to mollify God’s wrath and move him to act in gracious disposition. In times of emergency, the people fasted to persuade God to spare them from impending calamity (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.26">Jgs 20:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.6">1 Sm 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.9">1 Kgs 21:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.3">2 Chr 20:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.36.6,9">Jer 36:6, 9</a>). Individuals fasted in the hope that God would liberate them from trouble (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.16-20">2 Sm 12:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.27">1 Kgs 21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.13">Pss 35:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.10">69:10</a>). Fasting was accompanied by prayer (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.21">Ezr 8:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.1.4">Neh 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.12">Jer 14:12</a>).</p>
<p>Regular fasts were usually for one day, morning to evening, with food permitted at night (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.26">Jgs 20:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.24">1 Sm 14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.12">2 Sm 1:12</a>), although there are reports of longer fasts, such as Mordecai’s call for a three-day fast (night and day specified—<a href="?bref=Esth.4.16">Est 4:16</a>) and the seven-day fast at Saul’s death (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.13">1 Sm 31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.35">2 Sm 3:35</a>). Among special fasts were Moses’ 40 days on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.28">Ex 34:28</a>) and Daniel’s three-week fast prior to receiving visions (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.3">Dn 9:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.3,12">10:3, 12</a>).</p>
<p>In general, in the OT, fasting was abused. Instead of a sincere act of self-renunciation and submission to God, fasting became externalized as an empty ritual in which a pretense of piety was presented as a public image. Hence, the prophets cry out against the callousness of such hypocrisy. Jeremiah records the Lord as saying, “Though they fast, I will not hear their cry” (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.12">Jer 14:12</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.58.1-10">Is 58:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>The setting for the NT understanding of fasting lies in the development of the rabbinic tradition that grew out of the period between the Testaments, during which fasting became the distinguishing mark of the pious Jew, even though it was largely still ritualistic. Vows were confirmed by fasting (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.7.12">Tb 7:12</a>), remorse and penitence were accompanied by fasting (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.10.4">2 Esd 10:4</a>), and prayer was supported by fasting (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.47">1 Macc 3:47</a>). Special fast days were observed, some voluntarily imposed (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.13.12">2 Macc 13:12</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.5.13">2 Esd 5:13</a>).</p>
<p>This developed into a rabbinic tradition in which fasting was viewed as meritorious and therefore became the primary act of demonstrating piety. It was, however, a false piety consisting mostly in the externals of fastidious observance of fast days, both public and private. With the exception of ascetic groups such as the disciples of John the Baptist, the prevailing mood of fasting when Jesus appeared on the scene was one of mournful sadness, an obligatory necessity, a self-imposed requirement to produce the discipline of self-denial.</p>
<p>Jesus’ understanding of fasting is significant in that it represents a shift in the role of fasting. His initial attitude undoubtedly reflected the fact that he grew up participating in the regular fasts and therefore shared the prevailing teachings of his day. Yet his mature teaching about fasting breaks with the rabbinic tradition. Two accounts relating to Jesus and fasting are important: his fast as a part of his temptation in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.2">Mt 4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.2">Lk 4:2</a>), and his teaching about fasting in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.16-18">Mt 6:16-18</a>).</p>
<p>His temptation was born out of the context of struggle. Immediately after his baptism, he was cast out into the wilderness by the Spirit to face the temptation of Satan. In the midst of his temptation, he fasted and prayed, thereby showing his dependence upon God.</p>
<p>Jesus’ words about fasting in the Sermon on the Mount constitute a radically different approach to voluntary fasting. In condemning the type of fasting that seeks favor with men by an ostentatious display of outward piety, Jesus taught instead a robust faith that sought genuineness of relation to God through a pure heart. Jesus does not condemn fasting as such, nor does he forbid it. He does, however, give it a new meaning. Fasting is service to God.</p>
<p>This new understanding of fasting is set within the context of the dawning of the time of salvation. The Bridegroom is here. It is a time of joy, not of sorrow. Consequently, the prevailing mood of fasting as mournful stress and pretended piety is inconsistent with the mood of the new age that has begun.</p>
<p>Jesus’ teachings may be summarized: Fasting is transcended by the beginning of the eschatological times. The rule of the Messiah has broken the power of the evil age. Fasting would appear to be no longer consistent with the spirit of thanksgiving and joy that marks the framework of the new age, since the Christian life is not to be dominated by tragedy but by joy and happiness. Yet the kingdom is not fully realized. There is a place for fasting, properly understood. Fasting must be done within the context of the joyful thanksgiving of the new life in Christ. The context of fasting is prayer. It should conform to the same conditions as prayer: unostentatious quietness before God, arising out of gratitude, expressing thanksgiving, grounded in faith, as a means of spiritual growth.</p>

In the center is Lake Qarun, Egypt’s only large inland lake, which today covers 90 square miles (144.8 square kilometers), is about 17 feet (5.2 meters) deep, and has a surface 147 feet (44.8 meters) below the level of the Mediterranean Sea. Lake Qarun is surrounded by about a half million acres of farmland. In ancient times Qarun evidently was much larger than it is today.</p>
<p>Many ancient writers, following fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> Greek historian Herodotus, believed that the lake, which made the Fayum possible, was an artificial construction. But modern investigations have concluded that it was spring-fed. Sometime after 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>, during the Middle Kingdom period of Egypt, a canal was dug with sluice gates to connect Lake Qarun and the Nile River. Rulers during that period also constructed an irrigation system and brought much of the area under cultivation.</p>

<p>Prosperity of the Fayum declined when Ramses II and others used buildings of the area for stone quarries. The Ptolemies restored its prosperity during the third and second centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, when many Greek colonists arrived. In addition to exploration of the monuments of the Fayum, archaeologists have unearthed quantities of papyrus literature written in Greek. These papyri have helped to clarify the meaning of some words used in the NT.</p>

  <title>Fear</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FEAR</p>
<p class="fl">Emotional foreboding or dread of impending distress or misfortune. Often spoken of as the cause of people wanting religion. Yet fear alone can never account for true religion, since men are impelled to draw near unto God, the object of their worship. One does not desire to come close to the being one fears.</p>
<p>The biblical conception of fear embraces a much wider dimension than does our common English word, which simply denotes dread or terror. While this meaning forms an essential part of the scriptural picture, it is by no means the primary significance, especially when the fear of God—an awe-inspiring reverence—is referred to.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a legitimate place for the fear of God in the lower, anxious sense. We are told, “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.31">Heb 10:31</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus taught that we should fear God because he has the power to punish sin and consign people to utter destruction (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.4-5">Lk 12:4-5</a>). Fear has a constructive role to play in enabling men to realize both the degeneracy of their souls and their need of divine forgiveness. The first occurrence of such fear may be found in <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Genesis 3</a>, where Adam and Eve recoiled from the presence of the holy God whose commandment they had blatantly spurned. Their fear was entirely reasonable because they had been sternly warned that disobedience would incur a grave judgment. Fear is quite naturally the logical consequence of sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.10">Gn 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.4.13-14">4:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.28.1">Prv 28:1</a>). The Bible presents an array of people who are plagued with deep-reaching anxiety (e.g., Cain, Saul, Ahaz, and Pilate). Anxious fear seizes the wicked (<a href="?bref=Job.15.24">Jb 15:24</a>), surprises the hypocrite (<a href="?bref=Isa.33.14">Is 33:14</a>), and consumes evildoers (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.19">Ps 73:19</a>), whose faithless lives are characterized by fear (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">Rv 21:8</a>). Pharaoh’s mighty host was virtually paralyzed by fear as God moved against them (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.16">Ex 15:16</a>), and Job’s associate Bildad spoke of men driven to their knees by the judgments of God (<a href="?bref=Job.18.11">Jb 18:11</a>).</p>
<p>Fear has a tendency to either immobilize people or seriously affect their activity. This is especially true of the spiritually uncommitted. Saul’s fear of the people caused him to transgress the commandment of God (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.24">1 Sm 15:24</a>). The parents whose blind son was miraculously healed by Jesus were afraid to support Christ because they feared the Jews (<a href="?bref=John.9.22">Jn 9:22</a>). In the parable of the talents Jesus told of a man whose fear prevented him from doing his reasonable duty (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.25">Mt 25:25</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, by his atoning death, resurrection, and heavenly intercession for believers, is the unique liberator from fear. The apostle Paul encouraged the Romans (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.15">Rom 8:15</a>) by informing them that in their conversion to Christ they received the Holy Spirit, not as a spirit of fear and bondage, but as the spirit of adoption, whereby they could address God as “Abba” (the Aramaic word commonly used by Jewish children to address their fathers). This is the word by which our Lord Jesus addressed his heavenly Father and which Christians, by virtue of their adoption into the family of God, may also use in speaking to God (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.6">Gal 4:6</a>). Recipients of God’s love have received a dynamic force for casting out their anxieties (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.18">1 Jn 4:18</a>).</p>
<p>Unwarranted fear may harm the efforts of the people of God. Jeremiah was warned by God not to fear the faces of his opponents (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.8">Jer 1:8</a>) lest God allow calamity to befall him (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.17">17</a>). Similar calls to courage were given to Jeremiah’s contemporary, Ezekiel, and to a great many others (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.7-9">Jos 1:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.2.6">Ez 2:6</a>). We realize that even godly people are tempted to fear and may be temporarily overwhelmed (<a href="?bref=Ps.55.5">Ps 55:5</a>). Therefore, God repeatedly counsels his people not to succumb to that temptation (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.12">Is 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.1,27">Jn 14:1, 27</a>). He tells them to heap their anxieties upon the God of their redemption, whose care for his sheep is infinitely great (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.7">1 Pt 5:7</a>). Faith, then, is the indispensable antecedent of fearlessness as seen in the words of Isaiah: “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee” (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.3">Is 26:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The psalmists repeatedly stress the role of faith in conquering fear (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.1">Pss 37:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.46.2">46:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.7">112:7</a>).</p>
<p>Genuine faith is expressed in, and animated by, a reverential awe, and this is the basic meaning of the biblical idea of the fear of God. Unless there is personal awareness of the awesome and majestic sovereignty of God, it is impossible to have a meaningful faith existing in one’s heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.5.7">Pss 5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.7">89:7</a>). Though Christians are to be liberated from the fear of men (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.6">Heb 13:6</a>), death (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.15">2:15</a>), and life in general (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6-7">2 Tm 1:6-7</a>), they must never lose their sense of the awesomeness of God. Such awareness not only leads to true wisdom (<a href="?bref=Ps.111.10">Ps 111:10</a>) but also provides direction for the child of God throughout life (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.21">Eph 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.12">Phil 2:12</a>). Those who love God learn of wholesome fear by searching the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.3-5">Prv 2:3-5</a>), the Word of God, which the ancient Israelites were commanded to cleave to and obey as evidence of their reverence for God (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.2">Dt 6:2</a>). In <a href="?bref=Acts.10.2">Acts 10:2</a> Cornelius and his family were called “God-fearers” because of their high regard for the God of Israel and because they stood in awe of his person. True reverence for God must invariably express itself in good works and holy living (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.1">2 Cor 7:1</a>). This holy fear is actually a source of joy (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.11">Ps 2:11</a>) and a veritable fountain of life (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.27">Prv 14:27</a>). The fear of the Lord is more valuable than the greatest material riches (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.16">15:16</a>) because the Lord takes pleasure in those who hold him in such high regard (<a href="?bref=Ps.147.11">Ps 147:11</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">FEASTS AND FESTIVALS OF ISRAEL</p>
<p class="fl">Occasions of public or private rejoicing to commemorate some significant event or personage. The element of celebration has a special meaning in the cycle of religious occasions and the rites and ceremonies associated with these particular days. While the idea of a feast commonly implies a banquet with plenteous food and drink, this element is not indispensable. Sometimes there is only a token amount, as in the celebration of Holy Communion.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="AnnualFeastsAndFestivalsOfIsrael"/>
<p>In contemporary usage “festival” usually refers to activities extending over a period of time, while “feast” indicates one part of the celebration, often a meal. However, in religious usage, both ancient and modern, the two words are used interchangeably. The ancient Hebrews employed the words <span class="hebrew">mo’ed</span> (“seasons”) and <span class="hebrew">hag</span> for their great public celebrations, while feasts of a more private nature were commonly described by the term <span class="hebrew">mishteh</span><span class="ital">.</span> The majority of English translations of Scripture do not differentiate between these words.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FeastsandTheirFunctions">Feasts and Their Functions</p>
<p class="fl">Each festival places great emphasis on community participation and on the continuity of social or religious tradition, especially where the celebrations are elements of a regular civil or religious calendar. Without community backing, even in a family celebration, no festival can be successful. When there is communal participation, a festival can reinforce the individual and community memory of specific occasions, and can perpetuate that store of recollection over years and generations. Such shared memory has a cohesive effect upon a cooperating community, large or small, and serves to establish the traditions by which the group lives. If the festival commemorates a particular event or celebrates some lofty ideal, that theme becomes more firmly embedded in the minds of the participants by being associated repeatedly with the rites and ceremonies performed. The feasts of the ancient Hebrews had this positive function. The great festivals of their religious calendar commemorated specific occasions when God had reached out in power to intervene for his people or had provided for them in their distress. By celebrating these feasts on a regular basis, the Hebrews continually affirmed that their God had directed their destiny. Their repeated rehearsal of God’s help and love for them reminded them that he was still able to sustain them. Especially in times of hardship, it pointed to the reality of God’s presence and activity among them. Faith sustained by this means furnished an invaluable spiritual dimension to the life of the nation and provided a sense of continuity under divine provision and guidance. Only when corrupt or pagan elements were introduced into festive occasions did this important ingredient of national life begin to lose its vitality.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentFestivals">Old Testament Festivals</p>
<p class="h3">General Festivals</p>
<p class="fl">These occasions were surprisingly numerous in Israel, considering the rather austere mode of life reflected in much of the OT. No doubt such celebrations offset or compensated for the hardships and insecurities of existence in the ancient Near East, and the Israelites made the most of every opportunity. A wedding was one of the most obvious occasions for celebration, and it is not surprising that a feast was prepared for the marriage of Rachel and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.22">Gn 29:22</a>) in which the whole neighborhood participated. Just how long this particular feast lasted is unknown, but some marriage festivals continued for a week, as in the case of the marriage between Samson and the woman of Timnah (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.17">Jgs 14:17</a>). Wine that makes glad man’s heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.15">Ps 104:15</a>) was consumed freely on such occasions.</p>
<p>Birthdays were often observed in a festive spirit, especially where a royal person was concerned (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.20">Gn 40:20</a>). Solomon’s dream was commemorated with a feast provided for his servants (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.15">1 Kgs 3:15</a>), and when the temple was dedicated, the occasion was celebrated for a full week (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.65">8:65</a>). Kings and queens held feasts periodically to mark certain occasions or to express goodwill (cf. <a href="?bref=Esth.1.3">Est 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.18">2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.5.4,14">5:4, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.7.2,7">7:2, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.1">Dn 5:1</a>). Herdsmen traditionally made a feast for the shearing of the first sheep (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.4">Dt 18:4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Preexilic Festivals</p>
<p class="fl">In addition to the general festivals, which were frequently of a secular nature, communal feasts were prescribed for the Israelites that had a specifically spiritual significance. They were meant to emphasize the activity of God on behalf of his people and to remind them that continued divine blessing depended upon their obedience to his will. The catalog of festivals in <a href="?bref=Lev.23.2">Leviticus 23:2</a> began with an injunction to observe the Sabbath. The seventh day, in which God ceased from creating (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.3">Gn 2:3</a>), was holy, though it is difficult to determine the extent to which it was kept until the time of Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>). From that time on, Sabbath observance stressed refraining from all work so as to commemorate properly God’s own rest from creative activity (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.17">31:17</a>) and his deliverance of his people from bondage in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.12-15">Dt 5:12-15</a>). Sabbath celebration was the sign of a special relationship between God and the Israelites. During this 24-hour period, even trivial tasks like making a fire (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.3">Ex 35:3</a>) or gathering wood (<a href="?bref=Num.15.32-33">Nm 15:32-33</a>) were prohibited on pain of death. Journeys of any distance also came under the Sabbath ban (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.29">Ex 16:29</a>). Special offerings were part of the observance (<a href="?bref=Num.28.9-10">Nm 28:9-10</a>), and the bread of the Presence was replaced in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.5-8">Lv 24:5-8</a>). Despite the restrictions on activity, the Sabbath was meant to symbolize a time of happiness and security in the presence of God (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.58.13-14">Is 58:13-14</a>), since its observance would bring blessing to the individual and to the whole land.</p>
<p class="h4">Festival of the New Moon</p>
<p class="fl">The new moon was a monthly celebration based on the lunar calendar. It was especially appropriate for an agricultural people, since everyone could tell when the moon was new. Special offerings were prescribed for this festival, consisting of a burnt sacrifice, a grain offering, and a drink offering (<a href="?bref=Num.28.11-15">Nm 28:11-15</a>). In addition, a male goat was sacrificed to God as a sin offering, and trumpet blasts were sounded over the sacrificial offerings as a memorial before God (<a href="?bref=Num.10.10">10:10</a>). The sacrifices prescribed for the new moon festival were significantly greater than those required in <a href="?bref=Num.28.9-10">Numbers 28:9-10</a> for the weekly Sabbath.</p>
<p>This lunar feast was popular throughout Israelite history. During the monarchy, the Levites were required to assist the Aaronic priests at the new moon festival, as well as on the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.29-31">1 Chr 23:29-31</a>). The preexilic prophets may well have taken advantage of the large gatherings to give guidance to the people or proclaim prophetic oracles (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.23">2 Kgs 4:23</a>), though to what extent this was done is uncertain. Not everyone found the period of rest and celebration valuable, however, and Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.8.5">Am 8:5</a>) complained about those avaricious Israelites who felt that such observances interfered with the business of making a living. The feast could not be observed when the Judeans were in exile in Babylonia (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.2.11">Hos 2:11</a>), but under Ezra and Nehemiah, its observance was restored (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.33">Neh 10:33</a>). In <a href="?bref=Isa.66.22-23">Isaiah 66:22-23</a> it was related to Israel’s final destiny and was an accepted part of the ordinances for Ezekiel’s ideal temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.45.17">Ez 45:17</a>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the festival was to enhance the unity of national life by reminding the Israelites that God’s covenant with their ancestors was permanent and still binding upon the nation. It also stressed the loving nature and providence of a God who could begin such a relationship and carry out his promises with complete faithfulness (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.104.19">Ps 104:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Festival of Trumpets</p>
<p class="fl">The Festival of Trumpets was celebrated on the first day of the seventh new moon. This month, subsequently named Tishri, was especially holy, and for this reason was governed by certain regulations different from those of ordinary new moon festivals. The trumpets were blown on the first day (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.24">Lv 23:24</a>) as the animal and cereal sacrifices were offered. From <a href="?bref=Num.29.2-6">Numbers 29:2-6</a> it appears that the offerings required for this particular feast exceeded those prescribed for normal Sabbath sacrifice, but were somewhat less than those required for the regular new moon festival (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.28.11">Nm 28:11</a>). This feast was to be observed as a day of solemn rest and as a holy convocation, and the trumpets were sounded as a triumphant memorial to God’s great provision for his people through the Sinai covenant.</p>
<p>The seventh month was particularly sacred, partly because of its place in the hallowed cycle of sevens, but also because the Day of Atonement (or Yom Kippur) and the Feast of Tabernacles, or Booths (Shelters), occurred during this period. The latter feast followed the Day of Atonement by some five days (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.33">Lv 23:33</a>), and its joyful character served to offset somewhat the solemnity of the annual penitential occasion when the nation confessed its collective sins and saw them banished symbolically into the wilderness as the scapegoat was driven from the congregation.</p>
<p class="h4">The Sabbatical Year</p>
<p class="fl">Another festival closely connected with the institution of the Sabbath was the sabbatical year. At the end of each cycle of six years, the following 12 months were observed as a “sabbath of rest for the land.” During this interval, the ground was to lie fallow (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.11">Ex 23:11</a>) without any form of cultivation, and whatever sprouted and grew from it naturally was assigned to the poor and needy (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.6">Lv 25:6</a>). This provision for the land itself constituted one of the most important ecological principles of Scripture. Like God’s people, the land was holy, and just as they needed to have regular intervals of rest from daily work in order to regain their energy and spiritual vitality through worship, so the ground needed to rest and recuperate from the strain of constant cultivation. The festival reminded the Israelites that the land on which they lived had been given to them by God in fulfillment of his covenant undertaking to provide richly for their physical needs (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.8.7-10">Dt 8:7-10</a>). To keep the Israelites from experiencing any shortages or other hardships during the Year of Sabbath, God promised that in the year immediately preceding the sabbatical period, the land would bear fruit to suffice for the next three years (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.21">Lv 25:21</a>). This assurance was based upon the experience of the wilderness wanderings, when on the sixth day of the week sufficient manna appeared to last through the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.5">Ex 16:5</a>).</p>
<p>In this festival period, God’s absolute claim over the land was reaffirmed (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.25.23">Lv 25:23</a>), and the faith of the nation in God’s ability to provide for future needs was reinforced. The provisions that freed the land for a year from agricultural bondage were paralleled in the seventh year of rest by those requiring liberation of slaves and debtors. These underprivileged members of society were to be released from their obligations of servitude. As a result, men and women who had become slaves for one reason or another were given personal liberty (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.2-6">Ex 21:2-6</a>), and under proclamation of the Lord’s release, the provisions applying to debt were rescinded (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.1-6">Dt 15:1-6</a>). The sabbatical year seems to have been a regular part of preexilic Israelite life, although some abuses were noted in <a href="?bref=Jer.34.8-22">Jeremiah 34:8-22</a>. There the prophet took advantage of the opportunity presented to instruct the people in the nature and purpose of the sabbatical year ordinance. He also warned the wayward Judeans that because they had disobeyed the commands of God in denying proper liberty to their slaves, they would have their own freedom taken away in a far more serious manner by being carried captive to Babylonia after seeing their land destroyed. The lesson was not lost upon those who returned from exile, for under the administration of Nehemiah, the Jews bound themselves by a covenant to observe the principle of the sabbatical year (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.31">Neh 10:31</a>). This undertaking evidently took its impetus from the reading of the law of Moses at the Feast of Booths (Shelters), which coincidentally occurred at the beginning of the sabbatical year (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.13-18">Neh 8:13-18</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Jubilee</p>
<p class="fl">Still another feast based on the principle of the sabbath was the Year of Jubilee, or Pentecostal year (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.8-55">Lv 25:8-55</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.27.17-24">27:17-24</a>). As the sabbatical year was related to the concept of the seventh day, so the Pentecostal (50th) year marked the completion of a cycle of seven sabbatical years. The commencement of a jubilee year was proclaimed on the Day of Atonement throughout the land by means of trumpet blasts (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.9">Lv 25:9</a>). The activities that took place during the Pentecostal year were similar to those prescribed for the sabbatical year. A special feature was that land that had been sold during the preceding 49 years was returned to its original owners, a procedure that sometimes involved financial adjustments. To prevent abuse of the process through opportunism or speculation, the Hebrews were instructed to deal fairly and honestly with one another in the fear of God, who was the real owner of the land (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.14-17">Lv 25:14-17</a>). As with the sabbatical year, God promised to make provision before the jubilee year so that no one would suffer hardship. It was during the Year of Jubilee that those who were slaves in Hebrew households were given their liberty, so that everyone in the land would commence a new cycle of sabbatical years on the same footing, as free persons under God.</p>
<p class="h3">Seasonal Festivals</p>
<p class="fl">Three annual festivals that followed the seasons of the year rather than phases of the moon furnished important occasions for commemorating God’s power and provision in national life. These festivals were designated by the term <span class="hebrew">hag</span><span class="ital">,</span> indicating a festival usually observed by some sort of pilgrimage. These three festivals were prescribed in <a href="?bref=Exod.23.14-17">Exodus 23:14-17</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.16.16">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>, and consisted of the Feast of Passover and Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost), and the Festival of Booths (Tabernacles). On these occasions, all the males of Israel were commanded to make pilgrimage to the sanctuary and celebrate these festivals (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.14">Ex 12:14</a>). The Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were originally separate ordinances, but since the latter always followed immediately upon the Passover rite, they naturally blended into a single festival.</p>
<p class="h4">Passover</p>
<p class="fl">The Passover was of supreme theological significance for the Israelites, since it marked one of the most momentous acts of divine intervention in their history, the beginning of their deliverance from bondage in Egypt when, in the final plague, God destroyed the firstborn of the Egyptians but spared those Israelites whose homes had blood smeared on the doorposts (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.11-30">Ex 12:11-30</a>). God commanded that the day was to be observed as a memorial feast (v <a href="?bref=Exod.12.14">14</a>), and the next Passover celebration occurred in the Sinai Desert (<a href="?bref=Num.9.1-5">Nm 9:1-5</a>). In the Hebrew calendar the Passover festival came in the first month, called Abib in <a href="?bref=Deut.16.1">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>, but known after the exile as Nisan (cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">Neh 2:1</a>). The Passover rite took place the 14th evening (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.5">Lv 23:5</a>), and this was followed by a seven-day period during which nothing leavened was to be eaten. The principle for removing all leaven from bread was similar to that underlying the draining of blood from animal flesh. Both leaven and blood had quickening power and were to be kept separate as an offering to God. The first and seventh days of this period were marked by a holy assembly, during which the only work permitted was the preparation of food (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.16">Ex 12:16</a>). This period when unleavened bread was eaten was described as a festival because it opened the seven-week period of grain harvest (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.9">Dt 16:9</a>). During this feast, special burnt sacrifices were offered, followed with a sheaf of newly harvested barley at the Feast of Firstfruits. By NT times the festivals of Passover and Unleavened Bread were well-attended celebrations and were known as the “days of unleavened bread” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.1">Lk 22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.3">Acts 12:3</a>). The theme of Israel’s deliverance from the power of Egypt by divine intervention assured the Israelites that God was always ready to act on behalf of a faithful and obedient covenant people. It also reminded them that they had once been slaves (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.12">Dt 16:12</a>). In Israelite life the early Passover and Unleavened Bread observances were comparatively simple in character, but during the monarchy more elaborate Passover rituals came into use (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.21-23">2 Kgs 23:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.1-19">2 Chr 35:1-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Pentecost</p>
<p class="fl">The second great festival, Pentecost (or Weeks) lasted one day only and was observed on the 50th day after the newly harvested barley sheaf had been waved before the Lord at the end of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.9-12">Dt 16:9-12</a>). The festival marked the end of the barley harvest and the beginning of the wheat harvest, the beginning of the period when firstfruits could be offered (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.23.16">Ex 23:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.22">34:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.26">Nm 28:26</a>). The feast day was marked by the presentation of two wheat-flour loaves along with sacrifices of seven lambs, two rams, and a bull (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.15-20">Lv 23:15-20</a>). Freewill gifts to God were presented to reflect gratitude for his blessings, and the entire occasion was one of communal rejoicing (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.10-11">Dt 16:10-11</a>). Since Pentecost was essentially a harvest festival (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.16">Ex 23:16</a>), the Israelites were called on to recognize that they depended entirely upon God for their material prosperity. In <a href="?bref=Deut.26.1-19">Deuteronomy 26</a>, specific instructions were given for the ritual of presenting firstfruits from the harvest. It comprised a great confession of faith set within the framework of Israel’s history, and it recounted God’s deliverance of the nation from Egyptian oppression and his provision of a land that could amply supply the needs of his people.</p>
<p class="h4">Festival of Tabernacles</p>
<p class="fl">This festival, known variously as the Feast of Booths, Tabernacles, Shelters (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.34">Lv 23:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.13">Dt 16:13</a>), or Ingathering (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.22">Ex 34:22</a>), was the third great occasion that all Hebrew males were required to observe annually. It began on the 15th day of the seventh month (Tishri), shortly after the observance of the Day of Atonement, which fell on the 10th day. The Feast of Booths lasted for one week and involved pilgrimage. It was associated initially with the end of the year (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.22">Ex 34:22</a>), when the agricultural work had been completed. The first day was marked by a symbolic cessation from all activity, after which burnt offerings were presented to the Lord. The eighth day was also one on which the congregation of Israel abstained from manual work and again offered burnt sacrifices. <a href="?bref=Lev.23.39-43">Leviticus 23:39-43</a> furnished details for the rituals that gave the festival its special name of booths or shelters or tabernacles. The fruit of “goodly trees” was to be gathered on the first day of the feast, along with palm fronds, willow branches, and boughs from trees in full leaf. From these, rough shelters or booths were to be constructed in which the people lived for the week of the feast. Every seventh year the observances were marked by a public recital of the covenant provisions to which the Israelites under Moses had committed themselves, a procedure designed to keep fresh in their minds the obligations as well as the blessings of the covenant relationship. A particularly significant observance of the Feast of Tabernacles took place in the time of Ezra, when the Judean community returned from Babylon—a celebration of a kind unknown for centuries (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.13-18">Neh 8:13-18</a>). From the context it appears that observance of the feast had lapsed during the monarchy. The feast at Shiloh where Hannah was mistaken for a drunken woman and the feast referred to in <a href="?bref=Judg.21.19">Judges 21:19</a> were evidently the Feast of Booths. In a prophetic vision in which he saw all nations coming to Jerusalem to observe the Festival of Booths, Zechariah warned that those who did not continue this tradition could expect hardship and shortages of food (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.16-19">Zec 14:16-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Postexilic Festivals</p>
<p class="fl">There are a few minor festivals that were created in the period after the Jews returned from exile; some of these festivals had their origin in specific historical occasions.</p>
<p class="h4">The Festival of Purim</p>
<p class="fl">The Festival of Purim, also known as the Festival of Lots, was a joyful occasion occurring on the 14th day of the 12th month (Adar). It celebrated the way in which Esther and Mordecai were used by God to deliver his people in the Persian Empire from extermination by Haman (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.21,24-28">Est 9:21, 24-28</a>). The feast was observed on the 14th day of Adar by those living in villages, and on the 15th by the inhabitants of walled towns and cities. The explanation of the name of the festival is given in <a href="?bref=Esth.9.24-26">Esther 9:24-26</a>, and its observance reminded the Hebrews of God’s ability to save them during a time of anti-Semitic activity in Persia. The deliverance memorialized in this festival has consoled the Jews on other occasions when they have suffered persecution. Traditionally the scroll of Esther was read aloud in the synagogue on the evening before the feast, and there was a great outcry, especially among the children present, whenever the names of the hated Haman and his sons were mentioned.</p>
<p class="h4">Festival of the Dedication of the Temple</p>
<p class="fl">Another joyous festival that lasted for eight days was the Feast of the Dedication of the Temple (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.52-59">1 Macc 4:52-59</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.6-8">2 Macc 10:6-8</a>), familiar to modern readers as Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights. The specific dedication that prompted the feast occurred in 164 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Judas Maccabeus reconsecrated the temple in Jerusalem after it had been defiled by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The celebrations commenced on the 25th day of the ninth month (Kislev) and were marked at night by blazing lights and lanterns. The stories of brave opposition by the Maccabees to the crushing forces of paganism were recounted, and the feast was one of praise to God for his marvelous deliverance of the Jews during the Maccabean period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentFestivals">New Testament Festivals</p>
<p class="fl">In Christ’s time the Sabbath was observed rigorously and was the occasion for synagogue worship (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.4.16">Lk 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.14">Acts 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">18:4</a>). Pharisaic law prohibited all work, and Jesus came into conflict with the authorities periodically for breaches of the Sabbath regulations (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-4">Mt 12:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.1-5">Mk 3:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.10-17">Lk 13:10-17</a>). In the primitive church, worship occurred on “the first day of the week” (i.e., Sunday) to commemorate Christ’s resurrection. The early Christians initially participated in Jewish ceremonies (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.20.16">Acts 20:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.8">1 Cor 16:8</a>). It was during the Feast of Pentecost, after Christ’s resurrection and ascension, that the Spirit was poured out (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-4">Acts 2:1-4</a>), fulfilling <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Joel 2:28-32</a> and commencing the history of the Christian church as such.</p>
<p>The Passover and Feast of Unleavened Bread were of great significance in the life of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=John.4.45">Jn 4:45</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.4">6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.1-26">12:1-26</a>), for the occasion was a very popular one in NT times (cf. <a href="?bref=John.12.20">12:20</a>). On the Passover, Pilate had instituted the custom of clemency to a prisoner nominated by the populace (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.15">Mt 27:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.6">Mk 15:6</a>). Jesus participated actively in the Passover rituals (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.2.42">Lk 2:42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.13">Jn 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.4">6:4</a>). The Last Supper with his disciples occurred just prior to the Passover (<a href="?bref=John.13.1">Jn 13:1</a>), when Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus to the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.4-6">Lk 22:4-6</a>). The breaking of bread and the drinking of wine at that Passover celebration (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-25">Mk 14:22-25</a>) were related directly to Christ’s forthcoming death on the cross in a sacramental manner. Christ’s disciples were instructed to observe this rite as a memorial of his suffering and death for human sin (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.24-26">1 Cor 11:24-26</a>) and as a proclamation of the power of the cross until the Lord returns in glory. Some scholars have suggested that Christ was actually hanging on the cross when the Passover lamb was being slaughtered, and if that chronology is correct, it would represent Jesus graphically as the “Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">Jn 1:29</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus was also present once when the Feast of Tabernacles was celebrated (<a href="?bref=John.7.10">7:10</a>). In his day water was carried in procession from the pool of Siloam as an offering to God, and the ceremony most probably prompted Christ’s discourse on living water and eternal life (vv <a href="?bref=John.7.37-39">37-39</a>). On at least one occasion Jesus was in Jerusalem when the Festival of Lights occurred (<a href="?bref=John.10.22">Jn 10:22</a>) and narrowly missed death by stoning.</p>
<p>Jesus was entertained occasionally at private feasts (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.5.29">Lk 5:29</a>), and once remedied an emergency situation when the wine ran out at a wedding ceremony (<a href="?bref=John.2.8-10">Jn 2:8-10</a>). He was critical of the Pharisees for securing the chief seats at feasts (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.6">Mt 23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.39">Mk 12:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.46">Lk 20:46</a>) and taught that festivals ought to benefit the poor (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.13">Lk 14:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="SymbolismofFeasts">Symbolism of Feasts</p>
<p class="fl">Many aspects of the ancient Hebrew feasts were interpreted symbolically in the early church. Paul regarded the earliest Hebrew Christians as the firstfruits of the Israel of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.16">Rom 11:16</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Romans 8:23</a>, the Holy Spirit as possessed by Christians was regarded as only a token of what was to come, and as such was the firstfruit of the Spirit. Christians themselves were described in <a href="?bref=Jas.1.18">James 1:18</a> as the firstfruits of God’s creatures who were brought forth by the Word of Truth. The resurrection of Jesus was considered by Paul to be the firstfruits of those who slept (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20,23">1 Cor 15:20, 23</a>). In an allusion to OT festivals, Paul spoke of the Sabbaths, new moons, and feasts as merely being a shadow of good things to come (<a href="?bref=Col.2.16-17">Col 2:16-17</a>). The Passover was used figuratively to emphasize that Christ our Passover Lamb had been sacrificed for us. Believers were urged to keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, and not with the old leaven of malice and evil (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7-8">1 Cor 5:7-8</a>).</p>

  <title>Felix, Antonius</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FELIX, Antonius</p>
<p class="fl">Roman procurator (governor) of Judea (<span class="era">AD</span> 52–60) succeeding Cumanus, appointed by Claudius and succeeded by Festus Porcius. Felix’s brother, Pallas, a prominent, more influential Roman, interceded on his behalf after he was recalled from his procuratorship by Nero. During his oppressive rule, Felix utilized the aid of robbers to have Jonathan, the high priest, murdered. His tyranny has been cited as the cause for the Jewish revolt that broke out six years after he was recalled. Felix had three wives: one unknown, another the granddaughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, and another the Jewish sister of Agrippa II, whose name was Drusilla. At the age of 16 Drusilla left her husband, King Azizus of Emesa, to marry Felix. She later bore him a son, Agrippa.</p>
<p>Felix was serving as governor when the apostle Paul was brought before him in Caesarea to answer charges against him after the riot in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.24-24.27">Acts 23:24–24:27</a>). After a five-day delay, Tertullus, spokesman for the Jews, and others arrived to state their charges. Felix put off a decision until he could hear from Lysias, the tribune. In the meantime Paul was placed in limited custody. Felix hoped to obtain bribe money for his release. As a result, Paul was detained for two years, during which time he and Felix often conversed. The apostle’s message of “justice, self-control, and future judgment” alarmed Felix greatly (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.25">24:25</a>). Record of his life after being recalled by Nero is not available.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Fellowship">
  <title>Fellowship</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FELLOWSHIP</p>
<p class="fl">Communion with God, which results in common participation with other believers in the Spirit of God and God’s blessings.</p>
<p>In the beginning Adam was placed in the Garden to enjoy friendship and communion with God. When Adam and Eve chose to assert their own autonomy rather than live under the Creator’s gracious care, the fellowship was broken. As a result, Adam and Eve hid themselves from the Lord’s presence (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8">Gn 3:8</a>). Yet God immediately sought them out and revealed his plan for the ultimate restoration of sinners through the work of the Redeemer (v <a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">15</a>).</p>
<p>The OT tells how God began to draw a special people into fellowship with himself. Enoch is described as a man who walked with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.22,24">Gn 5:22, 24</a>). Noah, likewise, walked in communion with the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.9">6:9</a>). And Abraham, the father of Israel, is called “the friend of God” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.23">Jas 2:23</a>). No OT person had deeper fellowship with God than did Moses during his 40-day encounter with the Lord on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-18">Ex 24</a>). Later in Israel’s history, David wrote psalms that reflect a heart vitally in tune with the living God (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">Pss 16</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.63.1-11">63</a>).</p>
<p>As a result of Christ’s finished work on the cross, God now makes his permanent abode in each believer’s heart (<a href="?bref=John.14.23">Jn 14:23</a>). As a result, the fellowship that now prevails under the new covenant is nothing less than the vital, spiritual union of the believer with Christ (vv <a href="?bref=John.14.20-21">20-21</a>). Fellowship with God is the goal of the Christian life (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.3">1 Jn 1:3</a>), and this relationship will be perfected forever when we see our Savior “face to face” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.12">1 Cor 13:12</a>), when God dwells with his people in eternity (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.3">Rv 21:3</a>).</p>
<p>The gospel restores fellowship not only with God but also among believers. Jesus’ Last Supper with his disciples illustrates the relationship between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of fellowship (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-25">Mk 14:22-25</a>). In the upper room, Jesus shared with his disciples a sacred love feast. The hearts of the Lord and his followers were knit together by a deep sense of love and commitment. Later, the disciples discovered that their own hearts were strongly united out of their common loyalty to Jesus. Following the cross and the outpouring of the Spirit, the church was born—that new society of people in fellowship with God and with one another.</p>
<p>The depth of camaraderie among the first Christians is portrayed in the early chapters of Acts. The believers met together in house groups for teaching, fellowship, the Lord’s Supper, and prayer (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.42,46">Acts 2:42, 46</a>). So profound was their sense of togetherness that the Christians pooled their possessions and distributed them to brothers and sisters in need (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.44-45">2:44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.32-35">4:32-35</a>). Perhaps the dominant characteristic of this early Christian fellowship was the love among the believers (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.9">1 Thes 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.22">1 Pt 1:22</a>).</p>
<p>Motivated by love, Paul organized among the gentile churches a collection for poor believers in Jerusalem. In <a href="?bref=Rom.15.26">Romans 15:26</a>, which speaks of the gifts of the churches in Macedonia and Achaia, the word translated “contribution” is the common Greek word for “fellowship.” Similarly, the fellowship that the Philippian church shared with Paul assumed the form of gifts to support the apostle’s ministry (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.5">Phil 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.14-15">4:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>Scripture uses several images to describe the spirit of togetherness that characterized the early church. The first is “the household of God” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.19">Eph 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.15">1 Tm 3:15</a>), or “the household of faith” (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.10">Gal 6:10</a>). In God’s household, love and hospitality are to be the rule (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.1-2">Heb 13:1-2</a>). Further, the church is depicted as the family of God on earth (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.15">Eph 3:15</a>). God is the Father, and believers are his faithful sons and daughters. The life of God’s family is to be governed by love, tenderness, compassion, and humility (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-4">Phil 2:1-4</a>). Finally, the Christian fellowship is represented as the “one new man” or the “one body” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.15-16">Eph 2:15-16</a>). In spite of great natural diversity in the body, the Holy Spirit binds believers together into a single organism (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.4-6">4:4-6</a>). In this fellowship of love, no believer is insignificant. Each member has been endowed with gifts for the spiritual edification of the entire body.</p>
<p>Scripture lays down the basis of fellowship in <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 John 1:7</a>: “If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus Christ, then, is the source and fount of all spiritual communion. Only when rightly related to the Lord do we experience true fellowship with another Christian. Just as light and darkness are incompatible, so a believer can have no real fellowship with an unbeliever. Neither can the Christian be in fellowship with one who walks contrary to the teaching of Christ (<a href="?bref=2Jn.1.9-11">2 Jn 1:9-11</a>), or a professing brother who is immoral, idolatrous, a drunkard, or a thief (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.11">1 Cor 5:11</a>).</p>
<p>Scripture lays down several guidelines for enhancing the communion of believers in the body: (1) Love one another with the same compassion that Christ displayed to his own (<a href="?bref=John.13.34-35">Jn 13:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.12">15:12</a>). The law of the fellowship should be the rule of love (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.1">Heb 13:1</a>). (2) Cultivate that spirit of humility that seeks the other person’s honor (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.3-5">Phil 2:3-5</a>). (3) Lighten fellow believers’ loads by bearing one another’s burdens (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.2">Gal 6:2</a>). (4) Share material blessings with brothers and sisters in need (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.13">2 Cor 9:13</a>). (5) Tenderly correct a sinner while helping to find solutions to the problems (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.1">Gal 6:1</a>). (6) Succor a fellow believer in times of suffering (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.26">1 Cor 12:26</a>). (7) Pray for one another in the Spirit without ceasing (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.18">Eph 6:18</a>). The Christian will want to seriously regard the saying of an anonymous saint, “You cannot draw nigh to God if you are at a distance from your brother.”</p>

  <title>Festus, Porcius</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FESTUS, Porcius</p>
<p class="fl">Roman procurator (governor) of Judea, who succeeded Felix Antonius and who was succeeded by Albinus. The precise date of Porcius Festus’s accession to power is debatable but has been narrowed to sometime between <span class="era">AD</span> 55 and 60. The only sources mentioning Festus are the book of Acts and the writings of Josephus, a Jewish historian who lived in Rome in the first century <span class="era">AD</span> (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.8.9-11; 9.1).</p>
<p>Josephus wrote that Festus ruled wisely and justly, in contrast to Felix and Albinus. Sicarii bandits (named after the small swords they carried) who had terrorized the Palestinian countryside were eliminated under Festus’s rule. In spite of this, he could not reverse the damage incurred by his predecessor, Felix, who had aggravated the conflict between pagans and Jews.</p>
<p>The NT recounts that the new procurator Festus traveled from Caesarea (where Paul was in custody) to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1">Acts 25:1</a>). The Jewish leaders confronted him there and brought charges against Paul. Upon returning to Caesarea, Festus heard Paul’s defense (v <a href="?bref=Acts.25.6">6</a>). He granted the apostle’s appeal to be heard by Caesar (the right of any Roman accused of a capital offense) in an effort to avoid further religious disputes in his jurisdiction (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.25.11-12">11-12</a>). When King Agrippa arrived a few days later, Festus was in a quandary, unable to understand the Jews’ charges against Paul (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.25.25-27">25-27</a>). After Paul’s address before the king, Festus loudly declared him to be mad (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.24">26:24</a>), though still agreeing that Paul had done nothing to deserve death or imprisonment (v <a href="?bref=Acts.26.31">31</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Bronze symbol of a snake made by Moses on God’s instruction to save the Israelites.</p>
<p>Deadly snakes were sent by God to punish the Israelites for their rebellious grumblings, many of whom died from the poisonous bites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Nm 21:4-9</a>). Recognizing their sin, they cried out to God for deliverance, and he instructed Moses to make a fiery (bronze) serpent and set it on a pole. Healing was granted to those who gazed at the uplifted figure.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ referred to the bronze serpent incident as a symbol of the saving power of his crucifixion. A person who looks in faith to the uplifted Christ will receive deliverance from sin and have eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-15">Jn 3:14-15</a>). The apostle Paul also drew upon the OT event as a warning to those who might arrogantly test God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.9">1 Cor 10:9</a>).</p>

  <title>Firmament*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FIRMAMENT*</p>
<p class="fl">Bible word for the atmosphere about the earth. The original meaning of this word refers to space that is stretched out or expanded. The Hebrews probably considered the “firmament” as voidlike sky where the clouds, sun, and moon were.</p>
<p>During the second day of Creation, God created the atmosphere, or firmament, above the earth. He did this to divide the waters under it from the waters above it. God called the firmament heaven (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.6-8">Gn 1:6-8</a>). The atmospheric firmament serves as a supportive area in which the heavenly bodies exist and function according to the purposes for which God made them. On the fourth day of Creation, God created the lights in the firmament. They were to distinguish night and day as well as be signs of the different seasons. The greater light in the firmament, the sun, controlled the days, whereas the lesser light, the moon, controlled the nights (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.1.14-19">14-19</a>).</p>
<p>The term “firmament” is mentioned twice in the Psalms as the place of God’s handiwork (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">Pss 19:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1">150:1</a>). Also occurring in the books of Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.22-26">Ez 1:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1">10:1</a>) and Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.3">Dn 12:3</a>), the firmament is always related to Creation.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Firstborn">
  <title>Firstborn</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FIRSTBORN</p>
<p class="fl">Term used in the Bible to describe a family’s oldest son or daughter (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.21">Gn 22:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.29.26">29:26</a>). Israel was called God’s firstborn because of that nation’s miraculous beginning and special deliverance out of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5,15-16">Gn 17:5, 15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.4.22">Ex 4:22</a>). As God’s firstborn, Israel had unique privileges over all other nations. Gentiles were “blessed” only in relation to their kindness to Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gn 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.5-8">Dt 4:5-8</a>). The prophet Isaiah foresaw a day when Israel would have a double portion of inheritance (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.7">Is 61:7</a>). Thus, being firstborn implies priority or preeminence, as well as an inheritance.</p>
<p>The expression “first-born of the poor,” (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.30">Is 14:30</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) means one who is supremely poor, the poorest of the poor. Another figurative expression, “first-born of death” (<a href="?bref=Job.18.13">Jb 18:13</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), implied that Job’s disease was fatal.</p>
<p>Because God delivered Israel’s firstborn sons from death in Egypt, he expected each firstborn to be sanctified to him (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.4-7">Ex 11:4-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.12">13:12</a>). The first male child was a representative of the entire offspring (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.3">Gn 49:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.22.29">Ex 22:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.13">Nm 3:13</a>). The firstborn of all animals used in sacrifice was to be sanctified to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.2,15">Ex 13:2, 15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="FirstbornandRedemption">Firstborn and Redemption</p>
<p class="fl">The firstborn of every tribe except Levi’s was to be redeemed by a sum not to exceed five shekels (<a href="?bref=Num.18.15-16">Nm 18:15-16</a>). Redemption implied a previous bondage and was to remind Israel of their redemption from bondage in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.2-8">Ex 13:2-8</a>).</p>
<p>The firstborn of ritually clean animals was devoted to the Lord. It was brought to the tabernacle (or later, the temple) within a year from the eighth day after birth. This animal was then sacrificed and its blood sprinkled on the altar. The meat of the sacrificed animal was for the priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.13">Ex 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.22.30">22:30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.18.17">Nm 18:17</a>). The firstborn of unclean animals could be redeemed with an addition of one-fifth of the value as determined by the priest. If not redeemed, these animals were sold, exchanged, or destroyed by the priests (<a href="?bref=Lev.27.27">Lv 27:27</a>). The colt of an ass was to be redeemed with a lamb (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.13">Ex 13:13</a>). If not redeemed, it was to be killed. Meat from unclean animals was not eaten.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FirstbornandBirthright">Firstborn and Birthright</p>
<p class="fl">The firstborn acted as priest of the family in the father’s absence or death. Esau and Reuben are both examples (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.19,32">Gn 27:19, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.1-2">1 Chr 5:1-2</a>). This position of the firstborn ceased when the priesthood was committed to Levi’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.3.12-13">Nm 3:12-13</a>). All the firstborn of succeeding generations had to be redeemed. The redemption money became part of the Levites’ yearly income (<a href="?bref=Num.8.17">8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.18.16">18:16</a>).</p>
<p>A double portion of the family inheritance was the right of the firstborn. This protected the firstborn when there was a polygamous marriage. The son of a favorite wife could not take the place of the first son born of the household (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>).</p>
<p>The title “firstborn” is applied to Christ (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.7">Lk 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.15,18">Col 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.6">Heb 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.5">Rv 1:5</a>). It stresses Christ’s preeminence over all because he was the first to rise from the dead. As firstborn, Christ is heir of all things (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">Heb 1:2</a>) and the head of the church (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.20-23">Eph 1:20-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.18,24">Col 1:18, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.10-12">Heb 2:10-12</a>).</p>

  <title>Firstfruits</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FIRSTFRUITS</p>
<p class="fl">Firstborn child or animal or first parts of any crop that, in Hebrew thought, were considered as holy and therefore belonged to the Lord. The firstfruits, as a foretaste of more to come, were offered to God in thanksgiving for his goodness in providing them.</p>
<p>Firstfruit offerings could include produce either in its natural state or prepared or processed in some way, such as dough, bread, wine, olive oil, and wool. The firstborn son and the firstborn of the animals that one owned were to be treated as belonging to God. The firstborn children and the firstborn of the unclean animals were “redeemed” (paid for) with money by the offerer, and the firstborn of the cows, sheep, and goats were offered in sacrifice to God (<a href="?bref=Num.18.14-17">Nm 18:14-17</a>).</p>
<p>Firstfruits of any kind were reserved for those whom God designated, namely, the priests. At least three times “the first of the firstfruits” is mentioned in the OT. This may be a reference to the first ripened of the firstfruits, or it may refer to the choicest of them. These offerings were especially designated for the priests and could be eaten by any of them who was ritually clean (<a href="?bref=Num.18.12-13">Nm 18:12-13</a>). For other references to the firstfruits, see <a href="?bref=Exod.23.15-19">Exodus 23:15-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.22,26">34:22, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.2.14">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.10-17">23:10-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.20-21">Numbers 15:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.26-31">28:26-31</a>; and <a href="?bref=Deut.26.1-11">Deuteronomy 26:1-11</a>.</p>
<p>The firstfruits were presented to God by bringing the offering to the priest at the tabernacle and, in later times, at the temple (<a href="?bref=Deut.26.2">Dt 26:2</a>). The priest took the offering, and on the first day of the week, with arms outstretched, waved it before the Lord. On the same day, the person presenting the firstfruits offered a male lamb as a burnt offering to the Lord, a grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil, and a drink offering of wine. Fifty days later another grain offering was to be made. Each family was to give two loaves of bread to the Lord as a special gift. These were also given with appropriate animal, grain, and drink offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.9-22">Lv 23:9-22</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the apostle Paul referred to Jesus Christ’s resurrection as the firstfruits of the resurrection of believers that will occur at Jesus’ return (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20,23">1 Cor 15:20, 23</a>). The Holy Spirit, who indwells all believers (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9">Rom 8:9</a>), is also said to be the firstfruits of the full redemption that is yet to come. “Firstfruits” is sometimes used of the first believers in a geographical area (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.5">Rom 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.15">1 Cor 16:15</a>). They were a kind of promise of a spiritual harvest to follow in that particular locality.</p>
<p>Christian believers are said to be firstfruits, referring to their being a unique and sacred possession of God out of all he has created (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.18">Jas 1:18</a>). Similarly, in the book of Revelation the 144,000 are said to have been redeemed from humanity as firstfruits belonging to God and to the Lamb, Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.4">Rv 14:4</a>).</p>

  <title>First Jewish Revolt*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FIRST JEWISH REVOLT*</p>
<p class="fl">Uprising in <span class="era">AD</span> 66–70, which occurred as the result of a series of ineffective Roman governors in Judea. After the last Jewish king, Agrippa I (the Herod of <a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-25">Acts 12</a>), died in <span class="era">AD</span> 44, the next 20 years were filled with persecution and humiliation for the Jews in Palestine. The unrest needed only a spark to flame into open revolt; the spark was provided by Florus, the Roman governor appointed in <span class="era">AD</span> 64. His demand for money from the temple treasury, and the slaughter and pillage by Roman soldiers, provoked the Jews into an uprising in the year 66.</p>
<p>Rebellion quickly spread throughout Palestine, accompanied by a general struggle between Jews and pagans in several eastern Mediterranean cities. The revolt in Palestine was led by the Zealots, a Jewish group that had long wanted the Romans to leave Palestine. After an initial Jewish victory at the pass of Beth-horon, the emperor Nero dispatched his most able general, Vespasian, to direct the operation of punishing the rebels. By the autumn of <span class="era">AD</span> 67, all of Galilee and other northern lands were back in Roman hands. In 67 and 68 further operations in Samaria and Judea left only four strongholds in Jewish control. At this point the Roman campaign slackened. Nero committed suicide in <span class="era">AD</span> 68, and after three short-lived emperors, General Vespasian gained control of the empire in <span class="era">AD</span> 69. His son Titus took command of the forces in Palestine and laid siege to Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>The Jews in the capital might have been better prepared had they taken advantage of the turmoil in Rome to consolidate their own position and resolve disputes among warring Jewish factions. As it was, the arrival of Titus with 80,000 soldiers forced them to unify for a last defense of the city.</p>
<p>The siege of the city lasted for five months. Jerusalem held out heroically against the advancing Romans, forcing a step-by-step conquest of the city. A tragic moment in Jewish history came early in August of <span class="era">AD</span> 70 when for the first time in centuries the morning and evening sacrifices were not offered at the temple. About 29 August, under circumstances still not clear, the sanctuary was put to the torch and the temple destroyed, thereby fulfilling Jesus’ prophecy (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-2">Mt 24:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-2">Mk 13:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.43-44">Lk 19:43-44</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.5-7">21:5-7</a>). For another month some resistance continued, but by the end of September, the conflict was over in the desolated city. In all, perhaps one million Jews were killed and 900,000 taken captive during the course of the revolt.</p>

<p class="fl">The body; the physical being of humans; the human person and human existence; the carnal nature of humans.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Term commonly used to designate the material stuff of the body, whether of people (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.19">Gn 40:19</a>) or of animals (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.27">Lv 6:27</a>). However, “flesh” is used in the OT with a variety of meanings. Sometimes it is used as equivalent for the whole body (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.30">Prv 14:30</a>), and the meaning is extended to designate the whole person (“my flesh also shall rest in hope,” <a href="?bref=Ps.16.9">Ps 16:9</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). This idea leads to the union of two different persons, man and wife as “one flesh” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>), and a man can say of his relatives, “I am your bone and your flesh” (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.2">Jgs 9:2</a>). The idea of flesh as the whole person leads to the expression “all flesh,” denoting the totality of humankind, sometimes including also the animal world.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most distinctive use of “flesh” in the OT is found in those passages where it designates human weakness and frailty over against God. “My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for he is flesh” (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In <a href="?bref=Ps.78.39">Psalm 78:39</a>, God attributes sin to the fact that men are but flesh. In <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.8">2 Chronicles 32:8</a> the arm of flesh of the king of Assyria (i.e., his weakness) is contrasted with the all-powerful God. The one who puts trust in God need not fear what “flesh” can do (<a href="?bref=Ps.56.4">Ps 56:4</a>), but the one who puts trust in human flesh instead of in God is under a curse (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.5">Jer 17:5</a>). In <a href="?bref=Isa.31.3">Isaiah 31:3</a> flesh is contrasted with spirit, as weakness is with strength.</p>
<p>However, nowhere in the OT is flesh viewed as sinful. Flesh is conceived as being created by God of the dust of the earth (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>), and as God’s creation, it is good.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Paul ascribes many—often unique—definitions to the word “flesh” (Greek <span class="greek">sarx</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as the Stuff of the Body</p>
<p class="fl">“Flesh” is frequently used to describe the tissues that constitute the body. There are different kinds of flesh—“of men,” “of animals,” “of birds,” “of fish” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.39">1 Cor 15:39</a>). Pain and suffering may be experienced in the flesh (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.7">2 Cor 12:7</a>). Circumcision is done in the flesh (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.28">Rom 2:28</a>). While “flesh” in such references is not sinful, it is corruptible and cannot inherit the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50">1 Cor 15:50</a>). Jesus’ body was also a body of flesh (<a href="?bref=Col.1.22">Col 1:22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as the Body Itself</p>
<p class="fl">By a natural transition, the part is used for the whole, and in many places “flesh” is synonymous with the body as a whole rather than designating the fleshy part of the body. Paul may thus speak either of being absent in the body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.3">1 Cor 5:3</a>) or in the flesh (<a href="?bref=Col.2.5">Col 2:5</a>). Paul can say that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our body or in our mortal flesh (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.10-11">2 Cor 4:10-11</a>). “He who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her. For, as it is written, ‘The two shall become one flesh’ ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.16">1 Cor 6:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as Person with Reference to Origin</p>
<p class="fl">Following OT usage, “flesh” was used by Paul to refer not merely to the stuff of the body or to the body itself, but concretely to the person as constituted by flesh. In this usage the word may refer to the person’s human relationship, the physical origin and the natural ties that bind one to other humans. Paul speaks of his kinsmen “according to the flesh,” his fellow Jews (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.3">Rom 9:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), and even uses “my flesh” (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.14">11:14</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) as a synonym for these kinsmen. The “children of the flesh” (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.8">9:8</a>) are those born by natural generation in contrast to those born as a result of divine intervention. Christ was descended from David according to the flesh (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.3">1:3</a>). The phrase does not designate the source merely of his bodily life but of his entire human existence, including both his body and his human spirit.</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as Human Existence</p>
<p class="fl">Another use of “flesh” simply designates human existence. As long as a person lives in the body, that one is “in the flesh.” Thus, Paul can speak of the life that he lives “in the flesh” as lived by faith in the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Referring to Jesus’ earthly ministry, Paul says that he abolished “in the flesh” the enmity between Jew and Gentile (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.15">Eph 2:15</a>). Peter has the same meaning when he speaks of Jesus having been put to death “in the flesh” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">1 Pt 3:18</a>). So also John: “Jesus Christ is come in the flesh” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2">1 Jn 4:2</a>). This usage is reflected most notably in the Johannine saying “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as Human Existence in Terms of Outward Presentation</p>
<p class="fl">“Flesh” also extends beyond humans in their bodily life to include other factors crucial to human existence. Thus, “confidence in the flesh” (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.3">Phil 3:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) does not mean confidence in the body but confidence in the whole complex of the outward realm of human existence. It includes Paul’s Jewish ancestry, his strict religious training, his zeal, and his prominence in Jewish religious circles. The phrase to “glory after the flesh” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.18">2 Cor 11:18</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) is rendered “boast about their human achievements” in the <span class="sc">nlt</span>. A good showing “in the flesh” is practically synonymous with worldly prominence (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.11-14">Gal 6:11-14</a>). The Judaizers insisted upon circumcision to promote a sense of prideful attainment in the religious life so that they might have a ground of glorying. But these external distinctions and grounds for glorying no longer appealed to Paul, because the world had been crucified to him and he to the world.</p>
<p>“Flesh” is also used of outward relationships, as when describing the social ties existing between slave and master (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.5">Eph 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.22">Col 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.16">Phlm 1:16</a>). “In the flesh” also describes the realm of marital relationships, which entails certain troublesome problems (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.28">1 Cor 7:28</a>).</p>
<p>This usage illuminates an otherwise difficult saying, “Henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.16">2 Cor 5:16</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The <span class="sc">rsv</span> correctly renders the phrase “from a human point of view.” The verse does not mean that Paul had heard and seen Jesus in Jerusalem at some previous time and had gained some acquaintance with Christ “after the flesh.” “After the flesh” modifies the verb “to know,” not the noun “Christ.” Before his conversion, Paul knew all people “after the flesh”; that is, he judged them by worldly, human standards. To know Christ “after the flesh” means to look at him through merely human eyes. As a Jew, Paul had felt that Jesus was a deluded messianic pretender. According to the Jewish understanding, the Messiah was to reign over the earth as a Davidic king, save his people Israel, and punish the hated Gentiles. But Paul surrendered this false human view and came to know Christ as he really is—the incarnate Son of God, the Savior of all who believe. As a Christian, Paul no longer judged others according to the flesh.</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as Fallen Humanity</p>
<p class="fl">When Paul says that “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50">1 Cor 15:50</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), he does not mean that humans cannot inherit the kingdom of God but rather that human fallenness cannot; as the next clause shows, “neither does corruption inherit incorruption.” The weak, fallen, corruptible body cannot inherit the kingdom of God; there must be a change; the “corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.53">1 Cor 15:53</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). This is not the salvation of the soul or spirit but the exchange of one kind of body for another that is suited to the final glorious kingdom of God.</p>
<p>When Peter confessed the messiahship of Jesus, Jesus replied, “Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Mt 16:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The meaning of this verse is obvious. This knowledge of Jesus’ messiahship was not a human deduction; it could be achieved only by divine revelation.</p>
<p class="h3">Flesh as Sinful Humanity</p>
<p class="fl">There remains a group of ethical references that are distinctly Pauline. The most important feature of this usage is that man is seen not only as fallen and weak before God, but as fallen and sinful. Flesh is contrasted with human spirit regenerated by the divine Spirit, and without the aid of the Spirit, one cannot please God. The most vivid passage is the first part of <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-39">Romans 8</a>, where Paul sharply contrasts those who are “in the flesh” with those who are “in the Spirit.” To be “in the Spirit” in this sense does not mean to be in a state of ecstasy but to be living one’s life in that spiritual realm that is controlled by the Spirit of God. Those who are “in the flesh,” that is, unregenerate, cannot please God. There are two contrasting and mutually exclusive realms: “in the flesh” and “in the Spirit.” To be “in the Spirit” means to be indwelt by God’s Holy Spirit, that is, to be a regenerate person.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rom.7.1-8.39">Romans 7–8</a> Paul makes it clear that the unregenerate person cannot please God by loving and serving him as God requires. Thus, the Law was unable to make mankind truly righteous, because the flesh is weak (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2">8:2</a>). To live after the flesh is death; to live after the Spirit is life (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.6">8:6</a>). Elsewhere Paul says, “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing” (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.18">7:18</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Flesh here cannot be the physical flesh, for the body of flesh is the temple of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">1 Cor 6:19</a>) and a member of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15">6:15</a>) and is to be the means of glorifying God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.20">6:20</a>). Paul, therefore, means that in his unregenerate nature there dwells none of the goodness that God demands.</p>
<p>While Paul makes a sharp and absolute contrast between being “in the flesh” (unregenerate) and “in the Spirit” (regenerate), when one becomes regenerate and comes to be “in the Spirit,” that person is no longer in the flesh, but the flesh is still in him. In fact, there remains in the believer a struggle between the flesh and the Spirit. Writing to people who are “in the Spirit,” Paul says, “For the flesh lusteth [strives] against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.17">Gal 5:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Because the Christian life is the battleground of these two opposing principles, it is impossible to be the perfect person that one would wish to be.</p>
<p>The same situation is reflected in <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14-3.3">1 Corinthians 2:14–3:3</a> where Paul describes three classes of people: the “natural” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14">2:14</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>); the “carnal,” that is, fleshly man (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.1,3">3:1, 3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>); and the “spiritual man” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.1">3:1</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The “natural man” is unregenerate. Those who are “in the flesh” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9">Rom 8:9</a>) have devoted the whole of their life to the human level and hence are unable to know the things of God. “Spiritual man” refers to those whose life is ruled by the Spirit of God, so that the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Gal 5:22-23</a>) are evident in their life. Between these two there is a third class—those who are “fleshly” yet who are babes in Christ. Therefore, they must be “in the Spirit,” yet they do not walk “according to the Spirit.” Because they are “babes in Christ,” the Spirit of God dwells in them, yet the Holy Spirit is not allowed to have full control over them, and they are still walking “like men” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.3">1 Cor 3:3</a>), manifesting the works of the flesh in jealousy and strife.</p>
<p class="h3">Works of the Flesh</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-23">Galatians 5:19-23</a> Paul contrasts the life in the flesh and the life in the Spirit: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-21">Gal 5:19-21</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The important thing to note about this list is that while some of these are sins of bodily and sexual appetite, others are religious sins—idolatry, witchcraft—and several are sins “of the spirit,” that is, of the disposition—hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife. The words “seditions” and “heresies” refer not to theological heresies but to a factious, divisive spirit. This proves conclusively that for Paul the “flesh” is not synonymous with the body but includes the whole person, with all the inner attitudes and disposition.</p>
<p class="h3">Victory over the Flesh</p>
<p class="fl">While a struggle remains in the Christian between the Spirit and the flesh, Paul knows of a way of victory for the Spirit. The flesh of the body comes within the sphere of sanctification (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">1 Thes 5:23</a>), but the flesh as the unregenerate human nature can only be put to death.</p>
<p>This is called the tension between the objective and the subjective. Because certain things have happened in Christ (objective), certain inevitable results should accrue (subjective). In Paul’s view, the flesh has already been put to death in the death of Christ. Those who belong to Christ have already crucified the flesh with its passions and desires (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.24">Gal 5:24</a>). Paul elsewhere says, “I have been crucified with Christ” (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">2:20</a>) and “our old self was crucified with him” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.6">Rom 6:6</a>). Such references make it clear that “flesh” and the “self” are in some ways to be identified. This identity is further supported in the teaching about crucifixion, for Paul means the same thing by the crucifixion of the flesh that he means when he says, “How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? We were baptized into his death. We are buried with him by baptism into death” (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-4">1-4</a>). It is I myself who have died with Christ.</p>
<p>This crucifixion and death of the flesh does not, however, work automatically. It is an event that must be appropriated by faith. This involves two aspects. First, believers are to recognize that the flesh has been crucified with Christ. “Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.11">Rom 6:11</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). One cannot consider the self dead with Christ to sin unless that person has actually died and been crucified with Christ, but because this has already happened at the moment of saving faith, it can be put into daily practice. Those who have died with Christ are to “mortify [put to death] the deeds of the body” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.13">8:13</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). “Body” is here used as a vehicle for the works of the “flesh”—the sensual life of the unregenerate nature. Those who have been brought from death into life are to yield their members to God as instruments of righteousness (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.13">6:13</a>). One who has died with Christ is to “mortify” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), that is, put to death what is earthly—fornication, uncleanness, covetousness (<a href="?bref=Col.3.5">Col 3:5</a>). Having already put off the old nature and put on the new, the believer is to put on compassion, kindness, lowliness and the like.</p>
<p>Victory over the flesh is sometimes described as walking in the Spirit. “Walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.16">Gal 5:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.4">Rom 8:4</a>). Walking in the Spirit means to live each moment under the control of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="fl">Rising and overflowing of water to cover the land, specifically the flood of Noah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalAccount">Biblical Account</p>
<p class="fl">The narrative of Noah’s flood, found in <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-9.29">Genesis 6–9</a>, is referred to frequently elsewhere in the Bible, in each case being mentioned as a historical event (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1,32">Gn 10:1, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.11.10">11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.38-39">Mt 24:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.27">Lk 17:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.5">2 Pt 2:5</a>). According to the biblical account, God brought about the Flood because of human society’s increasing deterioration, which finally reached a point where “the wickedness of man was great in the earth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.5">Gn 6:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). God determined to destroy the race and to begin again with a new people who would obey him (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-28">Gn 1:26-28</a>). Of all the people on earth, only Noah, his sons, and their wives remained faithful to the Lord. They became God’s means of repopulating the earth following its watery destruction. After a period of 120 years’ preparation, during which Noah built a great ship and preached God’s coming judgment (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">Heb 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.20">1 Pt 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.5">2 Pt 2:5</a>), the Flood came in the form of heavy rain, giving rise to subterranean waters (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.11">Gn 7:11</a>). Only the selected pairs of land animals brought aboard the vessel were saved from the onslaught. For more than a year the waters prevailed, until finally the waters receded and the earth was dry and habitable again (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.6-12,24">Gn 7:6-12, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.8.3-6,10-14">8:3-6, 10-14</a>). When Noah and his family left the ark, they offered sacrifices to God in thanksgiving. God then promised that he would never again destroy the earth by a flood.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ExtentoftheFlood">Extent of the Flood</p>
<p class="fl">Scholars who view the flood account as history are divided as to its geographical extent. An objective reading of the story would seem to indicate that the whole earth was flooded, even to the height of the highest mountains (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.17-20">Gn 7:17-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.8.4">8:4</a>). Some have argued that waters high enough to cover “all the high mountains under the whole heaven” (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.19">7:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) would extend over the entire earth. Some advocates of a local flood respond that the narrative uses the language of appearance (that is, to Noah it <span class="ital">appeared</span> that all the earth was flooded). Thus a universal flood was unnecessary, for God wished to destroy only the human race, which at that time may have lived only in Mesopotamia. Others point out translation difficulties in the use of the word “earth.” In <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</a>, it is part of an ancient idiomatic expression denoting totality (“heaven and earth” means “cosmos”). Sometimes “earth” describes a person’s country (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.13">Gn 47:13</a>), the soil itself (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.15">23:15</a>), and so on. Thus, one should not necessarily assume that the use of the word in the Genesis flood story implies the complete inundation of the world.</p>
<p>Some advocates of a universal flood use the presence of marine fossils on the tops of the world’s highest mountains in support of their arguments. But others disagree, saying that since all the mountains originally emerged from the seas, they would be expected to preserve traces of their marine ancestry on their summits. One’s view on the matter must be determined in the final analysis on theological considerations as well as interpretive factors. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=ScientificEvidenceForTheFlood_Textbox_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">“Scientific Evidence for the Flood?”</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">FOOD AND FOOD PREPARATION</p>
<p class="fl">Substances required by the body to sustain life, and the methods of making them edible. Food consumed in Bible times included bread, milk products, fruit, meat, and fish. Food was also offered sacrificially or given as gifts. The availability of food was a perpetual concern because of the recurrent scarcity: droughts were frequent (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38">2 Kgs 4:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.1,4-6">Jer 14:1, 4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.11">Hg 1:11</a>), hailstorms wrought devastation among crops (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.17">Hg 2:17</a>), farming was frequently interrupted by warfare with neighboring nations (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.25">2 Kgs 6:25</a>), and intermittent plagues of locusts ravaged large areas.</p>
<p>Food was more plentiful in Palestine (described as a “land flowing with milk and honey”) than in many other parts of the Near East. Shallow cultivation of the soil, however, made crops highly reliant on regular rainfall. Egyptian crops were far less susceptible to weather variations, because the Nile provided a dependable source of water.</p>
<p>Food shortages were considered warnings or punishment from God (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.9,11">Lam 4:9, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.6-9">Am 4:6-9</a>) to teach the Hebrews that life is more than food and that faith must continue despite scarcity, famine, or even death (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.3">Dt 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.3.17-18">Hb 3:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>The staples of nomadic Hebrews were milk, curds, and cheese. As the people became more stationary, they grew grains and vegetables and planted orchards and vineyards. Grain would sometimes be grown for a season, and then after the harvest, the tribes would move their flocks to other pastures and find other arable land. Religious sacrifices and festivals were times not only of solemnity but also of rejoicing and great feasting. Victories were also celebrated with banquets and feasting on the food obtained from the camp of the vanquished enemy.</p>

<p class="fl">Milk and its by-products formed a vital part of the Hebrew diet (see <a href="?bref=Judg.4.19">Jgs 4:19</a>). Goat’s milk was most frequently used, although milk from camels, cows, and sheep was also available (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.15">Gn 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.14">Dt 32:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.27">Prv 27:27</a>).</p>
<p>Since fresh milk could not be preserved in Palestine’s hot climate, it was processed into buttermilk, curds, and cheese. Milk was poured into goatskins, where it soured and thickened because of the nonsterile condition of the previously used skins and the movement as it was transported. That movement of the pouch (often made from a cow’s stomach, containing the enzyme rennin used in cheese making) produced curds. Curds are first mentioned in the Bible as part of the meal that Abraham provided for his extraordinary guests (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.8">Gn 18:8</a>).</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for curds <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">chena</span><span class="ital">)</span> is also translated “butter” (<a href="?bref=Job.10.10">Jb 10:10</a>). This butter would be similar in consistency to yogurt from which the water has been squeezed out. When pressed and rolled into small balls, it kept indefinitely, despite the climate. Thus, compressed curds were particularly valuable for journeys in arid regions where food was scarce.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GrainCrops">Grain Crops</p>
<p class="fl">The most frequently mentioned food in the Bible is bread. The term refers in a general sense to all foods but more particularly to food prepared from grain. In biblical times bread was prepared from several grains. Wheat, barley, and spelt were grown in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.31-32">Ex 9:31-32</a>).</p>
<p>An Egyptian physician named Sinuhe, living in the mid-20th century <span class="era">BC</span>, recorded that bread was baked daily in Palestine and Syria, and it is probable that it was served with every meal. This bread was probably a wafer or flat cake made from barley or emmer (an inferior form of wheat), since these were the two grain crops that Sinuhe mentioned seeing. Wheat was the most expensive grain. Fine wheat flour was a luxury only the rich could afford (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.6">Gn 18:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.13,19">Ez 16:13, 19</a>). In later periods wheat became a valuable export crop that was shipped from Tyre to other ports in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Because barley could grow in less productive soil and was more tolerant of drought conditions, it became a popular grain crop in the ancient Near East. Barley could also be harvested several weeks earlier than wheat. Barley bread (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.13">Jgs 7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.42">2 Kgs 4:42</a>) and barley cakes (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.12">Ez 4:12</a>) were eaten by the average laborer. Jesus miraculously multiplied a young boy’s five barley loaves and two fishes and fed five thousand (<a href="?bref=John.6.9-13">Jn 6:9-13</a>).</p>
<p>Millet, a cereal with a small grain head growing on a stalk less than two feet (.6 meter) high, and spelt, a type of wheat, were also used in times of need as a border around the edges of fields.</p>
<p>The most primitive way of processing grain was to rub the ears between the hands to separate the kernels, as Jesus and his disciples did (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.1">Lk 6:1</a>). To perform this act on the Sabbath (the day of rest) was considered the equivalent of reaping and was therefore forbidden.</p>
<p>Parching (roasting the grain lightly in a pan) was another simple method of preparation (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.11">Jos 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.17">1 Sm 17:17</a>). It formed a quick and easy meal for laborers or kings (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.14">Ru 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.18">1 Sm 25:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.28">2 Sm 17:28</a>). Parched corn was ideal for taking on journeys.</p>
<p>Bread making was a strenuous task. Mortars, pestles, and simple mills with upper and lower stones were used for grinding flour in ancient Egypt around 2900 <span class="era">BC</span>. These primitive mills were normally placed on the ground, and one was compelled to kneel in order to do the backbreaking work. The resulting meal was coarse and filled with small pieces of husk.</p>
<p>When the flour had been prepared, water was added and the mixture was kneaded in a special trough. The dough could then be made immediately into cakes, pancakes, or unleavened bread (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.3">Gn 19:3</a>). These flat cakes or wafers were often baked on previously heated stones, on the inner walls of small conical ovens, or in larger communal ovens. Leaven was added to make a lighter dough. The leaven was normally a piece of dough left over from an earlier mixing and allowed to ferment before being used. The flour meal was also mixed with a porridge made of lentil beans in order to stretch the food supply.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AnimalProducts">Animal Products</p>
<p class="fl">The introduction of meat as part of the diet seems to have coincided with the time when Noah and his family left the ark (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.3">Gn 9:3</a>). After this time, however, the animals normally eaten for food were so valuable that only the wealthy could afford to slaughter them. So in biblical times the peasant had a simple, somewhat monotonous diet, while the rich feasted on meat, delicacies, and imported commodities. As a result, meat was a luxury item that the poor would rarely enjoy except on such occasions as the Passover celebration or sacrifices in which the worshiper ate part of the offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.8">Ex 12:8</a>). Although it was clearly uneconomic to slaughter an animal that produced such staples as milk, curds, and cheese, the rules of hospitality in the Near East dictated that an animal should be killed to entertain an honored guest (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.2-4">2 Sm 12:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>Domestic sheep, goats, and oxen provided the main source of meat, although venison was popular with the upper classes. When the blind Isaac was deceived by his son Jacob, the father was offered the luxury of both kid’s meat and wild game (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.3,9,19">Gn 27:3, 9, 19</a>). The ox kept in a stall or the fatted calf were reserved for occasions of great festivity (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.4">Mt 22:4</a>).</p>
<p>The use of meat for sacrifice was given definitive form in the provisions of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. The Law forbade anyone to slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.28">Lv 22:28</a>). Another prohibition, perhaps directed at pagan Canaanite sacrificial rituals, would not allow a kid to be stewed or poached in its mother’s milk (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.21">Dt 14:21</a>). Mosaic law was emphatic in prohibiting the consumption of blood in any form. Animal blood was considered the source of the animal’s life and was offered by priests as a sacrifice to God to atone for human sin (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.11">Lv 17:11</a>). In the Mosaic law, pigs, camels, badgers, and rabbits were considered unclean and were therefore forbidden for food, principally on hygienic grounds (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.4-8">11:4-8</a>).</p>
<p>In the ancient world, meat was usually boiled or stewed. Roasting an ox or a kid would usually occur only as part of a special feast or sacrificial ritual. Animals might also be roasted for members of the royal palace or for a king’s special guests.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that hunting was enjoyed by all who were able to participate, wild game provided only a minor part of the diet. Among the game found in Palestine and mentioned in the Bible are gazelle, roebuck, wild goat, and deer (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.5">Dt 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kgs 4:23</a>). It is probable that pheasants were available, and there were certainly turtledoves, pigeons, quails, and partridges, although the precise quantities of food that these birds provided is not certain (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.9">Gn 15:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.16.13">Ex 16:13</a>). Goose was the most popular dish in Egypt, and marsh ducks were also highly esteemed as game. After the Persian period, chickens were eaten (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.30">2 Esd 1:30</a>), and eggs and omelettes were popular in Rome in early Christian times. The eggs mentioned in Deuteronomy are probably wild birds’ eggs (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.6-7">Dt 22:6-7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.10.14">Is 10:14</a>).</p>
<p>Thirty varieties of fish were available in the Jordan, and an extensive fishing industry existed on the shores of the Sea of Galilee at the time of Christ. Supplies of fish were readily available from the Mediterranean coast during the Roman period, but at an earlier time the fish supply depended to a large extent upon whichever nation had control of the coastline. In the postexilic period the people of Tyre supplied the city of Jerusalem with fish, which were sold near the Fish Gate (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.3">Neh 3:3</a>). In the regulations concerning the types of fish suitable for food, only those that had fins and scales were acceptable (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.9-12">Lv 11:9-12</a>).</p>
<p>In NT times many of the distinctions concerning food were eliminated. In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus, challenging the Pharisees’ hypocrisy, upset the Jewish food laws by saying that evil thoughts, not certain foods, make a person unclean (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.19">Mk 7:19</a>). As Christianity spread into gentile areas, there was, however, a continuing concern about eating meat that had been offered to idols. The question came to a head in Corinth. The apostle Paul maintained that though the meat was acceptable, one should take care not to cause spiritual damage to another Christian with a more sensitive conscience.</p>
<p class="h2" id="InsectsandTheirFoodProducts">Insects and Their Food Products</p>
<p class="fl">Wild honey was found in Palestine, but there is no evidence of bee-keeping. Egyptians, however, did practice beekeeping at that time.</p>
<p>The honeycomb is mentioned specifically in <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.27">1 Samuel 14:27</a> and <a href="?bref=Song.5.1">Song of Songs 5:1</a>; liquid honey is referred to in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.3">1 Kings 14:3</a>. Honey was to be found in crevices of rocks and on trees (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.13">Dt 32:13</a>). It was the primary sweetener in cooking. Although it could not be used in a sacrifice to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.11">Lv 2:11</a>), honey was prized as a delicacy. In the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>, when Thutmose III was campaigning in Syria and Palestine, he brought back vast quantities of honey as tribute from his newly conquered lands.</p>
<p>Locusts were probably first eaten in desperation after they had devastated crops. They are one of the few insects mentioned as a permissible source of food (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.22">Lv 11:22</a>). Locusts were fried in flour or honey, or were preserved by being dried. Locusts and wild honey formed John the Baptist’s basic diet in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.4">Mt 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>). Although locusts contain little protein, they are rich in fat and have some mineral content.</p>
<p class="h2" id="VegetablesandSeasoning">Vegetables and Seasoning</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew people wandering in the Sinai wilderness bemoaned the loss of the flavorful vegetables they had become accustomed to during their Egyptian captivity. In particular, they expressed a longing for cucumbers, melons (possibly watermelons), leeks, onions, and garlic (<a href="?bref=Num.11.5">Nm 11:5</a>). Many of these vegetables were later grown in Palestine (particularly in the Gaza). When cucumbers were first cultivated, they were regarded as luxury items and had to be protected by guards who lived in shacks overlooking the gardens (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.8">Is 1:8</a>). Beans, lentils, and parched grain were among the items brought to David and his soldiers at Mahanaim (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.28">2 Sm 17:28</a>). Lentils were known in Egypt from at least the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> and were used extensively both then and in later times by the Israelites. Lentil soup is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gen.25.34">Genesis 25:34</a>.</p>
<p>In times of hunger the husks of the carob tree, normally fed to cattle, could be used for food. These would have been most acceptable to the prodigal son (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.16">Lk 15:16</a>). There were many kinds of green herbs that could provide a meal for the poor in time of need (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.17">Prv 15:17</a>). In cases of extreme hunger, some kinds of mallow and juniper roots could also be used as food. In Elisha’s time a group of prophets at Gilgal prepared a stew of wild vegetables, to which they mistakenly added poisonous wild gourds. Elisha rectified the situation by adding meal to the pot (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38-41">2 Kgs 4:38-41</a>). While there is no actual record of the kinds of bitter herbs used as part of the Passover offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.8">Ex 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.9.11">Nm 9:11</a>), mint and cummin were most probably included. Dill, cummin, rue, and mint were common garden herbs (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Mt 23:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.42">Lk 11:42</a>).</p>
<p>Seasonings were welcome additives to the rather bland character of typical Israelite fare. Salt came mainly from the Dead Sea area and was essential as a seasoning and preserving agent. Salt was so important in the diet that it became part of the vocabulary of moral obligation. The sharing of salt with a person at a meal sealed a covenant or pact (<a href="?bref=Num.18.19">Nm 18:19</a>). In the Levitical sacrificial ritual, salt was part of meat and cereal offerings, since it signified the sealing of God’s covenant with Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.13">Lv 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.24">Ez 43:24</a>).</p>
<p>The mustard tree, which was probably grown for its oil content, grew from a minute seed to the height of 15 feet (4.5 meters) (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.31-32">Mt 13:31-32</a>). Anise, coriander, and cinnamon were also available (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.31">Ex 16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Nm 11:7</a>). Perhaps the most popular and widely used spice, apart from salt, was garlic. Vinegar was also probably used as a flavoring agent and a preservative. From the number of seeds and plants found in Egyptian tombs from the 18th dynasty, it is obvious that the use of seasoning was widespread in antiquity.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FruitsNutsandWine">Fruits, Nuts, and Wine</p>
<p class="fl">Olive trees grew abundantly in Palestine and were an excellent source of food and oil. Even in poor soil, one tree could sufficiently supply a family for a whole year. Some green olives were pickled in brine and eaten with bread, but the olive was most important as a source of oil. Olive oil was used in baking bread and cakes and in frying foods. The best quality olive oil was used in the temple sacrifices.</p>
<p>Oil was extracted from olives by a simple process: for the finest quality oil, olives were picked before fully ripe and then crushed by hand with a stone mortar and pestle. Usually, however, pickers beat the olives from trees with long poles and collected them in baskets. The oil was then trodden out, probably in the same vat used for grapes (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.15">Mi 6:15</a>), which were harvested approximately four weeks later.</p>
<p>An oil mill was developed subsequently, and the heavy upper grinding stone was turned by two people. As the oil dripped through, it was collected in another stone vat and was allowed to settle and purify. When refined, the oil was stored in skins or jars.</p>
<p>Fig trees grew in all areas of Palestine. They required little attention and provided two or three crops per year. The most abundant of these was the second, which ripened in late summer. The first figs of the season were considered a great delicacy (<a href="?bref=Isa.28.4">Is 28:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.1">Mi 7:1</a>). The prophet Hosea suggested that the Israelites were like the firstfruits of the fig tree (<a href="?bref=Hos.9.10">Hos 9:10</a>). Another prophet, Jeremiah, spoke of those who had gone into exile as being like the first figs, while those who were left behind were the bad figs, fit only for destruction (<a href="?bref=Jer.24.1-10">Jer 24:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>Figs were usually eaten fresh from the trees, but some were pressed into cakes to use when traveling (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.18">1 Sm 25:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.12">30:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.40">1 Chr 12:40</a>). Figs were also valuable for medicinal purposes, since effective poultices could be made from them (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.7">2 Kgs 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.21">Is 38:21</a>). Sycamore trees produced small, figlike fruit eaten primarily by the poor. A short time before harvest, the fruit was slightly incised, making it swell and ripen more quickly. The prophet Amos notched sycamore fruit before he was called by God (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.14">Am 7:14</a>).</p>
<p>Fruit from the date palm could also have been pressed into flat cakes for travelers, as figs were. The Bible, however, makes no specific reference to its fruit as food (see <a href="?bref=Judg.4.5">Jgs 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.92.12">Ps 92:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.12">Jl 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.13">Jn 12:13</a>).</p>
<p>Another popular Near Eastern fruit was the red pomegranate. It was eaten whole, or the seeds were pressed to provide a refreshing drink. The pomegranate is mentioned in temple ritual as one of the fruits brought back from Canaan to Moses by his spies (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.33">Ex 28:33</a>) and as an exotic drink (<a href="?bref=Song.8.2">Sg 8:2</a>). The “apple” mentioned in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.11">Prv 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.2.5">Sg 2:5</a>) was most likely a type of apricot or quince, not an apple as we know it today. Nuts were used for additional flavor in cooking. Almonds and pistachio nuts were among the gifts sent by Jacob to ransom his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.11">Gn 43:11</a>).</p>
<p>Grapes were popular and plentiful from the early Bronze Age. In addition to being eaten fresh from the vine, grapes were dried as raisins (<a href="?bref=Num.6.3">Nm 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.18">1 Sm 25:18</a>) or pressed, their juice drunk either as new wine or fermented into an alcoholic drink. One of the duties of the cup-bearer in ancient royal courts was to provide grape juice or wine for the king, his family, and guests (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.9-13">Gn 40:9-13</a>).</p>
<p>The juice of grapes also provided vinegar when wine deteriorated. Vinegar was used as a flavoring agent in cooking and as a preservative. When diluted with water, it supplied a refreshing drink for workers in the fields. A type of jelly was made in the Near East by boiling grapes until they assumed the consistency of molasses. This syrup could also be used as a sweetening agent in cooking.</p>
<p>Wine was the universal drink in antiquity. It could be diluted with water or mixed with spices or honey to make a mulled wine (<a href="?bref=Song.8.2">Sg 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.22">Is 5:22</a>). The Hebrew word for “banquet” or “feast” literally means “drinking,” which reveals much of the character of such occasions. A certain amount of merriment was considered proper at a festival or banquet (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.34">Gn 43:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.9.13">Jgs 9:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.34">Lk 5:34</a>).</p>
<p>Wine making was similar in many respects to the production of olive oil. Clusters of grapes were cut from the vine with a sickle, collected in baskets, and taken to the winepress, where they were trodden by men and women. The juice ran into a lower vat, where, under the hot sun, fermentation began almost immediately. The wine was left to settle so that any twigs or skins would form a sediment; after that the wine could be strained off. In about six weeks the wine was ready to drink or store in earthenware jars or wineskins.</p>

<p class="h1">FOOTSTOOL</p>
<p class="fl">Low stool used to support one’s feet. Part of King Solomon’s great revenue of gold was used to fashion a footstool for his ivory throne (<a href="?bref=2Chr.9.18">2 Chr 9:18</a>). The word is frequently used metaphorically. Both the ark of the covenant and the temple are referred to as God’s footstool because they were places where God rested (his glory resided there) and reigned (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.2">1 Chr 28:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.5">Pss 99:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.7">132:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.2.1">Lam 2:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">Is 60:13</a>). The enemies of the Messiah were to become his footstool; that is, they would be fully subjected to him by the power of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Ps 110:1</a>). Many of the NT references to a footstool (lit. “something under the foot”) parallel the OT expectation of the final conquest of Messiah’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.44">Mt 22:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.36">Mk 12:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.43">Lk 20:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.35">Acts 2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">Heb 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.13">10:13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">FORDS OF THE JORDAN</p>
<p class="fl">Shallow places where people and animals could wade through the Jordan River. Many OT personalities crossed over the Jordan at its two main fords: these people include Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.10">Gn 32:10</a>), Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.4">Jgs 8:4</a>), David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.17">2 Sm 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.22">17:22</a>), Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.24">17:24</a>), Abner and his men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.29">2:29</a>). Joshua led his followers across the Jordan on dry land during a flood, truly a God-given miracle (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.15-16">Jos 3:15-16</a>). Jesus crossed the Jordan on several occasions on his trips between Galilee and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The two main fords of the Jordan were at Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.7">Jos 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.28">Jgs 3:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.15">2 Sm 19:15</a>) and at Bethabara, where John baptized (<a href="?bref=John.1.28">Jn 1:28</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). In certain places and at certain times the Jordan was not fordable: after the melting of the snows in the Lebanon Mountains, and near the Dead Sea, where the Jordan is about 100 feet (30.5 meters) wide and from 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters) deep (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.15">Jos 3:15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">FOREIGNER</p>
<p class="fl">Noncitizen or alien, temporary guest, sojourner, or stranger.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word meaning “foreigner” is rendered correctly on all occasions in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>, but the <span class="sc">kjv</span> uses it in its truest sense on only two occasions (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.3">Dt 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.11">Ob 1:11</a>). In most cases the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates the word as “alien” (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.21">Dt 14:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.15">Jb 19:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.8">Ps 69:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.5.2">Lam 5:2</a>) or “stranger” (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.13">Gn 15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.2.22">Ex 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.35">Lv 25:35</a>). Another Hebrew word means “dweller” (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.35">Lv 25:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.15">1 Chr 29:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.39.12">Ps 39:12</a>) or “settler.” For the most part, however, it is rendered “foreigner.”</p>
<p>A temporary guest or sojourner was usually someone who wanted to take up temporary residence or had moved from one tribe of people to another, and then attempted to obtain certain privileges or rights belonging to the natives. A whole tribe might be sojourners in Israel. This was the case with the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">Jos 9</a>) and the Beerothites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.3">2 Sm 4:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.17">2 Chr 2:17</a>). The Israelites themselves were sojourners in the land of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.13">Gn 15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.23.4">23:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.3">26:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.47.4">47:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.2.22">Ex 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.9">23:9</a>) and in other lands (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.1">Ru 1:1</a>).</p>
<p>Foreigners or sojourners had certain rights but also certain limitations while in Israel. They could offer sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.8">Lv 17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.18">22:18</a>) but could not enter the sanctuary unless circumcised (<a href="?bref=Ezek.44.9">Ez 44:9</a>). They were allowed to participate in the three great Jewish festivals (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.11,14">Dt 16:11, 14</a>) but could not eat the Passover meal unless circumcised (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.43,48">Ex 12:43, 48</a>). Foreigners were not obliged to follow the Israelite religion, but they shared in some of its benefits (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.29">Dt 14:29</a>). They were not to work on the Sabbath or the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.10">Ex 20:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.12">23:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.16.29">Lv 16:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.14">Dt 5:14</a>) and could be stoned for reviling or blaspheming God’s name (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.16">Lv 24:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.30">Nm 15:30</a>). Foreigners were forbidden to eat blood (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.10-12">Lv 17:10-12</a>) but could eat animals that had died a natural death (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.21">Dt 14:21</a>). Israel’s code of sexual morality also applied to the foreigner (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.26">Lv 18:26</a>). There were prohibitions against Israelites intermarrying with foreigners, but it was nevertheless a common occurrence (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.14">Gn 34:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.12,16">Ex 34:12, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.3-4">Dt 7:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.12">Jos 23:12</a>).</p>
<p>Civil rights were provided for foreigners by the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.49">Ex 12:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.24.22">Lv 24:22</a>), and they came under the same legal processes and penalties (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.2">Lv 20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.24.16,22">24:16, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.16">Dt 1:16</a>). They were to be treated politely (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.21">Ex 22:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.9">23:9</a>), loved as those under the love of God (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.34">Lv 19:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.18-19">Dt 10:18-19</a>), and treated generously (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.10">Lv 19:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.22">23:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.19-22">Dt 24:19-22</a>). They could receive asylum in times of trouble (<a href="?bref=Num.35.15">Nm 35:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.20.9">Jos 20:9</a>). Foreign servants were to receive treatment equal to Hebrew servants (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.14">Dt 24:14</a>). A foreigner could not take part in tribal deliberations or become a king (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.15">17:15</a>). The prophet Ezekiel looked forward to the messianic age when the foreigner would share all the blessings of the land with God’s own people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.22-23">Ez 47:22-23</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, “foreigner” is often used metaphorically. On the one hand, the work of Christ allowed all foreigners (i.e., those alienated from Christ) to become members of God’s household (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-19">Eph 2:11-19</a>). On the other hand, Christians should consider themselves foreigners in this world (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.13">Heb 11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.11">1 Pt 2:11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">FOREKNOWLEDGE*</p>
<p class="fl">Knowledge of things or events before they exist or happen.</p>
<p>In the NT the Greek equivalent of “foreknowledge” appears only seven times. It refers to the Christian’s advance warning about false teachers (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.17">2 Pt 3:17</a>); the Jews’ previous knowledge of Paul’s early life (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.4-5">Acts 26:4-5</a>); God’s previous knowledge of the death of Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.23">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-20">1 Pt 1:18-20</a>); and knowledge of his people (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.2">Rom 11:2</a>) and of the church (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.28-30">Rom 8:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1-2">1 Pt 1:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>The concept of foreknowledge does, however, appear throughout the Bible in other ways. First, the allinclusiveness of the knowledge of God is clearly taught. God’s understanding is unlimited (<a href="?bref=Ps.147.5">Ps 147:5</a>). He knows every heart and thought (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.9">1 Chr 28:9</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-24">Psalm 139</a> provides an extended poetic description of God’s knowledge of all human thoughts, words, and actions. This knowledge extends to the flight of a sparrow and the number of hairs on the head (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.29-30">Mt 10:29-30</a>). From such limitless knowledge, it may be inferred that God also knows the future events of human history.</p>
<p>In addition, Scripture directly teaches that God is aware of events before they happen. This sets him apart from heathen idols, who lack the ability to foresee the future (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.6-8">Is 44:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.21">45:21</a>). It is God’s foreknowledge that provides the basis for the predictions of the prophets. God announced to Adam and Eve that the seed of the woman would certainly defeat the serpent and his seed (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>). Promises of future blessing were given to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">12:3</a>). God said to Moses, “I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.19">Ex 3:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The coming glory of the Messiah was declared by the OT prophets (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-7">Is 9:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.20-31">Ez 34:20-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.4-5">Hos 3:4-5</a>). In <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Daniel 7</a>, God revealed the rise and fall of future world empires and the establishment of the kingdom of God (see also <a href="?bref=Dan.2.31-45">Dn 2:31-45</a>). In many places the NT sees Christ’s ministry and the establishment of the Christian church as fulfillment of predictions made beforehand by the OT prophets (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.22">Mt 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.8.17">8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.38-41">Jn 12:38-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.17-21">Acts 2:17-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.22-25">3:22-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.8">Gal 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.6">Heb 5:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.10-12">1 Pt 1:10-12</a>).</p>
<p>For many of the early Greek philosophers, fate rigidly controlled all future events, including not only the events of human history but also the fortunes of the gods. Occasionally, a future event might be known by the gods and revealed to people, and such foreseen events could in no way be altered. This view is, of course, far different from the biblical view of the personal Creator who knows the future and guides history according to his own purpose.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the question of the relationship between God’s foreknowledge and human freedom has occupied the attention of theologians and philosophers over the centuries. It is sometimes argued that if God knows what will happen in the future, then it must happen. Therefore, it makes no difference at all what choice a person makes, since it could not have been otherwise.</p>
<p>The theologians of the early church emphatically denied that foreknowledge implies any predetermination of events. Justin Martyr, for example, said, “What we say about future events being foretold, we do not say it as though they come about by fatal necessity.” In other words, this means that just because God knows what is going to happen before it happens does not necessarily mean that he has <span class="ital">caused</span> it to happen.</p>
<p>Other theologians, fearing that foreknowledge destroys human freedom and responsibility, insist that God does not know future events either certainly or completely. Modern process theology, for example, conceives of God as growing and developing along with nature and man. This God, it is argued, can at most know only those events that have already taken place. Hence the future remains open and uncertain for God as well as for man. An older theologian, Adam Clarke, suggested that although God can know all future events, he chooses not to know some events beforehand.</p>
<p>Augustine denied foreknowledge for a different reason. He argued that God lives in eternity where all things are present. For God, then, there is no past or future. Hence he would not know things before they happened, since he would see all events from the vantage point of an eternal “now.” Augustine, of course, did not deny God’s knowledge of all things, even of things that are still in the future as far as we are concerned.</p>
<p>Because of the clear biblical teaching regarding God’s foreknowledge, evangelical theologians have generally held that God has complete knowledge of all future events. There is a further distinction, however. The followers of Calvin insist that God knows all events precisely because he sovereignly determines what is to happen in human history right down to the tiniest detail. Here foreknowledge is closely tied to, if not identified with, foreordination. At the same time, most Calvinistic theologians assert that human beings are nonetheless responsible for their choices—not victims of a blind fate. It is also generally held that God is not the author of sin. Rather, sin is the result of the rebellion of angels and men against a holy and righteous God.</p>
<p>Evangelicals in the Arminian tradition, on the other hand, distinguish foreknowledge from the foreordination of events. While salvation of the world, and human history in broad outline, are predetermined by God, it is argued that individual response to God is not so predetermined. Hence, God can foreknow an event without directly decreeing that event to take place.</p>
<p>While evangelical Christians differ in their descriptions of the relationship between the eternal all-knowing God and the events of human history, it should be kept in mind that Scripture teaches both God’s foreknowledge of all things and the responsibility of humans for their choices.</p>

<p class="h1">FOREORDINATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Activity of God by which he establishes events and outcomes before they occur. In common usage, “foreordination” and the term “predestination” are synonymous. “Predestination” and “election,” however, specifically refer to the destiny of persons.</p>
<p>Foreordination was referred to by many early church fathers and was a major emphasis in the theology of Augustine of Hippo (354–430). Augustine greatly influenced the Reformers, particularly John Calvin. Reformed theologians begin the study of the doctrine of foreordination with the eternal decree of God, as indicated by creeds such as the Westminster Confession of Faith. The decree of God is one, but for purposes of discussion and explanation it is usually referred to as “the decrees of God.” Martin Luther believed in foreordination but did not stress it as much as Calvin. Luther’s theology is generally silent on foreordination, primarily discussing predestination, or election. Contemporary Lutheran thought stresses conditional, rather than absolute election, that is, election or predestination based on foreseen faith.</p>
<p>Foreordination underlies the whole plan of God: his decision to create the universe, to care for it (providence), and to determine its destiny “according to the counsel of his will” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Westminster Shorter Catechism states the teaching in this way: God has decreed “his eternal purpose according to the counsel of his will, whereby, for his own glory, he hath foreordained whatsoever comes to pass.” Foreordination, then, is at the foundation of all Christian teaching, for it concerns the history and destiny of the whole world, the universe, and all that it contains.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul spoke of God’s plan for the fulfillment of all creation: “For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-21">Rom 8:19-21</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Scripture gives only a glimpse of the redemption of the whole creation. It speaks of new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>). Those things that mar human existence and demonstrate human fallenness and sinfulness (i.e., depravity) will all pass away. God will make “all things new” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-5">Rv 21:1-5</a>), so the destiny of everything rests with God himself.</p>
<p>Foreordination creates problems for theology and commonsense thinking, particularly in relation to human freedom and responsibility and that aspect of foreordination concerned with salvation. How can people be held responsible for their actions and decisions if those actions have been predetermined? To remove that difficulty, some have denied God’s foreordination as it relates to human freedom. In creating free beings, they argue, God must have limited his determination of things that “must” come to pass. Otherwise, free and responsible human activity has no meaning. Calvinism rejects such an argument, insisting that free activity is possible even though it is foreordained and foreknown.</p>
<p>Denial of the doctrine of foreordination implies that God does not control his creation. If that were true, the existence and happenings in the universe, including human activity, would be determined either by something above or beyond God, or by occurrences whose ultimate causes are unknown. God’s providence and care revealed in the Bible and human experience make such a view untenable. Christian thought generally states that God foreordains and controls his creation and that humans are able to act freely and responsibly within that larger control. The apparent contradiction or paradox remains unresolved because there is a limit to human understanding.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ForeordinationinScripture">Foreordination in Scripture</p>
<p class="fl">There are many references to foreordination (including predestination, or election) and the related idea of foreknowledge in the Bible. Foreordination can be thought of as logically prior to foreknowledge, but there is no actual priority since both activities are eternal in God.</p>
<p>Speaking of judgment to come upon Babylon, God said, “This is the purpose that is purposed concerning the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations. For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it? His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?” (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.26-27">Is 14:26-27</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). God also declared that he has determined the end from the beginning. “My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose” (<a href="?bref=Isa.46.10">Is 46:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Paul stated that the purpose of God is carried out “according to the counsel of his will” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.119.89-91">Ps 119:89-91</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.35">Dn 4:35</a>).</p>
<p>With respect to human affairs, it is said that one’s life span is determined (<a href="?bref=Job.14.5">Jb 14:5</a>), that God’s concern extends to his creatures (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.14-30">Ps 104:14-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.29">Mt 10:29</a>), and even the hairs on our heads are numbered (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.30">Mt 10:30</a>). Furthermore, God’s plan extends to peoples and nations, for “he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.26">Acts 17:26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>God knows and even uses people’s evil acts for his own ends. For example, although Joseph’s brothers sinned by selling him into slavery, Joseph later said, “As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today” (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.20">Gn 50:20</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus, but God used that sinful intent. Jesus said, “For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.22">Lk 22:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). On the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter said, “This Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.23">Acts 2:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.4.27-28">4:27-28</a>). Paul refers to God’s determining authority over Pharaoh’s acts (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.17">Rom 9:17</a>). <a href="?bref=Rev.17.17">Revelation 17:17</a> says, “God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). God, then, foreordains the events of nature and history, and even evil acts are subject to his control and are made to fulfill his purposes.</p>
<p>Election of sinners to salvation through Christ is also included in God’s foreordination (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.28-39">Rom 8:28-39</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.13.48">Acts 13:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.12-13">Phil 2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>). God’s plan of salvation is grounded in his eternal love and good pleasure (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.3-14">Eph 1:3-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.6-11">Rom 5:6-11</a>). The Christian is the recipient of God’s grace in that the believer knows God and is known (i.e., loved) by God (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.9">Gal 4:9</a>). Both election and believers’ faith are part of the salvation process.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ForeordinationandProvidence">Foreordination and Providence</p>
<p class="fl">The doctrine of foreordination is implied in the doctrine of providence or God’s care. Providence is the working out of God’s plan for the world. God’s care and control of the whole creation point to his plan of redemption for man and woman made in his image. God sovereignly controls the events that take place in the world, but God is not responsible for sin. He created human beings who may say no to God as well as yes. That does not mean that God’s plan can be thwarted; it goes on in spite of opposition. God’s ultimate plan is being realized through all the events of human history, evil and good. Yet his sovereignty is not imposed arbitrarily. God is not a tyrant but rather is holy, loving, and righteous. His plan is carried out according to his nature, which is expressed in care and concern for the whole creation and in steadfast love for undeserving sinners.</p>
<p>“Natural law” refers to the rules God has laid down (foreordained) to control the universe. What about destructive forces of nature, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes? Why are such apparent evils necessary in a world made and controlled by a loving God? It is no answer to suggest that God is unable to act or control nature fully. If life’s total meaning resided in the temporal, physical world, there might be reason for complaint. But considering the whole plan of God and his ultimate redemptive purpose, the answer takes on a different dimension. God’s ultimate purpose transcends the present life and centers in the fullness of the redemptive kingdom yet to be revealed (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.15">Rv 11:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-4">21:1-4</a>). The doctrine of foreordination is a great mystery, but it should be a source of joy and comfort to believers whose loving Lord has brought them to a knowledge of his great plan.</p>

  <title>Forgiveness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FORGIVENESS</p>
<p class="fl">Pardon, involving restoration of broken relationships; ceasing to feel resentment for wrongs and offenses. Primarily, forgiveness is an act of God, releasing sinners from judgment and freeing them from the divine penalty of their sin. Since only God is holy, only God can forgive sin (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.7">Mk 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.21">Lk 5:21</a>). Forgiveness is also a human act extended toward one’s neighbor—a manifestation of one’s realization and appropriation of God’s forgiveness. Hence, forgiveness is a uniquely Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>In other religions, forgiveness does not have the same force. In animism, there is no awareness of a personal relationship with God. In Hinduism, all have to pay the inexorable consequences of karma in the wheel of reincarnations. Buddhism likewise knows nothing of a forgiving God. The idea is present in Islam, but there is no personal God and Father. Even in Judaism, forgiveness remains a limited experience, though forgiveness as developed in the NT adds dimension to the teaching of the OT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ExpressionsofForgivenessintheOldTestament">Expressions of Forgiveness in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The idea of forgiveness is expressed in various metaphors. The command is <span class="hebrew">nasa</span><span class="ital">,</span> to “send away,” as the scapegoat was sent away into the wilderness to bear the sins of the Israelites. It is also rendered “to be merciful” (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.20">Lv 4:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.30,34">1 Kgs 8:30, 34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.5">Pss 86:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.3">103:3</a>). The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">kapar</span> is commonly used of atonement, meaning “to cover up,” as the sacrifice was offered to cover the deficiency of the worshiper (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.36">Ex 29:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.8">Dt 21:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.23">Jer 18:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.20">Ez 43:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.20">45:20</a>). Cognates of <span class="hebrew">salah</span> always refer to God’s act of forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Num.30.5,8,12">Nm 30:5, 8, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.5">Pss 86:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.130.4">130:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.9">Dn 9:9</a>). God lets go of the transgression; he removes it. Another expression is <span class="hebrew">maha</span><span class="ital">,</span> to “wipe away” (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.1,7">Ps 51:1, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.25">Is 43:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.22">44:22</a>).</p>
<p>The OT teaches that God is a forgiving God (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">Ex 34:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.17">Neh 9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.9">Dn 9:9</a>), yet he is just and punishes sin. Many incidents are also given where God refuses to forgive when the proper conditions are not met, or when certain serious offenses are committed (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.20">Dt 29:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.4">2 Kgs 24:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.5.7">Jer 5:7</a>). Forgiveness is rooted in the character of God, but his forgiveness is never indiscriminate, for people must also be penitent. The OT (cited here in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>) uses vivid imagery to indicate the magnitude of God’s forgiveness. Sin is cast “into the depths of the sea” (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.19">Mi 7:19</a>), removed “as far as the east is from the west” (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.12">Ps 103:12</a>), hid behind God’s back (<a href="?bref=Isa.38.17">Is 38:17</a>), “remembered no more” (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.34">Jer 31:34</a>). The stain and soil of sin is bleached white (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>). Sin, which burdens like a weight, is forever lifted and remitted.</p>
<p>The dynamic of forgiveness in the OT is thus releasing one from the past. The past acts and deeds of sin are not denied, but there is no longer any bondage. Forgiveness brings freedom.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ForgivenessintheNewTestament">Forgiveness in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT, the concept of the unmerited forgiveness of God is intensified by the fact that God forgave our sins when Christ died for us. Each human is an insolvent debtor (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">Mt 18:23-35</a>) who has no hope of repayment. Sinners all, we cannot keep the law or save ourselves (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.26-27">Mk 10:26-27</a>). This highlights the NT teaching that it is in the person of Christ himself that there is forgiveness. He alone has the power to forgive sins (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.5-10">2:5-10</a>). It is his death that is redemptive (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>) and his blood that is the basis of a new covenant (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>). It is through him that one can enter into the living experience of forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.15,22">Heb 9:15, 22</a>). So forgiveness is inseparable from the proclamation of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.38">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.14">Col 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.12">1 Jn 2:12</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheChristianExperienceOfForgiveness"/>
<p>There are other distinctively NT concepts of forgiveness. The Greek word <span class="greek">charizomai</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “to forgive sins,” is distinctively developed by Paul in terms of God’s gracious pardon (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.7">2 Cor 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.13">12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.32">Eph 4:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.13">Col 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.13">3:13</a>). Sin is considered as a debt, and <span class="greek">aphesis</span> denotes the discharge of a debt (“putting it away”—see <a href="?bref=Luke.6.37">Lk 6:37</a>). Forgiveness is also treated as remission, <span class="greek">paresis</span> (“passing over”). God has not executed the full retribution called for by sin (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.16">Acts 14:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.30">17:30</a>); instead, he has shown mercy.</p>
<p>Yet the NT speaks of two limitations to forgiveness. One is the unpardonable sin (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.31-32">Mt 12:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.28-30">Mk 3:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.10">Lk 12:10</a>). In this regard Christ speaks of those who, like the Pharisees, are so warped in their moral judgments that they cannot distinguish between acts of Satan and the good deeds of Christ. There is also “the sin against the Holy Spirit” that is “sin unto death” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.5.16">1 Jn 5:16</a>). This sin is not specifically defined, but its essence seems to be consistent rejection of the grace of God.</p>
<p>The ethics of forgiveness in the NT insists not only on penitence as a condition for forgiveness (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.10">2 Cor 7:10</a>), but also on the need to forgive others (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.14-15">Mt 6:14-15</a>). If in the midst of receiving forgiveness one does not forgive others, it is a clear sign that repentance is not complete. Several times in his parables the Lord insists that the readiness to forgive others is a sign of true repentance (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">Mt 18:23-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.37">Lk 6:37</a>). So Christ taught that to forgive is a duty, and no limits can be set on it. It must be granted without reserve, even to 70 times 7 (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.21-22">Mt 18:21-22</a>). Forgiveness is part of the mutual relationship of believers: since all are dependent upon God’s forgiveness, all are required to forgive one another. “As the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.13">Col 3:13</a>).</p>

  <title>Fornication*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FORNICATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Unchastity, sexual immorality. The word “fornication” is used in the Scriptures to mean several different things.</p>
<p>Its general meaning refers to every kind of illegal sexual intercourse, that is, any intercourse except that between a husband and wife. For example, in <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1">1 Corinthians 5:1</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) the word is used twice to refer to a sin that was being tolerated by the church: a man apparently was cohabitating with his stepmother. In a list of terrible sins in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.29">Romans 1:29</a>, the apostle Paul included fornication, apparently intending the term to mean all acts of sexual immorality (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). In 1 Corinthians the context suggests that Paul used the word in reference to all sorts of illicit sexual activity (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.13,18">6:13, 18</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.2">1 Corinthians 7:2</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) Paul used the plural Greek word for “fornications” to imply the various ways in which the sin may manifest itself. He thus gave a reason why people in Corinth should marry and live together properly. One of the sins included in the word’s general sense is adultery.</p>
<p>“Fornication” also has a more limited sense of immoral sexual activity between unmarried people. Such a meaning is implied in those biblical lists where both fornication and adultery come together. Jesus’ list of the defiling sins that proceed out of a person’s heart includes “fornication” and “adultery” (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.19">Mt 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.21">Mk 7:21</a>). Paul’s list of those sinners who will not inherit the kingdom of God also contains both fornicators and adulterers (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9">1 Cor 6:9</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>“Fornication” in <a href="?bref=Matt.5.32">Matthew 5:32</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.19.9">19:9</a> (as translated by the <span class="sc">kjv</span>) is usually taken by biblical students today to refer specifically to adultery (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The translation of <span class="greek">porneia</span> has to do with interpretation rather than translation. Scholars disagree as to whether Jesus’ exceptive phrase relative to divorce has to do with fornication in a general or limited sense. He might have meant adultery alone, or he might have been including it generally with other sexual sins.</p>
<p>A figurative use of the word “fornication” appears in both the OT and NT. Originating in descriptions of Israel and the church as the Lord’s wife or the bride, apostasy from God and idolatry are called fornication (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.2.1-37">Jer 2</a>). <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">Ezekiel 16</a> uses unfaithfulness to marriage vows as a symbol of Jerusalem’s wayward relationship with God. Jerusalem had become an “unfaithful wife” to him. The first three chapters of Hosea use the relationship of the prophet Hosea and his unfaithful wife, Gomer, as an illustration of how the nation of Israel had become guilty of fornication against its “husband,” the Lord, by going after other gods. In the book of Revelation the figurative use of “fornication” and “impure passion” is ascribed to Babylon the great, the mother of harlots (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.8">Rv 14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.2-4">17:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.3">18:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.2">19:2</a>).</p>

  <title>Fort, Fortification</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FORT, FORTIFICATION</p>
<p class="fl">Walls, citadels, and sometimes moats protecting most cities in the ancient world. Fortifications followed the natural contour of the area encircling a city. Early city defenses consisted of simple banks of earth tossed against the walls and outer structures to make it difficult for hostile forces to approach and enter the city. Wherever possible, the site chosen for the location of a city would be a naturally favorable topographical situation, such as a steep elevation in an isolated place or a hill that afforded natural protection. Some sites were chosen because of their ample water supply, good navigation, or central location at a crossroads of traveled highways, even if they had no natural defenses. The difficulty and cost of fortifications were then obviously much more serious.</p>
<p>In general, whatever materials were available were used for construction of fortifications, including debris, rubble, and beaten earth. Those materials were faced with hard-packed clay or lime plaster to prevent an enemy from knowing the quality of the underlying filling. Commonly a ditch or moat was dug or cut out of solid rock in front of the walls. This hindered an enemy’s advance and made any attempt to tunnel under the walls and into the city more difficult.</p>
<p>Towers were built for added strength and protection at potentially weak spots, such as corners, gateways, or openings for water supplies. Towers had inner access stairways and chambers for use by soldiers who manned the structures and for use by watchmen who announced the approach of danger. Gateways were provided with massive piers and bronze or iron bars and bolts. Gates were hung on pivots driven into the pavement below and into the lintel above and had to be strongly fortified and carefully protected. Often they consisted of a series of entrances, one inside the other, with guardrooms between them.</p>
<p>Excavations of ancient forts reveal the development of fortifications from primitive beginnings to NT times. Earliest strongholds were constructed with crude brick and rough stone work. Masonry was irregular, and large stones of various sizes and shapes were roughly trimmed and crudely placed into the wall structures. Stone facings and wall joints were packed with pebbles or limestone chippings. During later times, carefully prepared mortar was used to cover the walls to give greater strength and support to the fortifications. Not until late in the Hebrew period were stones with ornamentation and skilled drafting used.</p>
<p>Scripture uses the imagery of a fortress or high tower to picture the confidence that believers can have in God’s strength and protection. The prophets realized that the strength and defense of the nation lay not in fortifications of brick and stone but in God, and they urged the people to put their trust in him as a secure refuge (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.2-3,33">2 Sm 22:2-3, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.29">Prv 10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.25.4">Is 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.19">Jer 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.14">Hos 8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.16">Jl 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.1.7">Na 1:7</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">FORUM</p>
<p class="fl">Open area in Roman cities used for commerce, political affairs, and judicial matters. The forum was usually on level ground, rectangular in shape, and surrounded by temples, law courts, colonnades, and other public buildings.</p>
<p>The forum of Appius was a traveler’s stop on the Appian Way, 43 miles (69.2 kilometers) south of Rome, where Paul was met by Christians from Rome on his way to the capital under guard (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.15">Acts 28:15</a>).</p>
<p>The most important of the forums were those located in the city of Rome. These were built at different times in its history, and existing forums were changed through continued building. The Rome to which Paul went for his trial had several forums, including those of Julius Caesar (begun by him but actually completed by Augustus Caesar) and of Augustus Caesar. Most important was the Roman Forum, center of the world in Paul’s day. It lay between the two central hills of the seven hills on which the city was built. It contained many columns, statues, works of art, and buildings important in the political and religious life of the empire.</p>
<p>If Paul was brought directly into the city by the centurion who had charge of him, he would have passed the triumphal arch of Augustus, the temple of Castor and Pollux, and the temples dedicated to Julius and Augustus for emperor worship. Arriving at the Roman Forum proper, he would have noticed on the northwest the famous ideal center of the city (and thus of the empire), and on the southwest the gilded milestone, giving distances to places as far away as London to the west and Jerusalem to the east. In the background was the temple to Jupiter, chief god in the Roman pantheon. On the south side was a large public building, the Basilica Julia, completed in <span class="era">AD</span> 12, the probable site of the pronouncement of Paul’s death sentence. On the north side was the Basilica Aemilia, a building from which marble columns were taken and used in the building of a church over the traditional site of Paul’s tomb. That church was completed in <span class="era">AD</span> 398 and stood for 1,400 years.</p>

<p class="fl">Fragrant gum resin that can be ground into powder and burned to produce a balsamlike odor. It was often associated with myrrh (<a href="?bref=Song.3.6">Sg 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.6">4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.2.11">Mt 2:11</a>). Frankincense is obtained from balsam trees of the genus <span class="ital">Boswellia,</span> specifically the species <span class="ital">B. carterii, B. papyrifera,</span> and <span class="ital">B. thurifera.</span> These trees, which are related to turpentine trees, have star-shaped flowers that are pure white or green, tipped with rose. To obtain the resin, a deep incision is cut into the trunk, yielding an amber-colored gum. Since these trees were native only to Saba (Sheba) in southern Arabia (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.6">Is 60:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.20">Jer 6:20</a>) and Somaliland, the resin was a costly item transported into Palestine by caravan.

<p>Frankincense was used alone or with other materials for incense. It was one of the ingredients of the holy incense used for worship in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.34">Ex 30:34</a>). It was placed on the bread of the Presence (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.7">Lv 24:7</a>) and mixed with oil on the cereal offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.1-2,14-16">Lv 2:1-2, 14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.15">6:15</a>), but it was excluded from the sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.11">5:11</a>).

<p class="fl">Translation of a Hebrew word referring to anything bound on the forehead (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.16">Ex 13:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.8">Dt 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.18">11:18</a>). The phylacteries of Jesus’ day (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Mt 23:5</a>) were worn daily at morning prayer by every male Israelite over the age of 13. They consisted of four Scripture passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.1-10">Ex 13:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.11-16">13:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Dt 6:4-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.13-21">11:13-21</a>) written on parchment and placed in small leather boxes tied to the forehead and the left arm. Whether the phylacteries were the parchments or the leather boxes is debated. There is no evidence that the Israelites in Moses’ day made such phylacteries. It is probable that the commands were to be understood figuratively, portraying the memorial value of the Feast of Unleavened Bread and the importance of the Law in the people’s lives. For the Pharisees, the outward observance had replaced the obligation to apply the power of God’s Word to the heart (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Mt 23:5</a>).</p>

  <title>Fruit of the Spirit*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT*</p>
<p class="fl">Expression taken from <a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. As listed there, this fruit is the evidence one may expect from a life in which the Spirit of God is living and reigning. The fruit of the Spirit, as listed in <a href="?bref=Gal.5.1-26">Galatians 5</a>, is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. “Love” is that outgoing, self-giving kind of action, not necessarily emotion, that characterized God himself when he loved the world so much that he <span class="ital">gave</span> his only Son (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>). “Goodness” is the translation of a Greek word that includes the idea of generosity. The word “faith” refers usually to trust or confidence in someone or something. However, the word can also refer to that which causes trust and faith, namely faithfulness and reliability. Both meanings are in the use of the word here as another evidence of the Spirit-controlled life. Another fruit, translated “temperance” by the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, is the Greek word for self-control, that ability to hold oneself in, to keep oneself in check. It is significant that the Spirit is said to be the one responsible for this fruit. Since these qualities are the fruit of the Spirit, it is self-evident that legalism and obedience to law cannot originate or produce them.</p>
<p>This fruit appears in a context within Galatians where Paul is emphasizing Christian freedom from obedience to the law as a meritorious means of being justified before God. He warns the Galatian Christians, who were in danger of returning to the law, that physical circumcision is an outward sign of a return to legalistic means of justification and that to attempt to obtain it this way is impossible (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.3">Gal 5:3</a>). However, lest the Galatians overemphasize their freedom in Christ, Paul cautions that this liberty does not mean license to sin, an opportunity for gratifying the desires of the flesh, but rather an opportunity to continue as loving bondservants belonging to one another (v <a href="?bref=Gal.5.13">13</a>). Life in the Spirit means that one will not fulfill the lusts or desires of the flesh (v <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16">16</a>). Then Paul identifies both the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit. A person who is abstaining from the works of the flesh and is demonstrating the fruit of the Spirit in his life will be loving, joyful, peaceful, patient, kind, good, dependable, gentle, and self-controlled. These are not said to be gifts of the Spirit, however, but graces that will adorn the life that is under the Holy Spirit’s control.</p>

  <title>Fullness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FULLNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Common translation of the Greek term <span class="greek">pleroma</span><span class="ital">.</span> The word carries various shades of meaning that must be determined by observing its use in context.</p>
<p class="h2">General Usage</p>
<p class="fl">In Greek usage outside the NT, the word means “that which fills.” It is found in reference to the cargo or crew that fills a ship, the people that make up a crowd, and the years that fill a person’s life. The philosopher Aristotle used the term to denote the population that fills a city. That sense is used in Matthew’s and Mark’s Gospels of a patch that fills up a hole in an old garment (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.16">Mt 9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.21">Mk 2:21</a>), and in Mark of the pieces of fish that fill a basket (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.43">Mk 6:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.20">8:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">“Earth” Expressions</p>
<p class="fl">In several instances in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> the term is found in the phrase “the earth and its fullness” (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.1">Pss 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.50.12">50:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.11">89:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.26">1 Cor 10:26</a>) or “the sea and its fullness” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.32">1 Chr 16:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.11-12">Ps 96:11-12</a>), meaning “contents.” Beyond its obvious quantitative sense, the meaning in these expressions may reflect a qualitative character: the contents of the earth are good and special. The Hebrew mind viewed the created order as a reflection of the Creator (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.5-6">Pss 8:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">19:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.24">Jer 23:24</a>). Accordingly, whenever people entered into relationship with anything God had created, whether in work or meals or relationships, they also entered objectively into relationship with God, who had given those things. Thus, the Jews heard with horror the prophetic announcement of God’s intention to bring destruction upon “the land and all that fills it” (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.16">Jer 8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.47.2">47:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.19">Ez 12:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.7">19:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.12">30:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">The Apostle Paul’s Usage</p>
<p class="fl">The origin of Paul’s understanding and use of “fullness” as a significant theological term has been debated. It is held by some that the word was a technical term used by the Gnostics in reference to a realm of spiritual beings that bridged the space between the true God and an “evil” earth. Subsequently, false teachers came to view Christ as one among many deities who lived in that “fullness.” In order to correct the misunderstanding, Paul borrowed the term from his opponents and applied it to Christ. Jesus is not just one of the beings between God and humanity, Paul taught; rather, he is all there is (“the fullness”) between God and humanity (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Col 1:15-20</a>).</p>
<p>Against that view it is argued that Paul used the term in several contexts where that interpretation is obviously inadequate (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.10">Rom 13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">Eph 1:22-23</a>). In addition, it is likely that Paul, with his Pharisaic Jewish background, would understand the term in light of its OT usage. Thus, Paul’s use of the term may be better understood as not borrowed from his opponents.</p>
<p>Paul used the term four times in the book of Romans. It can be rendered “full inclusion” in reference to the total number of Jews (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.12">Rom 11:12</a>) or Gentiles (v <a href="?bref=Rom.11.25">25</a>) who will come to God. In verse <a href="?bref=Rom.11.12">12</a>, however, the term is set in opposition to the “failure” and “trespass” of the Jews, who feel that righteousness is a matter of their Jewish heritage rather than faith. It may be that Paul used the term in reference to “complete obedience to God’s will.” Thus, in essence Paul said, “If their disobedience means this much good for the world, think of what their obedience will mean.” It is in this active sense that “fullness” is used in <a href="?bref=Rom.13.10">Romans 13:10</a>. Love brings to realization all that the law intends. Similarly, Paul desires that his own life be a full expression of the gospel of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.29">15:29</a>).</p>
<p>In the book of Ephesians, the church is referred to as the “fullness of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">Eph 1:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.13">4:13</a>), and “the fullness of God” (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.19">3:19</a>). A variety of interpretations have been offered for this phrase: the church is filled, made complete or whole by Christ; the church possesses the attributes of Christ; the church is the agent through which Christ does all his work. The church is full of Christ in that it is the complete, continuing expression of his words and works (compare <a href="?bref=Col.2.10">Col 2:10</a>). In the book of Colossians, Paul used the term in reference to Christ; in him dwells the “fullness of God” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.19">1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">2:9</a>). These passages are often interpreted as proclaiming the equality of Christ with God. All of God’s attributes are contained in Christ. All that God is, Christ is.</p>
<p class="h2">The Apostle John’s Usage</p>
<p class="fl">The prologue to John’s Gospel states that the “fullness of Christ” is received by all believers (<a href="?bref=John.1.16">1:16</a>). The exact nature of this fullness is defined in verse <a href="?bref=John.1.14">14</a>: “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.” The Greek word for “fullness” here indicates plenitude and totality. The Gnostics used the word to describe the totality of all deities. John, as with Paul, used the word to describe Christ as the fullness, the plenitude of God, for all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily (see <a href="?bref=Col.1.19">Col 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">2:9</a>).</p>
<p>Since all of God’s fullness dwells in Christ, every spiritual reality is found in Christ. In Christ, believers lack nothing. Of course, no single believer could receive all that Christ is; it takes the body of Christ to appropriate Christ’s fullness and to express it (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.23">Eph 1:23</a>). Nevertheless, each believer receives in measure the same content of that fullness. Christ is continually full; he never is depleted. No matter how much the believers receive of him, he keeps on giving. Believers do not need to seek any other source but Christ.</p>

  <title>Fullness of Time*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FULLNESS OF TIME*</p>
<p class="fl">Expression meaning “when the time was ripe,” occurring in English translations of <a href="?bref=Gal.4.4">Galatians 4:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</a>. In Galatians the reference is to the time when “God sent forth his Son.” The apostle Paul used the image of a child coming of age to say that Jesus came at a point in human history when the time was ripe and released humanity from bondage to the law.</p>
<p>Traditionally, theologians have seen indications of the ripeness of the time of Jesus’ birth in the historical circumstances of his day. Rome’s conquests had produced “Roman peace,” so that travel was both safe and easy. That political unity was built on the earlier victories of Alexander the Great, whose expansion from Greece to Egypt to India left in its wake the Greek language and culture, which later made the spread of the gospel easier. Greek-speaking Jews lived in every city of the Roman Empire. Their religion was protected by Roman law, and that law protected Christianity for its first half century. Many Gentiles who were interested in the monotheism and morality of Judaism went to the Jewish synagogues. Thus, the synagogue was a natural starting point for the church’s early outreach to Gentiles.</p>
<p>In Palestine the Jews were longing for a Messiah (deliverer) since they were politically subject to the Herods and the Romans. Messianic rebellion simmered constantly, and even repeatedly broke out in open battle. Socially, peasants were oppressed by large landholders, who used every opportunity and legal loophole to expand their properties. Many of those oppressors were from the chief priestly families, whose greed was well known to all. Throughout Palestine, messianic speculation was at a high point. The Pharisees talked about what would happen when the Messiah came, and the scribes at Qumran (the Dead Sea Scrolls community) wrote books about it. The time was ripe for Jesus’ coming, as he himself indicated (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.11,16-17">Mt 13:11, 16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Eph.1.10">Ephesians 1:10</a>, Paul used a slightly different Greek expression, which covers the whole of the time between Jesus’ first coming and his future return to complete God’s plan in history. Jesus revealed this plan (or “mystery,” as Paul called it—<a href="?bref=Rom.16.25-26">Rom 16:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.9">Eph 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.4-5">3:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.26">Col 1:26</a>), which works out in the church as people repent and are joined to him. In the ultimate sense, the full “ripeness” will come when God’s plan or purpose (“dispensation,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>) is completed and Christ becomes head over all things. Paul knew that this completion was in progress, but he awaited its total realization in what he hoped would be the near future.</p>

  <title>Funeral Customs</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FUNERAL CUSTOMS</p>
<p class="fl">Practices and rites that encompass the dying and death of human beings. Funerary rites have been practiced by all social groups from their very beginnings.</p>
<p>Most anthropologists believe that funeral customs fulfill certain important social functions for the living. However, the general meaning these customs provide for any given culture is a matter of longstanding dispute. On the one hand, some behavioral scientists believe that funeral rites alleviate the sudden anxiety that death brings for the grieving. On the other hand, some believe that the purpose of death customs is not to dispel anxiety but rather to foster the feelings of religious awe or group solidarity. In varying degrees both of these factors probably underlie most funeral rites. Funerary customs remind the participants that death must be taken seriously, while at the same time they provide a comforting interpretation of death.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientJewishFuneralProcession"/>
<p>Belief patterns have profoundly influenced funeral customs. A conception of immortality is one of the more commonly held beliefs. The discovery of artifacts such as tools, ornaments, and even food in the oldest known human graves may be evidence of the pervasive conviction that human beings continue to exist in some form after death. Proper funeral rites were believed to assist the dead in reaching their final habitat, which usually included a journey fraught with various perils, such as crossing mythical rivers or wide chasms. The rites also assured the living that the spirits of the dead would not harm them.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DisposingoftheCorpse">Disposing of the Corpse</p>
<p class="fl">A common form of disposing of a corpse has been burial in the earth (inhumation). This practice may have emerged because of the belief that the abode of the dead was located under the ground. Often the grave was considered the entrance to the underworld, although some groups considered the habitation of the dead to be in the sky. Above-ground disposal has also been practiced by many. Some communities place the corpse on a rack to be devoured by birds or other animals. A few groups have been known to eat the corpse, believing that the good qualities of the deceased could be ingested. Many Asian societies have traditionally practiced cremation, or the burning of the corpse. In the past, it was not uncommon for the wife and slaves of a deceased man to throw themselves on the burning pyre. Cremation is becoming popular in the West and may become more widely practiced because of the increasing scarcity of land for grave sites.</p>
<p>Nearly every society observes special mourning customs during the disposal of the body. These include the wearing of special clothing, emotional outbursts, seclusion, and food taboos. Most societies mark the experience by a ceremony that may include purification rites and the sharing of special meals by the friends and relatives of the dead. In almost every cultural group, status symbols infiltrate the funeral customs and rituals. For instance, if the deceased were of a high social standing, then the funeral ceremonies would be more elaborate.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FuneralCustomsandtheBible">Funeral Customs and the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">While the Bible does not provide a detailed picture of burial procedures, it does allude to the common burial practices of the Hebrew people and contains some scattered prohibitions relating to death. Placing the corpse in the ground or in a cave was the principal method for disposing of the dead. One of the worst indignities was to be left unburied or become food for predators (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.26">Dt 28:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.15">1 Kgs 11:15</a>). If possible, the deceased were to be buried on the day of death (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.23">Dt 21:23</a>). While embalming was not practiced, the corpse was dressed in special burial clothes and sprinkled with various perfumes (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.46">Mk 15:46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.44">Jn 11:44</a>).</p>
<p>Intense weeping surrounded funerary rites during biblical times. This mourning did not simply result from spontaneous grief but was part of the funeral ritual (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.17">Mt 11:17</a>). In ancient Israel, groups of paid mourners emerged who could wail on ritual cue. Much of the funeral service centered on these professional mourners who sang psalms and delivered elaborate eulogies for the dead (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.25">2 Chr 35:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.17-22">Jer 9:17-22</a>). The emphasis upon mourning resulted from the Hebrew appreciation of human life and health, which was considered one of God’s greatest gifts (<a href="?bref=Ps.91.16">Ps 91:16</a>), and also from a view of human nature that affirmed embodied existence (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.9-11">16:9-11</a>). This latter belief may have contributed to the OT’s lack of a full-fledged doctrine of immortality, even though it implies that the dead partake in the “shadowy existence” of Sheol and will someday be resurrected (<a href="?bref=Job.14.13">Jb 14:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">Ez 37</a>).</p>
<p>The early Christian church affirmed the Jewish belief in embodied existence but highlighted a belief in existence after death. Unlike the Greek dualists, who asserted the immortality of only the soul, the NT writers, following the OT, emphasized a belief in eternal life that entailed not only the soul but also the body. This view became the fulcrum for the belief in the bodily resurrection, which undergirded Christian funeral customs. Nearly every practice symbolized a belief in the resurrection and eternal life. Thus, the emphasis upon lamentation gave way to joyful singing of psalms. The body was washed, anointed with perfumes and spices, wrapped in linen, and surrounded by candles, all of which represented eternal life. Friends and relatives usually held a vigil at the home of the deceased, and scriptural passages dealing with the resurrection and eternal life were read. Whenever possible, the Lord’s Supper was observed, symbolizing the sacrifice of Christ. At the church or the grave site, a funeral oration was delivered both to eulogize the dead and to comfort the living. Many of these practices are still observed by Christians today.</p>

  <title>Furnace</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FURNACE</p>
<p class="fl">Brick or stone structure varying in size and shape, depending on whether it was to be used domestically or commercially. A typical furnace consisted of a firebox, a flue, a chamber for the material to be heated, and an opening to give the refiner access from the outside. Common uses of the furnace were to smelt ore, melt ore for casting, heat ore for forging, fire ceramic materials, fire bricks, and make lime.</p>
<p>Various types of furnaces are mentioned in Scripture. The potter’s kiln was used to make lime and to fire and glaze pottery (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.28">Gn 19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.8,10">Ex 9:8, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.18">19:18</a>). It was commonly made of limestone, was dome-shaped, had a chimney for smoke to escape, and a hole at the bottom for fuel. Such a furnace emitted a thick, dark column of smoke.</p>
<p>Larger furnaces used for smelting ore were seldom employed by the Hebrews, except possibly in the time of King Solomon. The Hebrews, however, knew of this type of furnace, probably from its extensive use in Lebanon. Most OT references to such furnaces are figurative (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.20">Dt 4:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.51">1 Kgs 8:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.17.3">Prv 17:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.21">27:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.10">Is 48:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.4">Jer 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.18-22">Ez 22:18-22</a>). This kind of large, ore-smelting furnace is central in the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, the three Jewish men whom King Nebuchadnezzar threw into the fiery furnace for refusing to bow down and worship his golden idol (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">Dn 3</a>).</p>
<p>The most common use of “furnace” in the Bible is to provide a figurative description of God’s discipline or punishment and his refining of character (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.20">Dt 4:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.51">1 Kgs 8:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.10">Is 48:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.27-30">Jer 6:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.18-22">Ez 22:18-22</a>). In the NT “furnace” is used as a symbol for hell (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.42,50">Mt 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.2">Rv 9:2</a>). The refining image is used to refer to the trials of life that prepare a person for life after death (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">Jas 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.7">1 Pt 1:7</a>). In John’s vision, the one who is like the Son of Man has “feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace” (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.15">Rv 1:15</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). This reference to refined brass, an extremely hard metal, is symbolic of Christ’s power to conquer his enemies.</p>

<p class="fl">Items of material culture used in homes, palaces, and temples. Because of its close geographical proximity to other nations, Israel had extensive contact with neighboring cultures. Historical surveys document parallels between the furniture of Israel and that of other tribes and countries.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PalestineinOldTestamentTimes">Palestine in Old Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">OT passages supply most of the information about furniture in ancient Palestine, although there are also significant archaeological data. There are many references to beds in the OT, using at least three Hebrew nouns. Jacob is pictured as sitting up in bed (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.2">Gn 48:2</a>) and as dying on his bed (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.33">49:33</a>). Moses threatened that frogs would invade the bedroom and bed of the Egyptian pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.3">Ex 8:3</a>). Michal, Saul’s daughter, placed an effigy in David’s bed (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.11-17">1 Sm 19:11-17</a>) when Saul sent messengers to capture him there. King David condemned the practice of killing a defenseless person sleeping in bed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.7,11">2 Sm 4:7, 11</a>). The prophet Elijah laid a dead boy on his bed and revived him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.19">1 Kgs 17:19</a>).</p>
<p>King Ahab sulked on his bed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.4">1 Kgs 21:4</a>), and King Ahaziah lay on his sick bed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.4-6,16">2 Kgs 1:4-6, 16</a>). The prophet Amos criticized the rich who lay on beds of ivory and stretched out on their couches (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>). The prophet Ezekiel spoke symbolically of disobedient Jerusalem as a prostitute sitting on a stately couch with the Lord’s incense and oil on a table nearby (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.41">Ez 23:41</a>). Isaiah promised that the righteous would rest in their beds (<a href="?bref=Isa.57.2">Is 57:2</a>) and also spoke of the unrighteous setting their beds among false worshipers (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.57.7-8">7-8</a>). The psalmist flooded his bed with tears (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.6">Ps 6:6</a>), and Proverbs refers to a sluggard on his bed (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.14">Prv 26:14</a>).</p>
<p>“Table” in the OT refers both to the temple table for the bread of the Presence and to the table used in the palace or home for meals or banquets. King Adoni-bezek had his captives scrambling for scraps under his table (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.7">Jgs 1:7</a>). Jonathan’s disabled son Mephibosheth was allowed to sit at David’s table (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.7,10-13">2 Sm 9:7, 10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.28">19:28</a>). Solomon’s table is described several times (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.7">1 Kgs 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.27">4:27</a>). The queen of Sheba was particularly impressed by the food and table service in Solomon’s palace (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.5">10:5</a>). The prophets frequently refer to tables (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.5">Is 21:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.8">28:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.65.11">65:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.39-43">Ez 40:39-43</a>). The few references to chairs describe people reclining at meals and indicate couches rather than actual chairs (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>).</p>
<p>There are numerous mentions of thrones, including those of the pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.40">Gn 41:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.11.5">Ex 11:5</a>), David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.10">2 Sm 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.13">7:13</a>), Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.18">1 Kgs 10:18</a>), the kings of Israel and Judah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.10">1 Kgs 22:10</a>), and God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19">1 Kgs 22:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.9.4,7">Pss 9:4, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.11.4">11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.93.2">93:2</a>). The OT writers sometimes indicate thrones decorated with ivory (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.18">1 Kgs 10:18</a>).</p>
<p>The exact character of furniture in Palestine is difficult to determine. Bas-reliefs and wall paintings are more common among Israel’s neighbors. Excavations in Jericho, however, have unearthed some valuable archaeological clues. Tombs of the middle Bronze Age produced reasonably well-preserved tables, stools, and boxes, making possible a study of ancient joinery methods. A variety of small trinket boxes show evidence of bone inlay and incised decoration. Some large slabs of timber may have been beds. Although primarily Canaanite styles, the furniture reflects the household furniture used in Israel in the centuries to follow.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GreekandRoman">Greek and Roman</p>
<p class="fl">Historians are quite informed about Greek furniture because of the abundance of decorated vases, bas-reliefs, bronze and terra-cotta statuettes, and literary descriptions. That archaeological evidence indicates that Greek furniture was influenced by preceding civilizations. The picture is generally one of comparative simplicity, far removed from the cluttered and crowded rooms of later civilizations.</p>
<p>The Greeks made several types of seats: (1) the throne, often with a back, legs of various shapes, and armrests; (2) the lighter curved-back chair with arm supports; (3) the four-legged stool; (4) the folding stool with crossed legs traceable to Egyptian models; and (5) the bench. Representations that regularly appear on monuments dating from the eighth to the second century <span class="era">BC</span> link Greek chairs to Egyptian and Assyrian prototypes.</p>
<p>Greeks used couches for sleeping and for reclining at meals. Footstools were used to rest the feet or as a step up to higher couches. Like chair legs, couch legs varied in style. Some were carved in the shape of animal legs, some were turned, some were rectangular. From about the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the legs projected above the frame. Such projections later became headboards and footboards. In Hellenistic times these headrests and footrests were carved and carried bronze medallions in high relief depicting children, satyrs, and animals. Turned legs replaced the rectangular ones. Couches were normally in wood, although bronze and marble couches are known.</p>
<p>Tables were used during meals to hold dishes and food and were removed after the meal. They were made of wood, bronze, and marble and normally had four legs, but three-legged tables were occasionally used. Chests, large and small, served to store clothes, jewelry, and other articles. They were normally of wood, although some were bronze.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Rome">Rome</p>
<p class="fl">Roman furniture continued many Greek patterns. The eruption of the volcano Vesuvius in <span class="era">AD</span> 79 preserved actual pieces of Roman furniture in its lava flow.</p>
<p>Chairs with backs were heavier than their Greek counterparts and widely used. There were several types of stools: the folding stool, mostly wooden, though sometimes metal; and a newly developed decorative stool, often of bronze, that was supported by four curved legs ornamented with scrolls.</p>
<p>A variety of couches were in use. Some followed Greek models, but others were of Roman invention. Excellent examples of bronze bed frames have been preserved. Presumably, interlaced strips of leather or cords were stretched crisscross on the frame. Gold, silver, tortoiseshell, bone, and ivory decoration were used along with veneer work in rare timber. Later, couches in Italy and in other lands had high backs and sides. The Romans seem to have used tables more widely than Greeks. They appear often as permanent supports for vases and other possessions. Tables were normally rectangular with four legs, but table makers also constructed some with three legs, or even resting on a single support. Round tabletops and legs of animals became popular from the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> on. Plain, undecorated wooden tables and benches were used in kitchens and workshops. Outdoor tables were usually of marble with carved animal legs or decorative figures of animals and monsters.</p>
<p>There were various chests and boxes in daily use. Shelves and cupboards became much more popular than in Greek times.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PalestineinNewTestamentTimes">Palestine in New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">The nature of furniture in the NT is probably best understood in relation to contemporaneous Roman models. The NT refers to beds in several passages. People brought a paralytic lying on his bed to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.2,6">Mt 9:2, 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.18">Lk 5:18</a>). When the apostles went into Solomon’s portico, people brought the sick to them on beds (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.15">Acts 5:15</a>). A Syro-Phoenician woman’s sick child lay on a bed (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.30">Mk 7:30</a>). Jesus spoke of setting a lamp on a stand and not placing it under a bed (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.21">Mk 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.16">Lk 8:16</a>), and described what would happen to people in bed when the Day of the Lord came (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.34">Lk 17:34</a>). In another parable Jesus spoke of a needy person begging for bread at midnight from a friend who was already in bed with his family (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.7">Lk 11:7</a>). Beds of the poor and sick were probably only pallets or mattresses (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.55">Mk 6:55</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.8">Jn 5:8</a>). When people reclined at meals, they would have been lying on a couch (<a href="?bref=John.13.23">Jn 13:23</a>).</p>
<p>There are numerous NT references to tables. Jesus mentioned crumbs falling from a rich man’s table (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.27">Mt 15:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.28">Mk 7:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.21">Lk 16:21</a>). Jesus overthrew the money changers’ tables in the temple (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12">Mt 21:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.15">Mk 11:15</a>). Jesus sat with his disciples at a table for the Passover meal (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.21">Lk 22:21</a>) and promised his disciples that they would sit at his table in God’s kingdom. The apostles were relieved of serving tables in order to preach (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.2">Acts 6:2</a>).</p>
<p>The household lamp is referred to a number of times (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.1">Mt 25:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.21">Mk 4:21</a>). Terra-cotta domestic lamps have been found in abundance in excavations.</p>

  <title>Futility</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">FUTILITY</p>
<p class="fl">Frustration, vexation, uselessness, and meaninglessness.</p>
<p>In Ecclesiastes (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.2,14">1:2, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.1,11,15,17">2:1, 11, 15, 17</a>; etc.) the expression appears again and again in a haunting refrain that is difficult to render in an English translation because the Hebrew term <span class="hebrew">hevel</span> has so many connotations. The traditional rendering, “vanity of vanities,” found in many older translations, has been replaced in newer versions with more creative attempts at capturing the meaning. In some translations the idea is “meaninglessness” (see <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>); in others, “emptiness” (see <span class="sc">neb</span>); in still others, “uselessness” (see <span class="sc">tev</span>). One of the best renderings is found in the <span class="sc">reb</span>: “Futility, utter futility, says the Speaker, everything is futile” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.2">Eccl 1:2</a>). Koheleth points to the futility of all human endeavors that seek to bring lasting satisfaction in and of themselves. One might as well try to “catch the wind.” A person can find permanent meaning and lasting contentment only in God with whom there is no meaninglessness.</p>
<p>In Paul’s writings there are two Greek words, often used synonymously, that convey the idea of futility: <span class="greek">kenos</span> and <span class="greek">mataiotes</span><span class="ital">.</span> The two words are frequently used together in the Septuagint (e.g., <a href="?bref=Job.20.18">Jb 20:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.7">Is 37:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.1">Hos 12:1</a>), in classical Greek, and in Hellenistic Greek. <span class="greek">Mataiotes</span> is the word used in the Septuagint. <span class="greek">Kenos</span> is used by Paul to signify that which is empty and hollow—hence, pointless and futile. <span class="greek">Mataiotes</span> is employed by Paul to signify that which is vain and useless—hence, ineffective and futile.</p>
<p>In Paul’s writings <span class="greek">kenos</span> expresses the emptiness of all that is not filled with spiritual substance; it speaks of the “zeroness” of human words and human endeavors that lack divine content. Nothing comes from this nothingness; it is futility. Paul used <span class="greek">kenos</span> to describe the hollow utterances (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.20">1 Tm 6:20</a>) spoken by Judaizers and/or Gnostics trying to entice the believers with philosophy and empty deceit (see <a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Col 2:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.5.6">Eph 5:6</a>). In contrast, Paul claimed that his preaching was not “futile” but purposeful and effective (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.14">1 Cor 15:14</a>). He made the same claim for his labor among the believers (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.1">1 Thes 2:1</a>). Paul made sure that his labor had not been for nothing (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.2">Gal 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.5">1 Thes 3:5</a>), for he had not been a recipient of God’s grace “to no effect” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.10">1 Cor 15:10</a>). His preaching and labor were not futile but purposeful because the One he had proclaimed and labored for, the risen Lord Jesus, had filled Paul with divine life and substance (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.14">14</a>).</p>
<p>Paul’s use of <span class="greek">mataiotes</span> was likely informed by the Septuagint, especially Ecclesiastes. Although the adjective <span class="greek">mataios</span> was regularly employed in Greek literature to describe that which is vain or empty, <span class="greek">mataiotes</span> is almost strictly a biblical term used often in the Septuagint to depict uselessness, worthlessness, and futility.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the NT is the kind of futility described in Ecclesiastes so characterized as in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.20">Romans 8:20</a>. When Paul speaks of the creation being subjected to futility, he is focusing on the inability of creation to function as it was originally designed to do. When people fell into sin, God subjected the earth to a curse for their sake. Since then, all of the creation’s attempts to express God are doomed to failure until it is released from its bondage. Redeemed humanity must take the lead, then creation—joining in the final redemption—will also be liberated from <span class="greek">mataiotes</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>In other portions, Paul used <span class="greek">mataiotes</span> to depict the futility that has its source in the thought life of fallen man. He characterizes the “thoughts of the wise” as being futile (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.20">1 Cor 3:20</a>), and he describes the Gentiles as those living “in the futility of their minds” because “they are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart” (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.17-18">Eph 4:17-18</a>, <span class="sc">nrsv</span>). The thought life of the unregenerate is futile and aimless because it lacks divine substance and spiritual insight; it produces a life of purposelessness and ineffectiveness. Salvation from <span class="greek">mataiotes</span> for now comes from the indwelling Spirit of Christ (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.10-11,26-27">Rom 8:10-11, 26-27</a>) and in the future will be given when Christ returns and the believers (along with all creation) receive their full redemption (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.22-25">Rom 8:22-25</a>).</p>
