  <body>
<p class="h1">PALACE</p>
<p class="fl">Residence for royalty. Excavations suggest that any city that enjoyed royal patronage would boast of a building that could be described as a palace. Royal cities had a second surrounding wall that shut off the royal palace and its outbuildings, forming the acropolis of the city. Jerusalem had the equivalent in the City of David, which formerly was the Citadel of Zion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.7-9">2 Sm 5:7-9</a>).</p>
<p>The OT’s references to palaces in Palestine are vague—for example, David’s palace (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.2,9">2 Sm 11:2, 9</a>), the palace of Tirzah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.18">1 Kgs 16:18</a>) and Ahab’s palace in Jezreel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1">21:1</a>). Even the references to Solomon’s palace in Jerusalem are quite imprecise. In <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.1-12">1 Kings 7:1-12</a> the construction of public and private buildings close to the temple went on for 13 years. Only the choicest of materials were used. But from the details supplied, it is quite impossible to reproduce plans of the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Porch of Pillars, the Porch of the Throne, the palace for Solomon’s Egyptian wife, or the royal palace. What the situation of these buildings was in relation to one another is matter only for conjecture. Round about the whole complex was a great court of hewn stones and cedar beams.</p>
<p>Forced labor was universal in the ancient Near East. Samuel’s warning that a king would introduce the system into Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.12-17">1 Sm 8:12-17</a>) was fulfilled, and it came to full development under Solomon when he undertook his massive building program, including his palace. Solomon raised his workforce from all over Israel. The system incited Jeroboam to revolt (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.4,16">1 Kgs 12:4, 16</a>). King Asa used it (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.22">15:22</a>), and it continued on into Jeremiah’s time (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.13">Jer 22:13</a>). Nehemiah’s builders were volunteers (see <a href="?bref=Neh.3.5">Neh 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>Prominent among Solomon’s royal buildings was the temple. Apparently, it stood in the middle of a courtyard called the inner court (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.36">1 Kgs 6:36</a>), by contrast with the great court (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.12">7:12</a>), which included both the temple and the palace. The palace itself had an inner court too (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.8">8</a>), the northern wall of which was common to the inner court of the temple. Hence it was but a step from the king’s domain to the Lord’s domain.</p>
<p>The king’s enthronement took place in the palace, in the Porch of the Throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.46">1 Kgs 1:46</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.19">2 Kgs 11:19</a>). When he took his seat on the throne, it marked his assumption of power (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.11">1 Kgs 16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.13">2 Kgs 13:13</a>). Solomon’s throne in his palace became the symbol of royal power, although his throne was still called the throne of David (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.24,45">1 Kgs 2:24, 45</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">Is 9:7</a>). Solomon’s palace throne is described as one of the wonders of the world (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.18-20">1 Kgs 10:18-20</a>). It was around this throne that the high officials came to do him homage (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.47">1:47</a>).</p>
<p>The king’s daughters lived in the palace until their marriage under the care of women (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.7">2 Sm 13:7</a>). They wore a distinctive dress (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.13.18-19">18-19</a>). The king’s sons were reared in the palace by nurses (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.2">2 Kgs 11:2</a>) and tutored under leading men of the city (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1,6-7">10:1, 6-7</a>), until they were able to perform certain duties at the court (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.18">2 Sm 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.17">1 Chr 18:17</a>). Then they led an independent life and were provided for by the king (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.3">2 Chr 21:3</a>). Amnon evidently lived outside the palace (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.5">2 Sm 13:5</a>), and Absalom had his own house (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.20">13:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.14.24">14:24</a>), lands, and livestock (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23">13:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.14.30">14:30</a>). Palace or court officials surrounded the royal family (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.4-5">1 Kgs 10:4-5</a>). Whatever their office, they were called the king’s “servants.” There were those “who saw the king’s face,” meaning they were admitted to the king’s presence (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.24,28,32">2 Sm 14:24, 28, 32</a>), or stood before the king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.21-22">1 Sm 16:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.12">Jer 52:12</a>). It was a signal mark of favor to be admitted to the royal table (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.7,13">2 Sm 9:7, 13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PALESTINE*</p>
<p class="fl">Country on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, also known as Canaan and Israel. Palestine was situated at the west end of the Fertile Crescent—that arching stretch of highly productive land that ran from the Persian Gulf through Mesopotamia and Syria to Egypt. Palestine lay in a unique position, for it constituted a land bridge between Mesopotamia and Egypt, the two primary cultural centers of the ancient Near East. It also served as a connection between the continents of Asia and Africa and as a continental link between Africa and Europe. Trade moved by well-defined routes as goods were brought into the Fertile Crescent from as far as northern Europe, India, and south of Egypt. The same roads were followed by prospective conquerors as they moved their armies from area to area in quest of power and wealth.</p>
<p>It was the land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants, the homeland of God’s chosen people, and the geographical scene for much of biblical history. It has become a land sacred to three great world religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Physically, Palestine is a kind of microcosm. In a stretch of 150 miles (241.4 kilometers) one can find almost every kind of climate and terrain known on the earth. It has fertile plains, sandy deserts, rocky wastes, forests, mountains, lakes, and rivers. With such a variety in so small an area, the land provides sharp contrasts. In the north, Mt Hermon stands perpetually snowcapped at an altitude of about 9,100 feet (2,773.7 meters), while a scant 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) distant in the subtropical depression of the Jordan Valley is the Dead Sea, representing the deepest spot on the earth.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Name">Name</p>
<p class="fl">This land has been known by many names over its long history. The country seems to have been named after the maritime region, perhaps because this was the area that most foreigners contacted. So the land was called Canaan and later named after Philistia. In the table of nations, Canaan is said to have extended from Sidon in the north toward Gerar as far as Gaza and east toward the Cities of the Plain (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.19">Gn 10:19</a>). The name Canaan appears in the Bible; the first occurrence of the name as that of a country or region is in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">Genesis 11:31</a>.</p>
<p>After the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the country was known as the land of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19">1 Sm 13:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.22.2">1 Chr 22:2</a>). With the division of the kingdom in the reign of Rehoboam (930 <span class="era">BC</span>), the name Israel went with the northern kingdom, and the southern kingdom was known as Judah (later, Judea).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Territory">Territory</p>
<p class="fl">The earliest reference to the extent of Palestine appears in the promise of the land to Abraham and to his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.18-21">Gn 15:18-21</a>). Here the borders are given as the River of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish) in the southwest to the Euphrates River in the northeast. It is further defined in terms of the peoples who occupied it at that time, 10 in all, including the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. In <a href="?bref=Gen.17.8">Genesis 17:8</a> the land is called simply “all the land of Canaan.”</p>
<p>The Lord gave more detailed directions to Moses concerning the borders of the land that Israel was to occupy (<a href="?bref=Num.34.1-12">Nm 34:1-12</a>). The southern boundary was to be from the River of Egypt to the south of Kadesh-barnea and along the wilderness of Zin to the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. The western boundary was the Mediterranean, the northern border was set at the entrance to Hamath, and the eastern limit was the Jordan River and the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The greatest extent of the Promised Land is seen in the Lord’s declaration to Moses that he would set the bounds of Israel from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines (Mediterranean) and from the wilderness to the Euphrates River (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.31">Ex 23:31</a>). Historically, during the period of the judges and the reign of Saul, Israel did not conquer the land that had been given to the tribes in the division under Joshua. The military strength of David and the diplomacy of Solomon enabled them to achieve a marked expansion of Israelite rule. David defeated Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and thus pushed his northern frontier to the Euphrates River; he defeated Syria, Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Amalek, enlarging the kingdom also to the east and south (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.1-14">2 Sm 8:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.1-13">1 Chr 18:1-13</a>). Solomon had a fleet of merchant ships stationed at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqaba. He also engaged in copper mining in that area.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Climate">Climate</p>
<p class="fl">It has been said that the climate of Palestine is more varied than that of any other area of comparable size in the world. Generally, the climate may be described as temperate; at Jerusalem, for example, the temperature extremes range from 26°F (-3.3°C) to 107°F (41.6°C), and the average annual rainfall is about 20 inches (50.8 centimeters). The coastal plain is warmer and has been compared to the east coast of Florida. The average annual temperature at Jaffa (Joppa) is 67° F (19.4°C). The Jordan Valley in the area of the Dead Sea is subtropical; in summer its temperatures may reach 120°F (48.8°C).</p>
<p>Rainfall is seasonal, with rain coming in the cooler months of the year as the prevailing west wind brings moisture over the comparatively colder land area, much like the “lake effect” snows of the Great Lakes region of the United States. The rainy season extends from October to April. Within this time the Israelites singled out two periods (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.24">Jer 5:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.23">Jl 2:23</a>), the former rain and the latter rain, with the former rain occurring in the months of October and November and the latter rain falling in March and April. The coastal area receives about 28 inches (71.1 centimeters) of rain annually, while the average for the country in general is 22 to 24 inches (55.9–70 centimeters).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">For purposes of description, the land of Palestine may be conveniently divided into five longitudinal sections:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The Maritime or Coastal Plain</p>
<p class="list">2. The Shephelah</p>
<p class="list">3. The Western Plateau or Hill Country</p>
<p class="list">4. The Arabah or Jordan Valley</p>
<p class="list">5. The Eastern Plateau or Transjordan</p>
<p class="fl">These divisions are based essentially on differences in elevation, but other geographic elements also serve to mark their limits or otherwise distinguish them.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfJerusalemInJudea"/>
<p class="h3">The Maritime or Coastal Plain</p>
<p class="fl">The Maritime or Coastal Plain may be divided into three separate plains from south to north: the plain of Philistia, the plain of Sharon, and the plain of Acre.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The plain of Philistia begins with the Wadi el-Arish, or River of Egypt, and extends north to the Nahr el-Auja, about five miles (8 kilometers) north of Joppa. This plain is about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) long and reaches its greatest width in the latitude of Gaza, where it measures about 30 miles (48.3 kilometers). Along the Mediterranean there were dunes of sand, but for the most part, this area was very fertile and admirably suited for the production of grain.</p>
<p class="list">2. The plain of Sharon is not sharply demarcated from the Philistine plain and was probably under Philistine control, but the OT recognizes it as a separate entity (cf. <a href="?bref=Song.2.1">Sg 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.65.10">Is 65:10</a>). The plain extends north to Mt Carmel. On the coast are the town of Dor, which is mentioned in “The Tale of Wenamon,” and the city of Caesarea, where Herod the Great did much building.</p>
<p class="list">3. Beyond the promontory of Carmel lies a bay on which was situated the city named Ptolemais (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.7">Acts 21:7</a>), also known as Acre or Acco (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Jgs 1:31</a>). Here a narrow plain stretches some 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) to the Ladder of Tyre (Ras en-Nakurah). The Kishon River (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.7,13">Jgs 4:7, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.40">1 Kgs 18:40</a>) flows through this plain to the sea.</p>
<p class="h3">The Shephelah</p>
<p class="fl">The Shephelah constitutes a kind of “midlands,” intermediate between the lowlands of the coastal plain and the highlands of the Western Plateau, with an elevation of about 500 to 1,000 feet (152.4– 304.8 meters) and a width of only a few miles. It extends from the valley of Aijalon to Beersheba.</p>
<p>The valleys of the Shephelah produced grain crops, while the hills were well suited for grapes and olives. The region was very important strategically, because it afforded approaches to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h3">The Western Plateau or Hill Country</p>
<p class="fl">The Western Plateau or Hill Country ranges from 1,000 to 4,000 feet (304.8–609.6 meters) in elevation and covers some 150 miles (241.4 kilometers) from Lebanon to Beersheba. It may also be divided into three areas: Galilee, Samaria, and Judea.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Galilee may be regarded as two parts, Upper Galilee (2,000–4,000 feet, or 609.6–1,219.2 meters) and Lower Galilee (below 2,000 feet, or 609.6 meters). The area was agricultural and pastoral, like much of Palestine, and was open to invasion. The highways that traversed Galilee made it a cosmopolitan district, so that <a href="?bref=Isa.9.1">Isaiah 9:1</a> calls it “Galilee of the nations.”</p>
<p class="list">2. Samaria was also suitable for crops and pasture. The brothers of Joseph were grazing their flocks in the plain of Dothan when Joseph visited them and became the victim of their conspiracy (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.17">Gn 37:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Judea has an elevation of about 2,000 to 3,500 feet (609.6–1,066.8 meters) and reaches some 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) from Bethel to Beersheba. The city of Jerusalem stands at an elevation of 2,654 feet (808.9 meters), surrounded by mountains and valleys that served as part of its defense system (<a href="?bref=Ps.125.2">Ps 125:2</a>). This was the heart of the nation, for from the time of David onward, the capital was here, and more important, the ark of the covenant had been brought here during David’s reign. As the Lord had long foretold, Jerusalem had become the center of his worship; here Solomon built the temple, one of the greatest structures ever made.</p>
<p class="h3">The Arabah or Jordan Valley</p>
<p class="fl">The Arabah or Jordan Valley presents the extremes of height and depth. Mt Hermon rises to 9,166 feet (2,793.8 meters), while the surface of the Dead Sea lies 1,275 feet (395 meters) below sea level, and at its deepest part the sea plunges another 1,300 feet (396.2 meters).</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The North Arabah or Upper Jordan Valley. The Jordan River has four sources, all near Mt Hermon. The Jordan flows through what was Lake Huleh, now partly drained and designated as a wildlife refuge. Two miles (3.2 kilometers) below the Huleh basin is the Bridge of Jacob’s Daughters, by which the old road to Damascus crossed the river. The Jordan then flows into a gorge some 1,200 feet (365.8 meters) deep.</p>
<p class="list">2. The Sea of Galilee, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) from Huleh, has an elevation of -685 feet (-208.8 meters). It measures 15 by 8 miles (24.1 by 12.9 kilometers), with a maximum depth of 750 feet (228.6 meters). The shape of the lake gave it the OT name, Chinnereth, meaning “harp” (<a href="?bref=Num.34.11">Nm 34:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.27">Jos 13:27</a>). In the NT it was also called the Lake of Gennesaret (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1">Lk 5:1</a>) and the Sea of Tiberias (<a href="?bref=John.6.1">Jn 6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.1">21:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. The Middle Arabah, or Ghor. The name Jordan means “descender”; in the 60 miles or 96.5 kilometers (in a straight line) from the outlet of the Sea of Galilee to the northern end of the Dead Sea there is a fall of more than 600 feet (182.9 meters), or 10 feet per mile. The river flows in a series of S-curves or zigzags, so that its actual course between Galilee and the Dead Sea covers some 200 miles (321.8 kilometers).</p>
<p class="list-text">This stretch of the Jordan Valley is known as the Ghor, or Rift. Six miles (9.7 kilometers) below the Sea of Galilee the Yarmuk River enters from the east. Some smaller streams empty into the Jordan, but the next river of consequence is the Jabbok (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.22">Gn 32:22</a>). Just south of the Sea of Galilee the Ghor is about four miles (6.4 kilometers) wide; near Beth-shan it reaches seven miles (11.3 kilometers) wide; beyond that for some 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) the mountains close in on the river on both sides, narrowing the valley to two to three miles (3.2 to 4.8 kilometers); near Jericho it broadens to about 12 miles (19.3 kilometers).</p>
<p class="list">4. The Dead Sea is unique. Its surface is the deepest point on the face of the earth and its waters are of tremendous wealth. In the OT it is known as the Salt Sea (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.3">Gn 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.34.12">Nm 34:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">Jos 12:3</a>) and the Sea of Arabah (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">Jos 12:3</a>). Josephus calls it Lake Asphaltitis.</p>
<p class="list-text">This body of water is 46 miles (74 kilometers) long, 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) wide, and 1,300 feet (396.2 meters) deep and consists of about 25 percent mineral matter, making it a chemical deposit of great value. In addition to the flow of the Jordan, the Dead Sea receives the water of other streams, such as the Arnon River on the east. Much of the runoff of the seasonal rains also finds its way into the Salt Sea. Temperatures in the valley may reach 120° F (48.8° C) in summer; with the extreme humidity the climate is very debilitating and almost unbearable. It is estimated that the daily evaporation from the sea is 6 to 8 million tons (5.4–7.3 million metric tons).</p>
<p class="list">5. The Southern Arabah, mostly a barren wilderness, extends from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, a distance of 150 miles (241.4 kilometers). There is a gradual ascent from the Dead Sea to a watershed just west of Petra. Near the tip of the Gulf of Aqaba were the ports of Elath (modern Eilat) and Ezion-geber.</p>
<p class="h3">The Eastern Plateau or Transjordan</p>
<p class="fl">The Eastern Plateau, or Transjordan, was not named as part of the land of promise, but it was taken by the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh. The region is better supplied with water than the Western Plateau and has perennial streams, such as the Yarmuk, Jabbok, and Arnon. A principal north-south road was the King’s Highway, followed by the Israelites during the exodus (<a href="?bref=Num.21.22">Nm 21:22</a>) and probably also the route taken by the invading kings of <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Genesis 14</a>.</p>
<p>The northern section of Transjordan was known as Bashan, noted for its cattle (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.12">Ps 22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.18">Ez 39:18</a>) and for its oak trees (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.13">Is 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.11.2">Zec 11:2</a>).</p>
<p>Gilead, famed for its balm (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Gn 37:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>), was often mentioned in the OT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.3.10-16">Dt 3:10-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.1-40">Jgs 11</a>). It extended from the Yarmuk River to the city of Heshbon. This area was heavily forested in David’s time (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.8">2 Sm 18:8</a>).</p>
<p>In Palestine proper there were two important divisions: the plain of Esdraelon and the Negev. The plain of Esdraelon, often associated prophetically with Armageddon, lies between Galilee and Samaria. This is one of the most fertile areas of Palestine and also was the scene of numerous battles. The plain was guarded by fortress cities on its southern side (Megiddo, Ibleam, and Taanach). In the OT the valley of Jezreel was not regarded as a part of Esdraelon but as the valley between the hill of Moreh and Mt Gilboa. At the eastern end was the stronghold of Beth-shan.</p>
<p>In the extreme south of the land is the wilderness area called the Negev, or South Country. This begins in the region of Beersheba and extends roughly to Kadesh-barnea. A district of infrequent and irregular rainfall, its agriculture is restricted, although a nomadic pastoral life has been widely practiced there. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Arabah_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Arabah</a>; <a href="?item=ConquestandAllotmentoftheLand_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Conquest and Allotment of the Land</a>; <a href="?item=DeadSea_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Dead Sea</a>; <a href="?item=Decapolis_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Decapolis</a>; <a href="?item=SeaofGalilee_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Sea of Galilee</a>; <a href="?item=JordanRiver_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jordan River</a>; <a href="?item=NegebNegev_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Negev</a>; <a href="?item=Shephelah_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Shephelah</a>; <a href="?item=Transjordan_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Transjordan</a>.</p>

  <title>Pamphylia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PAMPHYLIA</p>
<p class="fl">Coastal region on the southern shore of Asia Minor (Turkey) stretching 80 miles (128.7 kilometers) from Lycia on the west to Cilicia on the east, and about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) wide from the seacoast to the Taurus Mountains. Being little more than a narrow coastal plain with an unpleasantly hot and humid climate, this province produced few important cities. This, combined with its general inaccessibility—lying as it did deep at the north end of the bay of Adalia and separated from the rest of inland Asia by a rugged mountain range—made it a haven for pirates. In 102 <span class="era">BC</span> the Roman senate established patrol stations on the coasts of Pamphylia and western Cilicia to police the area, but no effective control was established until 67 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Pompey was given unlimited resources to clean up the Mediterranean.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="PaulandBarnabasTravelthroughPamphyliaattheEndoftheFirstMissionaryJourney"/>
<p>There was evidently a Jewish population in the province because Luke names Pamphylia among 15 countries from which Jews came to Jerusalem to the feast of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>). Some have argued that Pamphylia could not have possessed any significant numbers of Christians because it and Lycia are not mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Peter 1:1</a>, which seems to sum up the whole of Asia Minor. That argument is not convincing, however, because the date of the writing of 1 Peter is not known, and if it was written during the period from <span class="era">AD</span> 43 to 74, when Pamphylia was considered a part of Galatia, Pamphylia could have been included in that designation. Peter may also have considered Lycia in the broad designation of Galatia because his introduction mentions only the larger political divisions of Asia Minor. Nevertheless, it must be noted that Paul apparently had little success in the Pamphylian city of Perga, because there is no statement of opposition to him there or of any converts being made. He did not revisit the province on his second journey, even though his plan was to return and visit the Christians in every city where they had preached (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.36">Acts 15:36</a>). Perhaps Paul’s separation from Barnabas was the reason for this, and it may be that Barnabas and John Mark visited Pamphylia after Cyprus (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.37-41">37-41</a>).</p>

The combined city was famous for its temple, dedicated originally to the Syrian goddess Astarte, worshiped (according to Tacitus) with ancient Phoenician rites involving anointing of a conical stone (meteorite?). The Greeks identified her with Aphrodite, claiming she sprang from the sea.</p>
<p>At Paphos, Paul first met vigorous opposition to the gospel from Elymas. Here Paul performed his first recorded miracle. Mercifully, Elymas’s blindness was only “for a time” (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.11">Acts 13:11</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Early church leader of Hierapolis; chronicler of early Christianity. The information we have about Papias (<span class="era">AD</span> 60–130) and his work was given by Eusebius of Caesarea and Irenaeus of Lyons. Irenaeus stated that Papias had heard the apostle John preach and also knew Polycarp. Eusebius mentioned his <span class="ital">Explanation of the Sayings of the Lord.</span> In the preface to this work Papias maintains that his primary purpose was to bring forth a truthful record of a collection of the words and deeds of the apostles that were told to him by a presbyter. Irenaeus understood him to be alluding to the apostle John, but Eusebius contended that he referred to two Johns, one who was the apostle and the other who was the companion of Aristion.</p>
<p>Papias claimed that Mark, the Evangelist, who had never heard Christ, was the interpreter of Peter, and that he carefully gave an account of everything he remembered from the preaching of Peter. The statement that Matthew wrote down sayings of Jesus in Hebrew was affirmed by Papias. Irenaeus understood this as a reference to Hebraisms in Matthew’s Gospel, whereas Origen took this to mean that Matthew originally wrote his Gospel in Hebrew.</p>
<p>The statements of Papias have raised many questions concerning (1) the formation of the Gospels, (2) a possible Hebrew (Aramaic) version of Matthew, and (3) the possibility and identity of two Johns. According to tradition, Papias died a martyr.</p>

<p class="fl">An understanding of parables is essential if one is to understand the teaching of Jesus, since the parables make up approximately 35 percent of his recorded sayings. At no point are the vitality, relevance, and appropriateness of his teaching so clear as they are in his parables. While the parable form is not unique to Jesus, he was certainly a master at using parables as a way of teaching. The parables are not merely illustrations for Jesus’ preaching; they <span class="ital">are</span> the preaching, at least to a great extent. Nor are they simple stories; they have been truly described as both “works of art” and “weapons of warfare.” How one interprets the parables is not as easy a task as one might think. The way one understands the nature of a parable and the essence of Jesus’ message obviously will determine the method and content of interpretation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoryofInterpretation">History of Interpretation</p>
<p class="fl">A great deal of insight can be obtained by following the course of treatment the parables have received over the centuries. Not surprisingly, they have been subjected to radically different approaches. But the questions that underlie all interpretations are these: (1) How much of the parable is really significant—all the details or only one point? (2) What is the meaning of the parable in the teaching of Jesus? (3) Of what relevance is the parable to the interpreter?</p>
<p class="h3">The Allegorizing Approach</p>
<p class="fl">From the second century even to the present, many people have allegorized the parables. In effect, they have said that every detail in the account is significant and that the meaning and relevance of a parable are to be found in the way it portrays Christian theology. This method, often identified as the Alexandrian school of interpretation, is best illustrated by a classic example that comes from Augustine (<span class="era">AD</span> 354–430), the scholar who, despite his allegorizing, was a great theologian. His interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan views Christ as the good Samaritan, the oil as the comfort of good hope, the animal as the flesh of the Incarnation, the inn as the church, and the innkeeper as the apostle Paul (to say nothing of the other details). Obviously, this interpretation has nothing in common with Jesus’ intention but rather reads into the story preconceived ideas of the interpreter. Such an approach can sound good theologically, but it prohibits the hearing of the Word of God. Medieval interpreters went even further than the allegorizing approach by finding multiple meanings in the text. Usually four were listed: (1) the literal meaning; (2) an allegorical meaning relating to Christian theology; (3) a moral meaning giving direction for daily life; (4) a heavenly meaning indicating something about future life.</p>
<p>Not all of the church was dominated by such allegorizing interpretations. The school of Antioch was known for its commonsense approach to hearing the text. However, its influence was limited when compared to the Alexandrian school and, apart from notable exceptions, most of the church’s efforts at understanding the parables over the centuries have involved allegorizing.</p>
<p class="h3">The Approach of Adolph Julicher (1867–1938)</p>
<p class="fl">Julicher was a German scholar who published two volumes on the parables toward the end of the 19th century. His major contribution was the wholesale rejection of allegorizing as a means of interpreting the parables. In his reaction against allegorizing, Julicher went to the opposite extreme to say that a parable of Jesus has only one point of contact between the story and the fact being portrayed. He believed that this one point alone is important in interpretation and that it will usually be a general religious statement. Julicher went so far as to say that not only was allegorizing wrong but that Jesus did not use allegories, since they tend to hide rather than reveal. He said that any allegory appearing in the NT comes from the writers of the Gospels rather than Jesus. Julicher was correct to reject allegorizing (i.e., making an allegory of what was not intended to be allegory), but the rejection of allegory itself as a legitimate means of communication for Jesus is unfounded.</p>
<p class="h3">The Historical Approach</p>
<p class="fl">Twentieth-century study of the parables, particularly the work of C. H. Dodd (1884–1973) and Joachim Jeremias, has rightly emphasized the historical context in which the parables were originally told. Focus is placed on cultural factors that help in understanding the details of the parables and on the context of Jesus’ original preaching about the kingdom of God. Usually this approach has assumed that the first-century church changed the original thrust of some of the parables to meet her own needs, and consequently various procedures have been proposed to recover the original intent. It is true that the parables have been shaped, edited, and collected in units by the Gospel writers (note, e.g., Matthew’s collection of eight parables in <a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-52">Mt 13:1-52</a>). Also, the aim of an interpreter should be to hear the parables as they were originally intended by Jesus and as his original audience heard them. The attempt to go behind the Gospel accounts, however, is a delicate task, and some of the procedures proposed for doing so need to be questioned. Notice must be taken of the way each of the Gospel writers has used his material, but the extent to which one can go behind the Gospels is limited.</p>
<p class="h3">Modern Trends in Parable Research</p>
<p class="fl">In the past few decades a number of attempts to interpret the parables have suggested new avenues of approach. Basically these new approaches have been somewhat dissatisfied with (although appreciative of) both Julicher and the historical approach in that both limit the impact of the parables on today’s reader. Julicher reduced Jesus’ teaching to pious moralisms, and the historical approach tended to focus on 2,000 years ago while ignoring both the artistic and psychological features of the parables. Consequently, numerous attempts have been made to convey the same impact the parables had for the original hearers to today’s hearers. Increasingly, less focus is placed on the historical meaning of the parables and more emphasis is placed on their artistic, existential, and poetic effect. Jesus’ parables are regarded as works of art that can be regarded as open-ended as far as meaning is concerned. A parable, then, would have an original meaning and the potential for a series of further possible meanings. While the original meaning would provide some control for reinterpretation, these approaches are not bound by the author’s intention.</p>
<p>A great deal can be learned from modern approaches, especially from their concern to make sure that the parables speak to our day with their original vitality. However, there is also the danger of abusing the parables in a way similar to earlier mistreatments. Those allegorizing the parables in the history of the church were not bound by the meaning of Jesus and found their own meaning. Modern interpreters, too, can find their own meaning, and even though the explanations may sound convincing (as no doubt Augustine’s did to his hearers), they will not be a communication of the Word of God. If God and his ways are revealed by Jesus, then we err if we do not hear his parables as they were intended in their original context. There is indeed a dynamic interaction between the text and the interpreter, but the interpreter is brought to a moment of truth most effectively when the Spirit confronts him or her with the parable as Jesus intended it for his hearers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMeaningofParable">The Meaning of “Parable”</p>
<p class="fl">The usual definition of a parable as “an earthly story with a heavenly meaning” will not suffice for understanding Jesus’ parables. Nor are parables merely comparisons or illustrations of what Jesus wanted to say. The situation is much more complex with regard to the biblical meaning of the word “parable.” In fact, one must distinguish between three uses of the word “parable” in biblical studies.</p>
<p>First, one should be aware that the Greek word for parable and its Hebrew counterpart are both broad terms and can be used for anything from a proverb to a full-blown allegory, including a riddle, a dark saying, an illustration, a contrast, or a story. For example, the Greek word for parable is used in <a href="?bref=Luke.4.23">Luke 4:23</a> with reference to the saying “physician, heal yourself” and most translations render it as “proverb.” In <a href="?bref=Mark.3.23">Mark 3:23</a> “parables” is used with reference to the riddles Jesus asks the scribes, such as “How can Satan cast out Satan?” Similarly, <a href="?bref=Mark.13.28">Mark 13:28</a> uses “parable” of a simple illustration. In <a href="?bref=Luke.18.2-5">Luke 18:2-5</a> the unjust judge is <span class="ital">contrasted</span> with God, who brings justice quickly. If one compares the Hebrew OT and the Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation of the OT), the word for parable is used most frequently with reference to a proverb or dark saying. The broad meaning of “parable,” then, can refer to any of these methods used to stimulate thought.</p>
<p>Second, “parable” can be used of any story with two levels of meaning (literal and figurative) that functions as religious and ethical speech.</p>
<p>Third, “parable” can be used technically in modern studies to distinguish it from other types of stories, such as similitudes, exemplary stories, and allegories. In this case a parable is a fictitious story that narrates a particular event and is usually told in the past tense (e.g., the parable of the lost son). A similitude, however, is a comparison that relates a typical or recurring event in real life and is usually told in the present tense (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.13.31-32">Mt 13:31-32</a>). An exemplary story is not a comparison at all; rather, it presents character traits as either positive or negative examples to be imitated or avoided. Usually four exemplary stories are identified: the good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.30-35">Lk 10:30-35</a>), the rich fool (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.16-20">12:16-20</a>), the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">16:19-31</a>), and the Pharisee and the tax collector (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.10-13">18:10-13</a>).</p>
<p>Allegory is the most difficult to define and has caused considerable debate. Usually allegory is defined as “a series of related metaphors.” A metaphor is an implied comparison that does not use “like” or “as.” This definition is used broadly, but it is not entirely satisfactory for two reasons: (1) It does not indicate whether obscurity is an essential element in allegory. Some view allegory as needing to be decoded and as being understandable only to a select few. If, however, the allegory uses customary metaphors that all could understand, it would not be obscure. (2) It does not specify how much of the story is important as related metaphors. If there were only two or three related metaphors, would the story be an allegory? At the other extreme, do minor details in the story (such as the three levels of harvest in the parable of the sower) have significance? An example of an allegory would be the parable of the sower.</p>
<p>This raises the problem of the difference between a parable and an allegory—a frequently debated issue. On definitions one and two above, allegory is included in parable. But on definition three, a distinction is made between them because a parable is not a series of related metaphors. The details of the story of the lost son (the swine, the far country, etc.) do not stand for something else as they would if they were in an allegory but rather convey in dramatic terms the depths to which the son had sunk. However, a parable is <span class="ital">not</span> thereby limited to one point of comparison between the story and the fact being portrayed. There may be several items that need to be mentioned from a particular parable. The parable of the lost son emphasizes the rejoicing that takes place at repentance (note the repetition of this theme in <a href="?bref=Luke.15.24,32">Lk 15:24, 32</a>), but the receptivity of the father obviously parallels the grace of God and the younger and elder sons reflect sinners and religious authorities, respectively. The distinction between parable and allegory is vague at best and will vary, depending on what definitions are assigned the terms. One should note that what can be said about parable usually can also be said about allegory.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePurposeofParables">The Purpose of Parables</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of parables and a description of their characteristics will assist understanding. The parables focus on God and his kingdom and in doing so reveal what kind of God he is, by what principles he works, and what he expects of humanity. Because of the focus on the kingdom, some of the parables reveal many aspects of Jesus’ mission as well (note the parable of the wicked tenants in <a href="?bref=Matt.21.33-41">Mt 21:33-41</a>).</p>
<p>The following characteristics of parables should be observed: (1) Parables are usually concise and symmetrical. Items are presented in twos or threes with an economy of words. Unnecessary people, motives, and details are usually omitted. (2) The features in the story are taken from everyday life, and the metaphors used are frequently common enough that they set up a context for understanding. For example, the discussion of an owner and his vineyard would naturally make hearers think of God and his people because of the OT use of those images. (3) Even though the parables speak in terms of everyday life, often they contain elements of surprise or hyperbole (an exaggeration used as a figure of speech). The parable of the good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.30-35">Lk 10:30-35</a>) introduces a Samaritan in the story where one would probably expect a layperson. The parable of the unforgiving servant (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-34">Mt 18:23-34</a>) puts the debt of the first servant at $10 million, an unbelievable sum in that day. (4) Parables require their hearers to pass judgment on the events of the story and, having done so, to realize that they must make a similar judgment in their own lives. The classic example is the parable of Nathan to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.1-7">2 Sm 12:1-7</a>), where David judges the man in the story as worthy of death and then is told that he is the man. Because they force one to decide, to come to a moment of truth, the parables force their hearers to live in the present without resting on the laurels of the past or waiting for the future. The parables are the result of a mind that sees truth in concrete pictures rather than abstractions, and they teach that truth in such a compelling manner that the hearer cannot escape it.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheReasonJesusTaughtinParables">The Reason Jesus Taught in Parables</p>
<p class="fl">There is little doubt that Jesus taught in parables because they are both interesting and compelling and therefore are one of the most effective means of communicating. When one reads <a href="?bref=Mark.4.10-12">Mark 4:10-12</a>, however, it seems that Jesus taught in parables in order to <span class="ital">keep</span> people from understanding so that they would not turn and be forgiven. It seems as well that there is a mystery that is given to the <span class="ital">in</span> group and that the <span class="ital">out</span> group is prohibited from learning. Herein is the meaning of the term “mystery.” Rather than being that which is not known or understood, as the word is used today, the biblical use of this word is usually for that which has been revealed by God and would not have been known had God not revealed it. The content of the mystery is not explained here, but from Jesus’ teaching on the kingdom elsewhere, it probably refers to the fact that the kingdom is present in Jesus’ own words and actions.</p>
<p>The other factor crucial for understanding this passage is that the word “parable” in biblical usage has a broad meaning referring to any striking speech or dark saying intended to stimulate thought. Jesus did not spoon-feed his hearers; rather, he taught in such a way as to bring about a response, and where there was a response, he gave additional teaching. Consequently, it is not merely that parables are interesting, poetic, and arresting (as important as those characteristics are). In addition, parables stimulate thought and bring about response—if hardness of heart does not prevent it. It is as if Jesus were saying, “If you cannot hear what I am saying, I will reveal my thought in parables.” Where there is response to this initial teaching, additional information is given.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">Paraclete*</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration of a Greek word meaning “one who is called to someone’s aid” or “one who advocates for another.” Thus, the term may be used technically for a lawyer. More generally, the word denotes one who acts in another’s behalf as a mediator, an intercessor, or an encourager. In <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 John 2:1</a> Christ is called a paraclete because he represents people to God. This function is akin to his ministry as High Priest (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.7.25-28">Heb 7:25-28</a>).</p>
<p>The most numerous uses of “paraclete” come in John’s Gospel, all referring to the work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.14.16,26">Jn 14:16, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.13">16:13</a>). In these passages Jesus declares that the Holy Spirit will come from the Father when he departs. The Paraclete, also called “the Spirit of truth,” will lead them into all truth and aid them in their ability to recall correctly Jesus’ message. He is to become their special replacement for the departed Lord.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Paradise">
  <title>Paradise</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">Paradise</p>
<p class="fl">Term borrowed from Persian that means “garden of god.” The Hebrews originally used a word that they applied not only to ordinary gardens but also to God’s garden in Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-3.24">Gn 2–3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.3">Is 51:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.13">Ez 28:13</a>). Comparatively late in their history, they adapted from the Persian language the word that afterward became “paradise”; it appears three times in the OT referring to a park or orchard (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.8">Neh 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.5">Eccl 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.13">Sg 4:13</a>). Later still, when the OT was translated into Greek, there was a Greek form of the same word, and the translators used it extensively for “garden”; for Greek-speaking Jews, the garden of <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">Genesis 2</a> became <span class="greek">paradeisos</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>The idea of the original Persian word was that of an enclosure or walled garden. It referred particularly to the royal parks of the Persian kings, and this was how the Greeks came to know it. Both ideas fit well with the Hebrews’ picture of a garden where the Lord God walked (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8">Gn 3:8</a>) and from which his subjects could be excluded (v <a href="?bref=Gen.3.24">24</a>). Further important features of the Genesis paradise were its fruit trees and its rivers.</p>
<p>By NT times, this picture of God’s garden had developed in various ways, which are paralleled, not unexpectedly, in the folk beliefs of many nations. Like the Golden Age in Greek and Roman mythology, paradise was first of all something belonging to the remote past. But the Jews came to believe that it still existed in some undiscoverable place; like the Elysian fields, it was inhabited by the deserving dead. Then, with ever more elaborate descriptions of its glories, they wrote of its eventual reappearance at the end of this age.</p>
<p>Thus, in the idea of paradise converge all myths of another world, past, present, and future, where death and evil have no place. The NT witnesses to the truth that is at the core of all such beliefs. Paradise is the place into which, as an actual but otherworldly reality, Paul was once mysteriously “caught up” during his lifetime (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.4">2 Cor 12:4</a>). It is also the place where the repentant thief on the cross was promised he would be, with Christ, immediately after his death (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.43">Lk 23:43</a>). The third and last NT reference, a similar promise (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.7">Rv 2:7</a>), tells us in addition that paradise is where the tree of life grows, and so identifies it both with the original world of <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">Genesis 2</a> and with the future world of <a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-21">Revelation 22</a>, complete with the life-giving tree and river, the encircling wall, and the presence of the king.</p>

  <title>Paradox*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">Paradox*</p>
<p class="fl">Form of expression that seems to be either self-contradictory or absurd but at another level expresses fundamental truth. It is often employed to get hearers to think at a deeper and more critical level. It may often be closely related to hyperbole, an exaggerated statement, except that for the paradox there is an apparent element of contradiction, which arrests attention and demands consideration.</p>
<p>In the ministry of Jesus one finds it in such expressions as grown persons being born again. “Can a man enter a second time into his mother’s womb,” Nicodemus asks, “and be born?” (<a href="?bref=John.3.4">Jn 3:4</a>). Or again, in response to the attempts of rich men to enter the kingdom, Jesus says that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle (an impossibility) than for a rich man to enter the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.25">Mk 10:25</a>). The point is not to focus on the literal statement or take it word for word but to understand its essential purpose. In this instance, it is a form of “shock treatment” to force the wealthy to see how their attitudes toward wealth have excluded them from the kingdom.</p>
<p>Much of the use of paradox in Jesus’ ministry has to do with his attempts to show that the perspective, or value system, of the kingdom represents a complete reversal of the values by which people live. Whosoever will lose his life will find it (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.39">Mt 10:39</a>). The last shall be first, and the first last (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.30">Lk 13:30</a>). Whoever would be greatest of all must be servant of all (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.43">Mk 10:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.26">Lk 22:26</a>). Indeed, the servant ministry of Jesus himself underscores this great reversal of the kingdom. After washing the feet of the disciples, Jesus says, “You call me Teacher and Lord; and you are right, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet” (<a href="?bref=John.13.13-14">Jn 13:13-14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Paradox also enters Christian expression when one attempts to speak of God in the language of men. Thus God is “before all time.” Even “God in flesh” is paradoxical yet profoundly true. People inevitably and of necessity speak of God in terms of their own experience, yet God cannot be limited by such experience or language, for he is infinitely greater. Hence, language is a limited instrument for speaking of him who is not limited.</p>

<p class="fl">Symptom of an organic disease of the central nervous system affecting the temporary or permanent loss of sensation and/or voluntary muscle control. This degenerative condition was usually incurable. A few cases of paralysis (palsy) are mentioned in the NT, all of which occur in connection with Christ’s healing ministry.</p>
<p>Paralytics were included in the group of ailing people seeking Jesus’ healing in Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.24">Mt 4:24</a>), numbered among the sick at Bethesda in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=John.5.3">Jn 5:3</a>), and represented among those cured by Philip in Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.7">Acts 8:7</a>). The paralyzed servant of the centurion was described by Luke as very sick and at the point of death (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.2">Lk 7:2</a>). This man was probably victimized by an often fatal form of paralysis that begins in the legs and spreads rapidly upward through the rest of the body. The paralytic at Capernaum was most likely ailing from paraplegia, a paralysis of the lower half of the body (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.2,6">Mt 9:2, 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.3-10">Mk 2:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.18,24">Lk 5:18, 24</a>).

<p>The wilderness of Paran is a wild, arid expanse of tableland, mountains, gorges, and wadis. The lack of water and vegetation made it a most inhospitable place and a stark contrast to the land flowing with milk and honey that was promised to Israel.</p>
<p>This wilderness became the home of Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.20-21">Gn 21:20-21</a>). The nation of Israel camped there on the way from Egypt to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.10.12">Nm 10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.16">12:16</a>).

<p class="h1">PAROUSIA*</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration of a Greek word meaning “presence,” “arrival,” “appearance,” or “coming.” While it is used often with reference to people (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.17">1 Cor 16:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.6">2 Cor 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.10">10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.26">Phil 1:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.12">2:12</a>) and once with reference to the Antichrist (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.9">2 Thes 2:9</a>), the word is employed most frequently with reference to Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.3,27,37-39">Mt 24:3, 27, 37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">1 Cor 15:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.19">1 Thes 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.13">3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15">4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">5:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1,8">2 Thes 2:1, 8</a>). Consequently, the Parousia has come to denote the second coming of Christ at the end of the ages.</p>
<p>Paul was probably responsible for the technical emphasis on Christ’s return. While rejecting all attempts to calculate the time (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-2">1 Thes 5:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.2-3">2 Thes 2:2-3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.24.4-36">Mt 24:4-36</a>), he nonetheless paints a vivid picture of the Parousia (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-18">1 Thes 4:13-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7-2.8">2 Thes 1:7–2:8</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20-28,50-55">1 Cor 15:20-28, 50-55</a>). According to his teaching, it will be a personal, visible, sudden, and glorious coming (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">1 Cor 15:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.19">1 Thes 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.13">3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15-17">4:15-17</a>). Though apparently he felt he and his readers would experience Christ’s return (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15">1 Thes 4:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Rom 8:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.11">13:11</a>), his approaching martyrdom caused him to moderate his thinking (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>). James, also sensing the delay in Christ’s return, called for patience (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.7-8">Jas 5:7-8</a>). Peter, too, cautioned against allowing the delay to create doubt (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.8-10">2 Pt 3:8-10</a>). The message is not myth (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16">2 Pt 1:16</a>), and scoffers will be silenced (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.3-4">3:3-4</a>). John encouraged consistent faith lest the believer be put to shame at his coming (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.28">1 Jn 2:28</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PARTHIA*, PARTHIANS</p>
<p class="fl">Land (roughly corresponding to modern Iran) lying beyond the eastern boundaries of the Roman Empire, and so almost outside the world of the NT.</p>
<p>It is included, however, in maps of the OT world, which generally encompass Eastern territory. Many Jews deported from Palestine after the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions were living in this area when in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> it became part of the vast Persian Empire of Cyrus, and thousands stayed on in spite of Cyrus’s offer of repatriation. Two centuries afterward, that empire was conquered by Alexander the Great. But 100 years later several parts of it, including Parthia, threw off the yoke of his successors and became independent.</p>
<p>Parthia eventually became a great empire, stretching from the Euphrates to the Indus. In the NT period, even mighty Rome regarded it as a potential threat. The first confrontation between the two powers actually resulted in a defeat for the Romans (at Carrhae, the biblical Haran, in 53 <span class="era">BC</span>). Only in the second century <span class="era">AD</span> did the balance shift, and even then, though twice annexed, Parthia twice recovered its independence. It fell eventually in <span class="era">AD</span> 226, not to the Romans, but to a neo-Persian coup within its own borders.</p>
<p>Wealthy because of their position astride Asian trade routes, and militarily strong because of their famous mounted bowmen, who won many a battle by apparently retreating and then shooting at the pursuing enemy (hence the phrase “parting [or ‘Parthian’] shot”), the Parthians seem also to have been a tolerant people. A large Jewish community continued to live among them, and at the time of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>) their province of Babylonia had, curiously enough, a Jewish governor. More important, Jews from Parthia, and possibly also Parthian converts to Judaism (“proselytes”), were in Jerusalem on that epoch-making day (v <a href="?bref=Acts.2.9">9</a>). By them the gospel may have been taken, within weeks of the resurrection, well on its way to India.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Passion">
  <title>Passion*</title>

<p class="h1">PASSION*</p>
<p class="fl">A derivative from Latin meaning “suffering.” It is used in some translations (<span class="sc">kjv</span> and <span class="sc">rsv</span>) in <a href="?bref=Acts.1.3">Acts 1:3</a> to refer to the sufferings of Jesus. Throughout the centuries Christians have referred to Jesus’ sufferings as his Passion.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNatureofthePassion">The Nature of the Passion</p>
<p class="fl">Each of the four Gospels has what is called a Passion narrative, which is the section recording the sufferings of Jesus on the night of his arrest and the following day leading up to his death. Matthew includes it in chapters <a href="?bref=Matt.26.1-27.66">26–27</a>, Mark in chapters <a href="?bref=Mark.14.1-15.47">14–15</a>, Luke in chapters <a href="?bref=Luke.22.1-23.56">22–23</a>, and John in chapters <a href="?bref=John.18.1-19.42">18–19</a>.</p>
<p>On the physical side of his Passion, Luke describes most graphically the agony Jesus experienced while at prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.41-44">Lk 22:41-44</a>). John (<a href="?bref=John.18.12">Jn 18:12</a>) tells us that Jesus was then bound and led to the high priest’s house, where he was first interrogated by Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, current holder of that office. This interrogation is recorded in <a href="?bref=John.18.19-24">John 18:19-24</a>.</p>
<p>Annas sent Jesus on to Caiaphas for further examination (<a href="?bref=John.18.24">Jn 18:24</a>). At this stage the soldiers guarding Jesus indulged in some foul play—beating him and asking him (when blindfolded) to prophesy who had hit him (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.63-65">Lk 22:63-65</a>). At daybreak the Sanhedrin, or Jewish Council, assembled and attempted to convict him but could not obtain consistent evidence against him.</p>
<p>Finally, the high priest asked him a question that led him to incriminate himself (in their eyes)—a procedure that was quite contrary to Jewish law (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.55-64">Mk 14:55-64</a>). By putting a direct question concerning Jesus’ messiahship, they compelled him to commit what they regarded as blasphemy, for they had closed their minds to the possibility that this could in fact be true.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Matt.26.67-68">Matthew 26:67-68</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.14.65">Mark 14:65</a> suggest that it was at this point that Jesus was ill-treated by his guards and possibly some members of the council. He was then taken under arrest to Pilate’s residence in Jerusalem, the Praetorium or garrison headquarters. Pilate appears to have conducted a preliminary examination of Jesus, and when he found that his hometown was in Galilee, sent Jesus to Herod as being under the latter’s jurisdiction. Jesus refused to answer any of Herod’s questions, and so the Jewish tetrarch sent Jesus back to the governor—after mocking Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.1-12">Lk 23:1-12</a>). Pilate then appears to have wanted to enlist the crowd’s sympathy for Jesus and so had him scourged, after which he was dressed in a purple robe (possibly the one given him by Herod; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.11">Lk 23:11</a>) and a crown of thorns. The scourging could have been the regular prelude to crucifixion, or it may have been an attempt to suggest that he had punished Jesus enough (v <a href="?bref=Luke.23.16">16</a>). It was inflicted by the flagellum (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.15">Mk 15:15</a>)—a leather whip whose thongs were weighted with jagged pieces of bone and lead—while the victim’s hands were tied to a pillar. Even after this, Jesus faced more buffeting by the soldiers (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.27-31">Mt 27:27-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.16-20">Mk 15:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.3">Jn 19:3</a>) and then had to stand by while Pilate tried weakly to negotiate with the mob, who by now had been stirred up by his opponents to clamor for Jesus’ death (<a href="?bref=John.19.1-16">Jn 19:1-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.11-26">Mt 27:11-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.1-15">Mk 15:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.18-25">Lk 23:18-25</a>). All was in vain, and Pilate handed him over to the execution squad. It is not surprising that after all this ill-treatment, Jesus appears to have been unable to carry the cross (either the cross piece only or the whole of this instrument of execution) to Calvary, and so Simon of Cyrene was pressed into carrying it for him (see <a href="?bref=Mark.15.21">Mk 15:21</a> and parallels). Once this grim destination was reached, the soldiers lost little time in nailing him to the cross. Traditionally, this was done by driving a nail through each hand and a longer nail through both feet together. The cross was then set upright into a socket in the ground (or the cross piece hauled up on the piece already standing upright), and Jesus was left to hang there until he expired from loss of blood after the scourging (which in itself sometimes proved fatal) or from a ruptured heart caused by the strain on the muscles of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Apart from the physical side of the Passion, we must not forget that Jesus also experienced the mental agony of being betrayed by his friends and forsaken by his followers. There was the further suffering of knowing that all he went through was totally undeserved, him being completely innocent of all the charges trumped up against him. The Jews prided themselves on the quality of their religion, and the Romans on the standards of their law, and yet it was paradoxically the misunderstanding of Jewish religion and the misuse of Roman law that enabled his enemies to hound him to the cross.</p>
<p>Most of all, there was the spiritual suffering of knowing that he was going to be “made sin, who knew no sin” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>) and consequently separated from God. This was why Jesus, at a moment when many martyrs have known the presence and reality of God in a marked degree, uttered his stark cry of dereliction—“My God, my God, why have you deserted me?” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.34">Mk 15:34</a> and parallels).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheUniquenessofthePassion">The Uniqueness of the Passion</p>
<p class="fl">It is evident from the pages of the NT that the “good news” with which the first Christians turned the ancient world upside down was that “Christ died for our sins just as the Scriptures said he would, and that he was buried, and that three days afterwards he arose from the grave just as the prophets foretold” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>, <span class="sc">tlb</span>). This was the basic message of Peter (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.22-36">Acts 2:22-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.12-21">3:12-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.36-43">10:36-43</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">1 Pt 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a>) and Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.26-39">Acts 13:26-39</a>) and is also central to the thinking of John (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.10">4:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.1.5">Rv 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.9">5:9</a>) and the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.9,17">Heb 2:9, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.28">9:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.12">10:12</a>). The fact that Jesus was sinless qualified him to bear the sins of the whole world and thus achieve what no human being has ever been able, or will ever be able, to do: bear the consequences of, and punishment for, human sin.</p>

<p class="h1">PASTOR</p>
<p class="fl">Word literally meaning “shepherd,” used in both the OT and NT in a figurative sense for rulers and leaders. Of the 12 times the word is used in the NT as a metaphor for “leader,” it is translated as “pastor” only in <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Ephesians 4:11</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">asv</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">tev</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Pastors and teachers together formed a group who complemented the work of apostles, prophets, and evangelists. The titles “bishop” and “elder” refer to the same office in the NT (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.20.17,28">Acts 20:17, 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.5-7">Ti 1:5-7</a>), and “pastor” seems to be practically synonymous with them, as shown by Jesus being referred to as “the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">1 Pt 2:25</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The verb “to shepherd” is used to describe the work of local church leaders (<a href="?bref=John.21.16">Jn 21:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.2">1 Pt 5:2</a>), and often the congregation is called a flock. It is the pastor’s responsibility to build up the body of Christ by watching over the congregation (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.7">Heb 13:7</a>) and countering false teaching (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.29-30">Acts 20:29-30</a>). More detailed information regarding the duties and responsibilities of pastors is found in Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus, which have come to be called the Pastoral Letters.</p>

<p class="fl">Seaport of the ancient region of Lycia, now located in modern Turkey. The ancient city, one of the largest and most prosperous of the region, was a center of trade and commerce. A temple to Apollo stood in Patara. Remains of a theater and baths can still be seen there. Prevailing winds made Patara a convenient place for ships to begin their voyages to the eastern Mediterranean.

<p class="h1">PATH</p>
<p class="fl">A worn track or road. “Path(s)” and “pathway(s)” are used to translate a variety of words used in the Bible: (1) a well-trodden and much-used roadway (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.17">Gn 49:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.11">Pss 16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.139.3">139:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.2.8,19">Prv 2:8, 19</a>); (2) a thoroughfare or highway (<a href="?bref=Isa.59.7">Is 59:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.8">Jl 2:8</a>); (3) a beaten track as across fields, over hills, and through valleys (<a href="?bref=Job.30.13">Jb 30:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.35">Ps 119:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.17">Prv 3:17</a>); (4) a track or passage in which the idea of flowing along is included (<a href="?bref=Ps.77.19">Ps 77:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.15">Jer 18:15</a>); (5) a circular path, as in a trench or in a parapet (<a href="?bref=Ps.65.11">Ps 65:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.2.9">Prv 2:9</a>); and (6) a narrow passage, as through a hole (<a href="?bref=Num.22.24">Nm 22:24</a>). “Path” is used to translate the Greek words meaning a worn track (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.3">Mt 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.3">Mk 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.4">Lk 3:4</a>) and a wheel rut (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.13">Heb 12:13</a>).</p>
<p>A careful review of the use of the terms “path(s)” and “pathway(s)” reveals that the Bible uses them literally to speak of a stretch of ground over which traffic passes. This could be in the form of a crooked mountain path, an unpaved and much-traveled way, or a well-prepared pavement. Biblical writers also used the words metaphorically to speak of or to describe the way human life is lived in relation to God, and how God directs, and can and does either enrich or impoverish human life. Writers used the terms figuratively to refer to human conduct and experiences in the midst of the various dimensions of human life. Especially colorful in the last two uses are such expressions as the path of life (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.11">Ps 16:11</a>), the plain (level) path (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.11">27:11</a>), the good path (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.9">Prv 2:9</a>), the path of the wicked (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.14">4:14</a>), the path of the just (v <a href="?bref=Pr.4.18">18</a>), the path of judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.14">Is 40:14</a>), the right paths (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.11">Prv 4:11</a>), and paths of peace (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.17">3:17</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">The region of Upper Egypt, mentioned five times in the Hebrew OT (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.1,15">Jer 44:1, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.14">Ez 29:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.14">30:14</a>). Each time it occurs in conjunction with a city in Lower Egypt (Noph = Memphis, or Zoan = Tanis). The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">Pathros</span><span class="ital">,</span> and the Egyptian is <span class="ital">pa to resy</span> (“the Southern Land”). Egyptologists believe that the Hebrew form is a corruption of <span class="ital">Pethoris</span> or <span class="ital">Pethores.</span> <a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Isaiah 11:11</a> suggests that <span class="hebrew">Mitsrayim</span> is to be equated with Lower and Middle Egypt, and <span class="hebrew">Pathros</span> is the region south of it up to the border of Cush (i.e., Upper Egypt). According to <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.14">Ezekiel 29:14</a>, Pathros is the original home of the Egyptians. The prophets spoke about God’s judgment on Pathros: “I will lay waste Upper Egypt [“Pathros,” mg], set fire to Zoan and inflict punishment on Thebes” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.14">Ez 30:14</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). After the exile, Jews migrated to Egypt and some settled in Pathros. Jeremiah warned that God’s judgment on Egypt was to come and that they would not escape it: “This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt—in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis—and in Upper Egypt [Pathros]: ‘This is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah.

  <title>Patience</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PATIENCE</p>
<p class="fl">Ability to take a great deal of punishment from evil people or circumstances without losing one’s temper, without becoming irritated and angry, or without taking vengeance. It includes the capacity to bear pain or trials without complaint, the ability to forbear under severe provocation, and the self-control that keeps one from acting rashly even though suffering opposition or adversity.</p>
<p>The usual Hebrew expression for patience is related to the verb “to be long” and involves the idea of being long to get riled or slow to become angry. Two different Greek words were translated by the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translators with the word “patience.” One of the words has the idea of “remaining firm under” tests and trials and is better translated “endurance” or “steadfastness.” The other Greek word is related to the above Hebrew meaning and refers to patience as “long-spiritedness” or “calmness of spirit” even though under severe provocation to lose one’s temper.</p>
<p>The great biblical illustration of patience in operation is God himself. Several passages speak of him, in conjunction with other gracious attributes, as “slow to anger.” In a context that stresses Israel’s rebellion and provocation of God, he is contrasted as a God who is forgiving, gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.17">Neh 9:17</a>). The psalmist declares, “Thou, O Lord, art a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness” (<a href="?bref=Ps.86.15">Ps 86:15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see also <a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Ex 34:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.18">Nm 14:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.8">Ps 103:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.13">Jl 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.4.2">Jon 4:2</a>). In addition, the virtue of a patient spirit on the part of mankind is extolled in the OT, especially in Proverbs (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.29">Prv 14:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.18">15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.32">16:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.25.15">25:15</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.8">Eccl 7:8</a>).</p>
<p>The NT also stresses the patience of the Lord. It is God’s kindness, forbearance, and patience that lead people to repentance (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.4">Rom 2:4</a>). God was patient in holding off the Flood for the sinners of Noah’s day while the ark was being built, thereby giving more time for repentance (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.20">1 Pt 3:20</a>). Probably the greatest of the NT references to God’s patience is in <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.9">2 Peter 3:9</a>. The delay in Christ’s return is not an indication of slowness on God’s part, says Peter, but of his long-suffering, not being willing that anyone should perish. A specific reference to Jesus Christ’s patience is made by Paul, who claimed that, in his case, Jesus was able to demonstrate perfect patience (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.16">1 Tm 1:16</a>).</p>
<p>Patience, which is an attribute of our God and of our Lord Jesus Christ, is also to characterize each Christian. Paul’s prayer for the Colossians is that they might demonstrate this quality (<a href="?bref=Col.1.11">Col 1:11</a>). It is one of the fruits of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>), an attribute of love (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.4">1 Cor 13:4</a>), and a virtue (<a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.10">2 Tm 3:10</a>). In addition, Christians are exhorted to be patient (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.14">1 Thes 5:14</a>). If we are not, we will be treated as the slave in a parable that Jesus told. This slave pleaded with his lord, to whom he owed a great sum, for patience, promising to pay all. The lord was patient and forgave all the debt, until he found out that the slave had refused to show the same patience to a fellow servant who owed him a pittance in comparison (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.26-29">Mt 18:26-29</a>).</p>
<p>In some contexts, the word “patience” takes on the more general meaning of waiting long and expectantly for something. The farmer waits patiently for the crop to come (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.7">Jas 5:7b</a>). Abraham waited patiently for God’s promise to give him the land of Canaan to be fulfilled and died without seeing what was promised, although still believing (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.15">Heb 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.39">11:39</a>). Finally, all Christians are commanded to be long-suffering until the coming of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.7">Jas 5:7a</a>).</p>

  <title>Patmos</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PATMOS</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="PatmosandtheSevenLocalChurchesinRevelation"/>
<p class="fl">Small island in the Aegean Sea, located about 35 miles (56.3 kilometers) west of the city of Miletus off the coast of Asia Minor. Patmos is about ten miles (16.1 kilometers) long and six miles (9.7 kilometers) wide at its northern end, consisting of rocky volcanic hills.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Revelation 1:9</a> John says that he was on the island of Patmos “for preaching the word of God and speaking about Jesus” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). He also indicates that he is a fellow participant in their “suffering.” The Roman historian Tacitus informs us that the Romans used some of the Aegean islands as places of banishment and exile during the first century (<span class="ital">Annals</span> 3.68; 4.30; 15.71). Thus the language of the author and the evidence of Tacitus, joined to Christian traditions from the second and third centuries about John’s banishment, support the likelihood that Patmos was a place of exile or political confinement.</p>
<p>In a time when the Asian churches were undergoing persecution, John wrote to them from this island. He addressed each of seven churches by means of a letter of encouragement and warning. The series of letters is followed by the author’s account of the divinely sent vision of impending judgment, which “must soon take place” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.6">Rv 22:6</a>). Patmos, then, was the location from which this NT writing originated.</p>

  <title>Patriarchs, Period of the</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PATRIARCHS, P<span class="lc">eriod of the</span></p>
<p class="fl">Period of time during which the biblical fathers of Israel lived. The Bible tells of long-lived patriarchs before the Flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-5.32">Gn 1–5</a>), of Noah (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-9.29">6–9</a>), and of a line of patriarchs after the Flood (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-11.32">10–11</a>). However, the word in the narrower sense usually refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-36.43">12–36</a>), with the addition of Joseph (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.37.1-50.26">37–50</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Exact dating of the patriarchs is difficult because, apart from the kings mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-2">Genesis 14:1-2</a>, we do not have any fixed external point of reference from which to calculate. While this chapter does refer to historical persons and places, we cannot identify with certainty any one of the kings. The Italian excavators of Tell Mardikh (ancient Ebla) have reported finding the names of the “Cities of the Plain” of <a href="?bref=Gen.14.2">Genesis 14:2</a> (whose destruction is reported in <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">Gn 19</a>) and even the name of one of their kings on the clay tablets excavated. These clay tablets seem to date from well before 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>, which is too early for Abraham; all that they would prove is that the cities were in existence long before his time. What we can say is that the patriarchs must have belonged to the middle Bronze Age, probably early in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, and that this was the general period of the Amorite “drift” into Palestine from the north and the west. The most usual modern view is that the Amorite migration was in two “waves,” the earlier one being seminomadic (like Abraham’s friends Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, <a href="?bref=Gen.14.13">Gn 14:13</a>), and the second and later wave, probably from Syria in the north, being urbanizers and settlers (the group usually described as “the Amorites” in the catalog of the various races in Canaan, e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.3.8">Ex 3:8</a>). The society of the time of the patriarchs has been described as “dimorphic,” or twofold. On the one hand, there were the city communities, while on the other there were open village settlements and seminomadic tribes that at times were loosely grouped around the towns and at times drifted away from them. It is against this sort of background that we must imagine the patriarchs. Joseph, of course, lived in the fully settled world of Egypt, but Scripture does not give us the name of the pharaoh of his day.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GeographicalRange">Geographical Range</p>
<p class="fl">For such an early period, and seeing that it is really only the chronicle of one family, the patriarchal history has a remarkable geographic and climatic range, covering many hundreds of miles of varied country. It begins at Ur, an old Sumerian city on the Persian Gulf at one extreme end of the Fertile Crescent. Then the center of interest moves far to the northwest, to Haran on the Balikh River, between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers in their upper courses. Then the action sweeps far southwest to Palestine. But twice the interest moves back to Haran, and twice it goes into the Egyptian Delta. This is truly history on a wide canvas. Even when in Palestine, there is no fixed, quiet center of life. The patriarchs are endlessly on the move, backward and forward, mostly along the north-south mountain spine, but sometimes also in the coastal plain and even in Transjordan. Nor is there steady development; some groups slip away from the seminomadic life to join the city cultures (like Lot in <a href="?bref=Gen.13.12">Gn 13:12</a>), while others melt back into the desert or semidesert (like Ishmael in <a href="?bref=Gen.25.18">25:18</a>, or Esau in <a href="?bref=Gen.36.6-8">36:6-8</a>). Yet always at the center the life of the patriarchs goes on.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Importance">Importance</p>
<p class="fl">It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the place of the patriarchs in God’s gradually unfolding plan of redemption. The process that is to culminate in the coming of Christ begins with Abraham (<a href="?bref=John.8.56">Jn 8:56</a>). This is not, of course, to deny that in a more general sense God’s plan of salvation begins to unfold in the opening chapters of Genesis. But in a more special way, God’s particular revelation begins with the call of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>) and continues, with ever-increasing clarity, through the lives of the other patriarchs. It is no accident that the Bible speaks of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob even at the moment when a further revelation is about to be made to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6">Ex 3:6</a>). This is because the revelation made to the earlier patriarchs is the foundation of all that follows; indeed, we in the New Covenant look back to Abraham as our “father” too (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.16">Rom 4:16</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="FamilyandCulturalBackground">Family and Cultural Background</p>
<p class="fl">Paul was born around <span class="era">AD</span> 10, a Jew in a family of Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.6">Acts 23:6</a>) of the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>) in Tarsus of Cilicia (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.11">Acts 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.39">21:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">22:3</a>), a center of commerce and learning that embraced the Hellenistic spirit and Roman politics. It was a city of which he could be proud (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.39">21:39</a>). His parents named him Saul, perhaps after the first king of Israel, who was also a Benjaminite (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.15">1 Sm 11:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.21">Acts 13:21</a>), but <a href="?bref=Acts.13.9">Acts 13:9</a> notes that he “was also called Paul.” He uses the Roman name Paul throughout his letters.</p>
<p>From religious parents Paul received knowledge of the Law and Prophets and the Hebrew and Aramaic languages (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.40">Acts 21:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.2-3">22:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.6">23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.14">Gal 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.5-6">Phil 3:5-6</a>). Tarsus, however, was not a Jewish city. Rather, it had a Greek character, being a place where the Greek language was spoken and Greek literature was cultivated. This accounts for Paul’s familiarity with Greek (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.37">Acts 21:37</a>), the language of the streets and shops of Tarsus.</p>
<p>Jews were brought to Tarsus, the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia, in 171 <span class="era">BC</span> to promote business in the region. At that time Paul’s ancestors were probably given Roman citizenship. Paul inherited from his father both Tarsisian and Roman citizenship, which would prove to be of great value to Paul in his later life as he traveled with the gospel throughout the Roman Empire (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37">Acts 16:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.25-29">22:25-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.27">23:27</a>). Paul may have had several brothers and sisters, but <a href="?bref=Acts.23.16">Acts 23:16</a> mentions only one sister, whose son performed a lifesaving act for his uncle.</p>
<p>Paul was a tent maker (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.3">Acts 18:3</a>). He may have learned this trade from his father, or he may have selected it as a means of self-support, as was the custom of those in rabbinical training. Tarsus was well known for the goat’s-hair cloth called cilicium. It was the weaving of this cloth and the fashioning of it into tents, sails, awnings, and cloaks that gave Paul his economic independence during his apostolic ministry (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.3">Acts 18:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.34">20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.30">28:30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.9">2 Cor 11:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">1 Thes 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.8">2 Thes 3:8</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Although born in Tarsus, Paul testified to the Jews in Jerusalem that he had been brought up in this city and studied under Gamaliel (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">Acts 22:3</a>). It is not clear when Paul was first brought to Jerusalem, but it is likely that sometime between the ages of 13 and 20 he began his formal rabbinical studies. His teacher, Gamaliel, was the grandson of Hillel, founder of a Pharisaic school whose teachings run through the Talmudic writings to this day. This is the same Gamaliel whose wisdom persuaded the Sanhedrin to spare the lives of Peter and the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.33-40">5:33-40</a>). No doubt, it was while studying under Gamaliel in Hillel’s school that Paul began to advance in Judaism beyond many Jews of his own age and became extremely zealous for the traditions of his fathers (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.14">Gal 1:14</a>). Perhaps then also Paul began to experience the struggles with the law he would later describe in <a href="?bref=Rom.7.1-25">Romans 7</a>.</p>
<p>While Paul was studying the Jewish law in Jerusalem, Jesus was working as a carpenter in Nazareth. Then Jesus gathered the disciples who would one day be Paul’s coworkers in the gospel, fulfilled his ministry, and accomplished redemption on the cross of Calvary (<span class="era">AD</span> 30). Christ’s resurrection gave birth to the church, which was baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SaulthePersecutor">Saul the Persecutor</p>
<p class="fl">Shortly after these world-changing events, the members of certain synagogues in Jerusalem, including the Cilician synagogue, that of Paul’s native land (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>), could not withstand the wisdom and spirit (v <a href="?bref=Acts.6.10">10</a>) of a member of the church in Jerusalem named Stephen (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5,8">5, 8</a>). They accused him of blasphemy before the Sanhedrin (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.6.11-15">11-15</a>) and after his eloquent defense (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-53">7:1-53</a>) dragged him out of the city, where he was stoned to death. He became the first Christian martyr. The record does not fully reveal the role Paul played in these proceedings, but we know that he was present and prominent because the witnesses against Stephen, who were required to throw the first stones in the execution, “laid their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul [Paul]” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.7.58">58</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>At Stephen’s trial, Paul heard Stephen’s historical method of defense, and he later used it himself at Antioch of Pisidia (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.16-41">Acts 13:16-41</a>). He witnessed the man with the face of an angel (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.15">6:15</a>), full of the Holy Spirit, looking above and proclaiming “the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.56">7:56</a>). Stephen’s death initiated the events that would culminate in Paul’s conversion and commission as the apostle to the Gentiles. But at that time Paul was a leader of the oppressors of the church. He breathed threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1">9:1</a>); he persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.13">Gal 1:13</a>) by imprisoning Christians, both male and female (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.4">Acts 22:4</a>), in many cities.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ConversionandCalling">Conversion and Calling</p>
<p class="fl">Paul had obtained letters from the high priest in Jerusalem to the synagogues in Damascus authorizing him to arrest the believers there and bring them to Jerusalem for trial (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-2">Acts 9:1-2</a>). Paul traveled to Damascus for this purpose. Then, on the outskirts of the city, came the event that was to transform this law-keeping persecutor of Jesus Christ and blasphemous destroyer of the infant church into the chief propagator of the gospel of grace and master builder of the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.10">1 Cor 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.13">1 Tm 1:13</a>). This was the occasion of Paul’s conversion (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 31–33). It was of such revolutionary and lasting importance that three detailed accounts of it are given in the book of Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-19">Acts 9:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.1-21">22:1-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.1-23">26:1-23</a>), and many references are given to it in Paul’s own writings (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1">1 Cor 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8">15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.15-16">Gal 1:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.3">Eph 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.12">Phil 3:12</a>).</p>
<p>At that time a light from heaven, brighter than the midday sun, shone around Paul and his traveling companions, and they fell to the ground (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.13-14">Acts 26:13-14</a>). Only Paul, however, heard the voice of Jesus instruct him in his commission as a minister and witness to the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.26.14-18">14-18</a>). Temporarily blinded, Paul was led into Damascus (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.8">9:8</a>). There, the disciple Ananias and the Christian community forgave Paul, baptized him, and helped him through the bewildering event of his conversion (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.9.10-22">10-22</a>). After a short time with the church there, Paul was threatened with death by the Jews to whom he preached Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.9.20-22">20-22</a>), but he was protected by the believers and ingeniously delivered from his persecutors (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.9.23-25">23-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PreparationforMinistry">Preparation for Ministry</p>
<p class="fl">Then began a period of preparation, which lasted about 13 years. During this time, Paul first was in the desert of Arabia for three years. Here was his opportunity to pray and reflect on Stephen’s defense to the Sanhedrin, the momentous significance of his conversion, the vision he received of Jesus Christ, and the meaning of all this in the light of Jewish theology. Following this, Paul returned to Damascus and then visited Peter in Jerusalem for 15 days (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.17-18">Gal 1:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>At first, the disciples in Jerusalem were afraid of him because they did not believe he was a disciple of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.26">Acts 9:26</a>), but he was championed by Barnabas and thus accepted by the believers in Jerusalem (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.9.27-28">27-28</a>). While there, Paul may have heard the oral gospel, a summary of the words and deeds of Jesus, handed down to all converts. This would have included the institution of the Lord’s Supper (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.23-25">1 Cor 11:23-25</a>), specific words of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.35">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.10">1 Cor 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.14">9:14</a>), the appearances of the resurrected Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3-8">1 Cor 15:3-8</a>), and the spirit and character of Jesus (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1">2 Cor 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-8">Phil 2:5-8</a>). Paul also preached in Jerusalem, perhaps in the same synagogues in which he had heard Stephen. However, when his life was again threatened by the Jews, the believers sent him away to Tarsus (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.29-30">Acts 9:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.21">Gal 1:21</a>).</p>
<p>The end of Paul’s preparation came when Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for him and bring him to Antioch. By this time Paul had lived for 10 years in Cilicia. Since his conversion, before being sent to Tarsus, he had proclaimed Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.20">Acts 9:20</a>), speaking boldly in the name of the Lord (v <a href="?bref=Acts.9.27">27</a>). There is no reason to think he did otherwise while living among the Gentiles in Cilicia. In fact, his work may have been so effective that he began to attract attention in Antioch. During these years, Paul probably underwent many of the sufferings mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.24-26">2 Corinthians 11:24-26</a>. Several scholars think that the ecstatic experience mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.1-9">2 Corinthians 12:1-9</a>, with its accompanying thorn in the flesh, also took place before he came to Antioch.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SentOutfromAntioch">Sent Out from Antioch</p>
<p class="fl">The church in Antioch had its origins in the persecution fomented by Paul after the death of Stephen. Until they arrived in Antioch, the scattered believers had only spoken the word to Jews (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19">Acts 11:19</a>). It was here that the Gentiles first heard the Good News (v <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">20</a>), and many became believers (v <a href="?bref=Acts.11.21">21</a>). It is fitting that Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.21">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.13">Rom 11:13</a>), who was as yet unknown by sight to the churches of Judea (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.22">Gal 1:22</a>), should appear in Antioch to formally begin the ministry to which he was called (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.17-18">Acts 26:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>Barnabas and Paul stayed with the church in Antioch for a year. Their work there was so blessed that a new name, Christian, was coined to distinguish the believers in Antioch from Gentiles and Jews (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">Acts 11:26</a>). Hearing of a famine in Judea, the disciples in Antioch determined to send relief to the believers in Judea and did so by Barnabas and Paul (v <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">30</a>). Such a gift displayed to the Jewish churches the potency of the gospel among the Gentiles. Their mission complete, Barnabas and Paul returned to Antioch with John Mark (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">12:25</a>), Barnabas’s cousin (<a href="?bref=Col.4.10">Col 4:10</a>).</p>
<p>Beginning from the Day of Pentecost, the work in the gospel had been casual and incidental. Contacts were made in the homes, the marketplace, the streets, synagogues, highways, etc. (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.12,42">5:12, 42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.26-29">8:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.22">10:22</a>). But in Antioch the Holy Spirit initiated a determined effort to evangelize a section of the Roman Empire (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>). By the Holy Spirit’s instructions, the church separated Barnabas and Paul for this work. With the prayers and encouragement of this church, and with John Mark as their assistant, Barnabas and Paul, sent out by the Holy Spirit, sailed for Cyprus (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.4">4</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="TravelingwithBarnabas">Traveling with Barnabas</p>
<p class="fl">Arriving in Salamis, they preached in the synagogues as they traveled the length of the island to Paphos (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.5-6">Acts 13:5-6</a>). There the Roman proconsul, Sergius Paulus, wanted to hear the word of God (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.7">7</a>). A magician named Elymas Bar-Jesus tried to prevent the proconsul from believing in Jesus but was stricken with temporary blindness by Paul’s command (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.13.8-11">8-11</a>). This was the first manifestation in Paul of the signs of an apostle (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.12">2 Cor 12:12</a>). From then on, the name Paul, not Saul, is used in Luke’s record of the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.9">Acts 13:9</a>), and Paul replaced Barnabas as the leader of the party. So “Paul and his company” set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga of Pamphylia (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). John Mark deserted them at Perga and returned to his home in Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). This caused discord (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39">15:39</a>), but Paul and Mark were later reconciled (<a href="?bref=Col.4.10">Col 4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">2 Tm 4:11</a>).</p>
<p>Paul’s travels with the gospel now continued through the Roman province of Asia, specifically in the southern portion of Galatia, the areas of Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The coastal area where the party landed is a hot, malarial region. It is thought that Paul contracted malaria there and so traveled inland through the mountains to the 4,000-foot- (1,219.2-meter-) high tablelands. Such a journey would have been full of dangerous rivers and bandits (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.26">2 Cor 11:26</a>), but Paul was well cared for by the Galatian highlanders when he arrived (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.13-15">Gal 4:13-15</a>) and was rewarded with a warm reception to his message (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.48-49">Acts 13:48-49</a>).</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas were asked to speak at the synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.15">Acts 13:15</a>), and Paul delivered a discourse full of the characteristics of the gospel he would later record in his letters to the churches (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.13.16-41">16-41</a>). He was invited to speak the next week (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.42">42</a>); nearly the whole city gathered together to hear the word of God (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.44">44</a>). This stirred up jealousy in the Jews who opposed Paul’s words (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.45">45</a>), causing the apostles’ dramatic turn to the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.13.46-47">46-47</a>). Many Gentiles in Antioch believed and spread the word throughout the region, but Paul and Barnabas were forced out and went to Iconium in Lycaonia (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.13.48-51">48-51</a>).</p>
<p>The success in Antioch was duplicated in Iconium as was the Jews’ opposition (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.1">Acts 14:1</a>), and the apostles fled from the threat of a stoning to Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.5-6">5-6</a>). In Lystra the signs of an apostle were again seen when Paul healed a man who had been crippled since birth (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.8-10">8-10</a>). The idolatrous citizens of the town, however, primed by the popular belief that Jupiter, accompanied by Mercury, had once visited their region, worshiped Paul and Barnabas as these deities (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.11-13">11-13</a>). Even the convincing words of Paul, whom they mistook for Mercury, hardly restrained the crowds from offering a sacrifice (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.14-18">14-18</a>).</p>
<p>It was in Lystra that Paul was first given a taste of the same medicine he had once administered to Christians. The Jews stoned him, dragged him out of the city, and left him for dead (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.19">Acts 14:19</a>). Timothy (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-3">16:1-3</a>) may have been among the new disciples surrounding Paul as he lay outside the gate (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.20">14:20</a>). Timothy was Paul’s son in the faith (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.17">1 Cor 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.2">1 Tm 1:2</a>), eyewitness to his suffering (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.10-11">2 Tm 3:10-11</a>), faithful companion, and fellow worker (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.22">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">20:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.21">Rom 16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.2">1 Thes 3:2</a>). The next day Barnabas and Paul went on to Derbe (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.20">Acts 14:20</a>).</p>
<p>After making many disciples in Derbe, the apostles retraced their steps through Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia, strengthening and encouraging the new believers and appointing elders in each church (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.21-23">Acts 14:21-23</a>). Arriving again in Perga, they sailed back to Antioch of Syria, where they reported to the church the wonderful news that God had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.25-27">25-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheCouncilofJerusalem">The Council of Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">The Jews, who had dogged the steps of Paul and Barnabas throughout Galatia, followed on their heels to bewitch the Gentiles there, convincing them to desert the grace of Christ and submit to the Jewish law (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.6">Gal 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.1">3:1</a>). Shortly after the apostles’ return to Antioch, Judaizers came from Judea to Antioch, teaching salvation by the law (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1">Acts 15:1</a>). This began the war against the gospel of grace, which Paul preached.</p>
<p>The church in Antioch sent Paul, Barnabas, and others to Jerusalem to settle the controversy of the law versus grace with the apostles and elders there (<span class="era">AD</span> 49, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.2">Acts 15:2</a>). Along the way to Jerusalem they spread the news of the conversion of the Gentiles. This brought great joy to the believers (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.3">3</a>). Such joy was not shared by some in Jerusalem, who in the first meeting of the council said that the Gentiles should be ordered to keep the law of Moses (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">5</a>).</p>
<p>After this meeting, Paul and Barnabas met privately with Peter, John, and James (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Gal 2:1-10</a>) and explained the gospel they had been preaching to the Gentiles. These three leaders of the church in Jerusalem saw the grace that had been given to Paul to bring the gospel to the Gentiles and extended to him the “right hand of fellowship.” This private meeting seems to have decided the question of compliance to the Jewish law because in the next general meeting Peter said, “We believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.11">Acts 15:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), and James reached the decision that “we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.19">Acts 15:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This was a great victory for Paul and Barnabas, and the news was received with rejoicing by the church in Antioch (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.30-35">30-35</a>).</p>
<p>Later, Peter visited Antioch and freely associated with the Gentile believers as he had timidly done in Cornelius’s house (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.28">Acts 10:28</a>). This continued until “certain men came from James.” Their presence brought fear to Peter, clouding the light of the gospel of grace, and causing him to separate himself from the Gentiles. Peter’s action influenced others, including Barnabas, to do the same (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.12-13">Gal 2:12-13</a>). Paul rose to the challenge of this serious crisis, confronted Peter publicly, and charged him with Judaizing and hypocrisy (v <a href="?bref=Gal.2.14">14</a>). Paul won the battle and rescued Peter and Barnabas with eloquent words on justification by faith (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.2.15-21">15-21</a>), but the Judaizers had resumed their war. From this time on, they did not rest; rather, they tormented and persecuted Paul all over the world. But the apostle did not submit to them for a moment. He was engaged in the fight of his life, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with the Gentile believers (v <a href="?bref=Gal.2.5">5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="FurtherTravel">Further Travel</p>
<p class="fl">Paul wanted to visit the new believers and see how they were doing. So he proposed to Barnabas that they return to the cities where they had previously preached about Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.36">Acts 15:36</a>). Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them, but Paul would not take him since he had deserted them during their earlier journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13:13</a>). This sharp disagreement ended Barnabas’s association with Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.37-39">15:37-39</a>). Silas, a leader among the brothers in Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.22">22</a>), accompanied Paul as he set out by land through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.40-41">40-41</a>).</p>
<p>Beginning from Derbe in Galatia, Paul and Silas revisited the churches Paul had established with Barnabas. While in Lystra, they were joined by Timothy (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-3">Acts 16:1-3</a>). The apostles delivered to these young churches the letter drafted by the elders and apostles in Jerusalem concerning the observance of the law (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.23-29">15:23-29</a>), thus strengthening and increasing them (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.4-5">16:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>It is likely that Ephesus, a major city in the Roman province of Asia, was the party’s main objective for the advancement of the gospel, but they were “forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia” (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a>). Then they attempted to turn north and enter the region of Bithynia, “but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.7">7</a>). In this way they were forced by God to continue straight westward to Troas on the Aegean Sea, where Luke joined them (“we” in v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.10">10</a>), and Paul had a vision in which he was called out of Asia into Macedonia (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.16.8-9">8-9</a>). Paul and his party immediately crossed by boat into Europe (v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.11">11</a>) where they carried the gospel to Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth.</p>
<p>Philippi was a Roman colony and military outpost where there were few Jews, so Paul went to a place by the river where the local Jews prayed. He spoke to some women there, notably Lydia, who believed and with her household was baptized (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.12-15">Acts 16:12-15</a>), beginning the first church in Europe. Paul cast a spirit of divination out of a girl in Philippi, and as a result he and Silas were jailed (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.16.16-24">16-24</a>). The events of their night in jail made the jailer a believer in God (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.16.25-34">25-34</a>), and he and his family were added to the church in Philippi, which met in Lydia’s home (v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.40">40</a>). When Paul disclosed his Roman citizenship, he was released and was asked to leave the city (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.16.35-39">35-39</a>).</p>
<p>At Thessalonica the Jews, aroused to jealousy by the success of Paul’s gospel message, raised a mob to search for the apostles. They complained to the city authorities that the people “who have turned the world upside down have come here also” and accused the apostles of “saying that there is another king [besides Caesar], Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.5-7">Acts 17:5-7</a>).</p>
<p>Paul and Silas quickly left Thessalonica by night and arrived in Berea, a city thereafter distinguished by its citizens who eagerly and thoughtfully received the gospel (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.10-12">Acts 17:10-12</a>). The Thessalonian Jews did not rest but trailed Paul to Berea to incite the crowds. The believers then sent Paul away to Athens, while Silas and Timothy stayed behind (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.17.13-15">13-15</a>).</p>
<p>The Athenians called Paul a babbler but let him air his views before the Areopagus. Paul’s speech there was alive with his broad knowledge. He alluded to Greco-Roman philosophy (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.27">Acts 17:27</a>), poetry (v <a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">28</a>), sculpture (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.17.25,29">25, 29</a>), architecture (v <a href="?bref=Acts.17.24">24</a>), and religion while proclaiming the existence of an “unknown god” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.17.23">23</a>). But he was rudely cut short by scoffing and indifference when he mentioned the resurrection (v <a href="?bref=Acts.17.32">32</a>). Paul’s words delighted the minds of many but influenced the wills of few, so when he arrived in Corinth, he determined not to proclaim the mystery of God in lofty words of wisdom so that the believers’ faith would not rest on human wisdom but on the power of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.1-5">1 Cor 2:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>In Corinth Paul met Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2-3">Acts 18:2-3</a>), Roman Jews with whom he lived and worked as a tent maker and who would become prominent among the churches (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.26">Acts 18:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.3">Rom 16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19">2 Tm 4:19</a>). He stayed in Corinth 18 months from <span class="era">AD</span> 50 to 51, raising up a church (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.11">Acts 18:11</a>) on the strength of a vision from God (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.18.9-10">9-10</a>) and in spite of the attacks of the Jews (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">12-17</a>). Paul wrote the first and second letters to the Thessalonians from Corinth to establish the believers in a holy, industrious life (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.13">1 Thes 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">5:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.7-12">2 Thes 3:7-12</a>) in hope of the second coming of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15-18">1 Thes 4:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-17">2 Thes 2:1ff</a>.).</p>
<p>Accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila, Paul sailed from Corinth for Syria. He left his fellow workers in Ephesus, sailed to Caesarea, briefly visited Jerusalem, and returned to Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18-22">Acts 18:18-22</a>). Paul stayed in Antioch for awhile but did not remain absent from the field of his labors for long. Alone, he departed from Antioch, went from place to place in Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples, and eventually arrived in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.23">18:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.1">19:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="LaborintheGospel">Labor in the Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">A Jew named Apollos had ministered in Ephesus prior to Paul’s arrival and had recently gone over to Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-28">Acts 18:24-28</a>). There Apollos innocently became the cause of such discord (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.3-9">1 Cor 3:3-9</a>) that he left and refused to return even at Paul’s request (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.12">16:12</a>). Paul’s earlier visit to Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.19-20">Acts 18:19-20</a>), Apollos’s ministry, and the presence of Priscilla and Aquila had prepared Ephesus for the apostle’s preaching of the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>Paul began his work in Ephesus by setting straight some ill-informed disciples of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-7">Acts 19:1-7</a>). He then spent three months preaching at the local synagogue until members of the congregation “spoke evil of the Way” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.19.9">9</a>). Paul then took the disciples and continued his arguments on the neutral ground of Tyrannus’s school (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.19.8-9">8-9</a>), where Jews and Greeks were free to come. He continued there for two years and “all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.19.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>The work in Ephesus was a great success (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.10,20,26">Acts 19:10, 20, 26</a>). Paul enjoyed an open door for effective work (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.9">1 Cor 16:9</a>), bolstered by extraordinary miracles (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.11-17">Acts 19:11-17</a>), a public burning of valuable books of sorcery (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.19.18-19">18-19</a>), and the assistance of friendly officials from the province of Asia (v <a href="?bref=Acts.19.31">31</a>). There were also many adversaries (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.32">1 Cor 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.9">16:9</a>), especially among the artisans associated with the temple of Diana. Paul’s ministry had hurt their trade to the extent that they were incited to riot (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-41">Acts 19:23-41</a>). Paul had intended to stay in Ephesus until Pentecost (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.8">1 Cor 16:8</a>), but this tumult seems to have hastened his departure (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.1">Acts 20:1</a>).</p>
<p>During his stay in Ephesus, the household of Chloe sent word to Paul from Corinth that there were divisions in the church there (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.10-13">1 Cor 1:10-13</a>). This report generated a flurry of letters and travels. Paul wrote a letter, which is now lost, to this church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.9">5:9</a>). The church in Corinth wrote a letter (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1">7:1</a>) and sent messengers to Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.17">16:17</a>), and Paul sent Timothy to them (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.17">4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.10">16:10</a>). Paul then wrote 1 Corinthians (<span class="era">AD</span> 53) and sent it by Titus, who was to meet him in Troas to report the results (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.12-13">2 Cor 2:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>After his hasty exit from Ephesus, Paul found an open door for the gospel in Troas, but he so longed to hear from Corinth that he pushed on into Macedonia (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.12-13">2 Cor 2:12-13</a>). There he was finally comforted by Titus (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.5-7">7:5-7</a>) and rejoiced at the news of the Corinthians’ repentance, earnestness, longing, and zeal (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.8-16">8-16</a>). From Macedonia Paul wrote 2 Corinthians (<span class="era">AD</span> 54), toured northwest to proclaim the good news of Christ in Illyricum (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.19">Rom 15:19</a>), and then turned south for Achaia and his third visit to Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.21">Acts 19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.1-3">20:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.1">2 Cor 13:1</a>).</p>
<p>The time and place from which Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians is a topic of controversy. Some date it before the council at Jerusalem, about <span class="era">AD</span> 45. Others say he wrote it from Corinth at this stage in his history. The latter opinion is the choice of this narrative.</p>
<p>A three-month winter stay in Corinth (<span class="era">AD</span> 55–56) produced the Letter to the Romans, which firmly set the benchmark of the gospel for all the ages. Paul had many personal friends in Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">Rom 16</a>) and had long intended to visit there (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.10-15">1:10-15</a>). His plans were to deliver a collection from the Gentile churches to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.35">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.25-26">Rom 15:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1">1 Cor 16:1</a>) and then visit Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.21">Acts 19:21</a>) on his way to Spain (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.23-24">Rom 15:23-24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheArrestinJerusalem">The Arrest in Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">Paul’s trip from Corinth to Jerusalem was marked by abundant warnings of the danger awaiting him in Jerusalem. The Judaizers’ acrimony toward Paul was common talk everywhere, but all alarms went unheeded (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.22-24,38">Acts 20:22-24, 38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.4,10-15">21:4, 10-15</a>). However, the request for prayer in <a href="?bref=Rom.15.30-32">Romans 15:30-32</a> shows that Paul knew he might soon need a divine rescue from the unbelievers in Judea.</p>
<p>The travelers, carrying the collection for Jerusalem, journeyed swiftly in order to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.16">Acts 20:16</a>). They proceeded by land from Achaia, through Macedonia, to Philippi in time for the Passover (spring <span class="era">AD</span> 56, v <a href="?bref=Acts.20.6">6</a>). Crossing by sea to Troas, they visited the believers there (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.20.7-12">7-12</a>) and then sailed through the archipelago of the eastern Aegean Sea to Miletus (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.20.13-16">13-16</a>). From Miletus, Paul sent for the elders of Ephesus, to whom he delivered an impassioned speech containing his own dire warnings for them (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.20.17-38">17-38</a>).</p>
<p>Parting from them, Paul and his companions set sail to Cos, to Rhodes, and then to Patara, where they changed ships for Phoenicia (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.1-2">Acts 21:1-2</a>). A straight course to Tyre brought them within sight of Cyprus, with its memories of Barnabas and Sergius Paulus (v <a href="?bref=Acts.21.3">3</a>). “Through the Spirit” the disciples in Tyre “told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.21.4">4</a>), but he pressed on to Caesarea, where he and his company stayed with Philip, who had formerly served with the martyred Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.8">21:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">6:5</a>). In Caesarea, Paul would not be persuaded by an especially dramatic prophecy of his coming arrest (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.10-14">21:10-14</a>).</p>
<p>In Jerusalem the apostolic band stayed with Mnason, an early disciple, and were warmly welcomed by the brothers there (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.15-17">Acts 21:15-17</a>). James and the elders of the church praised God when they heard of the things he had done through Paul among the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.21.18-20">18-20</a>), and when they received the collection from the churches (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.17">24:17</a>). They told Paul of his bad reputation among the thousands of Jewish believers in Jerusalem and urged him to set right the Judaizers’ misrepresentation that he encouraged Jewish Christians to forsake the Mosaic customs (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.21-24">21:21-24</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.21.25">Acts 21:25</a> shows the Jerusalem elders understood that the Gentiles were under no obligation to Moses; their concern was for Paul to demonstrate that Jewish believers were free to continue their traditional observances.</p>
<p>Paul had kept the Jewish feasts (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.6">Acts 20:6</a>), as had Jesus and the early disciples in Jerusalem. He had also cut his hair in a vow at Cenchreae (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">18:18</a>), so it was a small matter for him, a Jew, to ceremonially purify himself after becoming a Christian, especially if it would undermine the arguments of the Judaizers. To have refused the elders’ request would have lent credence to the Judaizers’ charge. The success of this plan is seen in that it was the Jews from Asia, visiting Jerusalem for the Pentecost feast of <span class="era">AD</span> 57, who stirred up trouble for Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.27-29">21:27-29</a>)—not the Judaizers from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The whole city was aroused by Paul’s persistent persecutors. A violent crowd dragged him out of the temple just as Stephen had once been hauled to his martyrdom. They tried to kill him, but he was rescued by Roman soldiers as the mob cried, “Away with him!”—just as they had done to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.30-36">Acts 21:30-36</a>). At this juncture the educational and cultural diversity of Paul’s life came to his rescue. As he was carried for safety to the Roman barracks, he spoke in Greek to the tribune, who had mistaken him for an Egyptian assassin (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.21.37-38">37-38</a>). Given permission to speak to the crowd, he did so in the Aramaic language then common in Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.21.39-40">39-40</a>). The hushed crowd eagerly heard Paul’s defense until he uttered the word “Gentiles.” At this, the crowd resumed its threatening and violence, and Paul was brought into the barracks (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.1-24">22:1-24</a>). There the Romans prepared to flog him, until Paul revealed that he was not only a Jew from Tarsus but also a freeborn Roman citizen. The tribune was afraid, since he had bound a Roman citizen. Wanting to know the charges against Paul, he brought him to the Sanhedrin (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.22.25-30">25-30</a>).</p>
<p>This meeting of the Jewish judiciary was shortly reduced to dissension and violence. Paul resorted to tactics justifiable in such a war and hopelessly divided the Sanhedrin on the subject of the resurrection (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.1-9">Acts 23:1-9</a>). Paul again was rescued, this time from the contending factions of the Jewish leadership, and taken to the barracks, where the Lord encouraged him, promising that he would go to Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 56, vv <a href="?bref=Acts.23.10-11">10-11</a>).</p>
<p>In the meantime 40 Jews entered into a murderous plot against Paul. They vowed not to eat or drink until they had killed the apostle (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.12-15">Acts 23:12-15</a>). They almost succeeded, but with the help of the son of Paul’s sister (v <a href="?bref=Acts.23.16">16</a>), the conspiracy was exposed. For safety, Paul was taken from Jerusalem to Caesarea under guard of 470 soldiers and handed over to the custody of Felix the governor (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.23.16-35">16-35</a>). Inconclusive hearings before Felix (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.1-27">Acts 24</a>), his successor, Festus (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-12">25:1-12</a>), and King Agrippa (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.23-26.32">25:23–26:32</a>) occupied Paul in his two years of imprisonment in Caesarea. Festus, wanting to please the Jews, suggested that Paul be returned to Jerusalem for trial, but Paul knew the murderous intent of his accusers and again utilized his Roman citizenship by making a dramatic appeal to Caesar (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.9-12">25:9-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="VoyageandStayinRome">Voyage and Stay in Rome</p>
<p class="fl">To plead his case at Caesar’s court, Paul and his companions, Aristarchus and Luke, were taken on a perilous voyage (<span class="era">AD</span> 58, <a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-28.16">Acts 27:1–28:16</a>). Their passage by ship from Caesarea to Rome is one of the most remarkable on record. Luke’s detailed account is a treasure of information on ancient ships, navigation, and seamanship. It is also a beautiful portrait of a heroic and dignified apostle Paul, the gospel’s ambassador in chains (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.20">Eph 6:20</a>), who with the guidance and assurance of his God (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.23-26">Acts 27:23-26</a>), led the 276 people on board to safety (v <a href="?bref=Acts.27.37">37</a>).</p>
<p>Luke traces the voyage stage by stage through every crisis, with a change of ship at Myra, delay at Fair Havens on Crete, and the shipwreck on Malta. Finally, in the spring of <span class="era">AD</span> 59, they arrived at Puteoli, Italy, and made their way to Rome, welcomed by the believers along the Appian Way (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.13-16">Acts 28:13-16</a>).</p>
<p>Luke provided a peaceful denouement to the Acts, notwithstanding the fact that the apostle was an imperial prisoner of Caesar Nero. Paul lived by himself in his own house, chained to a Roman guard (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.16,30">Acts 28:16, 30</a>). There he received the local Jewish leaders—to calm any misgivings they may have had about him and, at the same time, to convince them about Jesus. His efforts had mixed success (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.28.17-28">17-28</a>). During Paul’s two or more years in Rome, the Judaizers seem to have withdrawn, only to be replaced by the peril of Eastern Gnosticism. This is seen in Paul’s letters to the Philippians, Colossians, and Ephesians, and to Philemon, all written at this time. It is unlikely that Paul’s accusers appeared in Rome to bring formal charges before Caesar, so Paul was probably released in <span class="era">AD</span> 61.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FinalYearsandMartyrdom">Final Years and Martyrdom</p>
<p class="fl">It is here assumed that the Pastoral Letters (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus) are truly Paul’s work. Only through them can the probable course of events in Paul’s final years be traced. <a href="?bref=Rom.15.28">Romans 15:28</a> shows that Paul intended to deliver the collection to Jerusalem and then to “set out by way of you [Rome] to Spain.” The arrest and imprisonment in Jerusalem not only destroyed these plans but also extracted five precious years from the prime of a most productive life. Although Clement of Rome implied that Paul did fulfill his desire to go to Spain (<span class="ital">Clement to the Corinthians</span> 5), it is certain that the daily pressure of Paul’s anxious care for all the churches (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.28">2 Cor 11:28</a>) did not abate.</p>
<p>If Paul went to Spain, he may have been there when Rome was burned on July 19, <span class="era">AD</span> 64. Tradition says that Paul traveled as far as Britain, but there is no evidence to confirm this. Returning east, he left Titus in Crete (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>) and traveled through Miletus, south of Ephesus, where he left Trophimus sick (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.20">2 Tm 4:20</a>). Traveling toward Macedonia, Paul visited Timothy in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.3">1 Tm 1:3</a>). On the way, Paul left his cloak and books with Carpus in Troas (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.13">2 Tm 4:13</a>). This indicates that he intended to return there for his possessions. From Macedonia Paul wrote his loving yet apprehensive first letter to Timothy (<span class="era">AD</span> 62–64). He had decided to spend the winter in Nicopolis (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">Ti 3:12</a>), northwest of Corinth on the Adriatic Sea, but was still in Macedonia when he wrote his letter to Titus. This letter is similar to 1 Timothy, yet with a somewhat harsher tone. In it is a final glimpse of the eloquent and zealous Apollos (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.13">Ti 3:13</a>), who is still in association with Paul 10 or more years after his first appearance in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24">Acts 18:24</a>).</p>
<p>From here Paul’s path is obscure. He may have wintered in Nicopolis, but he did not return to Troas for his winter cloak (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.13">2 Tm 4:13</a>). At some point he was arrested by the Romans, because he spent a winter in Rome’s Mamertine Prison, suffering from the cold in that rock cell before he wrote his second letter to Timothy (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–67). He may have been anticipating the coming winter when he requested that Timothy bring his cloak (vv <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.13,21">13, 21</a>). It is possible that the charges against Paul were related to the burning of Rome; this is unknown. It was, however, now “illegal” to be a Christian since the “new religion” was no longer protected by Roman law as being part of Judaism (which was a legalized, recognized religion by Roman law).</p>
<p>It was dangerous to be associated with Paul at this time. Many deserted him (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.16">2 Tm 4:16</a>), including all his coworkers in Asia (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.15">1:15</a>) and Demas, who loved the world (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">4:10</a>). Only Luke, the physician and author of Luke and Acts, was with him when he wrote his second letter to Timothy (v <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">11</a>). Faithful believers still in hiding in Rome were also in contact with the apostle (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.16">1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19,21">4:19, 21</a>). He told Timothy to come to him in Rome and bring Mark also (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">4:11</a>). Apparently Timothy did come and was imprisoned (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.23">Heb 13:23</a>). Paul’s request for the books and parchments (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.13">2 Tm 4:13</a>) discloses that he was reading and studying the Scripture to the end.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul had two hearings before Caesar Nero. At his first defense only the Lord stood by him (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.16">2 Tm 4:16</a>). There he not only pleaded his own cause but also that of the gospel, still longing that all the Gentiles would hear its message. Perhaps no decision was made, and thus he was “rescued from the lion’s mouth” (v <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.17">17</a>). Though he knew he would soon die, he was not afraid, but was assured that the Lord would give him a crown of righteousness on the last day (v <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.8">8</a>). Finally, the apostle himself recorded his seminal encouragement to all believers: “The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you” (v <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.22">22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). After this, the Scripture is silent regarding Paul.</p>
<p>Nothing is known of Paul’s second hearing but that it resulted in the sentence of capital punishment. History does not record Paul’s end. Nero died in the summer of <span class="era">AD</span> 68, so Paul was executed before that date. As a Roman citizen, he must have been spared the lingering torture that had recently been suffered by his fellow martyrs. Tradition says that he was decapitated by the sword of an imperial headsman on the Ostian Road just outside of Rome, and buried nearby. This fulfilled Paul’s desire “to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">PAVEMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Term occurring ten times in the Bible, usually alluding to the stone floor of the temple(s). Particular interest focuses on the reference in <a href="?bref=John.19.13">John 19:13</a> to the pavement on which Jesus stood trial before Pilate. It was at the decisive moment of the Roman phase of the trial of Jesus when “Pilate had Jesus brought out, and seated himself on the chair of judgement at a place called the Pavement, in Hebrew Gabbatha” (<a href="?bref=John.19.13">Jn 19:13</a>, <span class="sc">njb</span>). This verse has played an important role in determining the location of Jesus’ trial. Until recently scholars located this pavement where Pilate’s judgment seat was placed under the present street level in Jerusalem at the site of Herod’s fortress Antonia. This enormous stone pavement consists of large blocks of limestone, excavated in the 1930s by Père Vincent. Today, scholars disagree about whether this is the most historically plausible site for the pavement where Jesus was condemned.</p>

<p class="fl">A translation of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">sukkah</span> and <span class="hebrew">sokoh</span> in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">sukkah</span> is also translated as “booth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.17">Gn 33:17</a>), “tabernacle” (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.34">Lv 23:34</a>), and “tent” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.11">2 Sm 11:11</a>). Other translations of <span class="hebrew">sokoh</span> are “den” (<a href="?bref=Ps.10.9">Ps 10:9</a>), “tabernacle” (<a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">76:2</a>), and “covert” (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.38">Jer 25:38</a>). The words <span class="hebrew">sukkah</span> and <span class="hebrew">sokoh</span> signify a shelter or covering, which may be in the form of a tent (booth or tabernacle), hut, or den.</p>
<p>The word “pavilion” is used to refer to the tents of Ben-hadad’s royal entourage and allies as they were in a drunken stupor when Ahab attacked them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.16">1 Kgs 20:16</a>). Other versions read “booths” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), “temporary shelters” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>); “quarters” (<span class="sc">neb</span>), and “tents” (<span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The metaphorical use is found in the book of Psalms. In <a href="?bref=Ps.27.5">Psalms 27:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.31.20">31:20</a> the psalmist speaks of the Lord’s special protection as a place where one may find refuge from the evildoers. The word may also refer to the clouds that, in the pictorial language of the psalmist, cover the presence of the Lord, “He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him—the dark rain clouds of the sky” (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.11">Ps 18:11</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">PEACE</p>
<p class="fl">Total well-being, prosperity, and security associated with God’s presence among his people. Linked in the OT with the covenant, the presence of peace was conditional, based on Israel’s obedience. In the prophetic writings, true peace is part of the end-time hope of God’s salvation. In the NT, this longed-for peace is understood as having come in Christ and can be experienced by the believers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl"><span class="hebrew">Shalom</span><span class="ital">,</span> the most prominent OT term for “peace,” held a wide range of connotations (wholeness, health, security, well-being, and salvation) and could apply to an equally wide range of contexts: the state of the individual (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.37">Ps 37:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.2">Prv 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.17">Is 32:17</a>), the relationship of person to person (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.21">Gn 34:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.15">Jos 9:15</a>) or nation to nation (e.g., absence of conflict—<a href="?bref=Deut.2.26">Dt 2:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.21">Jos 10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.12">1 Kgs 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.122.6-7">Ps 122:6-7</a>), and the relationship of God and people (<a href="?bref=Ps.85.8">Ps 85:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.5">Jer 16:5</a>).</p>
<p>The presence of <span class="hebrew">shalom</span> in any of these contexts was not considered ultimately as the outcome of human endeavor but as a gift or blessing of God (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.6">Lv 26:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.33">1 Kgs 2:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.25.2">Jb 25:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.11">Pss 29:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.85.8">85:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.7">Is 45:7</a>). It is not surprising, therefore, to find “peace” tied closely to the OT notion of covenant. <span class="hebrew">Shalom</span> was the desired state of harmony and communion between the two covenant partners—God and his people (<a href="?bref=Num.6.26">Nm 6:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.54.10">Is 54:10</a>). Its presence signified God’s blessing in the covenant relationship (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.5">Mal 2:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.25.12">Nm 25:12</a>), and its absence signified the breakdown of that relationship due to Israel’s disobedience and unrighteousness (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.5,10-13">Jer 16:5, 10-13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.85.9-11">Ps 85:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.17">Is 32:17</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shalom</span> becomes a pivotal term in the prophetic writings. It was the “false” prophets who, forgetting the conditions for national well-being within the covenant relationship, assumed God’s loyalty to Israel (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">Ps 89</a>) would guarantee political peace forever (<a href="?bref=Jer.6.14">Jer 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.15">8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.10,16">Ez 13:10, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.5">Mi 3:5</a>). Against such popular but false security, the preexilic prophets proclaimed the coming judgment precisely as a loss of this <span class="hebrew">shalom</span> due to Israel’s persistent disobedience and unrighteousness (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.18">Is 48:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.13-16">Jer 14:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.5,10-13">16:5, 10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-17">28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.4,9-12">Mi 3:4, 9-12</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets did, however, point beyond the crises of exile and subsequent setbacks to a time when <span class="hebrew">shalom</span><span class="ital">,</span> characterized by prosperity and well-being (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.7">Is 45:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.25-26">Ez 34:25-26</a>), absence of conflict (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">Is 2:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.15-20">32:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.28-31">Ez 34:28-31</a>), right relations (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">Is 11:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-4">Mi 4:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.9-13">Zec 8:9-13</a>), restoration of harmony in nature (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.6-9">Is 11:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1-12">Ez 47:1-12</a>), and salvation (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.7">Is 52:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.17">60:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.30-31">Ez 34:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.26-28">37:26-28</a>) would again return. Often this eschatological (or end-time) expectation of peace in the OT was associated with a messianic figure, as in <a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the future Messiah is termed the “Prince of Peace.” Moreover, his reign would be one of “peace” not only for Israel but throughout the whole earth (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.9-10">Zec 9:9-10</a>). The OT ends with this hope of peace still unrealized in its full sense.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The Greek term for “peace” used predominantly in the NT is <span class="greek">eirene</span><span class="ital">,</span> a word expanded from its classical Greek connotation of “rest” to include the various connotations of <span class="hebrew">shalom</span> discussed above. As with <span class="hebrew">shalom</span><span class="ital">,</span> <span class="greek">eirene</span> could be used as a greeting or farewell (as in “peace be with you”—<a href="?bref=Luke.10.5">Lk 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.16">Gal 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.16">Jas 2:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.20.19">Jn 20:19</a>), or could signify the cessation of conflict (national—<a href="?bref=Luke.14.32">Lk 14:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.20">Acts 12:20</a>; or interpersonal—<a href="?bref=Rom.14.19">Rom 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.3">Eph 4:3</a>), or the presence of domestic tranquillity (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.15">1 Cor 7:15</a>).</p>
<p>The chief issue concerns how Jesus incorporated the OT hope for the eschatological peace of God into his ministry. In the “benedictus” of Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.67-79">Lk 1:67-79</a>), the coming of Jesus as the Messiah is expected to “guide our feet into the way of peace” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.79">79</a>). So also the angelic testimony to the shepherds proclaims Jesus as the bringer of God’s peace to people (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.14">2:14</a>). That is, Jesus as the Messiah would usher in God’s reign of peace. Jesus’ self-understanding as expressed in the fourth Gospel corresponds to this association. This long-expected peace of God is Jesus’ farewell gift to the disciples (<a href="?bref=John.14.27">Jn 14:27</a>); it is given to them when he breathed his Spirit into them (<a href="?bref=John.20.19-22">20:19-22</a>).</p>
<p>The nature of this gift of peace brought by Jesus may be easier to explain by stating what it is not. It is not an end to tension or the absence of warfare. It is not domestic tranquillity nor anything like the worldly estimation of peace (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.51-53">Lk 12:51-53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.27">Jn 14:27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.32-33">16:32-33</a>). Its presence may, on the contrary, actually disturb existing relations, being a dividing “sword” in familial relations (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.34-37">Mt 10:34-37</a>). Jesus’ gift of peace is, in reality, the character and mood of the new covenant of his blood that reconciles God to people (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1">Rom 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.20">Col 1:20</a>) and forms the basis of subsequent reconciliation between divergent people (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-22">Eph 2:14-22</a>).</p>
<p>The early church understood “peace” to be the final, end-time salvation of God given already through Jesus Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Phil.4.7-9">Phil 4:7-9</a>). This understanding of “peace” altered the content of the common greeting “go in peace” as it was taken up in the Christian community. In Paul’s common “grace and peace” greeting (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.3">1 Cor 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.2">2 Cor 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.3">Gal 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.2">Eph 1:2</a>, etc.; cf. also <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.2">1 Pt 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.3">2 Jn 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.2">Jude 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.4">Rv 1:4</a>), it is no longer a mere wish for peace that Paul extends to his readers but is a reminder of the messianic gifts available in the present time through Christ to the man of faith. In accord with this, Jesus is described as “peace” itself (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.14">Eph 2:14</a>), while God, too, because of his act of reconciliation through Christ, is known as a “God of peace” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.9">Phil 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.15">Col 3:15</a>).</p>
<p>This gift of peace or reconciliation with God, made available through Christ, places an ethical demand on the Christian; it calls for the exercises of “peace” (as reconciliation between persons) within the church. Peace, as a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>), is to be the goal of the Christian’s dealings with others (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.18">Rom 12:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.14.19">14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.14">Heb 12:14</a>).</p>

By the NT period, the pearl was a prized piece of feminine jewelry (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.9">1 Tm 2:9</a>), an item of trade (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.45-46">Mt 13:45-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.12-16">Rv 18:12-16</a>), and an object of high price. Being familiar objects, pearls were frequently used by Jesus in his illustrations. A fine pearl was an object of such great value that a man might sell all his accumulated wealth to purchase it (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.45-46">Mt 13:45-46</a>). A pearl (used figuratively for the word of the Lord) would not be given to those who, like pigs, had no appreciation for its value (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.6">7:6</a>).</p>

  <title>Pekah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PEKAH</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Remaliah and 18th king of Israel. His name means “he has opened [the eyes].” It is an abbreviated form of the name of his predecessor, Pekahiah, “Yahweh has opened [the eyes].” The name has been found on a fragment of an eighth-century-<span class="era">BC</span> wine jar from Hazor stratum V, the level destroyed by Tiglath-pileser in 734 <span class="era">BC</span>. It is thought that this is a reference to Pekah and to a kind of wine. It is likely that the usurper Pekah was so eager to ensure his position as king that he deliberately assumed the name of his predecessor. Moreover, Isaiah refers to him as the “son of Remaliah,” almost scornfully, to indicate his nonroyal descent. But when Isaiah refers to his heathen ally, he uses the specific name “Rezin, the king of Syria” (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.4-9">Is 7:4-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.6">8:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="AccessiontotheThrone">Accession to the Throne</p>
<p class="fl">Pekah, an officer of Pekahiah, was the third man in a chariot, apart from the driver and the warrior. He was the shield and armor bearer of the warrior. In time the term came to signify a royal aide-de-camp.</p>
<p>The account of Pekah’s murder of Pekahiah has been somewhat obscured because of the difficulty in understanding the terms Argob and Arieh (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.25">2 Kgs 15:25</a>). Some translators and commentators have thought these referred to persons, whereas others have held these are place-names. Some scholars radically alter the text here and eliminate the troublesome words by claiming they were a scribal mistake or emendation. A key seems to have been found by comparing them with the Ugaritic. The terms mean “eagle” and “lion,” respectively. Thus, Pekah was murdered “near the eagle and the lion.” It is suggested that this means he was put to death near the guardian sphinxes of his palace. Such sphinxes were a common motif in ancient eastern palaces and were duplicated on ivory plaques erected in the gateway. This interpretation seems very plausible, since it avoids critical emendation and solves the major problems in the text.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PoliticalSignificance">Political Significance</p>
<p class="fl">The brilliant Tiglath-pileser III, leading the kingdom of Assyria to prominence, appeared on Israel’s border. Menahem deemed it wise to become tributary to him. Apparently Pekahiah, Menahem’s successor, could not appease the Assyrians during his short reign. The conciliatory efforts of Menahem and Pekahiah may well have prompted the Syrians to conspire with Pekah, the army officer, to gain control of the throne of Samaria in order to present a united military front against Assyrian encroachment. Once Samaria was under control, the Syrians led by Rezin, Israel ruled by Pekah, and several Transjordanian kingdoms formed a powerful alliance.</p>
<p>In time Pekah and Rezin began to pressure the kingdom of Judah in order to induce it to join their alliance against the impending Assyrian attack. Jotham resisted their invitations and fortified the Judean hill country. Jotham’s son, Ahaz, continued his father’s policy of noncooperation with the Samaria-Damascus coalition. Pekah and Rezin invaded Judah with the intent of taking Jerusalem and placing “the son of Tabeel” on the throne of Judah in Ahaz’s place (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-6">Is 7:1-6</a>). He presumably was a son of Uzziah or Jotham by a princess of Tabeel. Although the actual siege of Jerusalem was unsuccessful, Pekah and Rezin inflicted severe casualties upon Ahaz’s army. In one day of battle they killed 120,000 men of Judah and carried away 200,000 captives, including women and children. However, the prophet Oded prophesied in Samaria before the army. He urged the leaders of Samaria to return the captives. The leaders heeded the prophetic word and sent the captives back to Jericho (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.8-15">2 Chr 28:8-15</a>).</p>
<p>Rezin’s revolt against Assyria brought a quick response from Tiglath-pileser, who laid siege to Damascus in 734 <span class="era">BC</span>. The city fell in 732 <span class="era">BC</span>. Another detachment of the Assyrian army descended on the upper districts of Syria and Samaria. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">Second Kings 15:29</a> lists the districts and cities that were overrun. They included Gilead (regions beyond Jordan), Naphtali (regions lying to the west of the lakes of Galilee and Merom), and all Galilee as far south as the plain of Esdraelon and the valley of Jezreel. Isaiah refers to this lost tribal territory (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-7">Is 9:1-7</a>). From this Assyrian-controlled region the messianic ruler would arise and give light to those who lived in a land of darkness (v <a href="?bref=Isa.9.2">2</a>). Thus Pekah’s kingdom was reduced to a third of its original size by the Assyrian campaign of 734–732 <span class="era">BC</span>. In 732 a palace conspiracy led by Hoshea plotted the assassination of Pekah. He was put to death in the coup d’état and the throne was usurped by Hoshea.</p>
<p>The author of Kings evaluates the reign of Pekah as follows: “But Pekah did what was evil in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight. He refused to turn from the sins of idolatry that Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel to commit” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.28">2 Kgs 15:28</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). It is likely that he continued the calf worship at the shrines at Dan and Bethel. The continuation of the apostasy during successive regencies was the cause for the judgment that befell the northern kingdom. Pekah is the last king of Israel given such an evaluation.</p>

<p class="h1">PEKAHIAH</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Menahem, king of Israel. Pekahiah (whose name means “Yahweh has opened [his eyes]”) was among the 20 kings who ruled Israel from Samaria following its decline consequent to the fracture of the Solomonic monarchy in the tenth century <span class="era">BC</span>. The brief account in the Bible concerning him (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.22-26">2 Kgs 15:22-26</a>) points to the godlessness of his life (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.24">24</a>). His sin, like that of his father (Menahem), was linked to the false worship of Jeroboam, who built shrines at Dan and Bethel to rival worship in the temple at Jerusalem. Such religious activity threatened the true worship of God by attempting to fuse biblical concepts with the fertility cult of Baal, a movement sharply denounced by the Word of God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-5">1 Kgs 13:1-5</a>). Like many of Israel’s kings, Pekahiah ruled briefly, being assassinated in the second year of his reign. The chief instigator of the plot against him, a captain named Pekah, took 50 men of Gilead and killed the king, along with two aides, in the citadel of the royal palace at Samaria. His successor, Pekah, was regrettably as evil as Pekahiah and received the condemnation of Scripture typical of virtually all the Israelite kings: he “did what was evil in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.28">2 Kgs 15:28</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). </p>

During his lifetime, the earth was divided (Peleg means “division” or “watercourse”). Precisely what the division refers to is still debated. Suggestions include (1) the geographical and linguistic dispersion following the Tower of Babel fiasco (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">Gn 11:1-9</a>); (2) dispersion of Noah’s descendants; (3) separation of the people of Arphaxad from Joktanide Arabs (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.24-29">Gn 10:24-29</a>); and (4) the division of land by irrigation canals (the term is so used in <a href="?bref=Job.29.6">Jb 29:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.38.25">38:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.25">Is 30:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.2">32:2</a>).

When the Greeks controlled Egypt, they renamed the town Pelusium, “the muddy city,” apparently confusing the Egyptian name with a similar Egyptian word <span class="ital">sin,</span> meaning “mud” or “clay.” In Ezekiel it is called “the stronghold of Egypt” because it provided a defense against the ever-present danger of attack from the north.</p>

<p class="fl">Word formed by two Greek words, <span class="greek">pente</span> (“five”) and <span class="greek">teuchos</span> (“case”) and commonly used to refer to the first five books of the OT (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), which were encased together, as in one book.

The Pentateuch begins with the creation of the universe and records God’s dealings with mankind in the Garden of Eden, his preparation of a seed-bearing line (the patriarchal stories), and the formation of the nation Israel. A substantial portion of the Pentateuch consists of laws governing the religious and civil life of the theocratic nation.</p>

<p class="h1">PENTECOST</p>
<p class="fl">Word derived from the Greek word <span class="greek">pentekoste</span> (“fiftieth”), which stood for the festival celebrated on the 50th day after Passover. In the OT this festival, called <span class="hebrew">Shavu‘oth</span> (Weeks) in Judaism, is referred to as the Feast of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.22">Ex 34:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.10">Dt 16:10</a>) because it occurs seven weeks after Passover. Other names include the Feast of Harvest (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.16">Ex 23:16</a>), because of its relationship with harvest season, and the Day of Firstfruits (<a href="?bref=Num.28.26">Nm 28:26</a>), because two loaves of newly ground grain were presented before the Lord. (This latter name should be distinguished from the offering of firstfruits at the beginning of the harvest season, as mentioned in <a href="?bref=Lev.23.9-14">Lv 23:9-14</a>.)</p>
<p>The Feast of Weeks was one of three OT pilgrimage festivals when individuals were to appear before the Lord with gifts and offerings (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.14-17">Ex 23:14-17</a>). The festival was primarily a harvest festival and celebrated the end of the barley harvest and the beginning of the wheat harvest. Traditionally, grain harvest extended from Passover, when the first grain was cut (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.9">Dt 16:9</a>) around mid-April, to Pentecost, which marked its conclusion in mid-June. Josephus’s statement that Pentecost was called “closing” illustrates this understanding (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 3.10.6).</p>
<p>Each year the priest waved a sheaf of newly harvested grain before the Lord on the day after the Sabbath during the Festival of Unleavened Bread (the period of seven days following Passover). The people then counted 50 days from the offering of that first sheaf of grain until the day after the seventh Sabbath to observe the Feast of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.11">Lv 23:11</a>). On this day two loaves, made of two-tenths of an ephah of flour and baked with yeast, were waved before the Lord (v <a href="?bref=Lev.23.17">17</a>) and freewill offerings were encouraged (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.10">Dt 16:10</a>). This harvest festival was a time of great rejoicing and a holy assembly when no work was to be done (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.21">Lv 23:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.11">Dt 16:11</a>). Observance of the Feast of Weeks during Solomon’s time (<a href="?bref=2Chr.8.13">2 Chr 8:13</a>) is the only OT reference outside of the Pentateuch, for Ezekiel makes no mention of it in his calendar for future festivals (<a href="?bref=Ezek.45.1-46.24">Ez 45–46</a>).</p>
<p>Pentecost is first mentioned in the NT as the occasion for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples of Christ, an event that many theologians understand as marking the beginning of the church (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1">Acts 2:1</a>). Since this was a required festival, Jews gathered from great distances to observe Pentecost in Jerusalem, making it an appropriate time for God’s work. On two occasions Paul takes into consideration the Festival of Pentecost when anticipating his travels. In the first instance he writes to the Corinthians about delaying his visit to them until after Pentecost (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.8">1 Cor 16:8</a>), while later he was desirous of traveling to Jerusalem to get there in time for Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.16">Acts 20:16</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Designation for the collective group that believes in God. It is a common strand of Israel’s faith that it became the people of God because he chose it to be his own possession (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6-7">Ex 6:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.5">19:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.6">Dt 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.2">14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.26.18">26:18</a>). The idea of the covenant is linked to this (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.9-12">Lv 26:9-12</a>). In the preaching of the prophets, where the judgment of God is often seen as leading to complete destruction, there is also the vision of the reestablishment and re-creation of the people of God (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.37">Jer 32:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.1,23">Hos 2:1, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.20">Ez 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.28">36:28</a>). In the development of Judaism after the exile, the idea emerges that it is only the Israel of the future, the final messianic community, that will be “people of God” in the full sense of that term.</p>
<p>It is evident from a number of passages in the NT that the church knew itself to be this future people of God. The clearest passage is <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Peter 2:9</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>): “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people.” The expressions “royal priesthood” and “holy nation” are taken from <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Exodus 19:6</a>, which so powerfully expresses both the participation in God’s reign and the priestly service of the people of God in the world. Just as the original people of God were called to proclaim God’s mighty acts of deliverance (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.20-21">Is 43:20-21</a>, LXX), so the new people of God are called to “declare the wonderful deeds of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>).</p>

<p>The comprehensiveness of the term is evident in the way it is used to refer to nomads (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.10">Ez 25:10</a>) or Mesopotamians (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.30">1 Kgs 4:30</a>).

The camp of Israel at Shittim was visible from the site (<a href="?bref=Num.24.2">24:2</a>). There Israel initiated a sexual orgy with the Moabite women, and worshiped Baal (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-13">25:1-13</a>). The exact location of the mountain is not certain, though Eusebius and Jerome place it opposite Jericho on the way to Heshbon. It is thus believed to be near Mt Nebo in the Abarim range.</p>
<p class="list">2. Place cited in the Septuagint in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.59">Joshua 15:59</a>, but not in Hebrew manuscripts. It is identified as the modern Khirbet Faghur, southwest of Bethlehem.</p>

<p class="h1">PERDITION*</p>
<p class="fl">Term used eight times in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> NT to express the eternal aspect of the destruction of life and self. In <a href="?bref=Phil.1.28">Philippians 1:28</a>, “perdition” is the opposite of “salvation.” <a href="?bref=Heb.10.39">Hebrews 10:39</a> contrasts it with “preserving one’s soul.” <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.7">Second Peter 3:7</a> links perdition with the day of judgment, while <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.9">1 Timothy 6:9</a> has both present and future in view. “Son of perdition” is a label affirming the destiny of the betrayer Judas (<a href="?bref=John.17.12">Jn 17:12</a>) and of the antichrist (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3">2 Thes 2:3</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8,11">Revelation 17:8, 11</a> perdition designates the final abode of the beast. <a href="?bref=Rev.19.20">Revelation 19:20</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10">20:10</a> identify this abode as the “lake of fire,” a place of everlasting torment.</p>
<p>“Perdition” occurs four times in the <span class="sc">rsv</span> NT (<a href="?bref=John.17.12">Jn 17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3">2 Thes 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8,11">Rv 17:8, 11</a>) and twice in the OT (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.5">2 Sm 22:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.4">Ps 18:4</a>). In the latter, the parallel lines of Hebrew poetry show that perdition is the equivalent of death.</p>

<p class="h1">PEREA*</p>
<p class="fl">Term not occurring in the NT except in the fourth-century manuscript Codex Sinaiticus and the fifth-century manuscript Codex Washingtonianus, where it appears in <a href="?bref=Luke.6.17">Luke 6:17</a> and is treated as a variant reading by most editors of the Greek NT. It was used in the first century <span class="era">AD</span> by Josephus to refer to the region “beyond the Jordan” (he derived the word Perea from the Greek for “beyond”). The geographical location of the area is therefore best understood from Josephus’s <span class="ital">War of the Jews</span> (3.3.3): “Now the length of Perea is from Machaerus to Pella, and its breadth from Philadelphia to Jordan; its northern parts are bounded by Pella, as we have already said, as well as its western with Jordan; the land of Moab is its southern border, and its eastern limits reach to Arabia, and Silbonitis, and besides to Philadelphene and Gerasa.” Gadara is called “the metropolis of Perea” by Josephus because it was a “place of strength” and because “many of the citizens of Gadara were rich men” (<span class="ital">War</span> 4.7.3). This Gadara is not to be confused with the Gadara of the Decapolis, modern Um Qeis, but is to be identified with Tell Gadura, about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) northwest of modern Amman, Jordan.</p>
<p>The Decapolis is separated from Perea in <a href="?bref=Matt.4.25">Matthew 4:25</a>, where it is listed among the various sections of Palestine from which people came to hear Jesus. Perea is here called the region “beyond the Jordan,” and is so designated also in <a href="?bref=Mark.3.8">Mark 3:8</a>. In one place Matthew referred to Perea as “the region of Judea beyond the Jordan” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.1">Mt 19:1</a>). This is perplexing because politically Perea was never a part of Judea, belonging to the jurisdiction not of Archelaus but of Herod Antipas, who also controlled Galilee. The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Mark.10.1">Mark 10:1</a> reads, “the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan.” Perhaps Matthew was using the phrase to refer to that part of Perea that, though politically not a part of Judea, was Jewish in population. In his <span class="ital">Natural History</span> (<span class="era">AD</span> 77) Pliny spoke of Perea as a place “separated from the <span class="ital">other parts</span> of Judea by the River Jordan” (5.70), and the <span class="ital">“rest</span> of Judea by the River Jordan” (5.70), and the <span class="ital">“rest</span> of Judea” as being divided into 10 local government areas, as though he considered Perea to be a part of Judea. However, this may be a mistaken assumption, since Pliny’s knowledge of the immediate area is somewhat questionable—in the same context he erroneously asserts that the Dead Sea is “more than 100 miles long and fully as wide at its widest part” (<span class="ital">Natural History</span> 5.72), whereas in reality it is less than 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) long and only 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) wide.</p>
<p>The area was well known and often mentioned in the OT by the phrase “beyond the Jordan” (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1">Nm 22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.1,5">Dt 1:1, 5</a>), and was occupied in its southern portion by the two Israelite tribes Gad and Reuben (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.12-14">Jos 1:12-14</a>). Stretching from the brook Kerith in the north almost to the Arnon River in the south, Perea was virtually synonymous with OT Gilead (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.9">Jos 22:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.17">Jgs 5:17</a>).</p>
<p>It seems to have been an important district in the decades before the birth of Christ (Hellenistic period) when Jewish (Maccabean) leaders controlled it after 124 <span class="era">BC</span>. Under Roman rule, it was given to Herod the Great until his death in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, when it passed (according to his will) into the hands of his son Herod Antipas, along with Galilee. Because the area was beautiful and productive and had trees noted for their medicinal balm (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.11">46:11</a>), it was always well populated and supported numerous well-known cities, such as Pella, Jabesh-gilead, Succoth, Penuel, and Gerasa (modern Jerash). Herod Antipas even had a fort named Machaerus in the southern extremities of Perea, where he imprisoned John the Baptist and had him put to death (see Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.5.2).</p>
<p>It was customary for Jews traveling back and forth from Galilee to Judea to cross the Jordan into Perea in order to avoid contact with the Samaritans. Before his death, John the Baptist had been baptizing in Bethany beyond the Jordan when he announced Jesus as the Lamb of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.28-29">Jn 1:28-29</a>), and Jesus returned here during his ministry once when he was being severely persecuted (<a href="?bref=John.10.40">10:40</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Son of Judah whose name is derived from a Hebrew word meaning “he who bursts forth”; his name refers to the manner in which he unexpectedly came first from Tamar’s womb before his twin brother, Zerah (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.29">Gn 38:29</a>). He fathered two sons, Hezron and Hamul, and became the ancestral head of the Perezite family (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.12">Gn 46:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.20-21">Nm 26:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.4-5">1 Chr 2:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.1">4:1</a>).

  <title>Perfume</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PERFUME</p>
<p class="fl">Term covering a wide range of materials prepared from ground-up minerals, vegetable oils, and roots, which were used from the earliest times to enhance one’s personal presentation or to produce pleasing fragrances both for secular and religious purposes. The Bible mentions a wide variety of perfumes, such as aloes, balm, balsam, bdellium, cassia, cinnamon, frankincense, gum, myrrh, nard, sweet cane, spice, ointment, and so on. There must have been a vigorous perfume trade with such lands as Arabia (frankincense, myrrh), India (aloes, nard), Ceylon (cinnamon), Persia (the spice galbanum), and Somaliland (frankincense). In the Bible there are several references to those who traded in these items; for example, the Arabian (Ishmaelite) merchants who took Joseph to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Gn 37:25</a>), the caravans of the queen of Sheba (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.10">1 Kgs 10:10</a>), and the traders of Sheba and Raamah who brought spices to Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.22">Ez 27:22</a>).</p>
<p>There are several biblical references to those who prepared perfumes. For example, Bezalel prepared holy anointing oil and sacred incense for the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.37.29">Ex 37:29</a>). The holy anointing oil was a mixture of four constituents (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.22-25">30:22-25</a>): myrrh, cinnamon, aromatic cane, and cassia mixed in olive oil. In postexilic times, some priests were given the responsibility of mixing perfumes for incense (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.30">1 Chr 9:30</a>), and a perfumer is mentioned among those who built Nehemiah’s wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.8">Neh 3:8</a>).</p>
<p>Modern excavation has produced tangible evidence of a variety of cosmetic vessels and appliances, although, strangely enough, little is said in the Bible about these (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.20">Is 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.7">Mt 26:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3">Mk 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.37">Lk 7:37</a>). The reference to alabaster containers gains support from their use in Egypt and from archaeology. Some ancient sites in Palestine have yielded numerous small decorated cosmetic bowls, often made of alabaster; small bottles for scents and oils; and palettes for mixing cosmetics. Some of these items are imports from lands like Egypt.</p>
<p>There was a wide range of uses for the various perfumes, whether powders or oils. Perfumed oils were regularly used to anoint the body in order to soothe sun-dried skin (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.20">2 Sm 12:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.3.3">Ru 3:3</a>). On one occasion, King Ahaz clothed, fed, and anointed men who returned home from captivity (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.15">2 Chr 28:15</a>). The rich in the land could afford the “finest oils” (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.6">Am 6:6</a>), although such extravagance could be costly (<a href="?bref=Pr.21.17">Prv 21:17</a>). This biblical picture is corroborated by evidence from Egypt and Mesopotamia. In particular, there was a lavish use of oils and ointments in the royal palaces of the East.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AnAlabasterVase"/>
<p>Ointments and oils of various kinds that gave off a pleasing fragrance were regularly used. The Song of Songs has many references to such ointments (<a href="?bref=Song.1.3">Sg 1:3</a>), some of which are specifically named: spikenard (<a href="?bref=Song.1.12">1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.13-14">4:13-14</a>), myrrh (<a href="?bref=Song.1.13">1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.6">4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.5.1,5,13">5:1, 5, 13</a>), frankincense (<a href="?bref=Song.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.6">4:6</a>), spices (<a href="?bref=Song.5.13">5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.6.2">6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.8.14">8:14</a>), henna (<a href="?bref=Song.1.14">1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.13">4:13</a>), fragrant powders (<a href="?bref=Song.3.6">3:6</a>), saffron (<a href="?bref=Song.4.14">4:14</a>), calamus, and cinnamon (<a href="?bref=Song.4.14">4:14</a>). And there are references in other parts of the Bible to perfumes and ointments of various kinds (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2,10">1 Kgs 10:2, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.13">2 Kgs 20:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.9">Prv 27:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.24">Is 3:24</a>).</p>
<p>Perfumes were put on clothes (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.8">Ps 45:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.11">Sg 4:11</a>) and sprinkled on couches (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.17">Prv 7:17</a>). Perfumes and spices also played an important role in the burial of the dead. They were used in embalming (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.2-3,26">Gn 50:2-3, 26</a>) and were sprinkled on the bier or burned in the fire at some funerals (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.14">2 Chr 16:14</a>). Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes to be used in wrapping the body of Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.19.39-40">Jn 19:39-40</a>). In the funeral of Herod the Great, 500 slaves carried the spices (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 17.8.3).</p>
<p>Besides the personal use of such materials, there was a wide range of oils, perfumes, and incense used in worship. A holy anointing oil was used to anoint the tabernacle and its furnishings and the Aaronic priests at their induction (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.22-25">Ex 30:22-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.133.1-3">Ps 133</a>). An interesting prescription for the sacred incense to be prepared by the perfumer is given in <a href="?bref=Exod.30.34-35">Exodus 30:34-35</a>. The items listed are well known both in Israel and in other parts of the ancient East.</p>
<p>The NT contains a number of figurative references. Christ gave himself as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.2">Eph 5:2</a>). The gifts of the Philippians to Paul were described as a fragrant offering (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.18">Phil 4:18</a>) and the prayers of the saints are described as bowls of incense (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.8">Rv 5:8</a>).</p>

  <title>Perga</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PERGA</p>
<p class="fl">City probably of very early Greek origin and the religious capital of ancient Pamphylia. In the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Romans overthrew a Syrian garrison there, and thereafter the city apparently had a substantial degree of independence from external control.</p>
<p>On their first missionary journey, Paul and his colleagues passed through the city on their way to Pisidian Antioch. The Acts of the Apostles reports no preaching activity on that occasion but notes only that it was at Perga that John Mark left his companions and returned to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.13-14">Acts 13:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>If we assume that Luke would have recorded the fact that Paul had preached during this visit, we can only speculate why he did not do so. The presence nearby of a renowned temple of Artemis, an Anatolian nature goddess, would surely have challenged rather than deterred him. The apostle may have been ill (some commentators suggest a possible connection with the reference in <a href="?bref=Gal.4.13">Gal 4:13</a>), but in that case we might have expected Barnabas to have taken his place. It has been suggested that at this point the group had disagreed about outreach to and acceptance of Gentiles, and that it was his differences with Paul (and perhaps his resentment at the latter’s leadership) that precipitated John Mark’s departure.</p>
<p>On the homeward journey, however, Paul and Barnabas “preached the word in Perga” before going on down to Attalia, where they took a ship to Antioch of Syria (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.25-26">Acts 14:25-26</a>). The results from that preaching are not known, but it is evident that Christianity did not flourish in Perga, as it did in other cities of Asia Minor.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">PERGAMOS*, PERGAMUM</p>
<p class="fl">City just north of the Caicus River, in the southern part of Mysia (western Turkey), and one of the greatest cultural centers of the Hellenistic era. The early geographer Strabo (63 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 24?) called the area around Pergamum the richest land in Mysia. It is mentioned only twice in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.11">Rv 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.12">2:12</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Pergamos”), both times referring to one of the seven churches of Asia to which the last book of the NT was written.</p>
<p>The province of Mysia was combined with Lydia and Caria to form the Roman district of Asia, comprising the western portion of modern Turkey. Pergamum lies less than 20 miles (32.3 kilometers) inland from the sea and about three miles (4.8 kilometers) north of the Caicus River on a large conical hill, 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) high, which is sandwiched between two smaller streams that flow into the Caicus, the Selinus on the west and the Cetius on the east. This natural position of strength, combined with its religious significance as a temple site, made it a desirable place to store wealth. Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great’s generals, deposited an enormous sum of money here (9,000 talents), which was later used by Pergamene kings to create the glory of Pergamum. Although coins were minted in Pergamum before 400 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was not a great city until long after the death of Alexander.</p>
<p>The splendor of Pergamum began with Attalus I (241–197 <span class="era">BC</span>), who took the title of king and founded the Attalic dynasty. His wealth, success in battle (defeating the Gauls who moved into Galatia in 278 <span class="era">BC</span>), and his judicial alliance with the rising power of Rome contributed to his ability to embellish his kingdom with Hellenistic culture. He adorned it with temples, theaters, a library, and other public buildings.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by his son Eumenes II, who, because of his help in Rome’s conquest of the Seleucid kingdom of Syria, was given in 189 <span class="era">BC</span> all Seleucid territory northwest of the Taurus mountains, thus extending the Pergamene kingdom from the Taurus to the Dardanelles. Under Eumenes (197–159 <span class="era">BC</span>), Pergamum attained the height of its power and glory. He expanded the library to 200,000 volumes, almost rivaling the great one at Alexandria, and he constructed the altar of Zeus, which stood on a hill 800 feet (243.8 meters) above the city and could be seen for miles. It is tempting to imagine this altar as the place “where Satan’s throne is” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.13">Rv 2:13</a>), especially since Pergamum was the chief center of worship for four of the greatest pagan deities—Zeus, Athena, Dionysus, and Asclepius. However, it may be that Revelation is referring to the fact that Pergamum was the center of emperor worship in Asia at that time.</p>
<p>The last king of the Attalic dynasty, Attalus III, died without leaving an heir in 133 <span class="era">BC</span>. In his will he gave all of his kingdom to Rome, with the exception of Pergamum and other Greek cities, which were given freedom as independent administrative units and were exempt from tribute. In order to reduce its obligation to police, the Roman consul bequeathed the easternmost territory of Phrygia to Pontus and Cappadocia. Thus, the newly created Roman province of Asia was smaller than the Pergamene Empire had been. Even though after 120 <span class="era">BC</span> Phrygia was reclaimed by the Roman senate (upon the death of Mithridates, king of Pontus), it was not actually incorporated into Asia until 85 <span class="era">BC</span>. At that time, the Roman provincial unit was again roughly comparable in size to the old Pergamene kingdom.</p>

<p>Pergamum was built across the centuries in three separate areas. The upper city on top of the mountain was the northernmost area and was largely the domain of the royal family, the nobility, and the military commanders. It had an air of officialdom. The middle city, further south and lower down the mountain, contained the part of the city visited by the common people and included sports fields for the youth and temples frequented by those of less education. These facilities were not controlled directly by the city and the priesthood, and the general citizenship of Pergamum had unrestricted access to them. The third area, across the Selinus River to the southwest, contained the famous Asclepian of Pergamum, a center for the healing arts. This center had a medical school that produced the celebrated physician Galen. Here the god Asclepius was worshiped in a cylindrical temple, which was a small replica of the famed Pantheon built in Rome some 20 years before (<span class="era">AD</span> 130). There was also a lovely fountain, theater, pool, medical building, library, and various temples, the striking remains of which may still be seen.</p>
<p>The references in <a href="?bref=Rev.2.12-15">Revelation 2:12-15</a> to the Nicolaitans and those who held the doctrine of Balaam probably refers to the extensive influence of the immoral and idolatrous worship of Dionysus and Aphrodite, which was especially offensive to the known Jewish population (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.10.22), as well as to true Christians. Pliny (<span class="ital">Natural History</span> 5.30) considered Pergamum to be the most distinguished city of Asia and as such it would have been the natural place for emperor worship. The reference to the martyrdom of Antipas, “my faithful witness” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.13">Rv 2:13</a>), can easily be understood in the light of the Jewish and Christian refusal to worship the emperor in this city.</p>
<p>Because of the extensive manufacture of writing material from sheepskin in Pergamum, the name parchment (Latin, <span class="ital">pergamena</span>) was given to the product.</p>

<p class="h1">PERIZZITE</p>
<p class="fl">One of several population segments occupying the land of Palestine prior to and subsequent to the Israelite conquest (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.20">Gn 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.8,17">Ex 3:8, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.23">23:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.2">33:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.11">34:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1">Dt 7:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.17">20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.3.10">Jos 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1">9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.3">11:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.8">12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.11">24:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20">1 Kgs 9:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.7">2 Chr 8:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1">Ezr 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.8">Neh 9:8</a>). The enumeration of these peoples throughout the OT serves a variety of purposes, none of which is strictly historical or geographical. It serves to inform the reader that, no matter how numerous, the doom of these people is sure when God’s time has come (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.20">Gn 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.8">Ex 3:8</a>). At other times, they are mentioned to illustrate the hostility of the enemies of God against Israel’s onward march into the land promised to them by the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1">Jos 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.3">11:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.11">24:11</a>). But they are also portrayed as conquered and reduced to servile labor (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.8">Jos 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20">1 Kgs 9:20</a>). In the postexilic period, they continue to be a threat to the purity of life of the covenant community recently settled in the land of their fathers (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1">Ezr 9:1</a>).</p>
<p>There are a few instances where the word “Perizzites” occurs in conjunction with “Canaanites” (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.7">Gn 13:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.34.30">34:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.4-5">Jgs 1:4-5</a>), and in one instance it is combined with “Rephaites” (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.15">Jos 17:15</a>). The name “Pirizzi” also occurs once in the tablets of El Amarna.</p>
<p>The exact identity of the Perizzites has thus far remained obscure. In a few instances in which the name occurs in conjunction with “Canaanites,” it seems to refer to one of the major components of Canaan’s population. Some have even suggested that the Perizzites were the pre-Canaanite population of Palestine, in view of the omission of them in the list of <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Genesis 10</a>. But this cannot be proven. Others have attempted to read this name as an appellative meaning “inhabitants of unwalled villages.” This view finds some support in another Hebrew word, <span class="hebrew">perazoth</span><span class="ital">,</span> “unwalled villages” (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.19">Est 9:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.11">Ez 38:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.4">Zec 2:4</a>; cf. also <span class="hebrew">perazi</span><span class="ital">,</span> “open country,” <a href="?bref=Deut.3.5">Dt 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.18">1 Sm 6:18</a>). But the fact that the name occurs so frequently among other peoples whose identity is known should caution against such an approach.</p>
<p>Several commentators, instead of regarding the Perizzites as one of the major components of Canaan’s population, have sought to localize them, either in the vicinity of Bethel (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.13.7">Gn 13:7</a>) or of Shechem (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.30">34:30</a>), or in the territory of Judah (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.4-5">Jgs 1:4-5</a>). But these locales are by no means contiguous. The reference to the Rephaim (<span class="sc">nlt</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span> “Rephaites”) in <a href="?bref=Josh.17.15">Joshua 17:15</a> has prompted the suggestion that the Perizzites belonged to the Transjordan region, but this does not follow either from the immediate context or from the use of the word “Rephaim” elsewhere.</p>

  <title>Persecution</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PERSECUTION</p>
<p class="fl">Infliction of suffering, injury, or death on others because of their identity or beliefs. The Bible begins with an account of the persecution of the righteous by the unrighteous (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-7">Gn 4:3-7</a>, “regard for Abel”; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.35">Mt 23:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.4">Heb 11:4</a>). The Wisdom of Solomon (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.2.12-20">Wisd of Sol 2:12-20</a>) dramatically illustrates the envy and guilt that prompt such persecution. Lot’s experience, likewise, illustrates the suffering involved in refusing to conform to popular behavior (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.9">Gn 19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.7-8">2 Pt 2:7-8</a>). The ill-treatment of Israel in Egypt, like her later oppression by the Philistines, Midianites, and others, had economic and political grounds. For those refusing to accept the royal policy of syncretism, official tolerance of injustice, and pagan immoralities, persecution becomes frequent—from Elijah’s period onward (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.10">1 Kgs 19:10</a>). Later prophets, as spokesmen of uncompromising truth and the claims of divine law in the face of social evils, suffered severely at the hands of the ruling classes, so that persecution became, in Jewish eyes, the hallmark of the true prophet (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.15-16">2 Chr 36:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.12">Mt 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.29-37">23:29-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.52">Acts 7:52</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.32-38">Heb 11:32-38</a>).</p>
<p>Daniel’s stories illustrate persecution during the exile. On the return under foreign rule, strict Jews sought to preserve the nation’s identity and religion amid alien pressures and the compromises of lax Jews anxious for accommodation and prosperity (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.11-15">1 Macc 1:11-15</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.42-48">2:42-48</a>). The result was the social oppression and harassment that made the repeated pleas for vindication and divine intervention, in such psalms as <a href="?bref=Ps.10.1-18">10</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-36">69</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.140.1-13">140</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.149.1-9">149</a>, painfully relevant in postexilic worship. This persecution reached a horrifying climax of cruelty during the Maccabean age, provoking armed resistance in response (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.1-7.42">2 Macc 6–7</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.35-38">Heb 11:35-38</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, despite her confidence in God’s sovereignty and “protection,” Israel learned that right does not always prosper in this world, that faithfulness to truth does not ensure immunity from suffering, sacrifice, or martyrdom.</p>
<p>This acceptance of the high cost of righteousness was inherited by Christianity. Jesus repeatedly warned of persecution, even within households, and urged “armed” preparation for it, promising the Spirit’s assistance at judicial examinations (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.11-12">Mt 5:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.16-23,34-36">10:16-23, 34-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.34">23:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.26">Lk 6:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.35-36">22:35-36</a>). Jesus was deeply angered by the murder of John the Baptist by Herod (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.9">Lk 23:9</a>), and he foresaw his own fate. Because he criticized the legalism and nationalism of the Pharisees, and the compromises of the Sadducees to protect their own privileges (<a href="?bref=John.11.47-50">Jn 11:47-50</a>), and because he disappointed the militaristic hopes set upon the Messiah by the common people, Jesus knew he would be rejected. His call to discipleship came to include warnings of danger, reviling, slander, accusation, flogging, arraignment before courts, hatred, and death. He frankly invited followers to prepare for his crucifixion, as the only way to life and the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21-26">Mt 16:21-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.17-22">20:17-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.29-30">Mk 10:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.18-25">Jn 15:18-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>). Jesus was killed on the charges of subverting the nation, forbidding payment of taxes to the Romans, and claiming to be king (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.2">Lk 23:2</a>).</p>
<p>The first persecution of the church by Jewish authorities was provoked mainly by Peter’s accusations concerning the murder of the Messiah. As apostolic influence increased, official action came to include imprisonment and beating (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.17,40">Acts 5:17, 40</a>). The powerful advocacy of the Hellenist Stephen provoked a Jewish mob to stone him (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-7.60">Acts 6–7</a>)—the signal for “a great persecution,” scattering most Christians from Jerusalem. The conversion of the archpersecutor Saul of Tarsus marked a resounding victory over opposition, and Herod’s sudden death just after attacking the church “to please the Jews” was another (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-3,20-24">Acts 12:1-3, 20-24</a>).</p>
<p>As Christianity moved into the Gentile world, a new cause of Jewish persecution arose as disturbances began to occur in the synagogues (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.44-45,50">Acts 13:44-45, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.1-6,19">14:1-6, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.1,5,13">17:1, 5, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.4-6,12">18:4-6, 12</a>). In addition, the healing of the slave girl at Philippi led to the disciples’ imprisonment (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.19-24">16:19-24</a>); at Ephesus, the effect of Christian preaching on the trade of idol makers occasioned a dangerous threat, which the authorities averted (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-41">19:23-41</a>). Paul averted the plot of more than 40 men who vowed to ambush him and kill him (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.4-36">21:4-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.12-15">23:12-15</a>). And the book of Acts closes with Paul awaiting trial before Caesar (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.30-31">28:30-31</a>).</p>
<p>Throughout this period, persecution of Christians was sporadic, local, and mainly Jewish, provoked by envy of the church’s missionary success. Officially, Christianity, as a Jewish sect (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.5,14">Acts 24:5, 14</a>), shared the state’s legal recognition won by the Jews. Thus, Paul received Roman protection at Paphos, Philippi, Corinth, Ephesus, and Jerusalem from governors Felix and Festus and their adviser Herod Agrippa, as well as from the centurion conveying him to Rome. This explains Paul’s confident appeal to Caesar; an imperial acquittal would ensure Christianity freedom from harassment throughout the empire.</p>
<p>Paul’s attitude to persecution included regretful remembrance of his own persecuting days (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.4">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.9-11">26:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.22-24">Gal 1:22-24</a>), deliberate acceptance of risks in obedience to Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.22-24">Acts 20:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.13">21:13</a>), continual warning that tribulation is inseparable from discipleship (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.22">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.3">Rom 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.12">12:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.4">1 Thes 3:4</a>), and assurance that in every form of tribulation Christians are more than conquerors (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.35-37">Rom 8:35-37</a>).</p>
<p>Almost certainly, Paul was beheaded during fierce persecution at Rome following the fire for which the Christians were blamed. Christians were often accused of “atheism” (rejecting polytheism), of appealing only to slave classes, of “scandalous” love feasts, and unsociable, austere behavior (cf. <a href="?bref=John.15.19">Jn 15:19</a>), making them a popular target for blame.</p>
<p>About this time, Peter warned Christians in the East of the danger confronting the church. For a little while, “various trials” only prove the genuineness of faith (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6">1 Pt 1:6</a>). Slander should be answered by blameless living. Honor should be paid to the authorities. Suffering for righteousness should be accepted without fear. Let Christians prepare respectful defenses, with consciences clear of blame. If they suffer for doing right, remember that Christ did too—for them. Thus they must “arm” themselves for suffering (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1">4:1</a>), and not be surprised at persecution as “something strange” (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12">12</a>). They are sharing Christ’s sufferings. His final word is “Stand fast!”</p>
<p>Mark, too, is thought to have written at this time for the benefit of the suffering Roman church. His Gospel dwells upon Christ’s conflict, its causes and forms, and vividly portrays Christ’s own heroic death. Like Peter, Mark meets persecution by pointing back to the suffering Lord.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, Christianity was exposed as an “illegal religion,” no longer a protected sect of Judaism, by the introduction into synagogue services of a prayer against “Nazarenes,” which Christians could not offer. Thereafter, the church was liable to official suppression. Rome readily incorporated old, national religions into state rituals for the sake of imperial unity, but she resisted new, nonconformist movements, especially those with secret meetings (i.e., the Eucharist), as politically dangerous (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.17.6-7">Acts 17:6-7</a>).</p>
<p>Toward the end of the century, faced with a growing church and political unrest, the state required public “worship” of “the genius of Rome” alongside any other religious rites. In Domitian’s reign (<span class="era">AD</span> 81–96) this became worship of the living emperor, with elaborate temples and an official priesthood. When Christians refused, acknowledging Jesus alone as divine Lord, official, and increasingly barbaric, persecution began. It is probable that Revelation reflects this situation (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rv 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.13">2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.9">6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.2">19:2</a>). So the Bible ends as it began, with the theme of the persecution of the people of God.</p>

<p class="h1">PERSEVERANCE</p>
<p class="fl">Action or condition of steadfastness. OT Israel waited generations for fulfillment of promises that many believers never lived to see (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.1,13,21-22,39">Heb 11:1, 13, 21-22, 39</a>). The promise to Abraham sustained hope for centuries before Canaan was possessed. The lesson of the wilderness journey, when the waning of initial zeal prevented the people from entering the Promised Land, was never forgotten (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.16-19">3:16-19</a>). Prophets looked constantly beyond failure and tragedy to distant horizons, and they nourished a patient faith (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.1-15">Jer 32:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.4-5">Hos 3:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">Jl 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.2.1-3">Hb 2:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.11-13">Dn 12:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>The NT everywhere urges similar perseverance. Among several Greek expressions, the usual word, <span class="greek">proskartereo</span><span class="ital">,</span> has the root meaning “to attend continually, adhere steadfastly” (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.9">Mk 3:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.13">Acts 8:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.7">10:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.6">Rom 13:6</a>), and is variously translated “devoted,” “continued,” “constant,” “[be] steadfast.”</p>
<p>This persistent patience is called for in prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.1-8">Lk 18:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.2">Col 4:2</a>); in well doing (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.7">Rom 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.9">Gal 6:9</a>); in Christian teaching (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.42">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.14">2 Tm 3:14</a>); in affliction (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.4">2 Thes 1:4</a>); in grace (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.43">Acts 13:43</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.1">2 Cor 6:1</a>); in faith (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.22">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.23">Col 1:23</a>); in divine love (<a href="?bref=John.15.9">Jn 15:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.21">Jude 1:21</a>); in standing firm (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.13">1 Cor 16:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.15">2 Thes 2:15</a>); in abiding in Christ (<a href="?bref=John.15.4-10">Jn 15:4-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.28">1 Jn 2:28</a>); in running with patience (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.12">Heb 6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.1">12:1</a>); in not falling away (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.12">Heb 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.1-10">4:1-10</a>); and in being zealous to confirm our call and election (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.10">2 Pt 1:10</a>).</p>
<p>The failure in perseverance of Judas (<a href="?bref=John.6.71">Jn 6:71</a>), Demas (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Tm 4:10</a>), and Hymenaeus (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.17">2 Tm 2:17</a>) must be kept in mind, as well as the dread possibility of neglecting so great a salvation (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">Heb 2:3</a>), being disqualified (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.27">1 Cor 9:27</a>), falling while we think we stand (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.12">1 Cor 10:12</a>), and committing apostasy (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.1-8">Heb 6:1-8</a>). For, as Jesus said, “He who endures to the end will be saved” (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.22">Mt 10:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.13">24:13</a>). Such extraordinary emphasis cannot be accidental. The pressures of pagan society, the danger of persecution, emotional reaction after a wonderful initial experience, and the apparent implication of “instant salvation,” made it imperative for Christians to understand that by their endurance they would inherit eternal salvation (<a href="?bref=Luke.21.19">Lk 21:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.3">Rom 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.11">Col 1:11</a>).</p>
<p>Yet Scripture never implies that perseverance depends entirely upon human effort. In the OT, the redeeming purpose of God is unswerving; God’s covenant stands, though it needs to be renewed (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>). Divine love (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">hesed</span>) connotes changeless loyalty; God “will never fail nor forsake” for “his own name’s sake.” The NT assurance is that Christ will raise his own at the last day—none shall pluck them from his hand or the Father’s. Christ will keep us from falling. God is faithful; he works in us to will and work for his good pleasure, and will not allow us to be tempted beyond our strength. Nothing, in heaven or earth, present or future, shall separate us from divine love. We are already sealed by the Holy Spirit as a guarantee of eternal salvation, and we are kept by the power of God unto a salvation yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>The scriptural tension between exhortation to perseverance and assurance of salvation has given rise to much debate. The intellectual paradox is resolved only in spiritual experience.</p>

<p class="fl">Persia served as a geographical link between inner Asia and the plateau of Asia Minor. It has been described as a triangle set between two depressions, the Persian Gulf on the south and the Caspian Sea to the north. The sides of the triangle are made up of mountain ranges that enclose an area of desert. On the west the Zagros Mountains run northwest-southeast, with many fertile valleys that are suitable for agriculture. Severe summer heat requires that animals be taken to cooler elevations during that season.</p>
<p>On the north is the Elburz range, with Mt Demavend reaching a height of more than 19,000 feet (5,791.2 meters). The most heavily populated area of Persia is Azerbaijan, which, because of routes leading from various northern points, was one of the most accessible parts of the country and therefore had to be protected by strong fortifications.</p>
<p>Farther east, the Elburz becomes the mountains of Khorasan, which also afford easy passage into the country. This district, which has been called the “granary of Iran,” has been susceptible to foreign invasion over the centuries. On the south, the third side of the triangle, is another mountain range, the Makran. Within these ranges is a saline depression, the southern part of which has been regarded as more arid than the Gobi Desert.</p>
<p>One of the important sections of the country was actually an extension of the Mesopotamian plain; this was known in ancient times as Susiana and now is called Khuzistan. Here the capital, Susa, was situated. Adjoining it to the north is a mountain spur that was the location of Luristan, famous for its bronzes. Another plain, near the Caspian Sea, is tropical in climate; because of heavy rainfall, it produces an abundance and variety of food.</p>
<p>Lacking a river like the Nile or the Tigris-Euphrates system, and having no regular seasonal rains as in Palestine, the agriculture of Persia is dependent on irrigation. Rainfall varies dramatically from one region to another and the climate differs markedly with the topography.</p>
<p>In antiquity the lower mountains were heavily forested with many kinds of trees sought for building by the Sumerian kings of Mesopotamia. Alabaster, marble, lapis lazuli, carnelian, and turquoise were used from early times. Iron, copper, tin, and lead were found here. In modern times the oil resources of Iran have been widely exploited.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">The Medes (a term often used synonymously with Persians, since the two are so closely related) are a people about whom relatively little is known. They were pictured in Assyrian reliefs. It was the Median Cyaxares who teamed up with the Babylonian Nabopolassar to bring about the destruction of Nineveh in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>In the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>, a small kingdom of Persians was established at Parsumash under Achaemenes, after whom the great Persian dynasty was named. Teispes (675–640 <span class="era">BC</span>), the son and successor of Achaemenes, was under the domination of the Medes, who were gathering forces to overthrow Assyria. Trouble for the Medes freed Teispes from their control, and the weakness of Elam enabled him to gain the province of Parsa (modern Fars). The Assyrians under Ashurbanipal destroyed the nation of Elam and came into contact with the Persians under Cyrus I, son of Teispes.</p>
<p>Cambyses, son of Cyrus, married the daughter of the Median king Astyages; their son, Cyrus II the Great (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>), built a great palace complex for himself at Pasargadae. The Babylonian king, Nabonidus, allied himself with Cyrus against the Medes. Cyrus fought and defeated his grandfather, Astyages, and made the Median capital, Ecbatana, “place of assembly” (Hamadan), his own capital and set up his archives there (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.2">Ezr 6:2</a>).</p>
<p>Cyrus, and later Darius, exhibited an attitude of benevolence and generosity toward defeated enemies, a policy that sometimes worked to the disadvantage of the Persians. A capable military leader, Cyrus invaded Asia Minor and defeated Croesus, king of Lydia, and brought the Greek cities of the area into subjection. He then solidified his eastern frontier. In 539 <span class="era">BC</span> he captured Babylon with virtually no resistance and decreed that the exiled Jews could return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezr 1:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>The son of Cyrus, Cambyses II (529–522 <span class="era">BC</span>), conquered Egypt. Upon his suicide, the empire nearly disintegrated. Cambyses was succeeded by Darius I the Great (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>), the son of Hystaspis, satrap of Parthia. Darius put down the internal revolts and consolidated the empire. For efficient administration of his vast empire, he created 20 provinces or satrapies, each under a satrap or “protector of the kingdom.” Other offices were instituted to check on the activities of the satraps. Darius changed the principal capital from Pasargadae to Persepolis, where his building activities were continued by later Achaemenid kings to make a tremendous palace complex. He was a follower of Zoroaster and a worshiper of Ahura Mazda, as were Xerxes and Artaxerxes.</p>
<p>The early victory of Darius over the rebels is commemorated on the famous rock of Bisitun (Behistun). This memorial took the form of reliefs and a long cuneiform inscription in three languages: Persian, Elamite, and Akkadian. A copy of these records was made by Henry C. Rawlinson in 1855 at considerable risk, for the monument was difficult to approach, situated some 500 feet (152.4 meters) above the plain. This accomplishment played a large part in the deciphering of languages in the cuneiform script. During the later part of Darius’s reign, he suffered defeat at the hands of the Greeks at Marathon (491 <span class="era">BC</span>). Upon his death, Darius was buried in a rock-cut tomb at Naqsh-i-Rustam, a short distance northeast of Persepolis. This was a memorial consisting of reliefs and a trilingual inscription that lauds his person and reign. Later kings were buried in tombs cut in the same cliff.</p>
<p>Darius was succeeded by his son Khshayarsha, better known as Xerxes (485–465 <span class="era">BC</span>). An inscription at Persepolis lists the nations subject to him at the time of his accession and confirms his devotion to Ahura Mazda. During his rule, the Persian fleet was defeated at Salamis (480 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Artaxerxes I Longimanus (Artakhshathra, 464–424 <span class="era">BC</span>) was followed by Darius II (423–405), Artaxerxes II Mnemon (404–359), Artaxerxes III Ochus (358–338), Arses (337–336), and finally Darius III (335–331).</p>
<p>The loss of the empire has been attributed to the cowardice of Darius III, whose armies were defeated by Alexander the Great at Issus in 333 <span class="era">BC</span> and ultimately at Gaugamela, near modern Erbil (Arbela) in 331 <span class="era">BC</span>. Upon the death of Alexander in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, Persia became the lot of Seleucus, one of his generals. Persian sources say little of the period between Darius III and the beginnings of Sassanian rule in the early third century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PersiaandtheBible">Persia and the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">The biblical references to Persia occur in the later period of OT history and in the writings of the prophets who ministered during that time. The earliest mention is the reference to Cyrus in <a href="?bref=Isa.44.28-45.1">Isaiah 44:28–45:1</a>, a passage that has confounded scholars who have felt that the prophecy could not be so precise. This predictive prophecy was given to Isaiah by God more than 150 years before Cyrus captured Babylon and decreed the return of the captive Jews to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The chronological notations in Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Zechariah, Haggai, and Esther enable us to set chronological markers with some degree of certainty. The first year of Cyrus’s reign over Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1">Ezr 1:1</a>) may be fixed at 538 <span class="era">BC</span>. The rebuilding of the temple met with opposition from enemies of the Jews in the time of Cyrus and Darius (Ezr 4).</p>
<p>It was at this time that the prophets Haggai and Zechariah encouraged the Jews and urged the completion of the temple. <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Haggai 1:1</a> places the message of that prophet on the first day of the sixth month of the second year of Darius I. That translates into August 29, 520 <span class="era">BC</span>. Similarly, <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">Zechariah 1:1</a> is dated to the eighth month of the year, that is, October/November 520 <span class="era">BC</span>. The letter that was sent to Darius concerning the decree for rebuilding the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.6-17">Ezr 5:6-17</a>) brought about a search of the royal archives that Cyrus had set up at Ecbatana (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.1-2">6:1-2</a>). The finding of the decree of Cyrus enabled the Jews to complete the temple project, which was finished on March 12, 515 <span class="era">BC</span> (the third day of the month Adar in the sixth year of Darius, <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.15">Ezr 6:15</a>).</p>
<p>The work of Nehemiah occurred in the reign of Artaxerxes I Longimanus. Nehemiah’s request that he be allowed to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the wall was made in the month of Nisan in the 20th year of Artaxerxes (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">Neh 2:1</a>, April/May 445 <span class="era">BC</span>). This building project also met with strong opposition. The date is generally confirmed by a letter from the 17th year of Darius II (408 <span class="era">BC</span>) and found among the Elephantine papyri in Egypt. Two personal names found in Nehemiah also occur in this letter: the sons of Sanballat, Nehemiah’s most virulent enemy (cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">Neh 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-8">4:1-8</a>), and Johanan the grandson of Eliashib, who was high priest at Jerusalem when Nehemiah arrived there (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.1">3:1</a>). Another letter among these papyri grants Persian authority to the Jews at Elephantine to celebrate the Passover according to their custom.</p>
<p>The book of Esther is set in the time of King Ahasuerus, who is Xerxes, referred to in <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">Ezra 4:6</a> between Darius and Artaxerxes. The Hebrew Ahasuerus represents Khshayarsha, whom the Greeks called Xerxes. On the other hand, the Septuagint has Artaxerxes, and Josephus names Artaxerxes as the king mentioned in the book of Esther. Esther provides a number of details of the life and customs of Persian royalty.</p>
<p>Persia also figures in the prophecies of Ezekiel, where Persia is named among the armies of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.10">Ez 27:10</a>). It is also listed as an ally of Gog in the invasion of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.38.5">38:5</a>). The recorded history in Daniel refers to Persia (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.1">Dn 10:1</a>), as do the prophecies of that book (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.20">8:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.2">11:2</a>).</p>

  <title>Pestilence</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PESTILENCE</p>
<p class="fl">Derivative of a Hebrew word referring to a contagious epidemic disease of devastating proportions. Pestilence is never portrayed in the Bible as an aimless, naturally occurring phenomenon. It is always regarded as a judgment or punishment sent by God.</p>
<p>Pestilence was one form of chastisement brought upon Israel for neglect of her covenant obligations (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.25">Lv 26:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.21">Dt 28:21</a>). This is the reason for the frequent use of the word by both Jeremiah and Ezekiel. These prophets were prosecuting God’s covenant lawsuit against his people. The sentence had been determined, and they announced that its infliction was impending. For this reason, pestilence almost always occurs as part of a list of scourges, such as the formula “sword, famine and pestilence” used throughout Jeremiah’s prophecy (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.12">Jer 14:12</a>, etc.). Because pestilence is a punishment for sin, it is not applied indiscriminately upon all. The one who remains faithful will be protected from its effects (<a href="?bref=Ps.91.1-3">Ps 91:1-3</a>). The enemies of Israel could also be objects of this form of judgment (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.50">Ps 78:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.23">Ez 28:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.22">38:22</a>).</p>
<p>Pestilence is not identical with plague in the OT. Plague often denotes such diseases as bubonic plague, measles, and smallpox, whereas pestilence might refer to cholera, typhus, typhoid, and dysentery—diseases often afflicting a city under siege. There is some overlap in the terms, however. The death of 70,000 Israelites after David’s census is an example of the severity and virulence of this form of divine chastisement (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.13-15">2 Sm 24:13-15</a>).</p>
<p>The Greek word <span class="greek">loimos</span> occurs three times in the NT. In <a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">Acts 24:5</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) Tertullus used this term as a derogatory description of Paul—“a pestilent fellow.” Jesus predicted that the destruction of the temple would be preceded by several judgments, including pestilence or plague (<a href="?bref=Luke.21.11">Lk 21:11</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The author says he is the apostle Peter (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pt 1:1</a>), a witness of Christ’s sufferings (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1">5:1</a>)—thus one of the original apostles chosen by Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.14-19">Mk 3:14-19</a>) as an authoritative spokesman. Also known as Simon and Cephas, Peter probably saw and felt Jesus’ last hours of suffering more keenly than any of the other apostles (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.54">14:54</a>) because he had denied Jesus three times (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.66-72">66-72</a>). In 1 Peter the sufferings of Jesus are mentioned at least four times (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11">1 Pt 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.23">2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1">5:1</a>).</p>
<p>Peter was known as the apostle to the Jews, just as Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.7">Gal 2:7</a>). Since Peter was a traveling missionary (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.12">1 Cor 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">9:5</a>), he could have actually visited the Asia Minor churches to whom this letter was sent.</p>
<p>That Peter had been with Jesus during his earthly ministry may help account for the strong influence of Jesus’ teaching in 1 Peter. Except for James, 1 Peter probably echoes more of Jesus’ words than any other NT letter. The chart below presents similarities between Peter’s words and Jesus’ words in the Gospels:</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="SimilaritiesBetweenPeterSWordsIn1PeterAndJesusWordsInTheGospels"/>
<p>Some scholars think the Greek of this letter is too good to have been written by a former fisherman whose native language was Aramaic; that the doctrine is too much like Paul’s to have been written by an apostle whose position was different from Paul’s; and that someone wrote the letter after Peter’s death and used his name to give apostolic weight to it.</p>
<p>Other scholars answer that if the author wanted to give authority to a letter whose teaching resembles Paul’s, he would have used Paul’s name, not Peter’s; that most Galileans probably learned Greek as well as Aramaic early in life; and that there is no evidence that the teaching of Peter and Paul fundamentally differed. When Paul rebuked Peter (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-14">Gal 2:11-14</a>), it was due to a temporary lapse in conduct, not a basic disagreement in teaching. Besides, some key doctrines of Paul are missing from 1 Peter (e.g., justification), and those similar to Paul’s were the common possession of all the early churches. We may reasonably conclude that the apostle Peter authored this letter. However, it seems quite clear that Silas (otherwise know as Silvanus) helped Peter write this epistle (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.12">1 Pt 5:12</a>), which means (1) he functioned as an amanuensis (secretary) for Peter, (2) he translated Peter’s letter (from Aramaic to Greek) as Peter dictated it, or (3) he composed a letter based on Peter’s thoughts.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DestinationOriginDate">Destination, Origin, Date</p>
<p class="fl">The people to whom 1 Peter is addressed lived in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. These Roman provinces covered all but the southernmost part of Asia Minor, the bulk of modern Turkey.</p>
<p>Christianity may have been brought back by pilgrim Jews converted in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.9">Acts 2:9</a>). More likely, these churches included some founded by Paul on his first and second missionary journeys, and others by unknown missionaries. Peter does not explicitly include himself among “those who preached to you” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.12">1 Pt 1:12</a>).</p>
<p>Whether the readers were Christian Jews or converted pagan Gentiles is not known. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">First Peter 1:1</a> reads: “to God’s chosen people who are living as foreigners in the lands of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, the province of Asia, and Bithynia” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). That the readers are in some sense exiles is confirmed by <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.17">1:17</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.11">2:11</a>. These verses could refer to a literal exile of Jews outside of Palestine or to a spiritual exile of all believers on earth because their true home is in heaven. No one denies that there was (and is) a literal Jewish dispersion (Diaspora). Peter, viewing the church as the true Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.2.29">Rom 2:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.16">Gal 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.3">Phil 3:3</a>), may simply have transferred the language of exile from the nation Israel onto the church. The phrase used by Peter in <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.11">1 Peter 2:11</a> is almost identical to the one in <a href="?bref=Heb.11.13">Hebrews 11:13</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.23.4">Gn 23:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.39.12">Ps 39:12</a>).</p>
<p>Against the view that construes the dispersion of <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Peter 1:1</a> as Christians (Jew and Gentile), rather than Jews only, one may argue that Peter was specifically the apostle to the Jews (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.7">Gal 2:7</a>) and that the use of so much OT in 1 Peter demands a Jewish readership. But there is evidence that Peter did not restrict his ministry to Jews (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.12">1 Cor 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.12">Gal 2:12</a>), and the use of the OT is not surprising even if the readers were not Jews, because so many Gentile God-fearers (like Cornelius, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.2">Acts 10:2</a>) were familiar with the OT.</p>
<p>Whether the readers were Jews or mainly Gentiles is decided by several texts that reflect the pagan background of the readers. Peter says in <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.10">1 Peter 2:10</a> that his readers were once “not a people,” a reference to <a href="?bref=Hos.2.23">Hosea 2:23</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.25">Rom 9:25</a>). Then in <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.3">1 Peter 4:3</a> Peter describes their past “immorality and lust, their feasting and drunkenness and wild parties, and their terrible worship of idols” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This does not describe unbelieving Jews, whose problem was not gross immorality but hypocrisy and legalism. Thus the recipients of this letter must have included many Gentile Christians in Asia Minor, characterized as aliens and strangers in the world.</p>
<p>Most scholars think 1 Peter was written from Rome. The clue is found in <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">5:13</a>: “She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). Babylon (which had come to symbolize a big, powerful, evil city) was substituted as a kind of code name for Rome in much early Christian literature (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rev.14.8">Rv 14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.19">16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.5">17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.2,10,21">18:2, 10, 21</a>; cf. Sibyllene 5:143, 159).</p>
<p>The date of 1 Peter is probably <span class="era">AD</span> 64 or 65 (see next section).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheChurchesofPetersFirstLetter"/>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">While other NT writings refer now and then to Christian suffering, 1 Peter is preoccupied with it. How Christians should conduct themselves when abused is often discussed (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3-7">1 Pt 1:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12,20-23">2:12, 20-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.13-17">3:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">4:12-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.9-10">5:9-10</a>). Official state persecution cannot be clearly affirmed; abuses seem to be the common lot of all Christians everywhere (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.9">5:9</a>). Cruel masters may sometimes abuse their Christian servants (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.18-20">2:18-20</a>); Christian wives may have to endure harsh, unbelieving husbands (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>); and in general, people are on the lookout to revile Christians as wrongdoers (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12">2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9,16">3:9, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.15-16">4:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>Even though no official state persecution is in view, the letter apparently indicates that there is something worse on the horizon (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">4:12-19</a>). Peter seems to sense that the present tension between believers and their society could flare into something much worse.</p>
<p>Early church tradition says that Peter was crucified in Rome during Nero’s persecution, and there is no good reason to doubt it. Moreover, since 1 Peter was written from Rome, and since <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12">4:12</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.17">17</a> imply an impending crisis like the one that struck the Christians in Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 65, we may suppose that this letter was written not long before Nero began to oppress the Christians in Rome. According to the historian Tacitus, Nero blamed the Christians for burning Rome, in order to squelch the rumor that he himself had done it (so that he could build a greater city). His relentless persecution of Christians had not yet broken out when 1 Peter was written (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.14">2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.13">3:13</a>), but Peter may have seen it coming and may have wanted to prepare the churches outside Rome, should the holocaust reach them, too. Nero’s persecution apparently did not affect the Christians in the provinces outside Rome, but that does not diminish the value of Peter’s letter, because mostly it deals with how Christians should relate to their society and how they should respond when abuse and suffering come.</p>
<p>If this is a correct picture of the background of 1 Peter, its date would be the early to mid 60s, since the fire of Rome broke out on July 19, <span class="era">AD</span> 64, and the persecution occurred later that year or in the spring of 65.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The main purpose of 1 Peter is to exhort Christians to conduct themselves properly among the community of believers (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.8">3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-7">5:1-7</a>), but especially in non-Christian society (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12">2:12</a>), testifying clearly to their hope in Christ (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1,15">3:1, 15</a>) for God’s glory. The letter aims to help Christians understand and endure the abuses that often come from relationships with non-Christians (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6-7">1:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12,18-25">2:12, 18-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9,14-17">3:9, 14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1-5,12-19">4:1-5, 12-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8-10">5:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>Peter’s exhortation is based on the good news of God’s salvation through the death, resurrection, and second coming of Christ. God is merciful (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.10">2:10</a>), “the God of all grace” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.10">4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.12">5:12</a>), and there is hope in grace’s ultimate display at Christ’s coming (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13">1:13</a>). God foreknew and determined (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.2,20">1:2, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.8">2:8</a>) a plan of redemption by which to create a holy people for his own possession (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9-10">2:9-10</a>). Accordingly, Christ was sent into the world to accomplish this redemption for the sake of God’s elect (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.20">1:20</a>). Although he was “chosen and precious” to God, he was “rejected by men” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4">2:4</a>) who did not believe him (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.7">7</a>). But his sufferings (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11">1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1,13">4:1, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1">5:1</a>) were not a meaningless tragedy; they were for the sake of his people (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21,24">2:21, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a>), to redeem them with his precious blood from their empty way of life (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-19">1:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>Put to death in the flesh, he was “made alive by the Spirit” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a>), raised from the dead and glorified (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.21">1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.7">2:7</a>), and holds the place of authority at God’s right hand (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.22">3:22</a>). Further still, we must try to explain the link between the good news of God’s saving activity and our good conduct. The good news must be proclaimed if it is to change anybody’s life. This proclamation happens in the power of God’s Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.12">1:12</a>). It is not merely a “newscast” but is “the living and abiding word of God” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.23">1:23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.11">4:11</a>), by which God calls his people into being and summons them “out of darkness and into his wonderful light” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">2:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.15">1:15</a>), “to his eternal glory in Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.10">5:10</a>). This change is described in 1 Peter as a “new birth” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3,23">1:3, 23</a>); what distinguishes a newborn person is the “living hope” that he has in Christ (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3,13">1:3, 13</a>).</p>
<p>This hope, grounded in Christ’s resurrection and his sure return, transforms behavior (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13-15">1:13-15</a>). No longer will we have to seek satisfaction and fulfillment in harmful, unloving ways, but rather by entrusting our souls to a faithful Creator (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.7">5:7</a>), we can endure unjust suffering patiently (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.20">2:20</a>), not return evil for evil (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9">3:9</a>), and seek to extend the mercy of God to others in doing good (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12,15">2:12, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.11,16">3:11, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>).</p>
<p>Lively Christian hope does not lead us <span class="ital">out</span> of non-Christian society but rather changes our behavior <span class="ital">in</span> it. Christians are addressed as citizens of the state (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.13-17">2:13-17</a>), as slaves of cruel masters (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.18-25">18-25</a>), and as wives of unbelieving husbands (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>). By living as new and hopeful persons <span class="ital">in</span> the institutions of society, others see our good deeds and give glory to our Father in heaven (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12">2:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.16">Mt 5:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1-2">1:1–2</a></p>
<p class="fl">This section describes God’s election of his people, which is often translated using three prepositional phrases.</p>
<p>First, it is “according to the foreknowledge of God” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). This means more than God’s knowing ahead of time whom he would elect. As in <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.20">1:20</a>, foreknowledge probably also includes God’s purpose (cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.3.2">Am 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.23">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.28-30">Rom 8:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.2">11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.3">1 Cor 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.9">Gal 4:9</a>).</p>
<p>Second, the election is “by the sanctifying work of the Spirit” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>). Election involves the Spirit’s effectual work in making a person obedient to the gospel (see <a href="?bref=Rom.1.5">Rom 1:5</a>). In <a href="?bref=Eph.1.4">Ephesians 1:4</a> election is described as “before the foundation of the world” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>Third, our election is “for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The latter probably refers to the moral effect of Christ’s death in purifying our conscience and our behavior as we trust in him (see <a href="?bref=Heb.9.13-14">Heb 9:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, the elect people of God have their origin in the eternal, purposed foreknowledge of God; owe their call and conversion to the work of the Holy Spirit; and have as their goal in life obedience to God (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14">1 Pt 1:14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3-12">1:3-12</a></p>
<p class="fl">This section describes how tremendously valuable salvation is—a vast inheritance, absolutely perfect, never diminishing in beauty or worth (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.4">4</a>), the goal of our faith (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.9">9</a>), the basis of inexpressible joy (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6-8">6-8</a>). Searched into and desired by the holy prophets of old, it is so amazing that even angels desire to peer into it (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.10-12">10-12</a>).</p>
<p>It originates in the great mercy of God and was made available to people through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">3</a>). Even though a <span class="ital">future</span> inheritance is ready to be revealed in the last time (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.5">5</a>), it offers many <span class="ital">present</span> spiritual benefits for those who trust in Christ. One of them is the promise of God’s present power to cause the believer to persevere in faith (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.5">5</a>). This does not mean Christians escape hardship; it may be necessary that they suffer (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6">6</a>). If so, they should not grumble but see suffering as a refining fire for their good, because it burns away false dependencies and leaves only the pure gold of genuine faith (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.7">7</a>). So suffering may be an important preparation for the full experience of salvation, since it is faith alone that will be blessed in the end.</p>
<p>Faith is not the same as sight, for believers have never seen Jesus, yet they trust him and love him (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.8">8</a>). There are good grounds for hope (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.15">3:15</a>), founded mainly on the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1:3</a>)—a real historical event.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13-25">1:13-25</a></p>
<p class="fl">Peter now gives a command: hope fully in the grace coming to you at the revelation of Christ (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13">13</a>), and lead a new life of obedience to God (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14-15">14-15</a>). Hope is an intense desire for something and a confidence that it will come. So Peter was commanding the churches to <span class="ital">desire</span> Christ strongly and be assured of his glory and his coming. Thus, believers must use their minds and keep clearheaded (sober) about what is truly valuable in life (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13">13</a>). Full hope in Christ always results in holiness of life. If we delight in being God’s children (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14">14</a>), we will surely imitate our Father (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.15-16">15-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lv 19:2</a>).</p>
<p>But there is another motivation for good conduct: fear of God, who judges each person according to his or her works (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.17">1 Pt 1:17</a>). While Peter motivates with fear, he also assures us that we have been redeemed from our futile conduct with the precious blood of Christ (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-19">18-19</a>). We are saved by faith, not by good works. Probably Peter means us to fear God’s displeasure with unbelief. When the letter says he will judge our works, it probably means that he will look for evidences of obedient, loving conduct, which is the sure sign of hope and faith. If we are lacking in this, fear of his judgment should drive us back to God’s mercy, where we can have peace and joy, which in turn lead to love.</p>
<p>This love is commanded toward believers in verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.22">22</a>. Hope is not mentioned in verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.22-25">22-25</a>, but it is implied when Peter says we are born anew through the <span class="ital">abiding</span> Word of God. Since “the word of the Lord abides forever” (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.25">25</a> = <a href="?bref=Isa.40.6-8">Is 40:6-8</a>), those whose life depends on it will abide forever.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.2.1-10">2:1-10</a></p>
<p class="fl">This passage is filled with OT quotations and imagery, as shown in the following chart:</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="OldTestamentQuotationsAndImageryFrom1Peter2110"/>
<p>Verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">9</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.10">10</a> indicate that Peter considered the Christian church a new Israel. He probably saw the experience of the church in the world as that of an <span class="ital">exile</span> like the Jews in Babylonian exile (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1,17">1:1, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.11">2:11</a>), and considered conversion as a kind of <span class="ital">exodus</span> out of the darkness of an old futile life into God’s light, like the Jewish exodus out of Egypt.</p>
<p>Verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.6-8">6-8</a> show that Jesus is a precious jewel for some but a stumbling stone for unbelievers. Behind that stands God’s inscrutable predestination (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.8">8</a>). Those who trust him are chosen (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1:1</a>) as a royal priesthood (see below on <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">2:5</a>), as a nation having God’s own holy character (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14-15">1:14-15</a>), and as a people cherished as God’s special possession. All of this is not due to our merit but to God’s mercy (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>Verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.1-3">1-3</a> are again a command—to desire the kindness of Christ that we have tasted through the milk of the Word and so to grow stronger in faith or to hope fully in the grace of Christ.</p>
<p>Verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4-5">4-5</a> portray a complex, mixed metaphor that pictures Christ as a living stone and the church both as a spiritual house of stones and as a priesthood. The church is, on the one hand, a dwelling place for God (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16">1 Cor 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.21-22">Eph 2:21-22</a>), and on the other, a group of ministers in that dwelling who offer God the sacrifices of obedience (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-2">Rom 12:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.2.11-12">2:11-12</a></p>
<p class="fl">This is the central concern of the letter. Since Christians are exiles in this world, they must not share the same desires as unbelievers. Such fleshly desires are ephemeral and destroy the soul that follows them. Instead, God’s new people should devote themselves to good deeds, even though people may slander them, for this will ultimately cause people to glorify God. The sequence, again, is changed desires, changed behavior, God glorified (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.16">Mt 5:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.2.13-17">2:13-17</a></p>
<p class="fl">Christians should show proper respect to everyone (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.13-14">13-14</a>). That Christ died for sinners is a very humbling truth that forbids Christians to be arrogant or to think that they do not owe others love (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>). Rather, they are adjured to count others better than themselves (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.44">Mk 10:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.3">Phil 2:3</a>).</p>
<p>Peter declares, then, that believers should be subject to the king and to the civil authorities under him. They should positively devote themselves to doing good so that those who say Christianity makes no difference in life will be silenced.</p>
<p>However, subjection to the state is not absolute, for Christians are first and foremost slaves of God. It is out of freedom that they acknowledge the propriety of a God-ordained state to preserve orderly life. Because Christians serve God first, and the king is merely God’s creature, subjection to him is a subjection for the Lord’s sake, not the king’s sake.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.2.18-25">2:18-25</a></p>
<p class="fl">Christian slaves have consciences oriented toward and shaped by God (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.19">19</a>). They also have experienced his grace and are here told to rely on it by enduring unjust suffering patiently. They are not to strike back: they were called to live this way because Jesus suffered <span class="ital">for them</span> and because he suffered <span class="ital">as an example.</span> Verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21-23">21-23</a> describe the example. Verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24-25">24-25</a> describe Christ’s redemption and its effects. That is, Jesus not only modeled the life of nonretaliation but also enabled his followers to live this way by dying <span class="ital">for</span> them that they might live for righteousness (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">24</a>). Only when Christians are secure and content in the hope Christ achieved <span class="ital">for them</span> can they have the freedom and inclination to follow his costly example. When believers are tempted to take vengeance into their own hands, they should recall that even Jesus entrusted himself to God, who judges justly (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.23">23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.12.19-20">Rom 12:19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-7">3:1-7</a></p>
<p class="fl">Here are six verses for wives and one for husbands. How shall a believing wife win her unbelieving husband (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1">1</a>)? Peter warns against preoccupation with making the body more attractive (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.3">3</a>). Instead, he stresses the adornment of the heart with a meek and tranquil spirit (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.4">4</a>), accompanied by pure, loving conduct (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.2">2</a>), which may win the husband “without talk” (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1">1</a>). This is not a call to mindless subservience but to poise, to free and confident service in love. The wife is not to be afraid even of an abusive husband (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.6">6</a>). But how? By following Sarah’s example of <span class="ital">hoping</span> in God (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.5">5</a>). So it is again said that hope transforms life and enables believers to be subject to others. The wife is bound first to the Lord and only secondarily to her husband. Like the slave, the Christian wife will use her God-oriented conscience (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.16">2:16</a>) to decide when, for Christ’s sake, she cannot follow the lead of her husband.</p>
<p>Husbands are admonished in verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.7">7</a> to bring their relationships to their wives into conformity with natural and revealed truth. The <span class="ital">natural</span> truth is that women are physically weaker. This does not mean that they are inferior mentally or emotionally. It is a simple statement of observed fact: women’s bodies are not as strong as men’s. In a culture without all kinds of automatic devices, physical strength was much more crucial for survival and comfort than it is today. So the man is urged to use his superior strength for the sake of his wife. The <span class="ital">revealed</span> truth is that the wife is an “equal partner in God’s gift of new life,” to be honored and respected.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.3.8-12">3:8-12</a></p>
<p class="fl">This concludes the section <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.13-3.12">2:13–3:12</a> and admonishes the whole church first to love the brotherhood (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.8">3:8</a>) and then to love the hostile outsider (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9-12">9-12</a>). Verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9">9</a> recalls Jesus’ behavior and his commands (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.27-36">Lk 6:27-36</a>). Not only are Christians to endure abuse patiently (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.19-20">1 Pt 2:19-20</a>), they are also to react positively and “bless” those who revile them (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9">3:9</a>). To bless means to wish them well and turn the wish into a prayer. Believers’ real desire for their enemies is that they be converted and come to share in the blessing that the Christian will inherit (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1,9">1, 9</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.34.12-16">Psalm 34:12-16</a> is brought in to support the logic of verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9">9</a>. If Christians want to inherit the blessing of salvation (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.4-5">1:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.9">3:9</a>), they must bless those who revile them. This does not mean they <span class="ital">earn</span> their salvation but that salvation is the goal of faith (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.9">1:9</a>), and true faith always makes a person loving.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.3.13-17">3:13-17</a></p>
<p class="fl">Generally speaking, when Christians do good, they will not be harmed for it (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.13">13</a>). Nevertheless, it may be God’s will that Christians suffer for doing good (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.17">17</a>) and that is far better than suffering for doing evil. It is better not only because they ought never do evil but also because they are “blessed” when they suffer for righteousness’ sake (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.14">14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.10-12">Mt 5:10-12</a>). So instead of being afraid of people, believers should fear displeasing Christ and be at peace in his faithfulness (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.14-15">1 Pt 3:14-15</a> with <a href="?bref=Isa.8.12-13">Is 8:12-13</a>). Thus, their consciences will be clear and believers will be freed so that when they explain the reason for their hope, even their demeanor will bear witness to its truth (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.15">1 Pt 3:15</a> with <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1:3</a>). The Christians’ abusers may be put to shame (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.16">16</a>) and be won over (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1">3:1</a>) and give glory to God (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.12">2:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-22">3:18-22</a></p>
<p class="fl">Similar to <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21-25">2:21-25</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-21">1:18-21</a>, this unit affirms Peter’s call for patient suffering. Since Christ died once for all for mankind’s sins and thus freed everyone from guilt and opened a way into the fellowship of the merciful God, believers should be able to bear unjust suffering meekly. Refusing to bear undeserved suffering would be a mark of unbelief in the all-faithful Creator (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>) who cares for his children and wants to bear their anxieties for them (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.7">5:7</a>).</p>
<p>Just as in the days of Noah, only a few were saved (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1,20">3:1, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.17">4:17</a>), so now only a few were being saved in Peter’s hostile generation, through baptism (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-21">3:18-21</a>). Peter defined very carefully in what sense he meant that baptism saves—not by the cleansing function of the water, but rather by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the pledge of a good conscience toward God (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.21">21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1-6">4:1-6</a></p>
<p class="fl">Christians should live according to the will of God (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14">1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.1-2,11-12,15">2:1-2, 11-12, 15</a>). This will mean a break with the behavior of their unbelieving friends and will probably result in being slandered (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.4">4:4</a>). But this should not cause believers to avenge themselves, for God will take care of judgment (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.5">5</a>).</p>
<p>Believers have this command (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1">1</a>): “So then, since Christ suffered physical pain, you must arm yourselves with the same attitude he had, and be ready to suffer, too. For if you are willing to suffer for Christ, you have decided to stop sinning” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Some have taken this to mean that through a process of suffering we are increasingly sanctified; however, if suffering here refers to dying (as the parallel with <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a> and the “therefore” of <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1">4:1</a> suggest), then probably verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1">1</a> is to be understood along the lines of <a href="?bref=Rom.6.6,10-11">Romans 6:6, 10-11</a>.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">First Peter 4:6</a> is difficult. Some think it refers to the same preaching referred to in <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19">3:19</a>. Another, perhaps preferable, interpretation is that there is no preaching to the dead here but rather a preaching of the gospel to those who subsequently died. That is, those who heard the gospel, believed, and then died did not hear the gospel in vain. For the purpose of the preaching was that, while from a merely human standpoint these believers have been judged in the flesh (i.e., have died), from the divine standpoint they live in the Spirit. The purpose of verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">6</a> is thus a great encouragement to live by God’s will, even when former friends scorn the Christian hope by pointing out that even Christians die.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.4.7-11">4:7-11</a></p>
<p class="fl">Activity among believers in the church is again the theme here. Peter saw contemporary events as the beginning of the end (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.7,17">7, 17</a>). This gave an earnestness to his exhortation that believers keep their minds clear and sober for prayer.</p>
<p>By steadily drawing upon God in prayer, Christians find the help they need to love each other and to overlook many offensive things (cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-3">Eph 4:1-3</a>). This love should manifest itself in joyful hospitality, especially important in times of persecution (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.9">1 Pt 4:9</a>), and should move believers to use all their varied gifts and talents to build each other up in faith (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.10">10</a>). Two examples are given: speaking and ministering (the work of the preacher and the work of the deacon). Most important in speaking and ministering is to recognize what the goal of these gifts is and how to reach that goal. The goal is “that in all things God may be praised” (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.11">11</a>). This may be done by recognizing that he gives the strength for service and the words for edifying speech.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-19">4:12-19</a></p>
<p class="fl">Here the situation of suffering and bearing reproach for being Christians is again in view. The prospect of a “painful trial” (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12">12</a>) is impending (cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6-7">1:6-7</a>). Peter saw these sufferings (probably from hostile associates rather than official state persecution) as God’s judgment on the world, beginning with the church (vv <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.17-18">17-18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.11.31">Prv 11:31</a>). But God’s judgment on the church is not punitive but purgative (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.14">1 Pt 4:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6-7">1:6-7</a>).</p>
<p>Peter gives a reminder that suffering is a normal Christian experience (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.14">3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.22">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.3">1 Thes 3:3</a>) and that Christ himself was so mistreated (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21-25">1 Pt 2:21-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.25">Mt 10:25</a>). Christians are encouraged to entrust their souls to a faithful Creator (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">1 Pt 4:19</a>), to rejoice (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.13">13</a>), and to persevere in doing good (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">19</a>), thereby glorifying God (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.16">16</a>). When believers respond to suffering in this way, they are blessed (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.14">14</a>), for God manifests himself to them in an intimate and reassuring way.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-7">5:1-7</a></p>
<p class="fl">Again (as in <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.8">3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.7-11">4:7-11</a>) Peter treats relations within the church. He tells the elders how to be good shepherds of the flock (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>), the younger people how to treat their elders (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.5">5</a>), and everyone how to be humble toward each other.</p>
<p>Peter reminds believers that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the lowly (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.5">5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.23.12">Mt 23:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.6">Jas 4:6</a>), whom he will exalt in the age to come (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.6">1 Pt 5:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.14.11">Lk 14:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.14">18:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.10">Jas 4:10</a>). Most important, God invites his people to throw all their anxieties on him because he cares for them (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.7">1 Pt 5:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.55.22">Ps 55:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.25-30">Mt 6:25-30</a>).</p>
<p>The young people who are thus made humble will be subject to their elders and respect them (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.5">1 Pt 5:5</a>). The elders who are thus made humble will not lord it over the flock (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.3">3</a>) or be greedy or begrudging in their service (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.2">2</a>), but will lead the flock by a humble example.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8-11">5:8-11</a></p>
<p class="fl">Peter returns to his concern with suffering. Suffering is the universal lot of believers (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.9">9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12">4:12</a>). Although in one sense willed by God (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.6">1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.17">3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>), it is used by Satan to try to destroy their faith. So Peter appeals to the church to be wakeful and sober (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8">5:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13">1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.7">4:7</a>) so that they can resist the lion by faith.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=1Pet.5.12-14">5:12-14</a></p>
<p class="fl">In conclusion, Peter describes his “brief” writing as an exhortation and a testimony concerning the true grace of God. So the letter is not a call for hard labor for God; rather, it is a call to recognize, enjoy, and live by the hard labor that God graciously has exerted and will exert for his children. As was noted above, the letter was written by Silas (Greek <span class="greek">Silvanus</span><span class="ital">,</span> probably the same person as in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.25">Acts 16:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1 Thes 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.1">2 Thes 1:1</a>). It was written from Rome, and greetings were sent from Mark (probably the Gospel writer and former missionary companion of Paul—<a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">Acts 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.37">15:37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">2 Tm 4:11</a>) and the whole church. Peter’s last word is to invoke peace upon the churches and to urge them to keep the affection warm among themselves.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The author is clearly identified in <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.1">1:1</a> as Simon Peter, one of the 12 apostles chosen by Jesus. However, two things should be noted. First, its style differs markedly from that of 1 Peter. Second, because 2 Peter is obviously a later work (see Date below) and incorporates Jude in abstract, it is possible that a trusted coworker (e.g., John Mark) put together Peter’s final concerns, incorporating an abstract of Jude’s epistle after Peter’s death. Thus, 2 Peter is the final words of Peter, a type of posthumous testament directing the church in the postapostolic age. It is also possible that Peter was the author behind this work, but not the writer, as was suggested in the section on “Author” for the First Epistle. As such, the epistle could have been prepared by someone other than Silas (as was done for Peter’s first epistle) and therefore would explain the difference in style between the two epistles. Furthermore, the actual written document may have been published posthumously.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginDestination">Date, Origin, Destination</p>
<p class="fl">Tradition tells us that Peter was martyred about <span class="era">AD</span> 64 in Rome. If that is so, this work was probably written in Rome before <span class="era">AD</span> 70 (before his last teaching was forgotten) and after <span class="era">AD</span> 60 (the earliest date when Peter might have known Paul’s letters). Furthermore, it was written after Jude, for <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1-22">2 Peter 2</a> incorporates a shortened form of Jude. The Roman place of origin also accounts for 1 Clement’s apparent knowledge of 2 Peter in <span class="era">AD</span> 96, the earliest use of the letter. If <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.1">3:1</a> refers to the same churches mentioned in 1 Peter, then the letter is destined for northeastern Asia Minor. The group of churches includes some to which Paul wrote letters (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.15">3:15</a>). But the churches could just as well be all the churches, to whom Peter was sending a general message.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">In a context of many attractive libertine cults, the church was constantly in danger from teachers promoting immorality. Corinth certainly had similar problems, and <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">Romans 6</a> may show that Paul was aware of a like misuse of his teaching that had reached Rome. Paul’s declaration that Christians are free from the law (see <a href="?bref=Gal.3.1-5.26">Gal 3–5</a>) always carried the danger that instead of yielding to the Spirit, people would yield to their fallen desires, ignoring Paul’s warning that those who did such things would not inherit the kingdom of God. This tendency in the early church seems to lie behind 2 Peter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">As <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.12-15">1:12-15</a> makes clear, the letter is a testament, a final reminder of truth written in the face of the divisions caused by false teachers. It is one final attempt to stabilize the church.</p>
<p>Three main theological themes stand out: (1) a call to Christian virtue and faithfulness and to the apostolic tradition on which the church had been founded; (2) a basing of this call on the exalted status of Jesus Christ and his return in judgment, making all other goals of life irrelevant; and (3) an apocalyptic denunciation of those who had compromised with the world and were therefore living with a sub-Christian ethic.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Greeting (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The greeting stresses the authority both of Peter and of his teaching by using the title “apostle,” and solidarity with his readers by including the word “servant” and mentioning “a faith of equal standing” with respect to the readers.</p>
<p class="h3">Call to Virtue (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.3-21">1:3-21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">God has already acted to call Christians to himself. He has, by sovereign grace, given them all that is needed to truly live in a godly manner. And he has set fantastic promises before them. They must not allow themselves to be caught again in the moral morass of the world, for it was God’s purpose in saving them to enable them to escape from this trap. Instead, they should become like Christ (“participate in the divine nature”) and must therefore grow in Christian virtue. If they fail in this growth, they miss God’s promises, but zealousness to move forward will confirm their election and their future in heaven (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.3-11">1:3-11</a>).</p>
<p>Since Peter was about to die, as Jesus predicted (cf. <a href="?bref=John.21.18-19">Jn 21:18-19</a>), he wanted to give his readers a final word of encouragement. Peter’s encouragement was important for two reasons. First, he was truly an eyewitness of Christ’s glory (i.e., the Transfiguration, an event that must have deeply impressed Peter, but is cited here because it revealed the glory, power, and authority of Jesus and bound the OT and NT together). Unlike the false teachers, his tradition is based on what God really did, not on mere speculation. Second, his experience confirms OT prophecy. Like Peter and his followers in the apostolic tradition, the OT prophets were inspired by the Holy Spirit. Thus, the Spirit alone gives the true interpretation, and the idiosyncratic interpretations of the false teachers are therefore wrong (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.12-21">2 Pt 1:12-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Denunciation of False Teachers (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1-22">2:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Christians need to be encouraged to stand firm in virtue because there have always been false teachers in the church who twist the OT Scriptures to support their own behavior. One cannot be sure exactly who these teachers were, but some of their actions are clear. First, they were libertine in their morals, probably twisting Paul’s teaching on freedom from the law to support their actions (cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.15">3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-20">1 Cor 6:12-20</a> shows a similar problem in Corinth). Second, they were forming groups loyal to themselves, exploiting these people and leading them into sin (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-3.23">1 Cor 1–3</a> for another example of building splinter groups). Third, they were teaching about angelic and demonic powers, some of which they were cursing, which revealed a general disrespect for authority (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.10">2 Pt 2:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Col 2:8</a>). Fourth, while ultimately sectarian, they were still celebrating the Lord’s Supper (which at that time was still a common meal, as it would be for another century) with the church and thus defiling the whole celebration (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.13">2 Pt 2:13</a>).</p>
<p>Peter’s great concern is that these people are sectarian. (“Destructive heresies” refers to groups split from the church, not to doctrinal differences, which is the meaning “heresy” took centuries later.) These teachers formed groups marked by their immoral behavior. They denied the authority of Christ, even though he once bought them out of sin. They denied Christ by rejecting his clear teaching against greed and immorality, and led others in their wake, making the whole Christian faith disreputable before the world. Their motivation was greed, and their predicted destiny was judgment, although it might not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the Scriptures.</p>
<p>This judgment is sure, as OT examples of the judgment of immoral persons (along with the salvation of the righteous) show: for example, of angels (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Gn 6:1-4</a>), of the people of Noah’s day (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.6.5-22">5-22</a>), and of Sodom (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-19.38">18–19</a>). In each case God delivered the few righteous individuals, even though he severely judged the evil majority; this encouraged the readers to be righteous like Noah and Lot. Furthermore, the readers might identify with Lot in their own distress at the immorality going on in their church (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4-10">2 Pt 2:4-10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jude.1.6-7">Jude 1:6-7</a>).</p>
<p>Like those judged in the OT, these false teachers were both proud and ignorant, cursing spiritual powers they did not really understand (probably demonic powers, for Peter was following Jude, who drew on a tradition from the Assumption of Moses). Even angels, who know far more than these teachers do and are more powerful, are not so disrespectful. Even Satan is to be spoken of with respect, according to Scripture. The teachers were not only proud but were also immoral and greedy, even at the Lord’s Table (“reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you,” <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.13">2 Pt 2:13</a>). They claimed to teach freedom but were themselves ensnared in desire, so their words were empty. Their teaching seemed impressive, but it was all sound and wind. Because they had returned to evil after experiencing freedom from sin in Christ, they became worse off than if they had never heard the gospel. They were like dogs (cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.26.11">Prv 26:11</a>) or like pigs (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.11-22">2:11-22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jude.1.8-13">Jude 1:8-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Warning of Coming Judgment (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.1-16">3:1-16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Both the OT and Jesus himself speak of coming judgment. The false teachers may scoff at the idea, but the story of Noah shows that God does eventually judge. God judged the world in Genesis by water (the very water from which he once separated land in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Gn 1</a>); he will judge again, but this time by fire (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.1-7">2 Pt 3:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>Judgment has not yet fallen, because God is wonderfully patient; time does not have the same meaning for him as for humans. The scoffing of the false teachers simply reveals their ignorance of God. And they also do not know God’s motives for his seeming delay—that is, that God wants to forgive people, not condemn them. He takes no pleasure in sending people to hell but wills that everyone be saved; not everyone, however, will accept God’s offer, and eventually his judgment will come and the universe will be burned. All that is now visible is transitory (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.8-10">3:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, Christians ought to live holy lives, preparing for the new and permanent world God has promised them, instead of indulging in the desires of this temporary, perishing world as the false teachers do (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.11-16">3:11-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jude.1.20-21">Jude 1:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Closing (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.17-18">3:17-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In closing, Peter exhorts Christians to be on guard against false teaching. Instead of copying the life of the false teachers, they are to imitate the life of Jesus. A doxology to Christ ends the letter.</p>

  <title>Peter, the Apostle</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PETER, <span class="lc">The Apostle</span></p>
<p class="fl">One of the 12 disciples; rose to prominence both among the disciples during Jesus’ ministry and among the apostles afterwards.</p>
<p>There are actually four forms of Peter’s name in the New Testament: the Hebrew translated into Greek, “Simeon” to “Simon,” and the Aramaic translated into Greek, “Cephas” to “Petros” (meaning “rock”). His given name was Simeon bar-Jonah (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Mt 16:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.1.42">Jn 1:42</a>), “Simon the son of John,” which was common Semitic nomenclature. It is most likely that “Simon” was not merely the Greek equivalent of “Simeon” but that, having his home in bilingual Galilee, “Simon” was the alternate form he used in dealings with Gentiles. In fact, it was quite common for a cosmopolitan Jew to employ three forms of his name depending on the occasion: Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. The double name “Simon Peter” (or “Simon called Peter”) demonstrates that the second name was a later addition, similar to “Jesus, the Christ.” The number of times that the Aramaic equivalent “Cephas” is used (once in John, four times each in Galatians and 1 Corinthians), as well as its translation into the Greek (not common with proper names), indicates the importance of the secondary name. Both Aramaic and Greek forms mean “the rock,” an obvious indication of Peter’s stature in the early church (see below on <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Mt 16:18</a>). It is obvious that he was called “Simon” throughout Jesus’ ministry but came to be known as “Peter” more and more in the apostolic age.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PetersBackground">Peter’s Background</p>
<p class="fl">Peter was raised in bilingual Galilee. <a href="?bref=John.1.44">John 1:44</a> says that the home of Andrew (his brother) and Peter was Bethsaida, the whereabouts of which is difficult to place archaeologically. The only site about which we know is east of the Jordan in the district called Gaulanitis. Yet <a href="?bref=John.12.21">John 12:21</a> places Bethsaida in Galilee; however, it is possible that John is reflecting the popular use of the term “Galilee” rather than the legally correct one. Peter and Andrew had a fishing business centered in Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.21,29">Mk 1:21, 29</a>) and perhaps were partners with James and John (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.10">Lk 5:10</a>). It is also likely that they intermittently continued in their business while disciples, as indicated in the fishing scene in <a href="?bref=John.21.1-8">John 21:1-8</a>.</p>
<p>One difficulty with this is the series of statements saying, “We have left all and followed You” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.27">Mt 19:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.28">Mk 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.28">Lk 18:28</a>, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>). The majority of interpreters have given this an absolute sense of “sold” or “left” their business. However, <a href="?bref=Luke.18.28">Luke 18:28</a> occurs in the context of leaving their homes but obviously is not meant in an absolute sense. It seems most likely that the disciples did leave the practice of their fishing businesses to follow Christ, but kept the tools of their trade and returned to their trades when necessary.</p>
<p>They certainly did not abandon their families, as evidenced by Peter, who returned to his home at the end of each tour. The New Testament tells us that Peter was married. In <a href="?bref=Mark.1.29-31">Mark 1:29-31</a> Jesus heals his mother-in-law, who perhaps was living with Peter. In fact, it is possible that his home became Jesus’ headquarters in Galilee. (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.14">Matthew 8:14</a> may indicate that Jesus dwelt there.) <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">First Corinthians 9:5</a> says that Peter, along with the other married apostles, often took his wife with him on his missionary journeys. Later tradition speaks of his children (Clement of Alexandria’s <span class="ital">Stromateis</span> 2.6.52) and says that Peter was present at the martyrdom of his wife (Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span> 3.30.2).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PetersConversionandCall">Peter’s Conversion and Call</p>
<p class="fl">Peter’s brother, Andrew, was a disciple of John the Baptist, according to <a href="?bref=John.1.35-40">John 1:35-40</a>. This follows the witness of John in <a href="?bref=John.1.29-34">1:29-34</a> and is the second stage of John’s discipleship drama in chapter one—i.e., after bearing witness he now sends his own followers to Jesus. Andrew and the unnamed disciple (perhaps Philip as in <a href="?bref=John.1.43">Jn 1:43</a> or the “beloved disciple,” whom many identify with John himself) then “follow” Jesus (a term used often in John for discipleship). The next day Andrew follows the Baptist’s example and finds his brother Simon, saying, “We have found the Messiah” (<a href="?bref=John.1.41">Jn 1:41</a>, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>). Peter’s conversion is presupposed in <a href="?bref=John.1.42">John 1:42</a>, where Simon is brought to Jesus by Andrew and there given a new name.</p>
<p>There are three separate episodes in the Gospels in which Simon is called, and these overlap with three episodes in which he is given the name “Cephas” (“Peter,” which means “rock”) by Jesus. John locates the event in Judea where John the Baptist was baptizing. The synoptic Gospels have two different scenes. The first call takes place at the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">Mk 1:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-22">Mt 4:18-22</a>). Jesus is walking along the shore and sees Peter and Andrew along with James and John casting their nets into the sea. At this time he calls them to become “fishers of men.” Luke then expands this into a fishing scene (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1-11">Lk 5:1-11</a>), in which the disciples have fished all night and caught nothing but at the command of Jesus lower their nets and catch an amount of fish so great that the boat starts to sink. The episode concludes exactly like the Markan abbreviated form: Jesus says that from now on they will “catch men,” and as a result they leave everything and follow him.</p>
<p>The second synoptic episode involving Peter’s call (and his new name) is the official choice of the Twelve upon the mountain (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.13-19">Mk 3:13-19</a> and parallels); in the list of the names we have “Simon he surnamed Peter.” The final occurrence dealing with Peter’s new name is found in <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17-19">Matthew 16:17-19</a>, in connection with Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi.</p>
<p>It is somewhat difficult to harmonize these episodes properly. Were there three different episodes in which Simon was called (<a href="?bref=John.1.42">Jn 1:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.20">Mk 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.16">3:16</a>) and three separate incidents in which he was given the name Cephas/Peter (<a href="?bref=John.1.42">Jn 1:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.16">Mk 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Mt 16:18</a>)? It is attractive to a broad spectrum of academia to assume that one single event, which happened at some indeterminate time toward the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, was later expanded into these diverse traditions. However, a closer examination of the Gospel data does not necessitate such a conclusion. <a href="?bref=John.1.35-42">John 1:35-42</a> is not an institutional scene that connotes an official call. Rather, it describes the first encounter with Jesus and realization regarding his significance. The “renaming” is in the future tense and looks to a later event. Moreover, John deliberately omits most of the crisis events in Jesus’ life (the baptism, the choice of the Twelve, the Transfiguration, the words of institution at the Last Supper, Gethsemane) and replaces them with highly theological scenes that teach the spiritual significance of the events. This is what he has done here.</p>
<p>The same is true of the first synoptic call, i.e., the fishing scene. Again, there is no hint of official ordination to office here but rather a proleptic or prophetic hint of future ministry. This is especially true of the highly theological scene in Luke, which promises abundant results. Again in all three accounts the future tense is employed: “I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew and Mark), “You will catch men” (Luke, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>). The call in <a href="?bref=Mark.1.20">Mark 1:20</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.4.21">Matthew 4:21</a> and their reaction (leaving all behind and following Jesus) is the opening gambit that is finalized in the actual institutional scene in <a href="?bref=Mark.3.13-19">Mark 3:13-19</a> and parallels. The wording does not indicate that these two episodes are doublets, for the actual appointment of the disciples occurs in the second passage. We must differentiate between the original call to one segment (who became the so-called “inner circle” of the Twelve) and the final choice of all the disciples.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PetersPlaceamongtheTwelve">Peter’s Place among the Twelve</p>
<p class="fl">The prominence of Simon Peter in the Gospels and Acts cannot be disputed. While some have attempted to attribute this to his leadership role in the later church, there is no basis for that in the text of the NT. From the very beginning Simon attained preeminence above the others. In the lists of the Twelve just mentioned, Simon’s name always appears first, and in <a href="?bref=Matt.10.2">Matthew 10:2</a> it introduces his name as “the first.” Moreover, the Twelve are often designated “Peter and those with him” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.36">Mk 1:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.32">Lk 9:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.45">8:45</a>, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>).</p>
<p>Throughout the accounts Peter acted and spoke on behalf of the other disciples. At the Transfiguration it is Peter who wanted to erect tents (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.5">Mk 9:5</a>), and he alone had sufficient faith to attempt walking on the water (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.28-31">Mt 14:28-31</a>). It is Peter who asks the Lord to explain his teaching on forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.21">Mt 18:21</a>) and parables (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.15">Mt 15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.41">Lk 12:41</a>) and who speaks the disciples’ minds in <a href="?bref=Matt.19.27">Matthew 19:27</a>, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you; what’s in it for us?” (paraphrased). The collectors of the temple tax come to Peter as leader of the group (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.24">Mt 17:24</a>). As a member of the inner circle (with James and John, possibly Andrew in <a href="?bref=Mark.13.3">Mk 13:3</a>) he was often alone with Jesus (at the raising of Jairus’s daughter, <a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">Mk 5:37</a> and parallels; at the Transfiguration, <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">Mk 9:2</a> and parallels; at Gethsemane, <a href="?bref=Mark.14.33">Mk 14:33</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.26.37">Mt 26:37</a>). Jesus asks Peter and John to prepare the Passover meal in <a href="?bref=Luke.22.8">Luke 22:8</a>, and in <a href="?bref=Mark.14.37">Mark 14:37</a> (and <a href="?bref=Matt.26.40">Mt 26:40</a>) he directs his rebuke to Peter as representing the others (“Could ye not watch with me one hour?”). Finally, the message of the angel at the tomb as recorded in <a href="?bref=Mark.16.7">Mark 16:7</a> said, “Go your way, tell his disciples and Peter.” Certainly Peter held a very special place among the Twelve.</p>
<p>This was especially evident in the Caesarea Philippi episode (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-33">Mk 8:27-33</a> and parallels). It was Peter whose confession became the high point of the Gospel accounts, “Thou art the Christ” (Luke adds “of God”; Matthew, “the Son of the living God”). After Jesus then spoke of the suffering of the Son of Man, Peter rebuked him, and in Mark’s description Jesus then turned, gazed at all the disciples, and said to Peter, “Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.8.33">33</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). This was obviously directed at them all through Peter.</p>
<p>The portrait of Peter that comes through all four accounts pictures him as impulsive, often rash; he is the first to act and speak his mind and was typified by his enthusiasm for everything in which he had a part. At the sight of Jesus walking on the water, Peter asked that the Lord command him to do the same and then immediately leaped out of the boat and began doing just that. At the Transfiguration, while the others were awed into silence by the appearance of Moses and Elijah, Peter the man of action said, “If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles” (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.4">Mt 17:4</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Mark and Luke both add here that Peter did not know what he was saying. Peter’s unguarded and unthinking tendency to protest Jesus’ statements is seen not only at Caesarea Philippi but also at the foot-washing scene in <a href="?bref=John.13.4-11">John 13:4-11</a> when he said first, “You shall never ever wash my feet”; and then after Jesus’ strong retort, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me,” he reversed himself completely, stating, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and head” (<a href="?bref=John.13.8-9">13:8-9</a>, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>). Finally, in the account of the race to the tomb (<a href="?bref=John.20.2-10">Jn 20:2-10</a>), the beloved disciple, reaching the tomb first, paused while Peter immediately and impulsively entered it. Peter was certainly one who “rushed in where angels fear to tread.” However, this very trait aligns him with all of us and may be one of the major reasons why he becomes the representative disciple throughout the Gospels.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PetertheRock">Peter the Rock</p>
<p class="fl">The key to the significance of Simon Peter is obviously the controversial addendum to the Caesarea Philippi episode, found only in <a href="?bref=Matt.16.17-19">Matthew 16:17-19</a>, Jesus’ testimonial to Peter. There are several crucial aspects of this saying. The most important for this study is verse <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">18</a>, “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). There have been many interpretations of this down through history: (1) It refers to Peter as the “rock” or first bishop of the church. This was the Roman Catholic interpretation from the third century on and was employed as a prooftext for apostolic succession, but it is not hinted at anywhere in the context or even in the epistles: it was not a first-century concept. (2) The majority of Protestants since the Reformation have taken this to be a reference to Peter’s statement of faith rather than to Peter himself; but this neglects the wordplay, which is even more pronounced in Aramaic, which has only one form for “Cephas” (rock). (3) An alternative has been to take “this rock” as a reference to Jesus himself, but that is fanciful and is hardly in the context. In conclusion, “this rock” is almost certainly a reference to Peter, but it must be understood in two ways. First, Peter was to become the foundation upon which Christ would build his church, a position clearly attested to in Acts. This does not mean that Peter had an authority above the other apostles. Paul’s rebuke of Peter in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-14">Galatians 2:11-14</a> demonstrates that he was not above them, and at the Jerusalem council in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> it is James who has the position of leadership. Second, Peter is seen here not merely as an individual but as the representative of the disciples. This view is coming to increasing prominence today. It recognized the Jewish concept of “corporate identity” in which the leader was identified with the corporate body (e.g., the king or high priest representing the nation before God). This concept is also in keeping with <a href="?bref=Matt.18.18-20">Matthew 18:18-20</a>, which passes on the same authority to the church as is here given to Peter. In this view Peter as the rock becomes the first of the building blocks upon which Christ, the chief cornerstone (to continue the metaphor), will build his church (see <a href="?bref=Eph.2.19-20">Eph 2:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>Two other aspects are worthy of note here. First, verse <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">18</a> says, “the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” The “gates of hell” is a common Jewish euphemism for death’s inevitable and irrevocable power. Jesus is saying that Satan will not be triumphant over the church, and his sphere of operations, death, will be defeated (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.26,54-55">1 Cor 15:26, 54-55</a>). The church would undergo persecution and martyrdom, but the church would be triumphant.</p>
<p>Second, verse <a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">19</a> promises, “I will give unto thee [singular] the keys of the kingdom,” another statement used of apostolic succession by the medieval church. Again, this must be understood in light of corporate identity; Peter, as the preeminent figure in the early church, here embodies the community in his leadership. The “keys of the kingdom” are in direct contrast to the “gates of hell” (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.1.18">Rv 1:18</a>, “the keys of hell and death” and <a href="?bref=Rev.3.7">Rv 3:7</a>, the “key of David”), and this follows the imagery of the building seen in the rock upon which Christ will build his church. Here Peter is given the keys that will unlock the power of the kingdom in building God’s community, the church. The future tense (“will give”) undoubtedly points to the postresurrection period, when that power was unleashed and the church erected.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PetertheApostle">Peter the Apostle</p>
<p class="fl">Two events led to the new Peter who fills the pages of Acts: his reinstatement described in <a href="?bref=John.21.15-17">John 21:15-17</a> and the resurrection appearance of the Lord, which is never described but alluded to in <a href="?bref=Luke.24.34">Luke 24:34</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.5">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>. His denial was certainly proof that he was not yet able to assume his predicted position as the rock of the church. Both Luke and Paul seem to state that the risen Lord appeared to Simon Peter before the others, which would be fitting in light of his preeminence in the early church. During the Palestinian era, the fifteen-year period prior to the Gentile mission, Peter was the leading figure. The others mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-12.25">Acts 1–12</a> are all secondary to Peter, the dominant director of church policy. These include John, who is with Peter in the temple (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1">3:1</a>), the prison (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.13">4:13</a>), and Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.14">8:14</a>); Stephen, who was one of the Seven and whose revolutionary preaching led to his martyrdom (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-7.60">6–7</a>); Philip, another of the Seven who proclaimed the gospel in Samaria and to the Ethiopian eunuch (ch <a href="?bref=John.8.1-59">8</a>); Barnabas, who set an example of communal sharing (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.36-37">4:36-37</a>) and was an official delegate to Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.20-30">11:20-30</a>); Paul, a miraculous convert and witness (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-30">9:1-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.25-30">11:25-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">12:25</a>); and James, who became the first apostolic martyr (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.2">12:2</a>). It is Peter who proposes the choice of the 12th disciple (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.15-17">1:15-17</a>), who proclaims the gospel at Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.14-40">2:14-40</a>), who utters the healing word (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.6">3:6</a>), and who defends the gospel before the Sanhedrin (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.8-12,19-20">4:8-12, 19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.29-32">5:29-32</a>). The episode regarding Ananias and Sapphira is particularly poignant, for here Peter functions as the avenging messenger of God; nowhere is his authority more evident. We would also note his authority in the scene at Samaria concerning the attempt of Simon the Sorcerer to buy the charismatic power (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.18-24">8:18-24</a>). Again, it is Peter whose influence commands the situation. In these two incidents we certainly see the “binding and loosing” jurisdiction (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">Mt 16:19</a>) exhibited in Peter.</p>
<p>Yet Peter and the church still came under the strictures of their Jewish heritage. The evidence points to a Jewish proselyte self-consciousness on the part of the early church. They viewed themselves as the righteous remnant, living in the age of Messianic fulfillment, but still interpreted themselves in a Jewish sense and conducted their evangelism in the proselyte form of Jewish particularism (i.e., Gentiles could only be converted through Judaism). Two events altered this. First, the Hellenistic Jewish branch of the church rebelled against the Hebrew Christians, which resulted in the appointment of the seven deacons and a change in the orthodox policy of the Palestinian church. Second, this then led to a new preaching ministry, first by Stephen, whose insights ended in his martyrdom and the dispersal of the Hellenistic branch in chapter <a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-40">8</a>; then by Philip and others, who extended the gospel even further, to the Samaritans and God-fearers. As a further result, Peter and John came to Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.14">8:14</a>), the next significant step toward the Gentile mission. Thus ended the centrality of Jerusalem in the unfolding story.</p>
<p>The two miracles of Peter, at Lydda (the paralytic) and Joppa (raising the dead woman) in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-42">Acts 9:32-42</a>, are probably intended to parallel similar miracles of Jesus in Luke’s first work (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.18-26">Lk 5:18-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.49-56">8:49-56</a>). This is part of a major theme in Acts whereby Jesus’ life and ministry are paralleled and continued in the work of the Spirit through the church. Again Peter is seen in a representative role.</p>
<p>The new relationships are extended in two further scenes. First, Peter stays with “Simon, a tanner,” in Joppa, an unclean trade; no pious Jew would knowingly have social contact with such a one. Even more important, God teaches Peter through a dream (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.10-16">10:10-16</a>) that the old dichotomy between clean and unclean has been broken. This then leads Peter to the home of an uncircumcised Gentile, the most serious social taboo for the Jew, and subsequent events force Peter to admit Gentiles into the church without the necessity of Jewish proselyte requirements. The serious consequences of this are seen in the debate that ensued in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.2-3">Acts 11:2-3</a>) and later at the council (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-21">Acts 15:1-21</a>). The centrality of this event is demonstrated in the extent to which Luke reproduces Peter’s speech, which seems to be a repetition of chapter <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10</a> but is meant to highlight this crucial episode. Often forgotten in the significance of this for the early church is the fact that for Luke the Gentile mission begins with Peter, not Paul. He is the one upon whom the salvific act of God descends; and as the leader of the church, he was the first important witness to it.</p>
<p>The persecution of Herod Agrippa (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-4">Acts 12:1-4</a>) was likely due to the furor caused by this free intercourse with Gentiles; and it ended the period of Peter’s leadership in Jerusalem. The Jewish people were greatly offended by the new Christian push; and according to Luke in Acts, the idyllic period of popularity, in which the common people supported the church, effectively ceased at this time. Peter’s miraculous release and the dramatic scene at Mary’s house typified the special place of Peter, but the momentum shifts. Peter is forced to flee Jerusalem, and in the interim James arises to leadership (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.17">Acts 12:17</a>); at the Jerusalem council it is the latter who has the chair and presents the council’s decision (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.6-29">Acts 15:6-29</a>).</p>
<p>The exact relationship between Peter and the other disciples, especially with the so-called pillars—James and John—and the apostle Paul, cannot be ascertained. The evidence is too vague. Many have thought that indeed there were no truly universal leaders, for the early church was too diverse. However, that is unlikely, and Luke’s portrayal in Acts parallels Paul’s statement in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.8">Galatians 2:8</a> that Peter was the apostle par excellence to the “circumcised” and Paul to the “Gentiles.” They were the universal leaders, while James became the local leader of the Jerusalem eldership. However, neither Peter nor Paul had dominical status similar to that of later popes (i.e., neither was the absolute spokesman of the church and above criticism). So-called emissaries from James could have such an influence on Peter that he would hypocritically change his behavior before Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.12">Gal 2:12</a>), and Paul could rebuke Peter publicly for doing so (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-14">Gal 2:11-14</a>). Paul never claimed authority over the other disciples and even sought their approval and “the right hands of fellowship” for his ministry to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Gal 2:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PetersFutureMinistry">Peter’s Future Ministry</p>
<p class="fl">We have very little hard evidence for Peter’s other movements. It seems as though Peter gradually turned from leadership to missionary work. However, this is an oversimplification. It is most likely that, following the similar pattern of Paul, he combined the two. The presence of a “Cephas party” at Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.12">1 Cor 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.22">3:22</a>) may indicate that Peter had spent some time there. This is made even more likely when Paul uses Peter as the main example for taking one’s wife on missionary expeditions (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">1 Cor 9:5</a>). The “Cephas party” probably consisted of those who were converted under his ministry; it is probable that they were Jewish Christians and opposed the “Paul party” on Jewish-Gentile debates reflected elsewhere in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>The First Epistle of Peter was sent to churches in northern Asia Minor—the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. The problem here is that there is no hint that Peter had been there and no personal notations in the epistle to demonstrate his acquaintance with these churches. However, it does show that he was very interested in them. In fact, some believe that the reason why Paul was not allowed into this district according to <a href="?bref=Acts.16.7-8">Acts 16:7-8</a> was that Peter was already ministering there. In short, the question of Peter’s involvement in Asia Minor must remain an open one.</p>
<p>There is no final NT evidence that Peter went to Rome. <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">First Peter 5:13</a> says that the epistle was sent from “Babylon,” and it is doubtful that this was the literal Babylon, because there is no tradition that Peter ever went there, and Babylon was sparsely populated back then. It is probably a cryptic symbol for Rome, the “Babylon of the West.” It is most likely that the “Babylon” of <a href="?bref=Rev.14.8">Revelation 14:8</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.16.19">16:19</a> is also a symbol of Rome. This would fit the strong tradition in the early church that indeed Peter did minister there.</p>
<p>There are four early external witnesses concerning Peter’s death. <a href="?bref=John.21.18">John 21:18</a> mentions only the martyrdom of Peter but does not give any hint as to the place. First Clement was written at the end of the first century and reports the martyrdom of Peter and Paul among others. While 1 Clement 5:4 testifies only to the fact and not the place of Peter’s martyrdom, a study of two aspects favors Rome—the reference to a “great multitude” of martyrdoms, which best fits the Neronian persecution, and the phrase “glorious example among us,” which shows that the people of Clement’s own church (Rome) were involved. Ignatius’s letter to the Romans (4:3) also testifies generally to the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, and again the context favors Rome as the place. He says, “I did not command you as did Peter and Paul,” which shows that they had ministries in Rome. The Ascension of Isaiah 4:2-3, a Jewish Christian work of the same period, speaks of Beliar (probably Nero) who martyrs “one of the Twelve,” almost certainly Peter. Therefore the earliest evidence does not explicitly point to Rome as the place of Peter’s death, but that is the most likely hypothesis.</p>
<p>Definite statements to that effect appear toward the end of the second century. Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, in a letter dated c. 170 (preserved in Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span> 2.25.8) says that Peter and Paul taught together in Italy. At the end of that century Irenaeus says (in <span class="ital">Against Heresies</span> 2.1-3) that Peter and Paul preached in Rome, and Tertullian in the same general period adds that Peter was martyred “like . . . the Lord” (<span class="ital">Scorpiace</span> 15). Clement of Alexandria and Origen both allude to Peter’s presence in Rome, and the latter adds the belief that he was “crucified head-downwards” (Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span> 2.15.2; 3.1.2). The tradition that Peter was crucified may be supported in <a href="?bref=John.21.18">John 21:18</a>: “when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall . . . carry thee wither thou wouldest not” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>The fact that Paul’s Epistle to the Romans (c. 55–57) does not mention Peter tells us that he could not have gone there earlier than that. If 1 Peter was written during the Neronian persecution, as those who hold to Petrine authorship believe, he must have gone there sometime in the late 50s or early 60s. Of course, the extent of his ministry in Rome also cannot be known. Some indeed have posited that he had little or no extensive stay in Rome. The facts, as they can be recovered, point to certain tentative conclusions. Peter did have some type of ministry in Rome, though the extent of it cannot be known. However, it is doubtful, in light of the early testimony to his preaching ministry there, that he was merely passing through Rome when caught in Nero’s pogrom. Therefore he most likely spent the last years of his ministry in Rome and there suffered martyrdom under Nero, perhaps by crucifixion.</p>
<p>Simon Peter, along with Paul, was the leading figure in the early church. His impact has been tragically dimmed by the acrimonious debates of Roman Catholic– Protestant circles, but the biblical evidence is clear. He was the leading disciple of Jesus and indeed the “rock” who provided the foundation for the church. As the representative disciple, his enthusiasm and even his weaknesses have made him the supreme example of the developing disciple, one who, through the power of the risen Lord, rose above his faults to become a towering figure on the church scene.</p>

Petra lay in an impressive valley about 1,000 yards (914.4 meters) wide among the mountains of western Edom, some 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) north of Aqaba. The only access to the valley is through a narrow gorge called the Siq. On all sides, massive cliffs of reddish sandstone arise. Today, ruins of many temples, houses, tombs, and other structures hewn out of the reddish sandstone remain. A Roman basilica and theater are still to be seen. The place continued through Roman times and later had a Christian church and a bishop. It fell into ruins during the days of the Muslim conquest in the seventh century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>

  <title>Pharaoh</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PHARAOH</p>
<p class="fl">Ruler over Egypt also known as “the King of Upper and Lower Egypt.” He lived in a palace known as the “great house,” which was the symbol of his authority. The Egyptian word for the palace was applied to the kings themselves during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 <span class="era">BC</span>). As king, the pharaoh personified the rule of the gods over Egypt. The 18th and 19th dynasties frequently employed the term “pharaoh” without giving the actual name of the pharaoh.</p>
<p>The title was not used officially. Rather, it was a popular designation for the king. In the OT the title was used to refer to men who lived in different historical periods. They were representatives of various dynasties. The use of the royal designation without the name was sufficient for the period in which the pharaoh ruled or for people who were acquainted with the pharaoh. For us today it is often difficult to ascertain who the pharaoh was at any given period and what dynastic period he ruled in.</p>
<p>In the OT the title pharaoh appears by itself (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.15">Gn 12:15</a>), as well as with the additional description “king of Egypt” (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.8">Dt 7:8</a>), and the name of the pharaoh, such as Neco (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29">2 Kgs 23:29</a>). The pharaoh was considered to be a representative of the gods Ra and Amon on earth. They upheld the divine order in Egypt and were supportive of the temples. The position of the pharaoh as civil and religious head of state gave him unique authority. Unlike his counterparts in the surrounding nations, the authority of the Egyptian king was not easily upset by insurrection.</p>
<p>It remains difficult to identify the pharaohs during the period of the patriarchs. Abraham and Joseph had dealings with the pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom and the second intermediate period. Also, the identity of the pharaoh of the oppression of the Israelites and of the exodus is not satisfactorily resolved. Those who hold to the early date of the exodus see Thutmose III as the pharaoh who began the oppression of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.8">Ex 1:8</a>). In this view Amenhotep II (c. 1440 <span class="era">BC</span>), who succeeded Thutmose upon his death (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.23">2:23</a>), is the pharaoh of the exodus. Another view is that the oppression began under the 18th dynasty and continued until the 19th dynasty. In this view Ramses II is the pharaoh of the exodus (c. 1290 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>During the united monarchy, Israel’s position as an international power grew. David subdued the nations on Israel’s border zones. When Joab took Edom, an Edomite prince, Hadad, fled to Egypt to find protection at pharaoh’s court. The 21st dynasty ruled in Egypt during David’s time, and it may be that Pharaoh Siamun welcomed Hadad as a political weapon to be used against the growing strength of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.14-22">1 Kgs 11:14-22</a>). Pharaoh Siamun is possibly also to be identified with the pharaoh who made an incursion into the Philistine coastland, conquering Gezer to be given as dowry to Solomon at the marriage of his daughter to Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1-2">3:1-2</a>). At the collapse of Israel’s unity, Pharaoh Shishak (Shishong I) of the 22d dynasty made a campaign against Judah and Israel and took much booty with him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-26">14:25-26</a>).</p>
<p>Pharaoh Neco defeated the Judean forces at Megiddo, killing King Josiah in action (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29">2 Kgs 23:29</a>). The last king of Judah (Zedekiah) hoped in vain for help from Egypt, where Pharaoh Hophra of the 26th dynasty ruled. The prophet Ezekiel spoke harshly against the king of Egypt: “Thus says the Lord <span class="sc">God</span>: ‘Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt. . . . It [Egypt] shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations; and I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations’ ” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.3,15">Ez 29:3, 15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Under the Persian regime, the power of the pharaohs dwindled, in fulfillment of the prophetic word.</p>

If one accepts an early date for the exodus, this foster mother of Moses could have been Hatshepsut. Some scholars who accept a later date for the exodus believe the pharaoh of the oppression was Ramses II; if so, this princess may have been the daughter of Seti I or the daughter of a pharaoh of the later 18th dynasty.

  <title>Pharisees</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PHARISEES</p>
<p class="fl">Religious sect active in Palestine during the NT period. The Pharisees are consistently depicted in the Gospels as Jesus’ antagonists. It is commonly held that the Pharisees represented mainstream Judaism early in the first century and that they were characterized by a variety of morally objectionable features. Accordingly, most Bible dictionaries and similar works of reference depict the Pharisees as greedy, hypocritical, lacking a sense of justice, overly concerned with fulfilling the literal details of the law, and insensitive to the spiritual significance of the OT. These and other characteristics are furthermore viewed as giving shape to Judaism more generally.</p>
<p>There are several problems with this common perception of Pharisaic Judaism. In the first place, the Gospels themselves give some important information that appears inconsistent with this view. Second, the primary documents of rabbinic Judaism (such as the Mishnah, the Talmud, and the Midrashim) are positive and praiseworthy. Third, it has become increasingly clear, especially since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, that prior to <span class="era">AD</span> 70 the Pharisees constituted only a small movement in a highly diversified society; whatever their popularity and influence, they can hardly be taken as representative of Judaism in general.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Origin">Origin</p>
<p class="fl">The origins of the Pharisees are obscure. According to Jewish tradition, Pharisaic (= rabbinic) Judaism can be traced back to Ezra and the beginnings of the scribal movement in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. At the opposite extreme, a few scholars argue that, since there are no explicit references to the Pharisees in historical documents prior to the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, Pharisaism appeared suddenly after the Maccabean revolt (167 <span class="era">BC</span>). Many specialists take the position that perhaps as early as the third century <span class="era">BC</span> one can find evidence of an incipient form of Pharisaism (as in The Wisdom of Joshua [Jesus] ben Sirach, also known as Ecclesiasticus). It may well be, moreover, that the intellectual pursuits associated with the work of the scribes did have something to do with the development of the Pharisees. It is also probable that prior to the Maccabean revolt some distinctive Pharisaic concerns appeared in connection with the development of the Hasidim (“the faithful ones”—traditionalists who opposed Greek influence in Jewish society).</p>
<p>According to a popular and reasonable interpretation, the Hasidim became disillusioned with the Maccabean rulers, whose conduct violated Jewish sensibilities in several respects. Some of the Hasidim separated themselves from the nation and developed into nonconformist sects, such as that of the Essenes. Those who remained tried to exert their influence on Jewish life and developed into the sect of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>The Pharisees no doubt played a significant role in Jewish affairs during the next century, even though at times they had little political clout. By NT times, they were widely recognized as religious leaders. Josephus, who tells us that he belonged to this sect, wrote toward the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span> that the Pharisees were “extremely influential among the townsfolk; and all prayers and sacred rites of divine worship are performed according to their exposition. This is the great tribute that the inhabitants of the cities, by practicing the highest ideal both in their way of living and in their discourse, have paid to the excellence of the Pharisees” (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.15). We cannot determine whether this description applies to the period before <span class="era">AD</span> 70, but the evidence of the Gospels themselves confirms it to some extent. For example, the parable of the publican and the Pharisee (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.9-14">Lk 18:9-14</a>), while it condemns the Pharisee, makes sense only if we appreciate the role reversal it announces: the wicked publican, not the one generally regarded as righteous, goes home justified.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BasicCharacteristics">Basic Characteristics</p>
<p class="fl">It is not possible to give an accurate characterization of the Pharisees, since scholars disagree sharply concerning their fundamental distinctiveness. Some stress the notion of “separateness,” partly on the basis of the supposed etymology of the name (from Hebrew <span class="hebrew">parush</span><span class="ital">,</span> “separated one,” though other suggestions have been made). A more carefully nuanced viewpoint calls attention to the Pharisees’ concern with ritual purity (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-4">Mk 7:1-4</a>). Some of the evidence indicates that the Pharisees wished to apply the priestly rituals to the people generally (this factor may help to explain the relative ease with which the Pharisees adapted to the absence of the temple and its sacrifices after <span class="era">AD</span> 70). Still another position sees the Pharisees as the scholar class. The close connection between them and the scribes (experts in the law) gives credence to this view, as does the fact that much of the later rabbinic literature reflects an intellectual pursuit, particularly in its detailed logical argumentations regarding the meaning and application of the Torah.</p>
<p>These various approaches are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, there appears to be widespread agreement about one theological conviction that was foundational to Pharisaism, namely, their commitment to the notion of a twofold law: the written Torah (the OT, principally the Pentateuch) and the oral Torah (the traditions handed down through many generations of rabbis). This is certainly one feature that distinguished them from the Sadducees (cf. Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.297-98). The latter accepted only the authority of the books of Moses and argued strongly that the importance that the Pharisees attached to oral traditions represented an unjustifiable innovation. These traditions, which sought to regulate the lives of the people before God, became more and more detailed over the course of time and were eventually brought together and written down as a single document, the Mishnah (dated c. <span class="era">AD</span> 210). Somewhere in its development the view arose that the oral law itself had been given by God to Moses and thus shared divine authority with the Scriptures.</p>
<p>A careful look at the NT helps in understanding that this feature more than anything else explains the nature of the conflict between the Pharisaic viewpoint and the message of the gospel. The apostle Paul, for example, stresses the distinctiveness of his apostolic preaching by contrasting it to “the traditions of the fathers,” which he zealously pursued in his youth (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.14">Gal 1:14</a>). Especially instructive is the key passage in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-37">Mark 7</a>, where it is written that the Pharisees complained to Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with ‘unclean’ hands?” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.7.5">5</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Christ’s reply counters their criticism with a serious indictment: “You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men. . . . Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down” (vv 8, 13 ; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.15.1-6">Mt 15:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>The importance the Pharisees attributed to their interpretations of the law compromised the authority of God’s own revelation. To make matters worse, the genius of those interpretations was to distort the doctrine of grace by relaxing the divine standards. The very example used by Jesus in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.10-12">Mark 7:10-12</a> indicates that a rabbinic regulation—the Corban—made it possible for people to ignore the fifth commandment and feel justified in so doing.</p>
<p>The Pharisaic regulations were numerous and aggravating, but at least they could be fulfilled. Those who followed scrupulously the rabbinic traditions were in danger of concluding that their conduct satisfied God’s demands (cf. Paul’s description of his own preconversion attitude, <a href="?bref=Phil.3.6">Phil 3:6</a>). And a muted sense of one’s sin goes hand in hand with a false sense of spiritual security; the need to depend on God’s mercy no longer appears crucial. This is, of course, the point of the parable of the publican and the Pharisee (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.9-14">Lk 18:9-14</a>). In contrast, Jesus calls for a much higher righteousness than that of the Pharisees: “Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.48">Mt 5:48</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">20</a>).</p>

Another identifies it with the Awaj, a river originating in the eastern foothills of Mt Hermon and flowing south of Damascus. In its early going, its course is steep and swift. The Awaj swells during the spring because of the melting of the snows on Mt Hermon, and subsides as the heat of the summer sets in. The river accounts for the good productivity of the southern Damascan plain and flows much more rapidly than the sluggish Jordan.</p>

<p class="list-text">Some years later, the Christian bishop and martyr Ignatius of Antioch also wrote a letter to the church in Philadelphia. He expressed appreciation for his recent visit with them, and encouraged them in Christian unity.</p>

<p class="fl">Christian known only from the letter addressed to him by the apostle Paul. He is mentioned nowhere else in the NT. From <a href="?bref=Col.4.17">Colossians 4:17</a> it is clear that Archippus, mentioned along with Philemon in <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.2">Philemon 1:2</a> (and perhaps his son), was a man of Colosse. Although Paul had never visited that city (<a href="?bref=Col.2.1">Col 2:1</a>), he obviously knew Philemon well. He addressed him as “our beloved co-worker” (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1">Phlm 1:1</a>); perhaps Philemon had been a colleague during Paul’s three-year mission in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.8-10">Acts 19:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.31">20:31</a>), and Paul knew that he could appeal to him on behalf of his runaway slave, Onesimus.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">In keeping with his custom and with the contemporary canons of the epistolary genre, the apostle Paul identifies himself as the author of this letter. He says that he was a prisoner at the time of writing (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.9-10,13,23">Phlm 1:9-10, 13, 23</a>) because of his witness to Jesus Christ.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientGreekManuscriptOfPhilemon"/>
<p class="h2" id="Origin">Origin</p>
<p class="fl">It is difficult to ascertain the location of Paul’s imprisonment at the time of writing. Of Caesarea, Ephesus, or Rome, either of the latter locations seems to correspond to the data available in this epistle and in Colossians, with which it is closely related (<a href="?bref=Col.4.7-14">Col 4:7-14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.23-24">Phlm 1:23-24</a>). The mention of Mark and Luke as Paul’s companions favor Rome as the point of origin of the letter (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>). However, the relative proximity of Ephesus to Colosse, where Philemon resided (about 100 miles, or 160.9 kilometers, away), and the announcement of Paul’s forthcoming visit to Colosse (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.22">22</a>) suggest Ephesus as the place of confinement. Although an Ephesian imprisonment is not explicitly mentioned in the book of Acts, the account of Paul’s missionary endeavors in that city make it clear that he met with considerable opposition (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.19">Acts 20:19</a>), which Paul describes in terms that could imply a time spent in prison (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.32">1 Cor 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8-10">2 Cor 1:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Recipient">Recipient</p>
<p class="fl">This document is often improperly viewed as a personal note from Paul to Philemon, his convert and friend, church leader in Colosse, and slave owner. In reality, the epistle is addressed to Philemon, to Apphia (presumably Philemon’s wife), to Archippus, and to the congregation of believers that met in Philemon’s house (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1-2">Phlm 1:1-2</a>). Greetings are sent by the medium of the epistle on behalf of Epaphras, Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, who represent together an impressive contingent of church leaders (vv <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.23-24">23-24</a>). Paul’s purpose in mentioning them is to make Philemon realize that his response to Paul’s plea will not be a private decision but one for which he will be accountable to the community of believers of which he is a part. In the body of Christ, matters that pertain to relationships of believers among themselves are of concern to the whole community. Such matters may not be treated as private issues, since they necessarily affect the well-being of the entire church (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.15-20">Mt 18:15-20</a>).</p>
<p>The epistle makes it clear that a warm bond of brotherly love existed between Paul and Philemon. The apostle calls Philemon his “beloved co-worker” (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1">Phlm 1:1</a>); he commends him in effusive terms for Philemon’s involvement in the missionary enterprise (vv <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.5-7">5-7</a>); he appeals to him on the basis of love (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.9">9</a>); he evokes their sharing of a common partnership (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.17">17</a>); he gently reminds Philemon that he owes his salvation to Paul (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.19">19</a>), and he says he trusts him to do what is requested of him and even more (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.21">21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The object of Paul’s letter pertains to a third party—Onesimus, the runaway slave of Philemon. After having committed some indiscretion not revealed in the letter (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.18">18</a>), the slave had escaped, and having traveled to the big city, he had sought anonymity among the heterogeneous groups of people that form the underclass of any metropolis. Through providential circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery, the fugitive slave had come under Paul’s influence; he had been converted by him (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.10">10</a>), had endeared himself to Paul’s heart (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.12">12</a>), and had become involved with him in the work of the gospel to the extent that Paul would have been glad to keep him in his service as his faithful and dear brother (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.13">13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.9">Col 4:9</a>).</p>
<p>Paul knew that, had he kept Onesimus at his side as a coworker, Philemon would have been compelled to assent to his decision (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.13-14">Phlm 1:13-14</a>). However, Paul decided to use the ambiguous situation that had developed as the occasion to make Philemon think through the implications of his faith on slavery, and to cause him to free Onesimus and elevate him to the status of brother, not only in a spiritual sense (“in the Lord”) but also in regard to his civil status (“in the flesh,” v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.16">16</a>). That Philemon acceded to Paul’s request and granted freedom to Onesimus is attested to by the preservation of this document. Had Philemon rejected Paul’s request, he would likely have destroyed the letter in order to erase from human memory what would have become incriminating evidence of his recalcitrance.</p>
<p>An intriguing postscript has been added to this story by the discovery of the repeated references to an elderly bishop named Onesimus who led the church at Ephesus in the early part of the second century, according to Ignatius’s letter to the Ephesians. The identification of the bishop with Philemon’s slave is suggested by the use in Ignatius’s letter of Paul’s play on words with the name of Onesimus in verses <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.11">11</a> and <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.20">20</a> (Onesimus means “useful” or “beneficial”). Should this be the case, it is conceivable that the former slave was the individual who collected the Pauline letters that were eventually integrated into the NT canon, including the letter to Philemon.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of Paul’s letter to Philemon was to dramatize the incongruity of the institution of slavery with Christianity and thus obtain the release of Onesimus. There is no evidence in the epistle that Paul was worried about Philemon’s inflicting upon Onesimus the harsh punishments that were prescribed by Roman law for runaway slaves. However, Paul was concerned that Onesimus not be reinstated as a slave but that he be received as a full-fledged member of Philemon’s family, and that he be treated with at least the same deference and dignity that might have been extended to Paul himself (vv <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.17,21">17, 21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Teaching">Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Among the many teachings contained in this small epistle, three deserve special mention.</p>
<p>First, the letter bears witness to the revolutionary challenge brought by the gospel to the sin-laden institutions of society. As such, it constitutes a condemnation of the practice of slavery. Jesus had denied his followers the right to own or control other human beings. Within the Christian community, mastery or leadership was to be exercised in servanthood from the bottom of the social ladder rather than hierarchically along lines of authority (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.42-45">Mk 10:42-45</a>). As a result, class differences had become irrelevant among Christians. In Christ, there was neither slave nor free but all were one in him (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Gal 3:28</a>). Enslaved Christians who could obtain their freedom were to avail themselves of the opportunity (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.21">1 Cor 7:21</a>), and those who were free were to avoid becoming slaves of men (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.23">1 Cor 7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.1">Gal 5:1</a>). Conversely, Christian slave owners were to act as servants to their slaves (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.9">Eph 6:9</a>), and all Christians were to be servants to one another (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.13">Gal 5:13</a>). Consequently, Philemon was to receive Onesimus “no longer as a slave” (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.16">Phlm 1:16</a>).</p>
<p>Second, if adherence to the gospel prohibits a conservative maintenance of the status quo, it also rules out its violent overthrow. The revolutionary temper of the gospel is expressed in a posture of servanthood rather than in militant hostility. Onesimus was advised by Paul to demonstrate this theology of liberation by returning in submission to Philemon so as to allow the Holy Spirit to effect radical change in their relationship. The employment of Satan’s methods to achieve kingdom results rules out divine intervention and results in increased oppression.</p>
<p>Finally, the epistle provides a masterful model of inspired churchmanship. The situation that had developed between Philemon and Onesimus required the mediation of an advocate who could command the respect of the former in order to speak successfully on behalf of the latter. To win his case, Paul used the psychology of commendation (vv <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.4-7">4-7</a>); he emphasized his own self-sacrificial suffering for the sake of the gospel (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.9">9</a>); he played on Philemon’s goodwill (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.14">14</a>); he appealed to personal bonds of friendship (vv <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.17,20">17, 20</a>); he offered to assume responsibility for losses incurred (v 18); he reminded Philemon of his own indebtedness to Paul (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.19">19</a>); and he announced a forthcoming encounter that might have caused embarrassment had Philemon demurred at his request (v <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.22">22</a>). Paul’s approach is personal and pastoral, friendly but fervent. It exhibits a perfect balance of firmness and finesse. It demonstrates how genuine Christian leadership is to be exercised through persuasion and entreatment rather than by heavy-handed authoritarian impositions.</p>
<p>Although it is one of the shortest documents in the Bible, the Letter to Philemon stands as a timeless monument to the dignity and equality conferred by Christ on all humans regardless of rank, gender, class, or status. It also offers Christians a mandate and a methodology to pursue effective social reform.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">PHILIP</p>
<p class="list">1. Apostle whose name is placed fifth in each of the lists of the twelve after the two pairs of brothers, Simon Peter and Andrew, and James and John (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Mt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mk 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.14">Lk 6:14</a>). John says that when John the Baptist bore witness to Jesus with the words, “Behold, the Lamb of God!” two of his disciples began to follow Jesus, and that one of these two was Andrew, who then declared to his brother Simon Peter, “We have found the Messiah,” and brought him to Jesus. (The other unnamed disciple was quite probably John himself, the writer of this account.) On the next day Jesus went to Galilee and there found Philip and addressed the call to him: “Follow me.” John adds that Philip was from Bethsaida. Philip in turn found Nathanael and told him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote,” and invited Nathanael, who was skeptical that any good could come out of Nazareth, to come and see for himself (<a href="?bref=John.1.35-51">Jn 1:35-51</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). From this is concluded that Philip was one of the first to follow Jesus and that he lost no time in persuading others to do the same.</p>
<p class="list-text">Like the other apostles, however, he still had much to learn about the person and the power of Christ. Hence, the testing question of Jesus to him on the occasion of the feeding of the 5,000, “How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?” and Philip’s puzzled response that even if they had 200 denarii (i.e., a large sum, roughly a person’s wages for half a year), it would not buy enough bread for each one to be given just a little to eat (<a href="?bref=John.6.5-7">Jn 6:5-7</a>). The miracle that followed taught him that the feeding of this multitude presented no problem to the one who is the Lord of all creation. Philip’s next appearance is in Jerusalem after Christ’s triumphal entry into the city, when “some Greeks” (i.e., Greek-speaking non-Jews) approached him with the request “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” Philip informs Andrew, and together they bring them to Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.12.20-22">12:20-22</a>). This perhaps indicates that Philip was a person whom others found readily approachable, and also that he spoke Greek. In the upper room, prior to his arrest and trial, Jesus took the opportunity to impart further instruction to Philip, who had said, “Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied.” Philip hoped perhaps, in all devoutness, for the privilege of some special revelation (reminiscent of the request of Moses, <a href="?bref=Exod.33.18">Ex 33:18</a>). But Jesus taught him that he himself, the incarnate Son, is the all-sufficient revelation of the Father to humanity (<a href="?bref=John.14.8-10">Jn 14:8-10</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is a tendency to confuse the apostle with the evangelist (see below) of the same name. It seems probable, however, that after preaching in various parts, the apostle settled in Hierapolis, a city of the Roman province of Asia, and died there. Whether his was a natural or a martyr’s death is uncertain.</p>
<p class="list-text"><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="?item=ApostleApostleship_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Apostle, Apostleship</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Hellenistic Jew and one of the seven men appointed by the church in Jerusalem to supervise the daily ministry of assistance to the impoverished widows of the Christian community. They all, including Philip, had Greek names, and one of them, Nicolaus, was a proselyte (i.e., not a Jew by birth). Whether or not they were regarded as deacons in the technical sense is not absolutely clear from the account; this occasion has, however, been generally accepted as the origin of the order of the diaconate (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-7">Acts 6:1-7</a>). Of the seven, Stephen and Philip are the only ones of whom we have any further record in the NT. They are described as men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom (v <a href="?bref=Acts.6.3">3</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">That Philip became known as “the evangelist” is apparent from <a href="?bref=Acts.21.8">Acts 21:8</a>. The designation was well deserved, for when the Jerusalem Christians were scattered by the persecution led by Saul of Tarsus, Philip went to a city of Samaria and proclaimed the gospel with such power there that a great number of people joyfully turned to Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-8">Acts 8:1-8</a>). In the midst of this spectacular work, Philip was divinely instructed to leave Samaria and go down to the desert area in the southern part of the country. Humanly speaking, for him to turn away from the multitudes, who were so eagerly responding to his preaching and to go to the uninhabited territory in the south, must have seemed foolish. Yet Philip showed himself not only sensitive but also obedient to the will of God and followed this guidance without question. In the desert he found not a crowd but a single person, an important Ethiopian court official who had visited Jerusalem and was now returning to Africa. The wisdom of God in directing Philip to this place was fully vindicated, for the Ethiopian was reading <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>, the great gospel chapter of the OT. Philip gave him the good news that this prophecy pointed to Jesus Christ. The Ethiopian subsequently believed and was baptized and went on his way rejoicing (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.8.25-40">25-40</a>). The conversion of this one person meant not only that Philip was the first to proclaim the gospel to a Gentile but also that the gospel was taken by this Ethiopian courtier to the continent of Africa.</p>
<p class="list-text">The prevailing nationalistic pride of the Jews was such that they despised the Samaritans and regarded the Gentiles as ceremonially unclean. But Philip, by his eager preaching of Christ first to the Samaritans and then to the Ethiopian, reflected the way in which the gospel penetrated social barriers and dissolved racial prejudices and demonstrated that the grace of God in Christ Jesus is freely available to all. Subsequently, Philip made his home in the coastal town of Caesarea. There he hospitably entertained Paul and Luke when they were en route to Jerusalem at the conclusion of the apostle’s third missionary journey. Luke tells us that Philip had four unmarried daughters who were prophetesses (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.8-9">Acts 21:8-9</a>). Not long after this, when Paul was in custody in Caesarea for two years, the kindness and friendship of Philip must have meant much to him (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.31-35">23:31-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.23,27">24:23, 27</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Son of Herod the Great and Cleopatra and half brother of Antipas, whose mother was Malthace. He is called Herod in <a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Luke 3:1</a>. The latter was tetrarch of Perea and Galilee from 4 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 39; Philip was tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis (plus certain other territories) to the northeast of Galilee for 37 years (4 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 33). His wife was his niece Salome, who danced for Herod in exchange for the head of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-12">Mt 14:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-29">Mk 6:17-29</a>).</p>

It was for this immoral relationship that John the Baptist rebuked Herod and was later imprisoned and beheaded (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-12">Mt 14:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-29">Mk 6:17-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.19-20">Lk 3:19-20</a>).</p>

  <title>Philippi</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PHILIPPI</p>
<p class="fl">Minor village of Thrace (known in antiquity as “The Springs”) until about 357 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, conquered the site and rebuilt it. He gave the village his name (“Philip’s City”), fortified it as a military stronghold in subduing the area, and exploited the nearby gold mines. Two hundred years later, in the Roman era, it became a chief city of one of the four Roman districts into which Macedonia was divided. But because it was about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) inland from the port of Neapolis, its growth was limited. Nearby Amphipolis (southwest) was the center of Roman government.</p>
<p>Philippi gained worldwide fame in 42 <span class="era">BC</span>, as the site where the imperial armies of Antony and Octavian defeated the republican generals Brutus and Cassius (the assassins of Julius Caesar). The victory opened the way for the emergence of the Roman Empire under the rule of Octavian (Augustus).</p>
<p>Veterans from the war of 42 <span class="era">BC</span> and other battles commonly settled in Philippi. When Paul came to the city, it still reflected its Latin military heritage. Situated on the Ignatian Way, it was one stop on that great military highway connecting the Adriatic with the Aegean. It possessed distinct civic pride inasmuch as it was a Roman colony (enjoying numerous privileges, such as tax exemptions), promoted Latin as its official language, and hosted numerous Roman citizens. Its government was modeled on the municipal constitution of Rome (its leader bearing Roman titles throughout), and the people lived as if they were indeed located in Italy. As Luke records in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.21">Acts 16:21</a>, the citizens viewed themselves as Romans.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientTheaterAtPhilippi"/>
<p>Paul visited the city on his second missionary tour and years later wrote one letter to the church. The account of Acts gives detailed attention to Paul’s visit. The narrative frequently refers to the city’s Roman heritage: not only does Paul successfully employ his Roman citizenship in his defense (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37">Acts 16:37</a>), but the city magistrates bear the dignified Latin title <span class="ital">praetor</span> (given in its Greek translation, <span class="greek">strategos</span>—vv <a href="?bref=Acts.16.20-22,38">20-22, 38</a>—and which English Bibles translate “magistrate”). There appears to have been a small Jewish community here. The church began with believing Jewish women who met outside the city because there was no synagogue. Later, they convened in the home of an important woman convert named Lydia (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.16.14-15,40">14-15, 40</a>).</p>
<p>Some have suggested that Luke may have had a special interest in Philippi. This is surmised not only by his careful attention to the city but also by the “we” sections of the book of Acts. The first “we” section (when Luke joins Paul) begins and ends at Philippi (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.10,40">Acts 16:10, 40</a>). This suggests that Luke stayed behind in the city after Paul’s departure. Then on the third tour Luke joins Paul again when the apostle passes through Philippi (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.6">20:6</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Philippians is like 2 Corinthians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon in that Paul shared its authorship with Timothy. The appearance of Timothy’s name at the start of these letters, however, probably does not mean that he had any greater part in their composition than perhaps to act as Paul’s secretary.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateandOrigin">Date and Origin</p>
<p class="fl">While it is clear that Paul was writing from prison (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.12-13">Phil 1:12-13</a>), it is not clear where he was imprisoned. The most likely possibility is Rome, in which case the date would be around <span class="era">AD</span> 62. But some have thought that all the journeys implied in <a href="?bref=Phil.4.14">4:14</a> and <a href="?bref=Phil.2.25-26">2:25-26</a> make such a distant place unlikely (the Philippians hear that Paul is in prison and send a gift by Epaphroditus; Epaphroditus hears in Rome that the Philippians have heard that he has been ill). So the alternatives of Ephesus (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 55) and Caesarea (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 58) have been proposed. We know that Paul was imprisoned in Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.33-35">Acts 23:33-35</a>), but the greeting “from those of Caesar’s household” is difficult to explain if it was written there, in spite of the coincidence of name. Ephesus is certainly near enough to Philippi for plenty of interchange, but no imprisonment is recorded in the account of Paul’s ministry there in Acts. So we would have to assume that Luke’s account in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-41">Acts 19</a> is not complete and that Paul had been placed in protective custody at the time of the riot (see esp. <a href="?bref=Acts.19.30-31">19:30-31</a>). But such an imprisonment could hardly have led Paul to wonder whether his time “to depart and be with Christ” had now come (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>). At the time of writing, he was clearly facing a capital charge.</p>
<p>The traditional location (Rome) seems the most satisfactory, especially when one reflects that Paul was imprisoned there for at least two years (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.30">Acts 28:30</a>), and that it took about three weeks to travel from Rome to Philippi.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Philippi had the distinction of being a Roman colony (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.12">Acts 16:12</a>), a privilege accorded to only a few cities outside Italy. Some 90 years before the gospel arrived there (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 50), the city had been greatly expanded by large numbers of Roman soldiers, who were settled there by their commanding officers. As a consequence, the town acquired its coveted status as a colony, which meant that for all intents and purposes its citizens were treated as if they lived in Italy, and the town had a fully Roman administration. Paul alludes to this status in <a href="?bref=Phil.3.20">Philippians 3:20</a>, where he teaches that Christians likewise are citizens of another city, the heavenly one, while yet residents elsewhere. It was a rich and busy place, one of the main centers of life in Macedonia, and consequently was “home” to the adherents of many different religions, from both east and west. There was a strong Jewish community there, as well as pagans of many sorts.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalThemes">Theological Themes</p>
<p class="fl">In a sense Paul’s imprisonment is not just background material but lies at the heart of the letter’s message. In his imprisonment he was experiencing the abasement that he mentions in <a href="?bref=Phil.4.12">4:12</a>, using there the same word found in <a href="?bref=Phil.2.8">2:8</a> to describe the self-humbling of Christ unto death. The pattern of the ministry of Jesus described in the great “hymn” of <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">2:6-11</a>—humiliation followed by glorification—becomes the pattern of Paul’s own life and of the vision he holds out before the Philippians. So alongside abasement and suffering, joy is the other great theme of the letter. Within suffering and self-sacrifice, true joy is born. In fact, Philippians could justly be titled “The Epistle of Joy.” Other prominent themes include the gospel, the Day of the Lord, and in addition to the famous “hymn” in chapter <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-30">2</a>, a comparison of Paul’s Jewish past with his present Christian experience (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.4-16">3:4-16</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientGreekManuscriptOfPhilippians"/>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Greeting and Opening Prayer (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.1-11">1:1-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the opening paragraph of his letter, Paul presents the themes that will be uppermost in his mind throughout. His personal warmth toward the Philippians is immediately striking: “I have you in my heart. . . . I long for all of you” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.7-8">1:7-8</a>), and this thought of outgoing and suffering love undergirds the whole letter. It is notable, too, that the letter begins and ends with the themes of “grace” and of “the saints” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.21-23">4:21-23</a>). The grace of Christ, which reaches out to sinful people and transforms them, separating them from the world, occupies Paul throughout. “The saints” are the ones who, touched by that grace, are transformed in heart and mind, so that their love abounds more and more in knowledge and depth of insight (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.9">1:9</a>).</p>
<p>Two more great themes appear here. The Greek word <span class="greek">phroneo</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to think,” is used more in Philippians than in any other letter of Paul, no fewer than nine times (as against seven in Romans). Unfortunately, it is not uniformly translated in the English versions, and so it is hard for the English reader to notice its repeated appearance and the emphasis on the right use of the mind that goes with it. But for Paul this is vital: the way we think is at the heart of the Christian life, and in these opening verses he makes it clear that the love he feels for the Philippians is actually the Christian way of thinking about them (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.7">7</a>: literally, “It is right for me to think this way about you”). This leads naturally to another emphasis—growth. For the “Christian mind” does not appear overnight. So Paul prays that this mind may grow, giving the Philippians powers of discernment that will transform their character and prepare them for “the day of Christ” (vv <a href="?bref=Phil.1.10-11">10-11</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, we note in this opening prayer the twin emphases on the gospel and on fellowship—linked in Paul’s prayer of thanksgiving for the Philippians’ partnership in the gospel (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.5">5</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.7">7</a>)—and also the introduction of the great theme of joy (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.4">4</a>). All three are vital to the whole letter.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul and His Imprisonment: Christ Exalted (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.12-26">1:12-26</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul writes about his own situation to present the heart of his message. For when he writes, “For me to live is Christ” (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.21">21</a>), he means more than that his every waking moment is taken up by fellowship with his Lord and service for him. He means also that, in his own person and experience, he displays Christ and “lives” him. Later he will say, “Keep putting into practice all you learned from me and heard from me and saw me doing” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.9">4:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Few Christian ministers would dare make such a claim today! Yet Paul believed that, as an apostle of Christ, it was his privilege not just to speak on Christ’s behalf but also to live out Christ’s life in his own person, even if that meant suffering and humiliation.</p>
<p>There are two historical difficulties here. First, it is hard to reconstruct the situation to which Paul refers in <a href="?bref=Phil.1.12-18">1:12-18</a>. The church in Rome (if that is where he is) was clearly divided about his imprisonment—some believers actually being glad that he was behind bars. It seems as though they were prompted by his imprisonment to get on with preaching their own version of the gospel. Far from being upset by this, Paul is delighted! “What does it matter?” he asks (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.18">18</a>). Whether by friend or foe, Christ is being proclaimed in a new way as a result of his imprisonment (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.14">14</a>). He was normally quick to defend the purity of the Word proclaimed, so these rivals of Paul could not have been heretics.</p>
<p>The other historical difficulty surrounds verses <a href="?bref=Phil.1.19-26">19-26</a>. At one moment Paul seems not to know what the outcome of imprisonment will be (vv <a href="?bref=Phil.1.19-21">19-21</a>). Yet he then suggests that he can choose whether to live or die (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.22">22</a>), and finally tells the Philippians that he is sure he will remain alive (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.25">25</a>). The best explanation is that Paul believed he had received a personal assurance from the Holy Spirit that his imprisonment would not end with his execution.</p>
<p>At any rate, his attitude about his own death is most moving. He expected deliverance, whether by life or by death (vv <a href="?bref=Phil.1.19-20">19-20</a>), and had an unshakeable confidence that to die is “better by far” (v <a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">23</a>), because it means being “with Christ.” This section ends with a note of joy.</p>
<p class="h3">The Life Worthy of the Gospel (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.27-2.18">1:27–2:18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section ends with “joy,” just as the last did, and its whole message is summed up in the opening exhortation of verse <a href="?bref=Phil.1.27">27</a>. Paul wanted the Philippians to be people in whom there is no gap between profession and practice, in whom the gospel believed is the gospel lived. The section falls into four portions, which might be entitled as follows: (1) <a href="?bref=Phil.1.27-30">1:27-30</a>—the worthy life in a hostile world; (2) <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>—the worthy life in Christian fellowship; (3) <a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-11">2:5-11</a>—the gospel that inspires us; (4) <a href="?bref=Phil.2.12-18">2:12-18</a>—priorities for lives worthy of the gospel.</p>
<p>Paul refused to let the Philippians feel that he was worse off than they. He wrote, “We are in this fight together. You have seen me suffer for him in the past, and you know that I am still in the midst of this great struggle” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.30">1:30</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). For suffering at the hands of a hostile world is part and parcel of Christian discipleship. If we profess to believe a gospel about one who, though equal with God, left aside the glory of heaven and submitted not just to incarnation but also to a horrible death (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-8">2:6-8</a>), then we must think of suffering not as an unfortunate necessity but as a privilege! “For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.29">1:29</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The essential quality the believers need, in order to face successfully the hostility of the world, is unity. They must be “standing side by side, fighting together for the Good News” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.27">1:27</a>), and believing one gospel will produce a united front against the world—and not a purely defensive front, either. The theme of unity continues into chapter <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-30">2</a>, where Paul turns to life within the fellowship (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>), as if to say that external unity before the world will not be possible unless their hearts and minds are truly united in one love, spirit, and purpose (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.2">2</a>), whatever their outward situation. Such a unity will come only if there is tenderness and compassion among them (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1">1</a>). The lovely progression in verse <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1">1</a> reaches a climax with this phrase, and that in turn leads into the famous “hymn” in <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">2:6-11</a>. Such tenderness will not find its home in their hearts unless they believe the gospel about which the hymn sings.</p>
<p>Whether <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">2:6-11</a> was in fact a real hymn, sung in the context of early Christian worship, is now impossible to know for sure. Certainly Paul’s language here takes on a hymnic quality, though it is not in poetic form. Many scholars have thought that Paul did not write these verses himself but was quoting a well-known piece of liturgy. All one can say for certain is that his language changes in style, and he expressed here ideas that are unique in his writings.</p>
<p>The hymn blends in with its context beautifully, and in fact forms the core of the whole letter. For we see here how the experience of imprisonment and deliverance, and of suffering and joy, is an entering into the experience of Jesus himself, who died and rose, was humbled and glorified.</p>
<p class="h3">Two Worthy Examples and Friends (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.19-30">2:19-30</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul again writes about his own situation and plans, but as before, this section is not just concerned with practical arrangements. On the face of it, he was simply explaining why he was sending the letter by the hand of Epaphroditus instead of Timothy. But actually he was holding them up as practical examples of the life lived by the gospel, about which he had just written. Timothy “genuinely cares about your welfare” (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.20">2:20</a>), because, unlike everyone else, he did not seek his own interests but those of Jesus Christ (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.21">21</a>). He lived the gospel! He was committed to the work of the gospel (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.22">22</a>). And Epaphroditus was the same, though in a different way. His union with Jesus was expressed not so much in his self-giving service for the gospel and his fellow saints, as in the illness that he suffered and the pains of separation that he endured. Like Jesus, he put his life on the line (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.30">30</a>), and like Jesus, he was restored to life again (v <a href="?bref=Phil.2.27">27</a>). Now he was to be restored to his beloved Philippians, and the joy that they would experience together would be a further outworking of the gospel.</p>
<p class="h3">Pressing Forward and Standing Firm (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.1-4.1">3:1–4:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section also begins and ends on the note of joy (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.1">3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.1">4:1</a>)—not accidentally. The way of the cross that Paul describes is also the way of joy (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.12.2">Heb 12:2</a>). It begins and ends also with the address “dear brothers and sisters,” and this, too, is not accidental, for once again in this passage Paul writes about himself, and once again the underlying thought is that his experience is typical and that his readers should expect and seek to see the same pattern in their lives. He wrote, “Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from those who follow our example” (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.17">3:17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Having put forward Timothy and Epaphroditus as examples in <a href="?bref=Phil.2.19-30">2:19-30</a>, Paul now does the same with himself.</p>
<p>The tone seems to change dramatically in <a href="?bref=Phil.3.2">3:2</a>, as Paul turns to warn the Philippians against “those dogs,” who are probably the same as those to whom he refers in <a href="?bref=Phil.1.28">1:28</a> as “your enemies.” There, he was much concerned about the inner foundation of the Philippians’ stand against them, so he did not specify who they were. But now he examines them more closely, in order to show the Philippians that the Christian life entails a complete reversal of the values held by their opponents.</p>
<p>It seems that they were Jews, the sort in <a href="?bref=Acts.17.5">Acts 17:5</a> who opposed Paul’s ministry in nearby Thessalonica. They believed that they were God’s chosen race, but Paul thought that was nothing more than placing confidence in the flesh (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.4">Phil 3:4</a>). They thought they knew the way of righteousness—it is the way of rigorous and disciplined obedience to God’s law in every detail of life. But Paul thought that was to seek a righteousness of one’s own (v <a href="?bref=Phil.3.9">9</a>), having nothing to do with the righteousness that God wants to give. The true way to be God’s people, he movingly insists, is the way of self-renunciation, so that all he previously held dear as a Jew came to be seen as rubbish (v <a href="?bref=Phil.3.8">8</a>), considered as loss for the sake of Christ (v <a href="?bref=Phil.3.7">7</a>). The only way to attain righteousness is through faith in Christ (v <a href="?bref=Phil.3.9">9</a>), for Christians must become like him in his death if they are to know the power of his resurrection (v <a href="?bref=Phil.3.10">10</a>). For Paul, dying with Christ meant not just suffering imprisonment and many other indignities for Christ’s sake but also renouncing all the prized possessions that his Judaism had given him.</p>
<p class="h3">Thinking, Rejoicing, Sharing (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.2-23">4:2-23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Again, the tone changes suddenly (both at <a href="?bref=Phil.4.2">4:2</a> and at <a href="?bref=Phil.4.10">4:10</a>)—so much so that some scholars have suggested that Philippians was compiled by an editor using several different letters. But when Paul turns (in v <a href="?bref=Phil.4.2">2</a>) to address Euodia and Syntyche, he was not really changing the subject. The link with the last section is the same as that between <a href="?bref=Phil.1.27-30">1:27-30</a> and the first paragraph in chapter <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-30">2</a>: how can Christians expect to be able to hold their own in the face of some enemies of the cross of Christ (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.18">3:18</a>) if they are disunited and at odds with each other? For if there is just one gospel, disharmony between Christians means that the gospel is not having its full effect. So Euodia and Syntyche are urged (literally) to “think the same thing in the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.2">4:2</a>), and are then reminded of how they once found a wonderful unity in striving side by side in the cause of the gospel (v <a href="?bref=Phil.4.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>The agreement that Paul urges them to come to does not mean complete identity of opinions on all subjects. It means a oneness of heart in a common love for Christ and the gospel. In the rest of the letter Paul spells out what this oneness means in practice—both what it should mean and what it has meant for the Philippians. The use of the mind is vital, and in verses <a href="?bref=Phil.4.4-9">4-9</a> Paul paints a picture of the Christian life in which careful and intelligent prayer (vv <a href="?bref=Phil.4.6-7">6-7</a>) and the deliberate directing of the mind toward “whatever is true and honorable” (v <a href="?bref=Phil.4.8">8</a>) will produce a life marked by the two qualities of peace and joy, whatever the circumstances.</p>
<p>That leads to the final paragraph, in which Paul gives thanks that, in spite of the disharmony evident in one part of the Philippian church, the church as a whole has already displayed this true Christian “mind.” For they have shown their oneness with Paul in the cause of the gospel by sending him a gift by Epaphroditus. “You have done well to share with me in my present difficulty,” Paul writes (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.14">4:14</a>), and our thoughts go back again to the hymn in <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">2:6-11</a>. From the gospel about the one who came from heaven to bear our burdens comes this mutual sharing—and so does Paul’s wonderful attitude to his circumstances: “I know how to be humbled [the same word as in <a href="?bref=Phil.2.8">2:8</a>], and I know how to abound” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.12">4:12</a>). Joined to Christ, we do not anxiously seek provision for our needs (v <a href="?bref=Phil.4.17">17</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Phil.4.6">6</a>), but share with him and with others whatever humiliation and exaltation he sends, confident that God will meet all our needs “from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.19">4:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">PHILISTIA, PHILISTINES</p>
<p class="fl">Small country situated in southwestern Palestine, along the Mediterranean coast (also called “Palestina” in <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <a href="?bref=Exod.15.14">Ex 15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.29-31">Is 14:29-31</a>); Aegean people who settled on the maritime plain of Canaan.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Territory">Territory</p>
<p class="fl">Strictly speaking, Philistia is that part of the maritime plain that is called the plain of Philistia, extending from the Wadi el-Arish (River of Egypt) in the south some 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) north to the Nahr el-Aujah, five miles (8 kilometers) north of Joppa. Near Gaza the plain reaches its greatest width, about 30 miles (48.3 kilometers). There are sand dunes near the shore, but most of the area is very fertile and produces an abundance of grain (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.15.1-5">Jgs 15:1-5</a>) and fruit.</p>
<p>The main highway between the East and Egypt lay along the coast. This was of commercial advantage for the Philistines, but it left them open to foreign invasion. God did not lead Israel from Egypt to Canaan by this shortest route through the land of the Philistines, because he did not want them to encounter fierce fighting from the Philistines (or perhaps from an Egyptian garrison stationed there) so soon (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.17">Ex 13:17</a>). Apparently, the Philistines had little to fear from the Egyptians, for some scholars think that the Egyptians had a hand in locating the Philistines in Palestine.</p>
<p>From this constricted area the Philistines soon felt a necessity to expand. The passes through the Shephelah provided natural access to the hill country of Israel. They established outposts in Israelite territory, and at the time of the battle in which Saul and his sons were killed, the Philistines exercised control over the city of Beth-shan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.10">1 Sm 31:10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePeople">The People</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible states that the Philistines came from Caphtor (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.23">Dt 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.47.4">Jer 47:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Am 9:7</a>), which is generally regarded as Crete, although some scholars place it in Asia Minor. The attire of the Philistines, as shown at Medinet Habu, is like that of Cretans, especially the headdress. The name of the Cherethites has been equated with Cretans, for the names have the same consonantal base: <span class="ital">c, r,</span> and <span class="ital">t.</span> The Cherethites were apparently a Philistine subgroup who lived in the Negev not far from Ziklag, David’s home among the Philistines (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.14">1 Sm 30:14</a>). The Cherethites and the Pelethites were among David’s bodyguards, along with 600 Gittites (men from Gath) (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.19">2 Sm 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.7,23">20:7, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.17">1 Chr 18:17</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="JonathanDefeatedtheGarrisonatGibeah"/>
<p>The name Philistines is recognizable in several languages. In Hebrew they are known as the <span class="hebrew">Pelishtim</span><span class="ital">,</span> which has been translated into English as Philistines. In the Egyptian sources they are listed among the Sea Peoples and are called the <span class="ital">Peleset</span> or <span class="ital">Peleste.</span> They are best known for their part in the invasion of Egypt by the Sea Peoples, who were vanquished by Ramses III in a land and sea battle in the Delta. Detailed scenes of this fighting are shown in deep-sunk relief on the north exterior wall of the temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu, opposite Luxor. These depictions give some idea of the attire and armament of the Philistines, who are easily identified by their headdress, which was made of feathers (or reeds?).</p>
<p>These people settled along the coast of Palestine after their defeat by Ramses, but it is possible that some stayed in Canaan on their way to Egypt. Possibly an earlier migration to Palestine occurred, perhaps before the time of the patriarchs.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Government">Government</p>
<p class="fl">Philistia had no single ruler over their entire land; the cities were independent, so they operated as city-states. The heads of these cities were not called kings but were spoken of in the Bible as “lords” or “rulers” (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.11">1 Sm 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.12">6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.29.2">29:2</a>), and there were five of them, corresponding to the five major cities that comprised the Philistine Pentapolis: Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.17">1 Sm 6:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.25.20">Jer 25:20</a>). The people had a voice in matters that related to them—for example, the return of the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.6-12">1 Sm 5:6-12</a>)—but the great decisions were made by majority vote of the five lords. While David and his men were living at Ziklag, for example, the Philistines planned a big military campaign against Israel. David was subject to Achish, king of Gath, who asked David to join forces with the Philistines against Israel. David agreed to this, but when the Philistine lords found that David was present, they complained and voted him out (ch <a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1-11">29</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ReligionandRitualObjects">Religion and Ritual Objects</p>
<p class="fl">Whatever gods the Philistines brought with them seem to have been abandoned relatively early in favor of Canaanite deities. A primary Philistine god mentioned in the Bible is Dagon, a grain god. Temples to Dagon have been found at Ras Shamra (Ugarit) and Mari. The Bible refers to a temple of Dagon at Gaza (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.23-30">Jgs 16:23-30</a>) and another at Ashdod (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-5">1 Sm 5:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePhilistinesandIsrael">The Philistines and Israel</p>
<p class="fl">The various forms of “Philistine” and “Philistia” appear almost 300 times in the OT, mostly in the books of Judges and Samuel. The earliest occurrence is in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.14">Genesis 10:14</a>, where it is said that the Philistines came from the Casluhim, an unidentified people related to the Caphtorim (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.12">1 Chr 1:12</a>).</p>
<p>Both Abraham and Isaac had contacts with the Philistines at Gerar, in parallel incidents involving their wives (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">Gn 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.1-35">26</a>). Here, however, the Philistines are not on the coast but at Gerar and as far east as Beersheba (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.33">26:33</a>). In both references the king of Gerar is called Abimelech—a good Semitic name. It has been suggested that the Philistines of that time had earlier migrated from Crete, but this has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p>After the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the Philistines began to exercise superiority over the Israelites. An aggressive and militant people, the Philistines had the advantage of superior weapons, for they used iron and exercised a monopoly on iron making in the area. Their control over Israel allowed them to prohibit blacksmithing in Israel, forcing the Israelites to go to the Philistines even for sharpening tools (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-22">1 Sm 13:19-22</a>). The Israelites were so poorly armed that only Saul and Jonathan had a sword or a spear (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.22">22</a>). Facilities for smelting iron have been found at Ashdod, Tell Qasile, Tell Jemmeh, and Tel Mor.</p>
<p>The Medinet Habu reliefs show the Philistines armed with spears and long, straight swords, with large, round shields for protection. They had three-man chariots with six spoked wheels, and they transported people by means of solid two-wheel carts pulled by four oxen. Their ships were rigged with a square sail, like those of the Egyptians, and had a duck-shaped prow, which possibly was used for ramming enemy vessels.</p>
<p>Apostasy came early in Israel, and the Lord used the Philistines to chasten his people. Shamgar delivered Israel by killing 600 Philistines with an ox goad (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.31">Jgs 3:31</a>). The account of Samson has many touches of Philistine life (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.1-16.31">13:1–16:31</a>). This record demonstrates that there was intermarriage between Israelites and Philistines, contrary to the OT law.</p>
<p>Warfare between Israel and the Philistines is reported in <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1">1 Samuel 4:1</a>, when the Israelites were camped at Ebenezer and the Philistines at Aphek. The Philistines won that round and captured the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.17">1 Sm 4:17</a>), which they returned after seven months because the Lord sent plagues upon them (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-6.21">5:1–6:21</a>). Later, when Samuel had become leader, the Philistines attacked Israel at Mizpah, but God gave the victory to Israel. On this occasion Samuel set up a memorial stone and named it Ebenezer (“Stone of Help,” <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.12">7:12</a>). The Philistines did not invade Israel again during the lifetime of Samuel, and Israel recovered cities that had been taken by the Philistines (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.14">14</a>).</p>
<p>The greatest activity of the Philistines in Israelite territory came during the reign of Saul, Israel’s first king. More than 80 references to the Philistines are related to that period. The Philistines established outposts or garrisons in various parts of Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.3">13:3</a>). Jonathan defeated the garrison at Geba (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.3">13:3</a>); his exploit related in <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.1-15">1 Samuel 14:1-15</a> led to a rout of the Philistines.</p>
<p>A confrontation of the Philistine and Israelite armies took place in the valley of Elah, where the Philistines challenged Israel to provide an opponent to meet their champion, Goliath, in single combat (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-11">1 Sm 17:1-11</a>). The young shepherd David killed Goliath; David became a hero, but Saul’s jealousy made David a hunted man. In the course of dodging Saul’s army, David’s men rescued the town of Keilah from the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-5">23:1-5</a>). Eventually David sought political asylum with Achish, king of Gath, who gave him the town of Ziklag, from which David made raids in the Negev (ch <a href="?bref=1Sam.27.1-12">27</a>).</p>
<p>When the Philistines were preparing for war against Israel, Achish asked David to join the Philistine forces, and David agreed. The lords of the Philistines voted down this participation, for they feared that David would turn against them (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.1-2">1 Sm 28:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1-11">29</a>). In the ensuing battle Saul and his sons were killed on Mt Gilboa by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-7">31:1-7</a>). The Philistines cut off Saul’s head, placed his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth in Beth-shan, and hung his body on the wall of that city (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.8-11">8-11</a>).</p>
<p>When the Philistines learned that David had become king, they made an effort to destroy him, but he defeated them “from Geba to Gezer” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.17-25">2 Sm 5:17-25</a>). David broke the Philistine power, and although they again attempted war against Israel, they met with no success (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.15-21">21:15-21</a>).</p>
<p>Uzziah warred against the Philistines; he broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod and built cities in Philistia (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.6-7">2 Chr 26:6-7</a>). In the reign of Ahaz, the Philistines invaded the Shephelah and the Negev and captured a number of cities (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.18">28:18</a>). Hezekiah fought against the Philistines as far as Gaza (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.8">2 Kgs 18:8</a>).</p>
<p>References to the Philistines in the Prophets are relatively few, although Jeremiah devotes a short chapter to the Philistines (<a href="?bref=Jer.47.1-7">Jer 47</a>). The Philistines were gradually assimilated into Canaanite culture and they disappeared from the pages of the Bible and from secular history, leaving the name Palestine as a monument to their presence.</p>

  <title>Philo*, Judaeus</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PHILO*, J<span class="lc">udaeus</span></p>
<p class="fl">Hellenistic Jewish philosopher (c. 25 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 40) whose thought presents the first major confrontation of biblical faith with Greek thought.</p>
<p>Son of a prominent Alexandrian family, Philo was educated both in the Jewish faith and in Greek philosophy and culture. Of the events of his life we know little, except that in <span class="era">AD</span> 40 he headed a delegation from the Jewish community in Alexandria to the emperor Caligula in Rome. Ethnic tension in Alexandria had grown as the Jewish populace increased and prospered. The tension erupted in <span class="era">AD</span> 42 into riots by the Greeks and the expulsion of Jews from the Gentile sections into which they had spread. Jewish commercial success, particularly in the wheat trade, led to intensified anti-Semitism. Out of the riots came two apologetic treatises by Philo Judaeus, <span class="ital">Against Flaccus</span> (Flaccus was governing in Alexandria) and <span class="ital">Embassy to Caligula</span> (Caligula was emperor in Rome).</p>
<p>The Jewish community in Alexandria was thoroughly Hellenized. Even the Scriptures were read in the Greek translation called the Septuagint. In spite of the fact that these Jews were living and participating in Greek culture, they remained orthodox. Philo was no exception. On the one hand, he carefully observed the Mosaic law and held that it is the infallibly revealed will of God, both for God’s chosen people—the Jews—and for the Gentiles. On the other hand, Philo was very Greek. He probably knew Hebrew only imperfectly and received a liberal education under Greek tutors. His Bible was the OT, especially the Pentateuch, which he held to be most authoritative, but he read it in Greek translation. Because he held that the Septuagint was divinely inspired, Philo had no need to refer to the original Hebrew text.</p>
<p>To understand Philo’s work, one must recognize that the need to come to terms with Greek culture stemmed not merely from practical necessity but also from the fact that Judaism is a missionary religion. Jews could not simply turn their backs on the Greek world, for the prophets had called Israel to be a light to the Gentiles. From his studies Philo was also convinced that there is much that is true in Greek philosophy. Consequently, he was anxious to find some way of correlating and harmonizing biblically revealed truth with the teachings of the philosophers. As a Jewish believer considering the claims of Greek philosophy, Philo was confronted with problems very similar to those posed for a Christian by scientific theories of evolution in our day.</p>
<p>The method that Philo used to harmonize Scripture with the teachings of the philosophers was allegorical interpretation. This method of interpretation had been practiced by many before Philo, and many others followed his example. Through the use of this method, Genesis could be read as a contemporary myth about the human condition and man’s search for salvation, rather than as an ancient and somewhat crude legend (as the Greeks would see it). The proper reading of the text gives not ancient history and geography but philosophical and moral truth. According to Philo, Moses—both because he was divinely instructed and because he had attained the summit of philosophy—did not resort to mythical fictions, as poets and sophists do; he was able to make ideas visible. By using allegorical interpretation, Philo found in the historical narrative and ceremonial law an inward, spiritual meaning that incorporates the truth he found in Greek thought.</p>
<p>In dealing with the conception of God, Philo approached Greek views critically and rejected what was opposed to Scripture. However, in dealing with the structure and composition of the world, Scripture is quite vague, and so Philo felt free to adopt whatever seemed most reasonable in the writings of the philosophers. He believed that God is the source of both the Mosaic law and the truths of Greek philosophy. The human mind is made in the image of the divine Logos, and so it has some capacity to receive and discover truths about realities beyond the sensible.</p>
<p>Among the philosophers, Philo found Plato’s view closest to the truth. God existed from eternity without a world, and after he made the world, he continued to exist above and beyond it. God is the active cause, and this world is passive, incapable of life and motion by itself, but a most perfect masterpiece when set in motion, shaped, and quickened by God. Moreover, God does not neglect his creation but cares for it and preserves it. This care is called providence. While the Greeks had spoken of a universal providence that preserves natural processes, for Philo providence acquired a new meaning. It is God’s care for individual beings, so that it includes the power to suspend the laws of nature.</p>
<p>God is one but is the source of all multiplicity. He is immutable and self-sufficient and hence does not need the world. Creation has its source in his goodness. Although Moses said that the world was created in six days, God must be thought of as doing all things simultaneously. The account of six days serves to show that there is order in things. The visible world was created out of nonbeing, from nothing. All the available matter was used in creation, so the world is unique. The world was created by God’s will, and it may be imperishable. Philo thought that Plato followed Moses in thinking that the world was created by God.</p>
<p>Concerning the doctrine of the Logos, Philo is both dependent upon and yet critical of the Greek philosophers. Plato had affirmed that there are eternal ideas to which the Craftsman or Maker looked when forming the world. Philo could not accept this position, because God alone is eternal. He harmonized the two views by affirming that from eternity the ideas existed as thoughts of God, but they became a fully formed intelligible world only when God willed to create the visible world. The universe of the ideas, which has no location other than the divine reason, is the pattern according to which the sensible world was made.</p>
<p>To Philo, the Logos is much more than just the instrument by which the visible world was made. It is also described as “the idea of ideas,” the first-begotten Son of the uncreated Father and “second God,” the archetype of human reason. The Logos is the vital power that holds together the entire hierarchy of created beings. As God’s viceroy, he mediates revelation to the created order. He stands on the frontier between Creator and creature. He is the high priest who intercedes with God on behalf of mortals. He appeared in the burning bush and dwelt in Moses. Some think that the Logos is God, but he is really God’s image. While one can be quite certain that the Logos was not a person for Philo, the exact status of this power in relation to God is by no means clear.</p>
<p>Various aspects of this teaching have been taken up by Christian writers, most notably John, who taught that the Logos (the Word) is the instrument by means of which God created the world (see <a href="?bref=John.1.1-4">Jn 1:1-4</a>). About the origins of this view much less is known. It appears that the notion of the Logos was current in Hellenistic Judaism. Its function in Philo’s thought seems to indicate that it was philosophical considerations, rather than biblical ones, that were most significant in his teaching.</p>
<p>Philo had other views about the creation. He believed that while the heavenly bodies are living creatures endowed with mind and not susceptible to evil, man is of a mixed nature, liable to failure. He can be both wise and foolish, just and unjust. God made all good things by himself, but man, because he is liable to both good and evil, must have been made by lesser deities. This is why we are told by Moses that God said, “Let <span class="ital">us</span> make man” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26">Gn 1:26</a>, emphasis added). In the case of man, then, being created involved a Fall. Here also there are two steps in Creation. First, there is man created after the divine image, and this is an idea or type, an object of thought only, incorporeal, neither male nor female, and by nature incorruptible (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26">Gn 1:26</a>). Later it says that “God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>). This man became an object of sense perception, consisting of body and soul, man or woman, by nature mortal. Woman became for man the beginning of blameworthy life. When man and woman saw each other, desire was aroused, and this desire produced bodily pleasure. This pleasure is the beginning of wrongs and violation of law. The Garden of Eden is also meant to be taken symbolically rather than literally. There never have been trees of life or of understanding, nor is it likely that any will ever appear on earth. The tree of life signifies reverence toward God; the tree of knowledge of good and evil signifies moral prudence.</p>
<p>One sees in Philo, then, a tendency to dualism in which spirit is good and matter evil, a tendency derived from Platonism and read into the OT. This led Philo to agree with the Stoics that the only good is the good of the soul. God gives us the world to use, not to possess. To rise to the eternal world of the mind, a man must suppress all responses to the sensible world. In general, Philo tended toward a world-denying asceticism.</p>
<p>The only temple worthy of God is a pure soul. True religion consists in inner devotion rather than externals. In this life the soul is a pilgrim, like Abraham or like the Israelites wandering in the desert. Through spiritual self-discipline, the soul comes to realize that the body is a major obstacle to perfection. The goal of this spirituality is to draw near to God, who has drawn the mind to himself. God is knowable by the mind, but he is unknowable in himself. We can know only that he is, not what he is. For Philo, the soul in its search for perfection ultimately comes to discover that it must cease to rely on itself and must acknowledge that virtue is a gift of God. The man who has discovered his own limitations comes to know God and his own dependence upon God.</p>
<p>Although Josephus borrowed some from Philo, Philo’s greatest influence was on Christian writers. Hellenistic Judaism became less significant as the Judaism of the rabbis became the norm during the next two centuries. By contrast, second- and third-century Christians had much in common with Philo. Parts of his work were translated into Latin and Armenian. Clement and Origen, among the Greek fathers, and Ambrose, among the Latin fathers, were especially indebted to him.</p>

  <title>Philosophy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p class="fl">Logically disciplined, self-critical inquiry into the basic questions of life. “Philosophy” itself means “love of wisdom.” This “love” treasures pursuing, discovering, analyzing, and justifying wisdom. Although the word “philosophy” appears only once in the Bible, both Judaism and Christianity were considered philosophies in the Hellenistic world. In fact, from their very earliest encounters with Jewish scholars in Alexandria in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, Greek philosophers referred to the Jews as a philosophical race. Biblical religion is philosophical because, unlike Greek religion, it makes holistic claims about the nature of reality and it sets out concrete values that can guide community life and individual decisions.</p>
<p>In the only explicit use of the word “philosophy” in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Col.2.8-10">Col 2:8-10</a>), a point of contrast is made between pagan and Christian philosophy. Paul wanted the Colossians to develop philosophy according to Christ, not according to empty deceit, human tradition, or “the elemental spirits of the universe.” In contrast to empty philosophy based on pagan deceit and human tradition, Christ is himself the fullness of deity dwelling bodily—a sound foundation for wisdom and philosophy. In contrast to the mere “elemental spirits,” Christ himself is the “head of all rule and authority,” the greatest source of truth and justice. The discipline of philosophy is not condemned, for the alternative to deceit and human tradition is “philosophy . . . according to Christ.”</p>
<p>As a discipline, philosophy developed in Greece only after the OT was complete, so it could not have been mentioned in the OT. Nevertheless, the biblical Wisdom Literature serves a function quite similar to some philosophical writings. It provides either proverbial instruction for wholesome living (especially Proverbs) or inquiry into the puzzles of human existence (especially Job and Ecclesiastes).</p>
<p>Some characteristics of biblical revelation are shared with the pagan philosophy of its time. For example, the idea of “conversion” was an assumed pattern in the Hellenistic world of the NT, because to change one’s philosophy meant to adopt a new form of life. Moreover, the literary form of an epistle was developed by philosophers prior to the NT. Plato and Isocrates started the practice of using letters to defend doctrines or ways of life.</p>
<p>Also, a concern for practical life was central to philosophy at the time of the NT; to learn a philosophy came to mean to acquire the art of living well. Furthermore, to be a philosopher meant to be someone who is interested in the question of God, however one understood that question. The NT world was ripe for guidance in right living and in knowing God.</p>
<p>Two specific philosophies are mentioned in the NT: Epicureanism and Stoicism (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.18">Acts 17:18</a>). Epicureans followed the teachings of Epicurus (342?–270 <span class="era">BC</span>), an Athenian philosopher who had taught practical ways of achieving a pleasant life through moderate behavior and stable human relationships. He believed that human beings are merely material objects produced by chance combinations of atoms—small, indestructible material pieces.</p>
<p>Stoics also emphasized moderate living, but they believed that there is an ultimate purpose in the world. This purposefulness is established by an all-pervading substance called Logos, or reason. However, like Epicureans, Stoics were materialists, believing all things to be made of matter, including humans, the divine, and the Logos (which they sometimes treated as God).</p>
<p>In Athens, Paul may have also encountered the “academic skeptics.” These philosophers emphasized the fallibility and finitude of human understanding to the point of withholding judgment whenever possible. However, they knew they had to make daily personal decisions, and they remained very curious about other people’s ideas. In fact, all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there at the time of Paul’s visit seemed to sustain a high level of curiosity about new ideas (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.21">Acts 17:21</a>), providing a mentally lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was only appropriate for Paul to present the gospel to these curious minds, and he was convincing enough to win some converts. He established a common ground by agreeing with ideas from two Greek philosophers: Epimenides (sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>), “In him we live and move and have our being”; and Cleanthes the Stoic (third century <span class="era">BC</span>), “We are his offspring.” Nevertheless, Paul inevitably offended most of his philosophic listeners by defending the uniqueness of a particular man, Jesus Christ, and by claiming that he had been resurrected from the dead—a claim that contradicted these philosophers’ materialist resignation to the finality of death. Clearly, Christianity entailed a dramatically different “philosophy.”</p>

<p class="list">1. Eleazer’s son, grandson of Aaron (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.25">Ex 6:25</a>), and Abishua’s father (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.4,50">1 Chr 6:4, 50</a>). During the high priesthood of Eleazer, Phinehas had charge over the gatekeepers of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.20">9:20</a>), as did Eleazer his father, when Aaron served as chief priest (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.3.32">Nm 3:32</a>). Phinehas, grieved by Israel’s sin with Baal of Peor at Shittim, killed an Israelite man and a Midianite woman for their licentious behavior (<a href="?bref=Num.25.7">25:7</a>). Following this act, the Lord turned away his anger toward Israel and made a covenant of peace with Phinehas, which was a covenant of a perpetual priesthood for him and his descendants (vv <a href="?bref=Num.25.11-13">11-13</a>); his deed was reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.30">Ps 106:30</a>). Except for the brief interval when Eli acted as high priest (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-3.21">1 Sm 1–3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.3">14:3</a>), Phinehas and his posterity officiated at the high priestly position until the destruction of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p class="list-text">Following the Baal of Peor incident, Phinehas joined Israel in defeating the Midianites in war (<a href="?bref=Num.31.6">Nm 31:6</a>). After Israel took possession of the land of Canaan, Phinehas was given the town of Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.33">Jos 24:33</a>). He was sent with a small delegation of Israelite leaders to question the building of an altar on the west bank of the Jordan River by the tribes of Israel living east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.13,30-32">Jos 22:13, 30-32</a>). Later, at Bethel, Phinehas promised Israel victory over Benjamin’s tribe in battle (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.28">Jgs 20:28</a>). His descendants Ezra the scribe (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.5">Ezr 7:5</a>) and Gershom (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.2">8:2</a>) returned with their families to Jerusalem following the exile.</p>
<p class="list">2. One of Eli’s two sons, who served as a priest at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3">1 Sm 1:3</a>). According to 1 Samuel, Phinehas was a despicable priest, who, along with Hophni his brother, profaned the offered sacrifices (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12-17">2:12-17</a>) and the sanctuary (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.22">22</a>), and scorned Eli (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.25">25</a>). His death was foretold to his father by a man of God (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.34">34</a>). In a subsequent war with the Philistines, Phinehas was killed on the same day his wife bore him a son, named Ichabod (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.11,17-19">4:11, 17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.3">14:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PHOENICIA, PHOENICIANs</p>
<p class="fl">Group of city-states (and their residents) that occupied a strip of the Syrian coastal plain at the foot of the Lebanon Mountains. “Phoenicia” was also spelled “Phenice” or “Phenicia.” At one time these states extended from Carmel in the south to Arvad in the north, a distance of less than 200 miles (321.8 kilometers). Nowhere is the Phoenician plain more than four miles (6.4 kilometers) wide. In these fertile plains rose independent city-states, so Phoenicia was neither a political nor a geographical unity.</p>
<p>Bereft of good natural ports, the Phoenicians were forced to build their own. Fortunately, they had abundant supplies of magnificent cedar on the western slopes of the Lebanon Mountains, which they dominated. Thus they had good ship timber and an important source of revenue in a wood-starved region of the world. Offshore grew some of the finest dye-producing creatures (sea snails) of the Mediterranean, making possible quality textiles and dyestuffs. These two sources of income were supplemented by superior industrial production in metal and glassware and the transport of the goods of other peoples in Phoenician ships. With the passage of time, Phoenician colonies grew up along their trade routes. Prominent among them was Carthage.</p>

<p class="fl">Though peoples of Mediterranean stock occupied Lebanon by about 4000 <span class="era">BC</span>, there was no significant political or cultural development in the area until after 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the Canaanites arrived. Canaanite (Hamitic) culture and ethnic stock were diluted by an Amorite (Semitic) invasion of Phoenicia, Syria, and Palestine about 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Subsequently, Semites became dominant in the area.</p>
<p>Long before the Semites arrived, Egyptians established commercial contacts with Phoenicia. During the Old Kingdom (c. 2700–2200 <span class="era">BC</span>), Egyptians seem virtually to have controlled Byblos, about 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) north of Beirut. It was the main port through which Phoenician timber moved to Egypt and Egyptian papyrus and influences entered Phoenicia.</p>
<p>Though Egyptian influence slipped during Egypt’s first intermediate period (2200–2050 <span class="era">BC</span>), it was fully restored during the Middle Kingdom. In fact, some scholars like to speak of much of Phoenicia falling within an Egyptian Middle Empire at this time (2050–1800 <span class="era">BC</span>), but others think that Egypt’s control was only economic. Subsequently, the Hyksos dominated the whole eastern end of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>During the Egyptian empire period (c. 1580–1100 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Egyptians at first effectively controlled the cities of Phoenicia, even stationing garrisons in them. But during the latter part of the period, Egyptians and Hittites fought for the mastery of Phoenicia. By 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, both the Egyptian and the Hittite empires had come to an end and Phoenicia entered a period of independence.</p>
<p>During the next two centuries, Tyre built up her power and established a hegemony over the other Phoenician cities. Of special significance in this rise to power were the efforts of Hiram I. At the same time, the Hebrew united monarchy was building, and the two powers reached out to each other in ventures of mutual advantage.</p>
<p>Conditions changed in the ninth century. In 868 <span class="era">BC</span> Ashurnasirpal of Assyria forced the Phoenician states to pay tribute, and their freedom was lost again. But under the Assyrians, the Phoenicians prospered and planted numerous colonies in the west. By the end of the eighth century, Isaiah could wax eloquent about the prosperity of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.3-8">Is 23:3-8</a>).</p>
<p>But as time wore on, the Phoenicians grew restless under increasing Assyrian restriction of liberties. About 678 <span class="era">BC</span> Sidon led a revolt against Esar-haddon of Assyria, which turned out to be a total failure. The furious Assyrians killed or captured most of the inhabitants and leveled the city of Sidon, thus intimidating all the Phoenicians. But Assyrian power subsequently diminished, and Tyre became independent about 625 <span class="era">BC</span>. Her greatness largely remained, and Ezekiel penned a remarkable description of her attainments (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.1-36">Ez 27</a>).</p>
<p>After Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, he turned his attention to Phoenicia, easily conquering the rebuilt Sidon but requiring 13 years to subjugate Tyre. At that time he took only the mainland city of Tyre, however. The island city was safe because Nebuchadnezzar had no fleet. The greatness of Tyre was gone; the mainland city was never rebuilt.</p>
<p>When Cyrus the Great conquered the Babylonian Empire in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Phoenicians were absorbed peacefully. But about two centuries later, they participated in a rebellion against the Persians. When the Persian army stood before Sidon in 352 <span class="era">BC</span> and the inhabitants faced the destruction of their homes and the prospect of being sold into slavery, they set fire to their homes and perished with them. It is said that 40,000 died in the flames. The other Phoenician cities had no heart to continue the rebellion.</p>
<p>When Alexander the Great came through Phoenicia in 332 <span class="era">BC</span>, most of the cities welcomed release from Persian rule and opened their gates to him. Tyre did not, however, and was totally destroyed after a seven-month siege. When the city was rebuilt, it was populated with immigrants from Asia Minor and had little ethnic connection with the earlier period. Phoenician maritime supremacy was forever broken.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Phoenicia came under the control of the Ptolemies (286 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Seleucids (198 <span class="era">BC</span>), and the Romans (64 <span class="era">BC</span>). During the Roman period, Phoenicia was part of the province of Syria and enjoyed new prosperity during the Pax Romana (the Roman peace) of the first two centuries of the Christian era. By that time, it was largely Hellenized and its former Semitic character was gone.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CulturalandHistoricalSignificance">Cultural and Historical Significance</p>
<p class="fl">As the finest mariners of the ancient world, the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean during the first half of the first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, as well as the Aegean Sea for much of that time. As intrepid seafarers, they not only shipped products but also transmitted ideas and processes and engaged in much cultural cross-fertilization.</p>
<p>Though there is no evidence that the Phoenicians invented the alphabet, they disseminated it so widely that it became known as the Phoenician alphabet. Especially important was their transmission of it to the Greeks (at least by 750 <span class="era">BC</span>), who then added vowels and passed it on to the Western world.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians also planted colonies in numerous places in the western Mediterranean, notably during the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Most powerful of these colonies was Carthage, which at its height controlled the western part of north Africa, much of Spain, and numerous Mediterranean islands, and which almost brought Rome to her knees during the third century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Phoenicians developed advanced techniques in metalworking; some scholars think the Egyptians and possibly even Aegean peoples derived some of their processes from the Phoenicians. Though they may not have invented glass-making, as many ancient authors claim, they certainly contributed much to its development and the spread of its knowledge in the ancient world. The Phoenicians exported quantities of purple dye or dyed cloth and their famous cedars. Cedars of Lebanon found their way not only to Palestine but also to Egypt, Mesopotamia, and faraway Iran.</p>
<p>Of all Phoenician exports, the one most severely censured in Scripture was Baal worship, which found its way into the kingdom of Israel through the marriage of Jezebel to Ahab, and into the kingdom of Judah through the marriage of their daughter Athaliah to Jehoram.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Religion">Religion</p>
<p class="fl">Less is known about Phoenician religion than that of most other peoples of antiquity. This is primarily because the Phoenicians’ own literature has not been preserved. One cannot be sure that information from ancient Ugarit in nearby Syria correctly reflects religious practices and beliefs of the Phoenician cities. Nor should it be assumed that the religion of Phoenicia’s colonies was transported without modification from the mother country. Unfortunately, what the OT says about Canaanite religion does not differentiate the beliefs or practices of individual Phoenician cities. The following information has been gleaned almost exclusively from Phoenician sources.</p>
<p>Several general names appeared in Phoenician religion. El was both the Semitic word for god and the name of a specific god who was head of the pantheon. Baal simply means “lord,” but it also applies to the son of El. Baalat means “lady,” but it often designated a specific deity as the Baalat of Gebal or Byblos. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">melek</span> meant a “king” or “ruler,” but it might form part of a name of a deity such as Melqart (“ruler of the city”), chief god of Tyre.</p>
<p>As in the Greek city-states, Phoenician cities had patron deities that were not necessarily the head of the pantheon. On the female side, there was really only one deity worshiped in all the cities, the mother and fertility goddess Ashtart or Astarte (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">Ashtoreth</span>), the Babylonian Ishtar. She was regarded as the genetrix of the gods and man as well as of plants. Promiscuity characterized her conduct, and religious prostitution was carried on in her name.</p>
<p>Baalat Gebal, who symbolized fertility and thus corresponded to Astarte, was the preeminent deity of Byblos, but Adonis was also very important. As the young god who died and was resurrected, he was linked to the annual death and rebirth of vegetation.</p>
<p>Astarte was also predominant in the pantheon of Sidon, as is demonstrated by numerous inscriptions, temples built in her honor, and the fact that kings and queens called themselves her priests. The male deity most involved in Sidonian life was Eshmun, thought to correspond to Adonis in function. By the Greeks, he was identified as Asklepios, god of healing.</p>
<p>The chief god of Tyre was Melqart, the baal or lord of Tyre. Since an annual feast of resurrection was celebrated in his honor, he was equated with Eshmun of Sidon and Adonis of Byblos. The Greeks identified Melqart with Heracles or Hercules. When Tyre came to dominate the other Phoenician cities, Melqart rose to a place of prominence in their pantheons. Melqart would have been the Baal introduced to Israel in the days of Ahab, who married Jezebel of Tyre. The main female deity of Tyre was Astarte. Hiram built temples to both Melqart and Astarte at Tyre, and Solomon brought the worship of Astarte (Ashtoreth) to Jerusalem in his day (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.5">1 Kgs 11:5</a>). Her shrine remained to plague the Jews until the reform of Josiah late in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.13">2 Kgs 23:13</a>).</p>
<p>The places for worship of Baal were either high places in the hills (consisting of an altar and a stone pillar representing the Baal, and a tree or pole representing Astarte) or stone enclosures with an altar, a stone pillar, and a tree. Sometimes they were covered temple buildings. Sacrifices consisted of animals and vegetables, and in times of great disaster, of human beings. Great religious festivals were held in observance of the god’s connection with the rhythm of the seasons. When he and nature died, there were mourning, funeral rites, and perhaps self-torture. The spring festival, which celebrated his resurrection and new life in nature and which sought the fertility of nature, commonly was accompanied by sacramental prostitution. The idolatry, human sacrifice, and sexual promiscuity connected with Baal worship brought upon it God’s special condemnation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PhoeniciaandtheBible">Phoenicia and the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">Phoenicia first became involved in biblical history shortly after 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>, when David obtained from Hiram I of Tyre some of the much-coveted cedars of Lebanon for construction of his palace. Solomon also bought cedar from Hiram for his palace and the temple. He hired Phoenician craftsmen for building the temple, for constructing fortifications at strategic centers, and for creating a major port facility at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqaba, an arm of the Red Sea. Phoenician architectural design was employed in various Hebrew building projects in Solomon’s day, and Phoenician shipbuilding expertise made possible Solomon’s merchant marine. Phoenician sailors manned the ships after they were launched (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.10-28">1 Kgs 9:10-28</a>).</p>
<p>During the first half of the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Phoenician impact on Israel was largely religious. It was then that Jezebel, a princess from Tyre, married Ahab and introduced Baal worship to the northern kingdom. More than a century later, Phoenicia was the subject of prophetic condemnation. Isaiah (before 700 <span class="era">BC</span>, see <a href="?bref=Isa.23.1-18">Is 23</a>) and Ezekiel (about 600 <span class="era">BC</span>, see <a href="?bref=Ezek.26.2-19">Ez 26:2-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.1-23">28:1-23</a>) hurled predictions of suffering and destruction at both Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p>In NT times the apostle Paul spent a week at Tyre with a group of Christians on his return to Jerusalem at the end of his third missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.2-7">Acts 21:2-7</a>).</p>

Phoenix was situated west of Fair Havens near the island of Cauda. Against Paul’s better judgment, the ship was ordered to leave the bay of Fair Havens and sail westward to Phoenix. While en route to this harbor town, the ship was struck by a powerful gale from the northeast. This wind drove the ship southwest past the island of Cauda and threatened to push it across the Mediterranean Sea into the treacherous north African shoals of Syrtis Major (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.9-17">9-17</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="Phoenix"/>
<p>Luke’s description of Phoenix as facing northwest and southwest (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.12">Acts 27:12</a>) suggests that this place was the same as the modern Phoinika, a town on the western edge of Cape Mouros. In antiquity, this deep harbor was apparently accessible to ships and afforded protection from the winter winds. The name Phoenix is retained in Phoinika.</p>

  <title>Phrygia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PHRYGIA</p>
<p class="fl">Area in western Turkey on the Anatolian plateau, the boundaries of which cannot be defined precisely. The Phrygians were originally Europeans, called Phryges by the Greeks, who crossed the Hellespont from Macedonia and Thrace and settled here. This migration followed the general pattern of invasions from Europe into this section of Asia Minor. The Phrygians formed a powerful confederacy that flourished between the downfall of the Hittite Empire and the rise of the Lydian Empire, that is, between the 7th and the 13th centuries before Christ.</p>
<p>Their religious capital was at “Midas City,” modern Yazilikaya, about 150 miles (241.4 kilometers) southwest of Ankara. This “city of Midas” consisted of an acropolis, defended by a wall with towers, and a lower city. Within a large cave was a spring, approached by steps cut in the rock, which supplied water for the upper and lower cities. The famous tomb or monument of King Midas has a Phrygian inscription that mentions the goddess “Mida,” identified with Cybele the mother goddess, considered to be the mythical mother of the king. French archaeologists in 1948–49 discovered remains that indicate the city was destroyed in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, rebuilt about a century later, and finally destroyed in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Their chief goddess was Cybele. She later became the fertility goddess of all Anatolia. Orgiastic rites were performed in her honor, leading to sensuality intended to facilitate reproduction among humans, animals, and crops. When the Ionians and the Greeks settled in Miletus and Ephesus, Cybele was transformed into Artemis the Greek goddess of fertility, whose temple in Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the world. Her image originally was a black meteorite stone (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.19.35">Acts 19:35</a>). She became the consort of Adonis, a vegetation god, and their fertility rites were common throughout the Middle East. This goddess was imported into Rome; a temple in her honor was built on the Capitoline Hill soon after the organization of the empire.</p>
<p>Gallic tribes invaded the region some three centuries prior to Paul. This changed the demographic situation, with the result that the political, geographical, and ethnic divisions did not always coincide. What was formerly Phrygia became known as Galatia because of the new inhabitants. Yet the old names persisted.</p>
<p>Jews were encouraged to settle in this area by the Syrian kings. They were an important part of society, and their synagogues were to be found in every major city. Paul passed through this area on his way from Lycaonia to Troas (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a>) after having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word of God in Asia. The gospel probably came to this area from the pilgrims who went to Jerusalem and heard Peter preach. There, in astonishment, they heard the early believers proclaiming the works of God in their own native language (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.8-11">2:8-11</a>). Some were converted and went home to spread the Good News.</p>
<p>That Christianity made early inroads and received a wide following here is indicated by the fact that in the middle of the second century Montanus, a zealous leader of the church, arose and called the church back to the primitive dynamism that characterized Pentecost. Thus arose the sect of Montanism, in which the leader was sometimes viewed as the incarnation of the Holy Spirit or the oracle of God. In better light, the movement is seen as a return to primitive Christianity and a protest against the increasing formalism among the churches. By the third century, the entire region was almost entirely Christian, according to Eusebius.</p>

<p class="h1">PHYLACTERY*</p>
<p class="fl">Small prayer case containing Scripture passages worn at times of prayer by pious Jews. Orthodox Jewish males wear two small, black leather cubes or boxes, with Scripture inside, at the time of prayer.</p>
<p>In its original form the phylactery was probably not a box containing Scripture but a strip of parchment on which four passages from the OT were written in Hebrew. The passages were <a href="?bref=Exod.13.1-10,11-16">Exodus 13:1-10 and 11-16</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, and <a href="?bref=Deut.11.13-21">11:13-21</a>. The <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a> passage contains the “Shema”—the confession of God being one Lord. All four passages contain the idea that God commands his people to bind his ordinances and commandments upon their hands and have them as “frontlets” between their eyes. Some Jews took this figuratively or spiritually and did not actually wear them. Other Jews took the command literally and began wearing portions of their Scriptures on their foreheads and on their hands. Exactly when they began to do this is not agreed upon by scholars. There is an explicit mention of the practice as early as 100 <span class="era">BC</span> in a Jewish nonbiblical document. It is thought by some to have begun as early as the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, if not earlier.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Matthew 23:5</a> Jesus condemned the scribes and Pharisees for, among other things, making “broad their phylacteries.” The context of the passage is Jesus’ condemnation of ostentation in religion. Apparently, the broad phylactery would impress others with how religious the wearer was. It was evidence of pride, pretense, and hypocrisy in religion.</p>

In early Israel the diagnosis and treatment of sick people was officially the concern of the priests, although many nonprofessional people practiced the healing art in the small towns and villages. King Asa sought their help for his feet (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.12">2 Chr 16:12</a>). Jeremiah inquired about physicians in Gilead (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>). Job complained that his friends were useless physicians (<a href="?bref=Job.13.4">Jb 13:4</a>). Scientific medicine and the careful training of physicians awaited the rise of Greek medicine, which by NT times saw medical schools established in various countries in the Greco-Roman world. Remarkable collections of surgical instruments have come from places like Pompeii. The NT refers to a number of sicknesses, and the word “physician” occurs several times in the Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.12">Mt 9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.17">Mk 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.26">5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.23">Lk 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.31">5:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.43">8:43</a>).

In Egyptian the name is translated “house of the goddess Bastet.” Bastet was first represented as a woman with the head of a lioness, and in later periods by the head of a cat. In Greek she was known as Boubastis or Bubastis. The city of Boubastis was extensively described by Herodotus. It was located on the right shore of the Old Tanite branch of the Nile, also known as the Branch of Boubastis. Boubastis is the present Tell Basta. Archaeological excavations in 1866–67 unearthed evidence that it is a very old city, dating from the Old Kingdom. It was not until Shishak I, the founder of the 22d (Libyan) dynasty, that Pi-beseth became the capital. Hence, the dynasty is also known as the dynasty of Boubastis. The 23d dynasty kept Boubastis as the capital. It served about two centuries as the capital (c. 950–750 <span class="era">BC</span>). The city was destroyed around 350 <span class="era">BC</span> by Persian forces.</p>

After Pi-hahiroth, they journeyed three days to Marah and Elim, thought to be on the east shore of the Gulf of Suez, en route to Sinai. It seems that Pi-hahiroth was on the northeast border of Egypt, possibly on the west shore of the Bitter Lakes. Israel did not travel by the expected route of the Way of the Philistines, but southeast by the desert route (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.13.17-18">13:17-18</a>), eventually linking up with the old Egyptian road to the copper and turquoise mines of Sinai.</p>

  <title>Pilate, Pontius</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PILATE, P<span class="lc">ontius</span></p>
<p class="fl">Appointed by Tiberius as the fifth prefect of Judea, Pilate served in that capacity from <span class="era">AD</span> 26–36. He appears prominently in the trial narratives of the Gospels as the Roman governor who authorized Jesus’ crucifixion. In addition, he appears in a variety of extrabiblical sources as a dispassionate administrator who relentlessly pursued Roman authority in Judea.</p>
<p>Tacitus (<span class="ital">Annals</span> 15.44) mentions Pilate in connection with the crucifixion of Jesus but adds little to the Gospel account. Josephus, on the other hand, provides three narratives. First, he describes Pilate’s arrival as the new prefect (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.9.2; <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.3.1; cf. Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Histories</span> 2.6). Offending Jewish law, Pilate brought ensigns into Jerusalem that bore the image of Caesar. A large gathering of Jews then came to Caesarea in protest, fasting there for five days. Pilate called in troops to dismiss them, but he learned his first lesson about Jewish intransigence. The Jews were ready to die rather than tolerate the ensigns. Soon thereafter Pilate relented.</p>
<p>A second incident occurred when Pilate appropriated temple funds in order to construct a 35-mile (56.3-kilometer) aqueduct for Jerusalem (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.9.4; <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.3.2). Again, there was a major protest. Pilate ordered his soldiers to dress in tunics and infiltrate the crowds in disguise. At his command, the troops used clubs to beat the offenders. Many Jews were killed. Josephus records the horror with which Jerusalem perceived the affair.</p>
<p>Finally, Josephus records the story of Pilate’s dismissal (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.4.1-2). In <span class="era">AD</span> 36 a Samaritan false prophet (pretending to be the <span class="ital">Taheb,</span> or Samaritan messiah) promised to show his followers sacred vessels hidden by Moses on Mt Gerizim. Pilate sent a heavily armed contingent of footmen and cavalry who intercepted the pilgrims and slaughtered most of them. The Samaritans complained to Vitellius, the prefect of Syria, whereupon Pilate was ordered to report to the emperor Tiberius. Another prefect, Marcellus, was then sent by Rome as Pilate’s replacement.</p>
<p>Philo records yet another event (<span class="ital">Leg. to Caius</span> 299-305). While extolling the liberal policies of Tiberius toward Judaism, he cites a negative example in Pontius Pilate. The prefect had erected gilded shields in Herod’s former palace in Jerusalem that bore the name of the emperor. Refusing to hear Jewish complaints, the sons of Herod appealed to Tiberius, who ordered Pilate to transfer the shields to the temple of Augustus in Caesarea. The similarities with the parallel story in Josephus have led many scholars to believe that Philo is merely recounting another version of the same event.</p>
<p>Luke mentions a minor incident that contributes to this same portrait. In <a href="?bref=Luke.13.1">Luke 13:1</a> some Jews tell Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. While this story is not corroborated by any other witness, it conforms to the impressions of Pilate’s character given by Philo and Josephus. In fact, Luke adds another detail of interest in his trial narrative. In <a href="?bref=Luke.23.12">Luke 23:12</a> he says that prior to the crucifixion of Jesus, Herod Antipas (in Galilee) and Pilate had been at enmity with each other. This may have stemmed not simply from Pilate’s usual antagonism but particularly from the Galilean incident.</p>
<p>Pilate’s role in the death of Jesus is recorded in each Gospel (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.2">Mt 27:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.1">Mk 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.1">Lk 23:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.29">Jn 18:29</a>) and was remembered as a historical datum in the preaching of the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.13">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.27">4:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.28">13:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.13">1 Tm 6:13</a>). In order to secure the conviction and death of Jesus, Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin brought their charges to Pilate. While the accusations took on a political flavor to evoke the governor’s interest, he still could find no grounds for condemnation. In the end, Pilate unexpectedly accommodates the Jewish leaders and has Jesus crucified.</p>
<p>All of the Gospels and particularly John show Pilate’s repeated verdict of Jesus’ innocence. According to <a href="?bref=Matt.27.19">Matthew 27:19</a>, Pilate’s wife had an ominous dream about Jesus’ conviction, and she warned her husband. Pilate tried to have Jesus released, but the crowd cried for Barabbas. Matthew even records that Pilate washed his hands (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.24-25">27:24-25</a>), declaring his own innocence in this. And finally, John says that Pilate refused to alter the title over the cross (<a href="?bref=John.19.19-22">Jn 19:19-22</a>). These accounts, therefore, take the full blame for Jesus’ death from Pilate and place it on the Jewish leaders of the Sanhedrin. They are ultimately responsible.</p>
<p>But why would Pilate act in behalf of the Sanhedrin? Two answers are possible. First, there may have been collusion between Caiaphas and Pilate that stemmed from a long-standing relationship and coterminous reign. Ten of Caiaphas’s eighteen years in power were under Pilate, and when the prefect was dismissed in <span class="era">AD</span> 36, Caiaphas was simultaneously removed. Second, if Jesus’ trial occurred in <span class="era">AD</span> 33, Pilate may have been concerned about his impeachment. He had originally been appointed by Sejanus (prefect of the praetorians in Rome who had appointed men to colonial office under Tiberius), but in the autumn of <span class="era">AD</span> 31 Sejanus died. This explains why a Jewish delegation could report directly to Tiberius during the votive shield incident. Hence, the charge recorded in <a href="?bref=John.19.12">John 19:12</a> (“If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend”) would have had genuine power over Pilate. Pilate perceived his jeopardy and was anxious to pacify the Jews and please the emperor.</p>
<p>The history of Pilate after his dismissal in <span class="era">AD</span> 36 is unknown. Eusebius reports that Pilate ultimately committed suicide during the reign of the emperor Caligula, <span class="era">AD</span> 37–41 (<span class="ital">History</span> 2.7).</p>

  <title>Pillar of Fire and Cloud</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PILLAR OF FIRE AND CLOUD</p>
<p class="fl">One of the most frequent modes of God’s appearing to humans in the OT; a visual manifestation of the presence of God common in the narratives of the exodus, Sinai covenant, the wilderness wanderings, and the dedication of the temple. The Bible refers to this phenomenon in a variety of ways: the pillar of cloud and of fire (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.24">Ex 14:24</a>); pillar of cloud (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.9-10">Ex 33:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.14">Nm 14:14</a>); pillar of fire (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">Ex 13:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.14">Nm 14:14</a>); cloud (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-35">Ex 40:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.33">Dt 1:33</a>); fire (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.33">Dt 1:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.12">4:12</a>). Though the Bible itself does not use this designation, the cloud and associated theophanies (God-appearances) are often called the “Shekinah glory” or simply “the Shekinah”—terms that have entered Christian theology from rabbinic literature.</p>
<p>The cloud theophany is associated with a variety of functions; common to all of them is that it is a visible expression of the presence of God. The cloud filled the tabernacle and was there day and night as a witness to the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">Ex 40:34-38</a>). God appeared in the cloud on the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.2">Lv 16:2</a>). God’s acceptance of the temple built as his dwelling is shown when the cloud comes at the dedication (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.5.13-14">2 Chr 5:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>The cloud was also a protection for Israel. At its first appearance in the events of the exodus, the cloud positioned itself between the armies of Egypt and Israel, engulfing the Egyptians in darkness on the one side while lighting the way with its fire for Israel on the other (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.19-20">Ex 14:19-20</a>). The psalmist recalled how God “spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night” (<a href="?bref=Ps.105.39">Ps 105:39</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>The pillar also served as Israel’s guide during the exodus and wandering in the wilderness. “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> guided them by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night. That way they could travel whether it was day or night. And the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> did not remove the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire from their sight” (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.21-22">Ex 13:21-22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped (<a href="?bref=Num.9.17">Nm 9:17</a>). In spite of the sins of the people, the Lord God went ahead of them on their journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.33">Dt 1:33</a>). Subsequent generations would recount how God was their guide by day and night (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.12,19">Neh 9:12, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.14">Ps 78:14</a>).</p>
<p>The cloud also had an oracular function (<a href="?bref=Ps.99.7">Ps 99:7</a>). Not only did God speak from the cloud at Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.9,16">Ex 19:9, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.1-25">34:1-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.11-12">Dt 4:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.22">5:22</a>), he also spoke from there when Israel rebelled (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.10">Ex 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.10">Nm 14:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.16.42-43">16:42-43</a>), when Aaron and Miriam had a quarrel with Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-15">Nm 12:1-15</a>), and when the 70 elders were appointed. Only Moses had this ready access to the very words of God. When Moses went into the tabernacle, “the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at the entrance while the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> spoke with Moses” (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.9">Ex 33:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). At the death of Moses the Lord appears in the pillar at the tent and speaks of the coming apostasy of the nation (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.14-29">Dt 31:14-29</a>).</p>
<p>Other theophanies having the features of cloud, fire, and light—or some combination—should probably be associated with the pillar of fire and cloud. Ezekiel saw an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by a brilliant light (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.4">Ez 1:4</a>); when he looked inside the cloud, he saw a fire, creatures in the service of God, the throne of God, and the awesome presence of the one who sat upon it and spoke (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.5-28">5-28</a>). Ezekiel also had a vision of the glory of God leaving the temple, and later a vision of its return (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-27">43</a>). In Daniel’s vision of the Ancient of Days, he sees one “like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven” to receive authority, glory, and power (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">Dn 7:13</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The phrase “son of man” becomes Jesus’ favorite self-designation in the Gospels. At the Transfiguration, when he reveals his own glory, the clouds envelop him (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.5">Mt 17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">Mk 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.34">Lk 9:34</a>). At his ascension he is received into the clouds, and angels remind the apostles of his promise to return in the same way (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.9-11">Acts 1:9-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Mt 24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mk 13:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.27">Lk 21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.7">Rv 1:7</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PISIDIA</p>
<p class="fl">Region included in the Roman province of Galatia at the time of the visit of Paul and Barnabas about <span class="era">AD</span> 48.</p>
<p>It is north of the Taurus mountain range that parallels the coastline of Cilicia and Pamphylia. Separated from these coastal provinces by the mountain range, it lies in the central plateau of Anatolia about 3,600 feet (1,097.3 meters) above sea level. The territory includes the foothills of the Taurus range and measures about 400 miles (643.6 kilometers) long and 165 miles (265.5 kilometers) wide. It was joined by the large province of Asia on the west, by Galatia on the north, and by Lycaonia on the east. The inhabitants of the mountainous terrain were predatory tribesmen who were subjugated with great difficulty over a period of years by the Seleucids and later by the Romans. To assist in controlling these tribes, the city of Antioch was founded by Seleucus I Nicator (312–280 <span class="era">BC</span>). Concern with security led Amyntas of Galatia to strengthen the city (c. 26 <span class="era">BC</span>). At his death in 25 <span class="era">BC</span>, Pisidia was absorbed into the province of Galatia. Augustus undertook the final phase of pacification of the populace by founding five cities in addition to Antioch: Crimma, Comana, Olbase, Parlais, and Lystra, all linked to Antioch by military roads. An inscription, discovered in 1912, indicates that Quirinius (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.2.2">Lk 2:2</a>) was administrator of the district and responsible to Augustus. Its capital, Antioch, was on the main road between Ephesus to the west and Derbe and Tarsus to the east. It was primarily a Roman colony and included a sizeable Jewish community, introduced by the Seleucids for the purpose of trade.</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas passed through the country at least twice (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.14">Acts 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.24">14:24</a>) in the journey between Perga and Derbe. It was in Antioch of Pisidia that one of the most important decisions in the history of Christian missionary strategy was made and announced. After being rebuffed by a majority of his Jewish audience, accompanied by a more cordial response from the Gentiles, Paul and Barnabas announced, “Since you thrust it [the word of God] from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles” (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.46">13:46</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Henceforth, the strategy of Paul and his associates was oriented more specifically to the non-Jewish peoples, thus making Christianity a world religion rather than another Jewish sect.</p>

<p class="h1">PITHOM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the store cities (along with Rameses) built by the Israelites during their Egyptian captivity (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.11">Ex 1:11</a>). There has been considerable debate among Egyptologists for over a century as to the identification of these sites. The identification of Rameses is fairly well established as being associated with Pirameses, the capital of Pharaoh Ramses II (1290–1224 <span class="era">BC</span>). A number of ancient sites have been suggested for Rameses, but Tanis in the northeastern Delta for many years was the assumed location. However, Qantir, in the same general region, is the more likely spot.</p>
<p>Pithom is derived from the Egyptian phrase meaning “House of [the god] Atum.” This would have been a temple dedicated to the worship of the solar deity Atum. The Israelites would have been involved in building the storage facilities of the temple. Storage facilities from the mortuary temple of Ramses II in Thebes are well-preserved, long rectangular structures with arched roofs. They were built side by side and covered a significant portion of the mortuary complex. This gives us a fairly accurate picture of the sort of structures for which the Israelites were forced to provide bricks.</p>
<p>While the etymology of Pithom is known, its location continues to be a subject of scholarly discussion. The two sites most frequently associated with Pithom are Tell er-Retabah and Tell el-Maskhutah, both located in the Wadi Tumilat, which extends eastward from the Nile Delta to Lake Timsah. Excavations have taken place at both sites in recent years, and both tells have yielded evidence for the presence of Asiatics from Palestine and Syria. Since there might be a link between the Arabic name Maskhutah and Hebrew Succoth (mentioned in <a href="?bref=Exod.12.37">Ex 12:37</a> as a stopping-off point on the route of the exodus), Tell er-Retabah is now thought to be the best possible location for Pithom, and Maskhutah would be Succoth.</p>

<p>There is no question that in the Hebrew mind plagues were part of the judgment God sent to individuals, families, and nations. God himself threatened to send plagues to the Israelites in proportion to their sins (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.21">Lv 26:21</a>) and took full responsibility for the Egyptian plagues (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.5">Jos 24:5</a>). The OT plagues demonstrated God’s control over the processes of nature, just as Christ’s miracles do in the NT.</p>
<p>At one point in the history of Israel, the Philistines won a battle and captured the ark of God (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.10-11">1 Sm 4:10-11</a>). When the ark was kept at Ashdod, however, God showed his power by allowing a fatal disease characterized by swellings or tumors to be prevalent (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.6">5:6</a>). The Philistines sent the ark on to Gath, but people of all ages began to have tumors in the region of the groin (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.9">9</a>). A similar occurrence at the next city, Ekron, resulted in many deaths (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, after seven months, the Philistines decided to return the ark of God to Israel along with a guilt offering of five golden rats and five golden tumors (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.1-4">1 Sm 6:1-4</a>). The selection of this unusual offering was made because the Philistine diviners associated the swarms of rodents that marred the land with the plague that was upon them (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.5">5</a>). The first Israelite village to receive the ark of God from the Philistines was punished with the same disease for looking into it (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.19">19</a>). The epidemic in Beth-shemesh left 50,070 people dead (cf. <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg).</p>

<p class="h1">PLAGUES UPON EGYPT</p>
<p class="fl">Unprecedented series of disasters striking Egypt, probably culminating in spring or early summer (c. 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>). They struck particularly the Nile Delta, although apparently not affecting the area called Goshen. These disasters were of such magnitude that the Egyptians from their earliest history could recall nothing like them (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.24">Ex 9:24</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="ThePlagues">The Plagues</p>
<p class="fl">The plagues are described in <a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-11.10">Exodus 7–11</a>. At first sight one might imagine that the plagues took place in succession within a few weeks, but casual notes of time (see <a href="?bref=Exod.7.25">7:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.31-32">9:31-32</a>), as well as the nature of some of the plagues, would suggest that several months may well have been involved. The first plague was the turning of water into blood (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.20">7:20</a>), so that the fish died and the water stank. Next came a plague of frogs (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.6">8:6</a>); even after their death, the land was strewn with piles of their bodies (v <a href="?bref=Exod.8.14">14</a>). Next came a plague of lice (v <a href="?bref=Exod.8.17">17</a>), or possibly gnats, sandflies, or mosquitoes. The exact sense of the word is not clear, but it obviously means some small irritating creature. After that came “swarms of flies” (v <a href="?bref=Exod.8.24">24</a>). Again, the meaning is not quite clear. Later Jewish tradition made it swarms of wild beasts, but flies is a much more likely sense. Then some sort of cattle plague struck (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.3">9:3</a>), affecting the domestic animals. After that came boils on humans (v <a href="?bref=Exod.9.9">9</a>), boils that erupted into painful blisters and vesicles, apparently irritating rather than fatal. Hail followed (v <a href="?bref=Exod.9.18">18</a>), so severe that nothing like it had been seen before—hail associated with thunder and lightning (v <a href="?bref=Exod.9.24">24</a>). This was so heavy that it could be fatal (v <a href="?bref=Exod.9.19">19</a>), and naturally did great harm to the crops of Egypt (v <a href="?bref=Exod.9.31">31</a>). After that came locusts in vast numbers (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.13">10:13</a>)—again on an unparalleled scale. Then came three days of complete darkness (v <a href="?bref=Exod.10.22">22</a>) that brought Egyptian life to a standstill. Finally, all the firstborn of the Egyptians died (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.29">12:29</a>)—from Pharaoh’s household down to the lowliest homes in the land.</p>
<p>All the plagues are seen in the Bible as successive judgments of God. Normally, each is preceded by a warning from Moses, which is disregarded by Pharaoh, and then each is lifted as a result of temporary repentance on the part of Pharaoh. But it is also clear that the plagues gradually increase in severity and intensity, until the climax comes in the death of the firstborn—with that, even Pharaoh is broken. The first plagues represent discomfort rather than danger for the Egyptians; then their animals and crops are struck down; finally death takes the firstborn, the flower of the nation.</p>
<p>There are certain common features that run through the account of the plagues. At first, Pharaoh’s magicians try to belittle the plagues, and the signs that precede them, by producing similar effects themselves (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.11-12">7:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.8.7">8:7</a>). This is an interesting warning that miracles may be produced from various sources and that this sort of sign is therefore not important in itself. But the time comes when the magicians are beaten and can no longer compete (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.18">8:18</a>); even they admit that this is God’s hand (v <a href="?bref=Exod.8.19">19</a>). When the plague of boils comes, the magicians cannot even present themselves before Pharaoh, so bad is their condition. After that, the magicians disappear from the story.</p>
<p>Another motif that becomes increasingly clear as the account of the plagues continues, is the increasing emphasis on the way in which God’s people, living in Goshen, were delivered from the plagues that affected the Egyptians. It could be assumed anyway that, as Goshen was not on the Nile, the water that turned to blood and the plague of frogs and mosquitoes might affect them less. But in the case of the later swarms of flies (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.22">8:22</a>), the cattle plague (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.4">9:4</a>), the hail (v <a href="?bref=Exod.9.26">26</a>), and the darkness (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.23">10:23</a>), we are specifically told that Israel was spared; in the case of the death of the firstborn, the Lord “passed over” Israelite homes.</p>
<p>At first, it seems as if the hearts of all the Egyptians are just as hard as that of the pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.13">7:13</a>). Yet as the story goes on, his own people keep urging him to yield to God. The magicians admit God’s role in the plague of lice (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.19">8:19</a>). Pharaoh’s servants who heeded God’s warning through Moses brought their servants and cattle indoors before the great hailstorms, and thus escaped loss and death (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.20">9:20</a>). Only the unbelieving suffered. Finally, Pharaoh’s own servants exhorted him to let Israel go, bluntly telling him that the land was being ruined by his stubbornness (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.7">10:7</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PharaohandthePlagues">Pharaoh and the Plagues</p>
<p class="fl">Pharaoh’s reaction to God’s word is remarkable. Scripture describes the hardness of Pharoah’s heart in three ways. <a href="?bref=Exod.7.3">Exodus 7:3</a> speaks of God hardening Pharaoh’s heart; <a href="?bref=Exod.7.14">7:14</a> has the neutral statement that Pharaoh’s heart was hardened; and <a href="?bref=Exod.8.15">8:15</a> has Pharaoh hardening his own heart. Obviously, these all refer to the same process, which must be taken into account in any explanation. Furthermore, Paul must be allowed to have the last word on the matter (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.18">Rom 9:18</a>).</p>
<p>But, within this theological framework, there is quite a movement, not merely a succession of shallow repentances designed to secure the removal of the plague, and then a renewed stubbornness, calling down a fresh judgment. There is also a typically Asian bargaining session between Pharaoh and Moses. After Pharaoh’s broken promises to let the people go (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.8">8:8</a>), he tries to bargain: the people should sacrifice to God in Egypt, without going at all (v <a href="?bref=Exod.8.25">25</a>); only the men should go (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.11">10:11</a>); they should all go, but leave their flocks and herds as hostage (v <a href="?bref=Exod.10.24">24</a>). But there can be no bargaining of this sort in response to the call of God, as Pharaoh was to learn. After the death of the firstborn, he was glad to see the Israelites leave (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.31-33">12:31-33</a>).</p>
<p>In this sense, the whole story of the plagues is a struggle. It has sometimes been seen as the struggle of the prototype prophet, Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.15">Dt 18:15</a>), against the prototype king, Pharaoh; while it may be that, it is far more. It is the struggle of Moses, the servant of God, against the magicians. It is the struggle of Moses against mighty Pharaoh, or rather, the confrontation of Pharaoh by God, in the form of the word brought by his servant. At the deepest level, it is a victory won by God over the false gods of Egypt. This gives to many of the stories their peculiar relish. For the Nile is the god Hapi; Hept the frog is a god of fertility and childbirth; Ra the sun (outraged by the darkness) is a god; Hat-hot had the form of a heifer, and Apis that of a bull; the flying hornet symbolized Egypt; and Pharaoh himself was a god. Yet all were helpless before the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNatureofthePlagues">The Nature of the Plagues</p>
<p class="fl">It is not known how God brought about the plagues, and some may think it vain even to ask, since God is free to use whatever means he pleases. Yet the statement that God turned back the waters of the “Reed Sea” by a strong east wind (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.21">Ex 14:21</a>) indicates that God could use natural means to bring about his will. The Hebrew concept of “miracle” was not the same as the modern one, which usually regards miracles as “supernatural” and sees all else as “natural” and thus as nonmiraculous. The Hebrews, however, regarded everything in nature as the work of God; it was only that in certain instances he had acted more “wonderfully” (perhaps one would say more “obviously”) than others. Therefore, there is nothing in any way rationalistic in saying that on this occasion God may have sent a series of “natural” disasters (the sort of disasters to which Egypt was geographically prone) but so heightened them—and sent them in such rapid succession—that they constituted miracles.</p>
<p>Most of the explanations of this sort assume a year of unusual climatic conditions, and in particular, a variation in the annual rise of the Nile. For instance, either an exceptionally low rise of the Nile (leading to red and muddy water) or an exceptionally high rise of the Nile (bringing down red earth from the Ethiopian highlands) have been suggested as explanations of the first plague. If one feels that the description “turned into blood” would be satisfied by thick blood-colored water, then either would be satisfactory. Another attractive suggestion is the multiplication of red plankton in the water. This phenomenon is fairly common across the world, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. This would make the likeness to blood much closer. In either of these cases, death of fish in foul water, and migration of frogs from the river would be understandable. If the Nile was flooding more widely than usual, the plague of frogs would be even more understandable. Some have seen the sudden death of the frogs as due to some type of internal anthrax; and, with piles of stinking frogs’ bodies in the fields, the way was laid wide open both for the carriers of the plagues (flies, etc.) and the plagues that followed.</p>
<p>The next plague, for instance, was one of mosquitoes, sandflies, gnats, or possibly lice. At least the first and the last are potent carriers of disease, and all would cause irritant sores by their bites. The flooding of the stagnant waters of the Nile would give perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes in particular.</p>
<p>If we are right in assuming that the swarms that followed were swarms of flies, then everything would fit into a divine pattern. Piles of dead frogs, piles of rubbish strewn over the land by the flood (including, no doubt, raw sewage), foul and muddied Nile waters—this would be a prime breeding place for flies. Further, Jewish interpreters suggest that the flies in question were biting or stinging flies (like our gadflies or horseflies). Perhaps these were the agents of the disease of the cattle. Modern interpreters have suggested a particular type of fly, still known in the area, which multiplies very rapidly amid rotting vegetation. The flies and the dust (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.9">9:9</a>) between them could have produced that dreaded tropical scourge “prickly heat,” easily becoming infected.</p>
<p>Again, in the providence of God, if the Israelites were not in the Delta area, nor actually living along the Nile itself, but concentrated in the Wadi Tumilat to the east, they would be spared these plagues—a fact that did not escape Pharaoh’s notice (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.7">9:7</a>). The miracle thus lay in God’s overruling providence, using his world and its geographic and climatic conditions to do his work of judgment on the stubborn-hearted.</p>
<p>Hail, accompanied by violent thunderstorms (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.24">9:24</a>), would be easily explicable (although rare in Egypt), especially in the “funnel” conditions of the Nile Valley, surrounded by hot, dry desert on either side. As to the severity of the hail (more common in Palestine), there are biblical parallels (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.11">Jos 10:11</a>). With this plague there is a valuable note of time, given incidentally (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.31-32">Ex 9:31-32</a>) in connection with the crops destroyed by the hail.</p>
<p>In the case of the plague of locusts, God’s use of the elements of nature is made plain in the text, where an “east wind” brings them and a “sea wind” takes them away (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.13,19">10:13, 19</a>). The “plague” here is both the enormous number of locusts (see <a href="?bref=Joel.1.1-12">Jl 1:1-12</a> for another illustration of this scourge) and the timing of their arrival. There are many other places in the OT where the precision of God’s timing is shown and where indeed the miraculous element lies in the timing of the event.</p>
<p>The locusts may have darkened the land with their numbers (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.15">Ex 10:15</a>), but that was nothing compared with the three days of darkness that followed. Most commentators are agreed that this is the dreaded <span class="ital">khamsin,</span> the hot desert wind bringing dust storms or sandstorms that fill the sky and may last for days without respite. If the red earth from the Ethiopian highlands had been brought down by the floodwaters of the Nile and deposited widely over the land, some commentators have suggested that it was whipped into the air by this wind, thus giving an even darker pall over the land.</p>
<p>In the case of the last plague, the death of the firstborn, we have no indication of what, if any, particular disease was used by God. Scripture gives us no clue. What can be said is that the Egyptians suffered but the Israelites did not. After this plague, they were free. Henceforth, it was their glad knowledge that none of “the plagues of Egypt” would strike them as God’s people (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.26">15:26</a>). It was their unshakable belief that these plagues were God’s judgment, a punishment on stubborn Pharaoh, but the means of their salvation. Therefore, the plagues are not only a warning to us but also an encouragement. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=EgyptEgyptian_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Egypt, Egyptian</a>; <a href="?item=ExodusBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Exodus, Book of</a>; <a href="?item=Moses_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Moses</a>; <a href="?item=Plague_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Plague</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Identifying biblical plants has always been a difficult task, partly because people continue to identify the biblical elm, sycamore, lily, rose, and vine with modern plants, and also because they assume that all the plants now growing in the Holy Land were there in ancient biblical days, or that the plants referred to in the Bible are still to be found there today. Unfortunately, many plants now quite common in the Holy Land were not there in biblical days. Many plants that once grew in abundance in the Holy Land are now extinct. Some have been driven out by foreign invaders; others have been exterminated or nearly exterminated by overcultivation of the land, the destruction of forests, and the resulting changes in climatic and other environmental conditions. At one time the Holy Land was a land of palm trees, with the date palm as abundant and characteristic there as it was in Egypt, but today the date palm is much less common. Similarly, in antiquity, the towering cedars clothed the slopes of Lebanon and other mountain ranges. Now the few remaining specimens must be carefully fenced in to protect them against trampling and the ravages of goats.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Acacia">Acacia <span class="ital">(Acacia tortilis</span> and <span class="ital">A. seyal)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any tree or shrub of the mimosa family of plants growing in warm regions. The plant referred to in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> as “shittah” (singular) or “shittim” (plural) is undoubtedly the acacia tree, the only timber tree of any considerable size in the Arabian desert. <span class="ital">Acacia tortilis</span> is by far the largest and most common tree in the desert in which the Israelites wandered for 40 years. It is especially conspicuous on Mt Sinai and was probably the species used for the tabernacle furnishings. <span class="ital">A. seyal</span> is less common, at least today. It can grow as high as 25 feet (7.6 meters), and bears yellow flowers on twisted branches. The wood is close grained, heavy and hard, orange-brown in color, and much valued in cabinetwork. The ancient Egyptians clamped shut mummy coffins with acacia wood.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Acanthus">Acanthus <span class="ital">(Acanthus syriacus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The acanthus, perhaps referred to in <a href="?bref=Job.30.7">Job 30:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.9">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, is a perennial thistlelike herb or small shrub about three feet (.9 meter) tall, and is a common weed in all Eastern countries. It has been used since time immemorial as a model for the leaf or scroll decorations in art.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Algum">Algum <span class="ital">(Juniperus excelsa Bieb)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The timber from Lebanon referred to in <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.8">2 Chronicles 2:8</a> is probably the juniper. Some translators hold, however, that algum and almug are Hebrew variants for the same tree (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg, <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.8">2 Chr 2:8</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">The almond is a peachlike tree with saw-toothed pointed leaves and gray bark. It grows to a height of from 10 to 25 feet (3 to 7.6 meters). It blooms very early in the year; its Hebrew name has its roots in “watch for.” To the Jews it was a welcome harbinger of spring (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.11">Jer 1:11</a>).</p>

This timber was brought by sea from Ophir to Ezion-geber, near Elath. Modern authorities suggest that Ophir was either in Arabia, India, or East Africa near Mozambique. The reference to “algum“ in <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.8">2 Chronicles 2:8</a> is possibly to this tree. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="#Algum">Algum (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Aloe">Aloe <span class="ital">(Aloe succotrina, Aquilaria agallocha)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Chiefly African, lilylike plant of the genus <span class="ital">Aloes,</span> certain species of which yield a drug and a fiber. Aloe is an aromatic substance mentioned in the Bible, together with myrrh, balm, and other fragrant plants (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.8">Ps 45:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.7.17">Prv 7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.14">Sg 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.39">Jn 19:39</a>). Most scholars think these passages refer to two different plants. The OT plant is likely to have been <span class="ital">Aquilaria agallocha,</span> the eaglewood, a large tree growing up to 120 feet (36.6 meters) tall with a trunk 12 feet (3.7 meters) in circumference. It is native to northern India, Malaya, and Indochina. The decaying wood is highly fragrant, and as such is highly valued as perfume and incense and for fumigation.</p>
<p>The aloe of <a href="?bref=John.19.39">John 19:39</a> is thought to be the true aloe <span class="ital">(Aloe succotrina),</span> the juice of which was used by the Egyptians in embalming. Its smell, however, is not very agreeable, and it has a bitter taste. It is sometimes used by veterinarians as a horse medicine.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Apple">Apple <span class="ital">(Malus sylvestris)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The identity of the fruit identified by the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">tappuach</span> (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.11">Prv 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.2.3,5">Sg 2:3, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.7.8">7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.8.5">8:5</a>) continues to be debated. In most English translations it has been rendered “apple” because of its close linguistic tie to the Arabic word <span class="ital">tuffah.</span> Many scholars identify this tree as the apricot, questioning whether apples fit the biblical description “apples of gold” and whether the apple tree was cultivated in ancient Palestine. Recent excavations at Kadesh-barnea, however, have uncovered carbonized apples, probably a crab apple <span class="ital">(Malus sylvestris),</span> dating to the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>. This would certainly allow for this ornamental apple’s cultivation in Solomon’s gardens.</p>

<p class="fl">The identification of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">tappuach</span> with the apricot continues to be debated. The apricot tree produces yellow-orange peachlike edible fruit and is native to western Asia and Africa. It is abundant in the Holy Land and probably has been so since early biblical times. The tree is a round-headed reddish-barked tree growing 30 feet (9.1 meters) tall. Most translations render this Hebrew word “apple,” though many scholars identify it with the apricot because of its descriptions in the biblical text (see <a href="?bref=Pr.25.11">Prv 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.2.3,5">Sg 2:3, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.7.8">7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.8.5">8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.12">Jl 1:12</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Ash">Ash <span class="ital">(Alhagi maurorum, Fraxinus ornus, Tamarix mannifera)</span></p>
<p class="fl">There are several ash trees found in the Near East. One of these, the prickly alhagi <span class="ital">(Alhagi maurorum),</span> is a member of the pea family. It is a low, many-stemmed, much-branched shrub growing about three feet (.9 meter) tall with somewhat hairy twigs and pealike flowers. During the heat of the day, leaves exude a sweet, gummy substance that hardens in the air and is collected by shaking the bushes over a spread-out cloth.</p>
<p>The manna tamarisk <span class="ital">(Tamarix mannifera)</span> is a multibranched shrub or a small tree 9 to 15 feet (2.7 to 4.6 meters) tall with rigid branches that have tiny pink flowers. It is found on deserts from the Holy Land to Arabia and the Sinai.</p>
<p>The flowering or manna ash <span class="ital">(Fraxinus ornus)</span> is a tree that grows from 15 to 50 feet (4.6 to 15.2 meters) tall. The fruits are very similar to those produced by our species of ash. The ash of <a href="?bref=Isa.44.14">Isaiah 44:14</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is believed to be the Aleppo pine.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Aspen">Aspen <span class="ital">(Populus euphratica</span> or <span class="ital">P. tremula)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several trees of the genus <span class="ital">Populus</span> with leaves attached by flattened leafstalks so that they tremble or “quake” in the wind.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Balm">Balm <span class="ital">(Balanites aegyptiaca, Pistacia lentiscus, Commiphora opobalsamum</span><span class="ital">)</span></p>
<p class="fl">An oily aromatic resin exuded by chiefly tropical trees and shrubs and used medicinally; trees and shrubs producing this substance. References in <a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Genesis 37:25</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jeremiah 8:22</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.46.11">46:11</a>, and <a href="?bref=Jer.51.8">51:8</a> are thought to be either the Jericho balsam <span class="ital">(Balanites aegyptiaca)</span> or the lentisk or mastic tree <span class="ital">(Pistacia lentiscus).</span> The Jericho balsam is very common in Egypt, North Africa, the plains of Jericho, and the hot plains bordering on the Dead Sea. It is a small desert-loving plant, 9 to 15 feet (2.7 to 4.6 meters) tall, with slender, thorny branches and small clusters of green flowers.</p>
<p>The lentisk or mastic tree is native to the Holy Land, and the reference in <a href="?bref=Gen.43.11">Genesis 43:11</a> is probably to this plant, since the implication is that this is a native product of the Holy Land unknown in Egypt at the time. This tree is a shrubby or bushy tree 3 to 10 feet (.9 to 3 meters) tall with evergreen leaves. The “balm” is a fragrant gummy exudation of the sap secured by making incisions in the stems and branches, usually in August. The best grades are in the form of yellow-white translucent tears or drops; they are employed in medicine as an astringent. The poorer grades are used extensively as a varnish. Children in the East use it as chewing gum.</p>
<p>References to spices in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.10">1 Kings 10:10</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.13">2 Kings 20:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Song.3.6">Song of Songs 3:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.39.2">Isaiah 39:2</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.17">Ezekiel 27:17</a> are thought to be the balm of Gilead <span class="ital">(Commiphora opobalsamum),</span> which in spite of its name is not a native of Gilead or even of the Holy Land but is indigenous to Arabia, especially the mountainous regions of Yemen. The trees were still in existence on the plain of Jericho at the time of the Roman conquest. The Roman conquerors carried branches to Rome as trophies of their victory over the Jews.</p>
<p>This tree is a small, stiff-branched evergreen tree seldom more than 15 feet (4.6 meters) high with straggling branches. The “balm” is obtained by making incisions in the stem and branches of the tree. The sap soon hardens into small irregular nodules that are collected. Gum is also procured from green and ripe fruit.</p>

The common barley <span class="ital">(Hordeum distichon),</span> the winter barley <span class="ital">(H. hex</span><span class="ital">astichon),</span> and the spring barley <span class="ital">(H. vulgare)</span> have been cultivated in temperate regions of the world since time immemorial and today still constitute one of the principal grain foods. Barley and wheat were the two staple cereal crops of Egypt and the Holy Land. Being less expensive, barley was mostly used for feeding cattle, although it was also used by itself or mixed with wheat and other seed as food for man (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9-12">Ez 4:9-12</a>). Barley is mentioned in the Bible over 30 times, either as a plant growing in the fields or in reference to products made from it, such as barley meal, barley bread, barley cakes, and barley loaves. As the common food of the poor, barley was also regarded as a symbol of poverty and cheapness or worthlessness (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.2">Hos 3:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Bdellium">Bdellium <span class="ital">(Commiphora africana)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Aromatic gum resin similar to myrrh, produced by various trees of the genus <span class="ital">Commiphora</span> of Africa and western Asia. The reference in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.12">Genesis 2:12</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Numbers 11:7</a> to bdellium is thought by most scholars today to refer to a gum resin, obtained from a shrub, <span class="ital">Commiphora africana</span>, that grows in south Arabia and northeastern Africa. The resin is yellowish, transparent, and fragrant, and looks like a pearl.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Bean">Bean <span class="ital">(Faba vulgaris)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The references in <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.27-28">2 Samuel 17:27-28</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9">Ezekiel 4:9</a> are generally regarded as referring to the broad bean. This species, an annual plant, is thought originally to have grown in northern Persia, but it was extensively cultivated in western Asia in very early times as a food plant. Beans have been found in the mummy coffins of Egyptian tombs, and they were also cultivated by the Greeks and Romans.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BitterHerbs">Bitter Herbs <span class="ital">(Cichorium endivia, Taraxacum officinale, Lactuca sativa)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The “bitter herbs” of <a href="?bref=Exod.12.8">Exodus 12:8</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.9.11">Numbers 9:11</a> seem to have been plants like endive <span class="ital">(Cichorium endivia),</span> the common chicory <span class="ital">(Cichorium intybus),</span> lettuce <span class="ital">(Lactuca sativa),</span> or the common dandelion <span class="ital">(Taraxacum officinale).</span> These are all weedy plants common in modern Egypt and western Asia and are still eaten by people living there. The leaves of the ordinary garden lettuce are intensely bitter when bleached. This is also true of the common dandelion. Others suggest that the bitter herbs were derived from thorns and thistles.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BoxthornEuropean">Boxthorn, European <span class="ital">(Lycium europaeum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Various thorny shrubs, some species of which bear purplish flowers and brightly colored berries. The reference in <a href="?bref=Judg.9.14-15">Judges 9:14-15</a> is thought to be to the European boxthorn or desert-thorn. It is a thorny shrub 6 to 12 feet (1.8 to 3.7 meters) tall with clustered leaves and small violet flowers eventually producing small globular red berries. It is native to and common throughout the Holy Land, especially in the region from Lebanon to the Dead Sea.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BoxTree">Box Tree <span class="ital">(Buxus longifolia)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The long-leaved box tree is a hardy evergreen tree found in the mountainous regions of the northern part of the Holy Land, the Galilean hills, and Lebanon. It grows to a height of about 20 feet (6.1 meters) with a slender trunk seldom more than six to eight inches (15.2 to 20.3 centimeters) in diameter. Its wood is very hard and takes a fine polish. It was cultivated by the Romans for its hard wood, which they inlaid with ivory for cabinets and jewel caskets. Scriptural references include <a href="?bref=Isa.41.19">Isaiah 41:19</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">60:13</a>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Broom">Broom <span class="ital">(Retama raetam)</span></p>
<p class="fl">A shrub native to Eurasia. The word translated “juniper” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> has nothing to do with the true junipers but refers rather to a species of broom, known as the white broom <span class="ital">(Retama raetam).</span> Its branches are longer and flexible, forming an erect, dense bush 3 to 12 feet (.9 to 3.7 meters) tall. The leaves are small and sparse, yet it forms an agreeable shade in a desert region. The white pealike flowers are sweet and very fragrant and are borne in clusters along the twigs. It is a beautiful shrub that grows in the desert regions of Palestine, Syria, and Persia. In many desert areas it is the only bush that affords any shade (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.4-5">1 Kgs 19:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>The “juniper roots” of <a href="?bref=Job.30.4">Job 30:4</a> are not the roots of either the juniper or white broom. The roots of the latter are very nauseating and could not be eaten in the manner described by Job. Job’s “juniper roots” were probably an edible parasitic plant <span class="ital">(Cynomorium coccineum).</span> This plant grows in salt marshes and maritime sands. It is frequently eaten in times of food scarcity and at one time was highly prized for its supposed medicinal value in the treatment of dysentery.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Buckthorn">Buckthorn <span class="ital">(Rhamnus palaestina)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The Palestinian buckthorn is a shrub or small tree attaining a height of three to six feet (.9 to 1.8 meters) with velvety, thorny branches, evergreen leaves, and clusters of small flowers blooming in March or April. It grows in thickets and on hillsides from Syria and Lebanon through the Holy Land to Arabia and the Sinai.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Bush">Bush <span class="ital">(Acacia nilotica, Loranthus acaciae)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Low, branching, woody plant, usually smaller than a tree. There are differences of opinion in regard to the bush out of which the Lord appeared to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.2-4">Ex 3:2-4</a>). From the biblical account, it seems most likely that the event was a miraculous one. However, some seek a natural explanation and believe that the burning bush may have been the crimson-flowered mistletoe or acacia strap flower <span class="ital">(Loranthus acaciae),</span> which grows in great profusion as a partial parasite on the various acacia shrubs, such as the thorny acacia <span class="ital">(Acacia nilotica),</span> in the Holy Land and Sinai. When in full bloom, the mistletoe imparts to the shrub or tree the appearance of being on fire because its brilliant flame-colored blossoms stand out against the green foliage and yellow flowers of the host plants.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Buttercup">Buttercup <span class="ital">(Ranunculus asiaticus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The Persian buttercup is one of the flowers or grasses of the field (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.28-30">Mt 6:28-30</a>). It is a showy plant blooming in all brilliant colors except blue, with double flowers sometimes measuring two inches (5.1 centimeters) across.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Calamus">Calamus <span class="ital">(Acorus calamus, Andropogon aroma</span><span class="ital">ticus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">A plant, or its aromatic root; any of a variety of tropical Asiatic palms. One of the plants that grew in Solomon’s garden (<a href="?bref=Song.4.14">Sg 4:14</a>). The sweet flag <span class="ital">(Acorus</span> <span class="ital">calamus)</span> and the beardgrass <span class="ital">(Andropogon aromaticus)</span> have been suggested as the plants from which calamus came. The sweet flag is highly aromatic and grows in Europe and Asia, but it is not known in the Holy Land. Indigenous to India, beardgrass is highly odoriferous when bruised and is thought to have furnished the calamus of the Bible. It yields an oil known as ginger-grass oil.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cane">Cane <span class="ital">(Saccharum officinarum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">It is thought that there were two species of sugarcane indigenous to and growing wild in the Holy Land. One of these, <span class="ital">Saccharum sara,</span> is known to be only from Lebanon. The other native species is <span class="ital">S. biflorum,</span> which grows on the banks of ditches and streams from Syria and Lebanon through the Holy Land south to Stony Arabia and the Sinai. This may be the wild cane familiar to the Jews. Most authorities, however, think that the “sweet cane” of <a href="?bref=Isa.43.24">Isaiah 43:24</a> was the true sugarcane <span class="ital">(S. officinarum).</span> This plant is thought to have originated in the tropics of the eastern hemisphere. It has been cultivated by people since time immemorial and is not now known in the wild state anywhere. It is a tall, stout perennial grass, maizelike in aspect with many jointed stems and a large plumelike terminal cluster of flowers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CaperPlant">Caper Plant <span class="ital">(Capparis sincula)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Spiny, trailing shrub of Mediterranean region; the flower bud of this shrub. The word “desire” in <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.5">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a> may actually refer to the caper berry. The common caper or caper berry grows profusely in Syria, Lebanon, the Holy Land, and in the mountain valleys of Sinai. The plant may sometimes grow upright but more generally spreads itself weakly over the ground like a vine, covering rocks, ruins, and old walls like ivy. The young flower buds, pickled in vinegar, were used by the ancients as a condiment for meat. The berries were also used in cooking.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CarobTree">Carob Tree <span class="ital">(Ceratonia siliqua)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Evergreen of the Mediterranean region having edible pods. Scholars generally agree that the pods of the carob or locust tree were the “husks” of Jesus’ parable of the prodigal son (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.16">Lk 15:16</a>). The carob is an attractive evergreen leguminous tree that is very common throughout the Holy Land, Syria, and Egypt. The pods are most abundant in April and May and contain numerous pealike seeds embedded in an agreeably flavored mucilaginous sweetish pulp. The pods are also used abundantly now as they were in antiquity for feeding cattle, horses, and pigs. In time of scarcity, they are used as human food and perhaps even regularly by the very poor. The carob is frequently mentioned in the Talmud as a source of good food for domestic animals. The seeds of the carob were formerly employed as a standard of weight and are the source of the term “carat.” Some commentators suggest that the “locusts” eaten by John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.4">Mt 3:4</a>) were not insects but the fruit of the carob tree.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cassia">Cassia <span class="ital">(Cinnamomum cassia, Saussurea lappa)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Tree of tropical Asia with bark similar but inferior to cinnamon. The “cassia” of <a href="?bref=Exod.30.24">Exodus 30:24</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.19">Ezekiel 27:19</a> is the cassia bark tree, <span class="ital">Cinnamomum cassia.</span> In <a href="?bref=Ps.45.8">Psalm 45:8</a> the reference seems to be to the Indian orris, <span class="ital">Saussurea lappa.</span></p>
<p class="h2" id="CastorOilPlant">Castor Oil Plant <span class="ital">(Ricinus communis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Large plant, native to tropical Africa and Asia, cultivated for ornamental reasons and for extraction of oil from its seeds. The gourd of <a href="?bref=Jon.4.6-7">Jonah 4:6-7</a> was probably the ordinary castor bean. The castor bean is a tender shrub, growing 3 to 12 or more feet (.9 to 3.7 meters) tall with huge leaves that resemble the outstretched human hand. The castor bean plant is found in waste places, especially near water, in both Lebanon and the Holy Land and often is cultivated. In hot climates it becomes treelike and affords a dense shade by the abundance of its huge, umbrella-like leaves. It is known in the Orient for the rapidity of its growth. The oil extracted from the seeds of the castor bean was used by the Jews in ceremonial rites and is mentioned among the five kinds of oil that rabbinical tradition sanctioned for such use. The seeds themselves are poisonous when eaten.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cedar">Cedar <span class="ital">(Cedrus libani)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several coniferous evergreen trees of the genus native to the Old World. With few exceptions, the references to “cedar” are to the well-known cedar of Lebanon. This is a noble tree, the tallest and most massive with which the Israelites were acquainted. It grows quite rapidly, attaining a height of up to 120 feet (36.6 meters) with a trunk diameter of as much as 8 feet (2.4 meters). In Solomon’s day these trees were obviously abundant on the mountains of Lebanon, but now, because of excessive lumbering, they are very rare. The cedar of Lebanon was held in high esteem not only for its vigor, beauty, and age but also for the fragrance and remarkable lasting qualities of the wood. It symbolizes grandeur, might, majesty, dignity, lofty stature, and wide expansion. References in <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.3,22-24">Ezekiel 17:3, 22-24</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.3-18">31:3-18</a> beautifully illustrate how these lofty kings of the forest symbolize and typify worldly strength, power, and glory.</p>

<p class="fl">Two varieties of trees of this genus, native to tropical Asia, with aromatic bark that, when ground, is used as a spice. The cinnamon of <a href="?bref=Exod.30.23">Exodus 30:23</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.7.17">Proverbs 7:17</a>, <a href="?bref=Song.4.14">Song of Songs 4:14</a>, and <a href="?bref=Rev.18.13">Revelation 18:13</a> is undoubtedly <span class="ital">Cinnamomum zeylanicum.</span> The tree is a rather low-growing one, never getting more than 30 feet (9.1 meters) high, with a smooth, ash-colored bark and widespread branches and white flowers. Its shiny, beautifully veined evergreen leaves grow about nine inches (22.9 centimeters) long and two inches (5.1 centimeters) wide.</p>
<p>The Jews always regarded cinnamon as a deliciously fragrant substance and valued it highly as a spice and a perfume. It was one of the principal ingredients used in the manufacture of the precious ointments, or “holy oil,” that Moses was commanded to use in the tabernacle for anointing the sacred vessels and officiating priests. It was undoubtedly very costly and precious.</p>

<p class="fl">Tree native to Asia bearing lemonlike fruit with a thick, fragrant rind. It seldom exceeds a height of 30 feet (9.1 meters) and has hard, dark-colored, durable, fragrant wood that takes a fine polish. The wood was one of the most highly prized woods of the ancients, who employed it extensively for cabinetwork. It was commonly referred to as being worth its weight in gold. The wood, owing to its resinous properties, is slow to decay and remains practically uninjured by insects.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Coriander">Coriander <span class="ital">(Coriandrum sativum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The references in <a href="?bref=Exod.16.31">Exodus 16:31</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Numbers 11:7</a> are clearly to the common coriander plant. The coriander was found quite commonly growing along with grain in cultivated fields throughout the Holy Land. It grows wild in Egypt and was used by the ancients both as condiment and as a medicine. The leaves are quite aromatic and are used in soups and for flavoring puddings, curries, and wines. The coriander is still used today as a spice by the Arabs. In Scripture it is mentioned only in connection with manna, which was said to resemble coriander seeds in size, shape, and color.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cotton">Cotton <span class="ital">(Gossypium herbaceum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of various plants or shrubs of this genus grown in warm climates for the soft white fiber attached to their seeds and the oil from these seeds. The “green” of the <span class="sc">kjv</span> in <a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Esther 1:6</a> is undoubtedly a reference to the Levant cotton <span class="ital">(Gossypium herbaceum)</span> that was cultivated since time immemorial in the Far East. Alexander the Great brought it back from India. It is probable that the Jews became acquainted with cotton during the period of their Persian captivity under King Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cucumber">Cucumber <span class="ital">(Cucumis chate, C. sativus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The cucumber is an annual climbing or trailing vine, the origin of which is unknown. It has been cultivated in all the warm countries of the Old World since prehistoric times. Cucumbers are usually eaten raw; a cucumber and a barley cake or some other kind of bread often constitute a meal. The reference to “a lodge in a garden of cucumbers” (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.8">Is 1:8</a>) refers to the crudely built small house or lodge often set up in Palestinian cucumber fields and vineyards.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cummin">Cummin <span class="ital">(Cuminum cyminum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The references in <a href="?bref=Isa.28.25-27">Isaiah 28:25-27</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Matthew 23:23</a> are clearly to the cummin—a common, annual plant of the carrot family said to be native to Egypt and the region of the eastern Mediterranean. It has long been cultivated for its powerfully aromatic and pungent seeds, which are similar to caraway seeds but larger. They do not have as agreeable a taste as caraway seeds but nevertheless were used extensively as a flavor or spice and sometimes were even mixed with flour in making bread. Cummin was also used medicinally and as a condiment with fish and meats.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cypress">Cypress <span class="ital">(Cupressus sempervirens horizontalis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The cypress is a massive, tall-growing evergreen with scalelike leaves and is widely distributed in the mountainous regions of the Holy Land. On Mt Lebanon and Mt Hermon it grows together with the cedar and oak. Its usual height is 50 to 60 feet (15.2 to 18.3 meters), but it may grow as tall as 80 feet (24.2 meters). It is said to have been used extensively in shipbuilding by the Phoenicians, Cretans, and Greeks. There is general agreement that the “gopher wood” of <a href="?bref=Gen.6.14">Genesis 6:14</a> is cypress because the wood is very durable.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Dandelion">Dandelion <span class="ital">(Taraxacum officinale)</span></p>

<p class="h2" id="DarnelGrass">Darnel Grass <span class="ital">(Lolium temulentum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">It is generally agreed that the “tares” of the <span class="sc">kjv</span> (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.24-30">Mt 13:24-30</a>) are the annual or bearded darnel grass. It is a strong grass closely resembling wheat or rye in appearance. The seeds are much smaller than those of wheat or rye, but it is extremely difficult to distinguish it from wheat or rye in its early stages. If it is not eradicated early but is left until the time of harvest, it is cut down with the wheat and the two are subsequently very difficult to separate. The seeds are poisonous, either due to some chemicals naturally present or because of a fungus that grows within the seeds.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Dill">Dill <span class="ital">(Anethum graveolens)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Dill is a weedy annual plant resembling parsley and fennel, 12 to 20 inches (30.5 to 50.8 centimeters) tall with yellow flowers. The reference in <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Matthew 23:23</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) to anise is probably a reference to dill. This plant is widely cultivated for seeds that are aromatic and carminative.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Ebony">Ebony <span class="ital">(Diospyros ebenaster, D. ebenum, D. mela</span><span class="ital">noxylon)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Chiefly tropical tree of southern Asia with hard, dark-colored heartwood. Ebony comes from the date plum or date tree <span class="ital">(Diospyros ebenaster</span> and <span class="ital">D. melanoxylon)</span> of India and is quite different from the date palm. It was sent by Phoenician ships across the Arabian Sea and up the Red Sea to the market in Tyre, from which it was carried overland by camel caravans. The outer wood of these trees is white and soft, but when old, the interior wood becomes hard, black, heavy, and durable and still constitutes most of the costly ebony of commerce. Ebony takes on a fine polish and is highly valued for cabinetwork, for turnery, for the manufacture of fancy ornamental articles and instruments, and as a veneer for other woods.</p>
<p>Ezekiel mentions ivory and ebony together (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.15">Ez 27:15</a>). Ebony was and still is frequently inlaid with ivory, with which it contrasts so strikingly in color.</p>

<p class="h2" id="FigFigTree">Fig, Fig Tree <span class="ital">(Ficus carica)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several trees or shrubs of this genus, native to the Mediterranean region; its edible fruit. The common fig, mentioned some 60 times in the Bible, is one of the most important Bible plants. Its leaves are spoken of first in <a href="?bref=Gen.3.7">Genesis 3:7</a>. The fig is generally regarded as native to southwestern Asia and Syria, but already in early times it was also cultivated extensively in Egypt and the Holy Land, where it was one of the principal foods. <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.18">First Samuel 25:18</a> states that a part of the gift sent by Abigail to David consisted of 200 cakes of figs.</p>
<p>The fig tree has a very peculiar type of fruit called a syconium, which is actually a very much enlarged and fleshy receptacle. It is pollinated by a wasp, without which it cannot get its fruit; this was discovered when it was first transplanted to California.</p>
<p>The fig puts out its earliest fruit buds before its leaves, the former in February and the latter in April or May. When the leaves are out, the fruit ought to be ripe (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.19">Mt 21:19</a>).</p>
<p>Whenever the prophets of old berated the people for their wickedness, they often threatened that the vine and the fig crops would be destroyed. And when they held out the promise of great rewards, they said that the vine and fig crop would be restored (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.13">Jer 8:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.12">Hos 2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.7,12">Jl 1:7, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.4">Mi 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.10">Zec 3:10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="FirTree">Fir Tree <span class="ital">(Abies cilicica)</span></p>
<p class="fl">This a generic term for various evergreen trees having flat needles and erect cones. In all probability, most of the references in Scripture to the fir are references to the pine, cypress, or juniper. The only true fir in the Holy Land grows in the higher parts of Lebanon and the mountains northward. It attains a height of 30 to 75 feet (9.1 to 22.9 meters) and is widely cultivated.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Flax">Flax <span class="ital">(Linum usitatissimum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several plants of this genus, one particularly being widely cultivated for the linseed oil from its seeds and the fine textile fibers from its stems. Flax is the oldest known of the textile fibers. Cotton is identified only once in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>). There is no mention of any other fiber plant being cultivated in Egypt or the Holy Land in biblical days, and for that reason it is thought that linen was the material out of which clothes other than woolen ones were made. Linen was also used for domestic purposes such as towels (<a href="?bref=John.13.4-5">Jn 13:4-5</a>), napkins (<a href="?bref=John.11.44">11:44</a>), girdles and undergarments (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.23">Is 3:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.51">Mk 14:51</a>), nets (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.8-9">Is 19:8-9</a>), and measuring lines (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.3">Ez 40:3</a>). The priests serving in the temple were to wear nothing but linen clothes; a mixed cloth of wool and flax together was strictly forbidden to the Jews (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.19">Lv 19:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.11">Dt 22:11</a>).</p>
<p>At least three kinds of linen were used in biblical times, and apparently there were particular uses for each kind. Ordinary linen of coarsest texture is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Lev.6.10">Leviticus 6:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.9.2">Ezekiel 9:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Dan.10.5">Daniel 10:5</a>, and <a href="?bref=Rev.15.6">Revelation 15:6</a>. The second type of linen of superior quality is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Exod.26.1">Exodus 26:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.39.27">39:27</a>. A third type of linen of finest texture and high cost is mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.27">1 Chronicles 15:27</a>, <a href="?bref=Esth.8.15">Esther 8:15,</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.19.8">Revelation 19:8</a>.</p>
<p>The common flax plant grows from one to four feet (.3 to 1.2 meters) tall with a simple, slender, wirelike stem and numerous small, pale, lancelike green leaves. The failure of the flax crop is listed as one of God’s punishments (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.9">Hos 2:9</a>). The manufacture of linen from flax fibers was a domestic industry of Jewish women (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.13,19">Prv 31:13, 19</a>), ranging from ordinary clothing to the robes and aprons worn by the priest and temple attendants. Linen was also used for wicks in lamps (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.3">Is 42:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Frankincense">Frankincense <span class="ital">(Boswellia)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Aromatic genus resin used chiefly as incense. Frankincense is obtained from three species of a single genus of plants that grow in southern Arabia, Ethiopia, Somaliland, India, and the East Indies. The trees are large in size, related to the turpentine or terebinth tree and to those that produce balsam and myrrh. The gum has a bitter taste and gives off a strong odor in the form of a volatile oil when warmed or burned. It is obtained by successive incisions in the bark of the trunk and in the branches of living trees. It is thought that the Hebrews imported all their frankincense from Arabia, especially from the region about Sheba.</p>
<p>Frankincense is mentioned 21 times in the Bible (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.30.34">Ex 30:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.29">1 Chr 9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.9">Neh 13:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.3.6">Sg 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.6,14">4:6, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.2.11">Mt 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.13">Rv 18:13</a>) and was probably employed almost exclusively in the sacrificial services of the tabernacle and temple until the time of Solomon. It has always been the most important incense resin in the world.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Galbanum">Galbanum <span class="ital">(Ferula galbaniflua)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Galbanum is a malodorous yellowish or brownish gum resin containing the chemical substance umbelliferone, obtained from several species of plants related to the fennel, native to Syria and Persia. The gum is a natural exudation of the stem or is obtained by making a transverse incision in the young stem a few inches above the ground. The milky juice soon hardens and forms one of the kinds of commercial galbanum. Its odor is strongly balsamic, pungent, and disagreeable when burned. Galbanum was one of the ingredients used to form the “holy incense” (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.34">Ex 30:34</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="GourdWild">Gourd, Wild <span class="ital">(Citrullus colocynthis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">There has been considerable difference of opinion regarding the meaning of the words translated “wild gourds” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.39">2 Kgs 4:39</a>) or “gall” (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.18">Dt 29:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.32">32:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.21">Ps 69:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.14">Jer 8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.15">23:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.3.5,19">Lam 3:5, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.12">Am 6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.34">Mt 27:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.23">Acts 8:23</a>). Most scholars today believe the plant referred to was the colocynth, a cucumber-like vine that trails on the ground or climbs over shrubs and fences. The fruit contains a soft spongy pulp, which is intensely bitter, strongly cathartic, and sometimes poisonous.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Hedge">Hedge <span class="ital">(Rhamnus palaestina, Balanites aegyptiaca, Lycium europaeum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Row of closely planted shrubs or low-growing trees forming a fence or boundary. A number of plants were used to provide hedges in Bible times. One of these was the Palestine buckthorn, <span class="ital">Rhamnus palaestina.</span> This plant is a shrub or a small tree growing from three to six feet (.9 to 1.8 meters) tall with velvety, thorny branches, evergreen leaves, and clusters of small flowers blooming in March and April. It grows in thickets and on hillsides from Syria through the Holy Land to Arabia and the Sinai. The Jericho balsam <span class="ital">(Balanites aegyptiaca)</span> and the European boxthorn <span class="ital">(Lycium europaeum)</span> are also prickly shrubs widely used as hedges in the Holy Land and may be the plants referred to in <a href="?bref=Pr.15.19">Proverbs 15:19</a> and <a href="?bref=Hos.2.6">Hosea 2:6</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Henna">Henna <span class="ital">(Lawsonia inermis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Tree or shrub of Asia and northern Africa with fragrant reddish or white flowers and leaves from which a reddish dye is made. The plant referred to in <a href="?bref=Song.1.14">Song of Songs 1:14</a> and <a href="?bref=Song.4.13">4:13</a> and translated as “camphire” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is thought by scholars today to refer to the henna plant. It is a native of northern India and grows wild in the Sudan, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, and the Holy Land. It grows from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 meters) tall, and its scent is similar to that of roses.</p>
<p>Henna leaves are dried, crushed into a powder, mixed with water, and made into a paste that has been used since time immemorial as a cosmetic. A number of mummies have been found decorated with henna. Henna was used to provide a bright yellow, orange, or red color to the fingernails, toenails, the tips of the fingers, the palms of the hand, and the soles of the feet of young girls. Men also used it for coloring their beards and the manes and tails of horses. The dye had to be renewed once every two or three weeks. This use of henna as a cosmetic was common in Egypt at the time the children of Israel were there as slaves; they were undoubtedly familiar with it.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Hyacinth">Hyacinth <span class="ital">(Hyacinthus orientalis)</span></p>

<p class="h2" id="Hyssop">Hyssop <span class="ital">(Origanum maru)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Woody plant native to Asia with spikes of small blue flowers and aromatic leaves used as a condiment and in perfumery. There is little agreement among botanists as to the exact identity of the biblical “hyssop.” Some have suggested <span class="ital">Hyssopus offici</span><span class="ital">nalis,</span> the well-known garden herb now called hyssop. However, this plant is not native either to the Holy Land or Egypt, being found only in southern Europe. Moreover, it does not fit the requirements of the biblical plant.</p>
<p>The “hyssop” of the OT is likely the Syrian or Egyptian marjoram <span class="ital">(Origanum maru).</span> It is referred to in <a href="?bref=Exod.12.22">Exodus 12:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.14.4-6,52">Leviticus 14:4-6, 52</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.19.6,18">Numbers 19:6, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.33">1 Kings 4:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.7">Psalm 51:7</a>; and <a href="?bref=Heb.9.19">Hebrews 9:19</a>. The marjorams are mints growing (under favorable conditions) about two or three feet (.6 to .9 meter) tall, but more often are dwarfed when growing in rock crevices and walls (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.33">1 Kgs 4:33</a>). An aromatic substance is obtained from the crushed and dried leaves. If gathered together in a bunch with leaves and flowers, the hairy stems of the marjoram would hold liquid very well and would make an excellent sprinkler.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Hyssop"/>
<p>The hyssop of the crucifixion passage in the NT (<a href="?bref=John.19.29">Jn 19:29</a>) is probably the sorghum, a tall cereal plant grown primarily for food but also used for brushes and mops.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Juniper">Juniper <span class="ital">(Juniperus)</span></p>

The Phoenician juniper, <span class="ital">Juniperus phoenicia,</span> is found in the hills and rocky places of Arabia. The savin juniper, <span class="ital">J. sabina,</span> is common throughout the deserts, plains, and rocky places of Syria and Palestine. These references are to the brown-berried cedar, or sharp cedar.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LaurelorSweetBay">Laurel or Sweet Bay <span class="ital">(Laurus nobilis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. While the reference in <a href="?bref=Ps.37.35">Psalm 37:35</a> may be to the cedar of Lebanon, most scholars refer the “green bay tree” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) of the psalmist to the sweet bay, a native of the Holy Land, inhabiting thickets and woods from the coast to the middle montane zone. It is an evergreen tree attaining a height from 40 to 60 feet (12.2 to 18.3 meters).</p>
<p>Even though the tree is abundant on Mt Carmel and around Hebron, it is generally not common in the Holy Land. Its leaves are still used as a condiment, and its fruit, leaves, and bark have long been used in medicine.</p>

<p class="fl">Any of various plants of the genus <span class="ital">Lilium</span> having large, variously colored, trumpet-shaped flowers; and related plants. The lily is one of the most famous of all the plants in the Bible, but it is also one about which there has been considerable difference of opinion. It seems probable that several kinds of plants, perhaps five or six, are called lilies in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. Most authorities regard the Palestine anemone or wind flower, <span class="ital">Anemone coronaria,</span> as the “lily of the field” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.28">Mt 6:28</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) that surpassed Solomon in all his glory. These flowers are found in every part of the Holy Land in profusion; the most common forms are scarlet or yellow, but the Palestine anemone may also be blue, purple, rose, or white in color. The flower attains a diameter of two and three-quarter inches (7 centimeters).</p>
<p>An alternative suggestion is the Palestinian chamomile, <span class="ital">Anthemis palaestina,</span> a common, white, daisylike plant. The chamomile is gathered like dry grass and thrown into the furnace when it dries up.</p>
<p>Another proposed plant is <span class="ital">Lilium chalcedonicum,</span> the scarlet or Martagon lily. The statement in <a href="?bref=Song.5.13">Song of Songs 5:13</a>—“his lips like lilies”—would better fit this plant than the Palestine anemone. The reference is apparently to a rare plant of exceptional beauty. The scarlet lily is rare in the Holy Land; indeed, some botanists doubt that it lives there.</p>
<p>The references in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.19,22,26">1 Kings 7:19, 22, 26</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.5">2 Chronicles 4:5</a> are probably to the water lily, <span class="ital">Nymphaea alba,</span> which served as the pattern. The water lily is quite common in Europe and also in the Holy Land and northern Africa.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LotusBush">Lotus Bush <span class="ital">(Zizyphus lotus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The “shady trees” of <a href="?bref=Job.40.21-22">Job 40:21-22</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>; cf. <span class="sc">nlt</span> “lotus plants”) may refer to the lotus bush of the Middle East, <span class="ital">Zizyphus lotus,</span> a shrub or low tree that grows to a height of about five feet (1.5 meters) with smooth, zigzag, whitish branches.</p>
<p>Other commentators believe that the shady trees of Job are large-leafed trees such as the plane tree, <span class="ital">Platanus orientalis,</span> or the oleander, <span class="ital">Nerium oleander.</span> This suggestion is based on the assumption that the animal described in <a href="?bref=Job.40.1-24">Job 40</a> is the hippopotamus, and it seems unlikely that the hippopotamus would live under a lotus bush or even be found in places where this shrub grows. These individuals regard the plane tree or the oleander as more likely.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mallow">Mallow <span class="ital">(Atriplex)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew word used in <a href="?bref=Job.30.4">Job 30:4</a> implies saltiness, and for this reason botanists believe that it refers to one of the species of the saltwort or orach. Twenty-one species of saltwort occur in the Holy Land, almost all of which are common and could well meet the requirements of the text. <span class="ital">Atriplex halimus</span> is the species usually suggested, a strong-growing bushy shrub related to the spinach.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mandrake">Mandrake <span class="ital">(Mandragora officinarum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The mandrake or love apple is a stemless herbaceous perennial related to the nightshade, potato, and tomato. It has a large, beetlike, often forked taproot from the top of which arise many dark leaves about a foot (30.5 centimeters) long and four inches (10.2 centimeters) wide. The plant is slightly poisonous, and the thick taproots have some resemblance in shape to the lower parts of the human body. For this reason certain aphrodisiac properties were ascribed to it (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.30.14-16">Gn 30:14-16</a>).</p>
<p>The love apple was a common plant in deserted fields throughout the Holy Land. It is native to the entire Mediterranean region, southern Europe, and Asia Minor. The mandrake is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Song.7.13">Song of Songs 7:13</a>, though some scholars believe the writer may actually have been referring to the citron or to the common edible field mushroom, <span class="ital">Agaricus campestris.</span></p>

The melons of <a href="?bref=Num.11.5">Numbers 11:5</a> may be either the muskmelon <span class="ital">(Cucumis melo)</span> or the watermelon <span class="ital">(Citrullus vulgaris).</span> It may be that both fruits are referred to.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Melon"/>
<p class="h2" id="Millet">Millet <span class="ital">(Panicum miliaceum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">A grass grown in Eurasia for its edible seed. Millet seeds are the smallest of all the grass seeds cultivated as food but are produced profusely. Millet is an annual grass seldom more that two feet (.6 meter) tall. The small seeds of the millet are used on cakes and eaten uncooked by the poor of the land.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mint">Mint <span class="ital">(Mentha)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of various plants of this family with aromatic foliage that is processed for flavoring. Quite a few mints are common in the Holy Land, but the horse mint <span class="ital">(Mentha longifolia)</span> is probably the one referred to in <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Matthew 23:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.11.42">Luke 11:42</a>. Mints were employed by the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans for flavoring, as a carminative in medicine, and as a condiment in cooking.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mulberry">Mulberry <span class="ital">(Morus nigra)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any tree of this family, some bearing dark-purple fruit and one bearing white fruit, having leaves used as food for silkworms. The sycamine tree of <a href="?bref=Luke.17.6">Luke 17:6</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is evidently the black mulberry, <span class="ital">Morus nigra.</span> It is a low-growing, thick-crowned, stiff-branched tree standing from 24 to 35 feet (7.3 to 10.7 meters) tall, though rarely more than 30 feet (9.1 meters) tall. Originally native to northern Persia, it is now cultivated throughout the Middle East for its fruit. The Chinese or Indian species, <span class="ital">M. alba,</span> was until recently widely cultivated in Syria and the Holy Land but is not indigenous.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mustard">Mustard <span class="ital">(Brassica nigra, B. arvensis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Various plants of this genus are native to Eurasia, some of which are cultivated for their edible seeds. While there is disagreement about the identity of the “mustard” of <a href="?bref=Matt.13.31-32">Matthew 13:31-32</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.17.20">17:20</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.4.31">Mark 4:31</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.13.19">Luke 13:19</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.17.6">17:6</a>, it is generally thought to be the ordinary black mustard, <span class="ital">Brassica nigra.</span></p>
<p>The mustard Jesus referred to may be the charlock or wild mustard, <span class="ital">B. arvensis,</span> which normally grows from one to three feet (.3 to .9 meter) tall. Some have suggested that it was actually <span class="ital">Salvadora persica,</span> found in thickets around the Dead Sea. The plant has a pleasant aromatic taste resembling that of mustard, and if taken in considerable quantity, it will produce an irritation of the nose and eyes similar to that of mustard. However, this plant does not grow as far north as Galilee, and the fruits are rather large and stony, thus hardly fitting the description of the parable.</p>
<p>While the seeds of the mustard are not the smallest known, they were probably the smallest familiar to the common people who comprised Jesus’ audience in Galilee.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Myrrh">Myrrh <span class="ital">(Commiphora myrrha, C. kataf)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Shrub or tree exuding an aromatic gum resin used in perfume and incense. Most of the references in Scripture to myrrh are to <span class="ital">Commiphora myrrha,</span> although <span class="ital">C. kataf</span> may also be involved since it grows in the same region and is similar. The two trees are native to Arabia, Ethiopia, and the Somali coast of east Africa. They yield a gummy exudation that constitutes most of the myrrh of commerce. Both species are low, scrubby, thick- and stiff-branched thorny shrubs or small trees that grow in rocky places, especially on limestone hills. In the East it is highly regarded as an aromatic substance, perfume, and medicine. The ancient Egyptians burned it in their temples and embalmed their dead with it; the Jews also used it for embalming (<a href="?bref=John.19.39">Jn 19:39</a>). The Hebrews held it in high regard as a perfume (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.8">Ps 45:8</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Myrrh"/>
<p class="h2" id="Myrtle">Myrtle <span class="ital">(Myrtus communis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The myrtle tree is common in the Holy Land, especially around Bethlehem, Lebanon, Hebron, and the slopes of Mt Carmel and Mt Tabor. It is native to western Asia and in good environments grows into a small evergreen tree 20 to 30 feet (6.2 to 9.1 meters) tall. More often, however, it is a straggling bush 1½ to 4 feet (.5 to 1.2 meters) tall.</p>
<p>In the Bible, myrtle is referred to chiefly as a symbol of God’s generosity. Branches of myrtle trees were included among those that Nehemiah ordered to be gathered for the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.15">Neh 8:15</a>). The myrtle was symbolic not only of peace but also of justice.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Myrtle"/>
<p class="h2" id="Narcissus">Narcissus <span class="ital">(Narcissus tazetta)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Widely cultivated plant of this family with narrow leaves and usually white or yellow flowers with a cup-crown or trumpet-shaped crown. The polyanthus narcissus <span class="ital">(Narcissus tazetta)</span> appears to be the plant referred to in <a href="?bref=Isa.35.1">Isaiah 35:1</a>. This narcissus grows abundantly on the plains of Sharon and elsewhere in Palestine. Being sweet-smelling, it is a great favorite.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Nard">Nard <span class="ital">(Nardostachys jatamansi)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The nard is a perennial herb with strong, pleasantly scented roots. It is native to high altitudes in the Himalayas, and its range extends from there into western Asia. The roots and spikelike wooly young stems are dried before the leaves unfold and are used for making perfume. It is still used in India as a perfume for the hair, and there is every reason to believe that the spikenard of Scripture (<a href="?bref=Song.1.12">Sg 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.13-14">4:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3">Mk 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.3">Jn 12:3</a>) came originally from India.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Nettle">Nettle <span class="ital">(Urtica)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Plant of this genus having toothed leaves covered with hairs that exude a stinging flush. Four species of nettle are found in the Holy Land: the common or great nettle, <span class="ital">Urtica dioica;</span> the Roman nettle, <span class="ital">U. pilulifera;</span> the small nettle, <span class="ital">U. urens;</span> and <span class="ital">U. caudata,</span> which is similar to the small nettle. Some nettles attain a height of five to six feet (1.5 to 1.8 meters). They are common pests of waste places and fields. They are often seen occupying ground that was once cultivated but has since been neglected (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.13">Is 34:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.6">Hos 9:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="NutmegFlower">Nutmeg Flower <span class="ital">(Nigella sativa)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The “fitches” of <a href="?bref=Isa.28.25-27">Isaiah 28:25-27</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) are probably the nutmeg flower, an annual plant of the buttercup family. The plant grows wild in southern Europe, Syria, Egypt, north Africa, and other Mediterranean lands, where it is extensively cultivated for its strongly pungent, pepperlike aromatic seeds. These are sprinkled over some kinds of bread and cakes in the East and are used for flavoring curries and other dishes in the Holy Land and Egypt. Cummin and nutmeg flowers are still gathered in the Holy Land in the same way described by Isaiah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Oak">Oak <span class="ital">(Quercus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">At least five species of oaks are found in Palestine. One of these is the kermes oak <span class="ital">(Quercus coccifera),</span> the host of the insect <span class="ital">Coccus ilicis,</span> which produces the scarlet dye used in coloring linen and wool (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.28-30">Gn 38:28-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.25.4">Ex 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.26.1">26:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.28.33">28:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.23">35:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.39.24">39:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.14.4-6,51-52">Lv 14:4-6, 51-52</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.19.6">Nm 19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.7,14">2 Chr 2:7, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.14">3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.19">Heb 9:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.12">Rv 18:12</a>). The kermes oak grows from 6 to 35 feet (1.8 to 10.7 meters) tall and is found in the mountainous regions of Syria, Lebanon, and the Holy Land. When it grows alone, the kermes oak often becomes a large tree. It was regularly planted by tombs in the East. The oak was always respected and even venerated in biblical times for its large size and strength, and great men were usually buried in its shade. Abraham’s oak in Hebron is an example.</p>
<p>A second oak is the valonia oak <span class="ital">(Q. aegilops),</span> perhaps the oak of <a href="?bref=Isa.2.13">Isaiah 2:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.44.14">44:14</a>. It is common in the middle montane zones and probably was abundant in the area around Bashan. The oak of <a href="?bref=Gen.35.4,8">Genesis 35:4, 8</a> is thought to have been the holm oak <span class="ital">(Q. ilex),</span> an evergreen oak that grows to a height of 60 feet (18.3 meters). Still another oak is <span class="ital">Q. lusitanica,</span> the cypress oak, a small deciduous tree seldom more than 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall. The very large acorns of this tree were sometimes eaten.</p>
<p>The word translated “plain” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) in <a href="?bref=Gen.12.6">Genesis 12:6</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">13:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.14.13">14:13</a>, and <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1">18:1</a> should probably be translated “oak.” </p>
<p>The many references to “groves” in the OT, usually in connection with the worship of Baal or other heathen gods (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.13">Ex 34:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.21">Dt 16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.7">Jgs 3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.23">1 Kgs 14:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.19">18:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.16">2 Kgs 17:16</a>—all <span class="sc">kjv</span>), were probably groves of sacred oak trees.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OilTreeOleaster">Oil Tree, Oleaster <span class="ital">(Elaeagnus angustifolia)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Small Eurasian tree with oblong silvery leaves, greenish flowers, and olivelike fruit. There is question as to which tree is referred to when <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.23,31-33">1 Kings 6:23, 31-33</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.28">1 Chronicles 27:28</a> refer to “olive trees.” The same word occurs in <a href="?bref=Isa.41.19">Isaiah 41:19</a> and <a href="?bref=Mic.6.7">Micah 6:7</a>. The plant referred to is probably the narrow-leaved oleaster <span class="ital">(Elaeagnus angustifolia),</span> a small stiff-branched tree or graceful shrub growing from 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters) tall, common in all parts of the Holy Land except in the Jordan Valley. At one time it was particularly common on Mt Tabor and at Hebron and Samaria. The wood is hard and fine-grained and therefore well suited for carving of images and figures. The oil that it yields is a rather inferior type used in medication but not for food; this may be the oil of <a href="?bref=Mic.6.7">Micah 6:7</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Oleander">Oleander <span class="ital">(Nerium oleander)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any poisonous evergreen shrub of this genus growing in warm climates. One of the suggestions for the plants identified as “roses” in various translations (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.24.14">Ecclus 24:14</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) is the oleander. This plant, originally native to the East Indies, has been cultivated throughout the warm regions of the world for centuries. It flourishes in the Holy Land today and forms dense thickets in some parts of the Jordan Valley. It is usually a shrub from 3 to 12 feet (.9 to 3.7 meters) tall. Every part of the plant is dangerously poisonous.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OliveOliveTree">Olive, Olive Tree <span class="ital">(Olea europaea)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Old world semitropical evergreen tree bearing edible fruit. The olive, <span class="ital">Olea europaea,</span> was unquestionably one of the most valuable trees known to the Jews. There are innumerable references to it in Scripture, as well as to olive oil, which was used for anointing. The tree is quite common in the Holy Land, and in many places it is the only tree of any substantial size. The branches of the wild olive are rather stiff and spinescent, and the typical cultivated tree is a multi-branched evergreen, 20 or more feet (6.1 meters) tall, with a gnarled trunk and smooth, ash-colored bark. The leaves are leathery and the flowers are small, yellow or white. The fruits are large, black or violet, ripening in September, and it is the outer fleshy parts of the fruit that yield the valuable olive oil of commerce. Thirty-one percent of the ripe fruit is oil. The ripe fruit is eaten raw, as is the green, unripe fruit. The wood of the trunk and limbs is hard, rich yellow or amber in color, and fine-grained, often handsomely variegated. It is still used today for the finest cabinetwork and turnery. The tree grows very slowly, but it attains a great age. It is difficult to kill the olive tree by cutting it down, because new sprouts are sent up from the root and all around the margins of the old stump, often forming a grove of two to five trunks, all from a single root that originally supported only one tree.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Onion">Onion <span class="ital">(Allium)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The onions referred to in <a href="?bref=Num.11.5">Numbers 11:5</a> are undoubtedly <span class="ital">Allium cepa,</span> the Egyptian onion, which is made up of a compact coated bulb formed of layers consisting of broad fleshy bases of closely overlapping leaves. The leaves are slender and hollow. The entire plant has a characteristic pungent taste and odor.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="LeeksAndOnions"/>
<p>Closely related to the onion is the garlic, <span class="ital">A. sativum.</span> The common garlic is a hardy, bulbous perennial plant that is cultivated in Europe, western Asia, and Egypt. The leaves are narrow, flat, and ribbonlike. It is extremely popular with people of the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Still another one of the onions is the leek, <span class="ital">A. porrum.</span> The bulb of the leek differs from that of the onion and garlic in that it is slender, cylindrical, and more than six inches (15.2 centimeters) in length. The flavor resembles that of the onion but is more pungent. The leaves are eaten as a relish or are cooked in soups. The bulbs are cut into small pieces and employed as seasoning for meat.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Palm">Palm <span class="ital">(Phoenix dactylifera)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The palm tree of the Bible is undoubtedly the date palm. At one time it was as characteristic of the Holy Land as it is still today of Egypt. It is characterized by a branchless, tapering stem of up to 80 feet (24.2 meters) or more in height and a large terminal cluster of feathery leaves, each six to nine feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) or more long. Because of its height and unusual structure, it was natural that it should be used as a form of ornamentation in Eastern architecture. The stem and leaves were favorite subjects of architectural embellishment. The immense, branchlike leaves that are referred to as branches in the Bible were symbols of triumph and were used on occasions of great rejoicing (<a href="?bref=John.12.13">Jn 12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.9">Rv 7:9</a>). The large leaves are still used to cover the roofs and sides of houses and to give solidity to reed fences. Mats, baskets, and even dishes are made of them. Small leaves are used as dusters, and the wood of the trunk is used for timber. Rope is made from the weblike integument in the crown. The fruit, borne in an immense drooping cluster, which may weigh from 30 to 50 pounds (13.6 to 22.7 kilograms), is the chief food of many natives of Arabia and north Africa. A single tree may yield up to 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms) of dates a year. They may be dried for future use.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Papyrus">Papyrus <span class="ital">(Cyperus papyrus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The Egyptian bulrush or papyrus (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.3-5">Ex 2:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.8.11">Jb 8:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.18.2">Is 18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.19.6-7">19:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.7">35:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.5">58:5</a>) has smooth three-sided stems ordinarily attaining a height of 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3 meters), but sometimes even 16 feet (4.9 meters), and a thickness of two to three inches (5.1 to 7.6 centimeters) at the base with a large tuft of florets at the end. The papyrus formerly grew in great abundance along the banks of the Nile, forming what was almost a dense jungle. Today it is practically extinct in lower Egypt, although it is still found along the White Nile and in the Sudan. The papyrus still grows in parts of the Holy Land, especially around the north end of the plain of Galilee and the Huleh swamps.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Papyrus"/>
<p>In addition to being used for making small vessels to float in water (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.3">Ex 2:3</a>), for mats, and for various other domestic purposes, it is best known as the source of ancient paper. In manufacturing paper from papyrus, the stems of the plant were first peeled and the pitch then cut longitudinally into thin slices that were laid side by side. These were then sprinkled with water and pressed to unite the whole into one piece. The sheet was then dried and cut into pieces of the required size. In the better grades of papyrus paper, several layers of stem slices were laid crosswise on each other.</p>
<p>The pale, fawn-colored, tassel-like inflorescences at the summit of the stems were used to adorn Egyptian temples and to crown the statues of gods. They were also worn as crowns by famous men and national heroes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PineTree">Pine Tree <span class="ital">(Pinus brutia, P. halepensis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Various evergreen trees of this family with needle-shaped leaves in clusters and seed-bearing cones. While there is considerable confusion concerning the conifers of the Bible, it seems apparent that pines are referred to in such passages as <a href="?bref=Lev.23.40">Leviticus 23:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.8.15">Nehemiah 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.41.19">Isaiah 41:19</a>; and <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">60:13</a>. One of the Holy Land’s pines is the Brutian pine <span class="ital">(Pinus brutia),</span> a mountain-inhabiting species of the northern regions of Palestine. It attains a height of 10 to 35 feet (3 to 10.7 meters) with a rather diffuse growth and branches in whorls.</p>
<p>Another of the pines is the Aleppo pine, <span class="ital">Pinus halepensis.</span> Most of the instances of the occurrence of “fir” or “fir tree” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> probably refer to the Aleppo pine (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sm 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.8,10">1 Kgs 5:8, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.34">6:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.23">2 Kgs 19:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.8">2 Chr 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.17">Ps 104:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.1.17">Sg 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.8">Is 14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.24">37:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.13">55:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">60:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.5">Ez 27:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.8">31:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.8">Hos 14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.2.3">Na 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.11.2">Zec 11:2</a>). It grows from 9 to 60 feet (2.7 to 18.3 meters) tall with diffuse ascending branches and yellowish or brownish branchlets.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Pistachio">Pistachio <span class="ital">(Pistacia terebinthus, P. vera)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The Palestine terebinth or turpentine tree is a large deciduous tree with straggling boughs. In the winter, without its leaves, it looks much like the oak. It grows from 12 to 25 feet (3.7 to 7.6 meters) tall. Every part of the tree contains a fragrant, resinous juice. It is common on the lower slopes of the hills throughout Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Arabia, generally growing as a solitary tree and found mostly in localities too warm or too dry for the oak that it generally replaces. Since it is native to Gilead, it is quite probable that its resinous juice formed part of the spicery that the Israelites carried to Egypt from Gilead (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Gn 37:25</a>).</p>
<p>The nuts of <a href="?bref=Gen.43.11">Genesis 43:11</a> are apparently pistachio nuts from the pistachio tree, <span class="ital">Pistacia vera,</span> closely related to the terebinth. It attains a height of 10 to 30 feet (3 to 9.1 meters) with a spreading top. It is found wild in many rocky parts of Lebanon and the Holy Land. The nut has a light-colored shell and the kernel has a sweet delicate flavor much relished wherever it grows.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PlaneTree">Plane Tree <span class="ital">(Platanus orientalis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several trees of this family with bell-shaped fruit clusters and usually an outer bark that flakes off in patches or strips. The references in <a href="?bref=Gen.30.37">Genesis 30:37</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.8">Ezekiel 31:8</a> are apparently not to the chestnut tree, which is not indigenous to Palestine, but to the oriental plane tree, <span class="ital">Platanus orientalis.</span></p>
<p>The plane tree is a massive tree 60 feet (18.3 meters) or more tall with a trunk often of vast circumference, sometimes as much as 40 feet (12.2 meters). The outer bark peels off in sheets or scales, thus exposing a smooth whitish or yellowish inner bark. The tree is common throughout Lebanon, Syria, and the Holy Land, growing even in subalpine regions. However, it is primarily a tree of the plains and lowlands, growing on the edges of streams and lakes and in marshy places.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Pomegranate">Pomegranate <span class="ital">(Punica granatum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The pomegranate is usually a small, bushlike tree but may occasionally become a large, branching shrub or small tree reaching a height of 20 to 30 feet (6.1 to 9.1 meters). The branches are often thorny. The showy bell-like flowers are usually scarlet, though sometimes yellow or white. The globular fruit is as large as an orange or medium-size apple. It has a hard rind of a bright red or yellowish color when ripe and is surmounted by the dry sepals that resemble a crown. The fruit itself is a crimson juicy pulp in which many red seeds are imbedded. The flowers of the pomegranate undoubtedly served as a pattern for the golden bells referred to in <a href="?bref=Exod.28.33-34">Exodus 28:33-34</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.39.24-26">39:24-26</a>, and the open flowers of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.32">1 Kings 6:32</a>. The erect calyx lobes on the fruit served as a model for crowns of kings.</p>
<p>The pomegranate is native to Asia, but it has been cultivated since prehistoric times and is now quite common in the Holy Land, in Egypt, and along the shores of the Mediterranean. It is listed as one of the pleasant fruits of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Num.20.5">Nm 20:5</a>) and one of the promised blessings of the Holy Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.8">Dt 8:8</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Poplar">Poplar <span class="ital">(Populus euphratica, P. alba)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Fast-growing deciduous tree of the same genus as the aspen and cottonwood. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> references in <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.23-24">2 Samuel 5:23-24</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.14-15">1 Chronicles 14:14-15</a> to mulberry trees are more probably to the Euphrates poplar or aspen, <span class="ital">Populus euphratica.</span> This tree grows to a height of 30 to 45 feet (9.1 to 13.7 meters) with spreading branches. The Euphrates aspen is found only on rivers and stream banks throughout the area from Syria through the Holy Land to Stony Arabia. It is especially common in the Jordan Valley.</p>
<p>The white poplar <span class="ital">(Populus alba)</span> is common in wet places in Syria, Lebanon, the Holy Land, and Sinai. It attains a height of 30 to 60 feet (9.1 to 18.3 meters) with spreading branches. Some suggest that the altars of various pagan religions were usually erected on the top of a hill and in the shade of a poplar grove.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Quince">Quince <span class="ital">(Cydonia oblonga)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Tree native to western Asia, having white flowers and applelike fruit that is edible when cooked. Some believe that the “apples” of the OT were quinces, <span class="ital">Cydonia oblonga.</span> The quince tree is quite common in the Holy Land, though chiefly as a cultivated tree. It may occur wild in the northern parts of Syria. It is native to northern Persia and Asia Minor. The fruit is yellowish and highly fragrant, and it is the fragrance that caused it to be held in high regard by the ancients.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Reed">Reed <span class="ital">(Juncus, Scirpus, Typha angustata, Arundo donax)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Numerous species of the rush and bulrush grow in the Holy Land. There are at least 21 varieties of rushes. The common soft rush or bog rush <span class="ital">(Juncus effusus)</span> is found in wet places, even in the Sinai and other deserts. The sea or hard rush <span class="ital">(J. maritimus)</span> is found in damp places throughout the Holy Land and even in Sinai.</p>
<p>At least 15 kinds of bulrushes <span class="ital">(Scirpus)</span> are known in the Holy Land. The cluster-headed club rush <span class="ital">(Scirpus holoschoenus)</span> is common in damp places throughout the Holy Land to the Sinai. The lake club rush or tall bulrush <span class="ital">(S. lacustris)</span> is found in swamps and ditches throughout northern Africa to the Dead Sea. The sea club rush or salt marsh club rush <span class="ital">(S. maritimus)</span> is found in ditches and swamps in many places of the Holy Land. Any of these species may be the one referred to in <a href="?bref=Job.8.11">Job 8:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.9.14">Isaiah 9:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.19.6,15">19:6, 15</a>.</p>
<p>The reference in <a href="?bref=Gen.41.2">Genesis 41:2</a> to the feeding of cattle in the meadow seems to be to the tall reed <span class="ital">(Arundo donax),</span> which grows 18 feet (5.5 meters) or more in height. This plant is also known as the Persian reed and is common throughout the Holy Land, Syria, and the Sinai peninsula. It is a gigantic grass that may have a stem diameter of two or three inches (5.1 to 7.6 centimeters) at the base and is terminated by a plume of white flowers similar to those of the sugarcane or pampas grass. The plant was used for many purposes by the ancients: for walking sticks, fishing rods, measuring rods, and musical pipes. It is, therefore, quite possible that the “reed” of <a href="?bref=Matt.27.48">Matthew 27:48</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.15.36">Mark 15:36</a> was a carpenter’s reed or measuring rod.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Rue">Rue <span class="ital">(Ruta chalepensis, R. graveolens)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Aromatic Eurasian plant with evergreen leaves that yield an acrid, volatile oil once used in medicine. There is little question as to the correctness of the translation of “rue” in <a href="?bref=Luke.11.42">Luke 11:42</a>, but there is some doubt as to the exact species. Most writers think that it was the common rue <span class="ital">(Rue graveolens),</span> a perennial shrubby plant with erect stems two to three feet (.6 to .9 meter) tall and deeply cut leaves. A very strong odor emanates from the foliage. This species is native to the Mediterranean region and grows wild in the Holy Land, especially on Mt Tabor.</p>
<p>Rue was highly thought of by the ancients as a medicinal, supposed to prevent dizziness, dumbness, epilepsy, eye inflammations, insanity, and the “evil eye.” Rue was also used for seasoning dishes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Rush">Rush <span class="ital">(Butomus umbellatus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Generic term for any of various grasslike marsh plants having pliant, hollow, or pithy stems. There is considerable uncertainty about the identification of the plant referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.41.2">Genesis 41:2</a> translated in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> as “meadow,” and in <a href="?bref=Job.8.11">Job 8:11</a> as “flag.” Since it is mentioned along with the papyrus in the Job passage, it seems that it refers to a specific kind of plant rather than to an aggregate of plants in a meadow. From the description in Genesis as being a plant on which Pharaoh’s cattle might feed along the banks of the Nile and yet not the papyrus, it may refer to the flowering rush or water gladiola <span class="ital">(Butomus umbellatus),</span> which flourishes both in Egypt and in the Holy Land, along with the papyrus.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Saffron">Saffron <span class="ital">(Crocus sativus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Saffron, referred to in <a href="?bref=Song.4.14">Song of Songs 4:14</a>, is the product of several species of <span class="ital">Crocus,</span> especially of the blue-flowered saffron crocus <span class="ital">(C. sativus),</span> which is native to Greece and Asia Minor. The commercial product consists of the stigma and upper portions of the style, the top parts of the flower ovary, which are collected shortly after the flower opens. It requires at least 4,000 stigmas to make an ounce of saffron. After being gathered, the stigmas are dried in the sun, pounded, and made into small cakes. Saffron is used principally as a yellow dye and also as a fruit coloring for curries and stews.</p>
<p>Another, entirely different kind of dye-producing plant <span class="ital">(Carthamus tinctorius)</span> called carthamine, bastard saffron, or safflower is a member of the thistle family. Its red florets yield a dye used extensively for coloring silk, in cooking, and for adulterating genuine saffron. It is an annual spiny plant three to four and a half feet (1.4 meters) tall, native to Syria and Egypt. In Egypt the grave clothes of mummies were dyed with this material, and it is quite possible that this plant may also have been the saffron of the Bible.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Sage">Sage <span class="ital">(Salvia judaica)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The Judean sage grows to three feet (.9 meter) tall in the mountains and hills of Palestine. Its stems are four-angled, stiff, and rough. The plant grows from Syria south through Nazareth, Hebron, Tiberius, Samaria, and Judea.</p>
<p>This plant is the origin of the design of the seven-branched lampstand of <a href="?bref=Exod.37.17-18">Exodus 37:17-18</a>, which is known as the menorah, the traditional Jewish symbol. The inflorescence of the plant, when pressed flat, has almost exactly the same shape and form as the seven-branched candlestick, with its central spike and three pairs of side branches each bending upward and inward in a symmetrical fashion. On each branch of the plant’s inflorescence are whorls or buds that perhaps give the idea for the “knops” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “knobs” on the biblical golden candlesticks.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Spelt">Spelt <span class="ital">(Triticum aestivum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Hardy member of the wheat family. The rye of <a href="?bref=Exod.9.32">Exodus 9:32</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.28.25">Isaiah 28:25</a>, as well as the fitches of <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9">Ezekiel 4:9</a> (all <span class="sc">kjv</span>) are thought to be spelt. It is a hard-grained species of wheat with loose ears and grains triangular in cross-section, and was the most common form of wheat in early times. It has a stouter stem than wheat and strong spikes of grain. Bread made of its flour is much inferior to that made from wheat, but spelt will thrive in almost any kind of soil and will yield a crop on land that is unfit for wheat. The ancients preferred it to barley for bread.</p>
<p class="h2" id="StoraxTree">Storax Tree <span class="ital">(Styrax officinalis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Various trees of this genus yielding an aromatic resin. Today it is thought that the stacte of <a href="?bref=Exod.30.34">Exodus 30:34</a> was derived from the storax tree. It is an irregularly stiff-branched shrub or small tree 9 to 20 feet (2.7 to 6.1 meters) tall. This tree is abundant on low hills and rocky places from Lebanon through the Holy Land. Its gum is obtained by making incisions in the stems and branches. It is highly perfumed and is still prized today as a perfume.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Sycamore">Sycamore-fig <span class="ital">(Ficus sycomorus)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Tree of northeastern Africa and adjacent Asia, related to the fig. The word translated “sycamore” in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.27">1 Kings 10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.28">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.1.15">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.27">9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.47">Psalm 78:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.9.10">Isaiah 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.14">Amos 7:14</a>; and <a href="?bref=Luke.19.4">Luke 19:4</a> undoubtedly refers to the well-known sycamore-fig, which is also known as the mulberry-fig or fig-mulberry. It should not be confused with the common sycamore of the North American continent, which is actually a plane tree. The sycamore-fig of the Bible is a strong-growing, robust, wide-spreading tree growing 30 to 40 feet (9.1 to 12.2 meters) tall and sometimes attaining a trunk circumference of 20 feet (6.1 meters) or more with a crown 120 feet (36.6 meters) in diameter. It is a tree that is easily climbed and is frequently planted along roadsides, which accounts for the reference in <a href="?bref=Luke.19.4">Luke 19:4</a>. It produces an abundant amount of fruit in clusters on all parts of the tree, on both young and old branches and even on the trunk itself. It is very similar to the common fig, only smaller and much inferior in quality. In David’s day it was so valuable that he appointed a special overseer for the sycamore trees (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.28">1 Chr 27:28</a>). It is thought that Amos was not a gatherer of sycamore fruit but rather a dresser of sycamore trees.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Tamarisk">Tamarisk <span class="ital">(Tamarix)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The references in <a href="?bref=Gen.21.33">Genesis 21:33</a> and <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.6">1 Samuel 22:6</a> and <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.13">31:13</a> seem to be to the tamarisk. These trees or shrubs are small and fast-growing with a durable wood. They are abundant in deserts, dunes, and salt marshes. <span class="ital">Tamarix aphylla</span> is leafless and has small white flowers. These trees or shrubs often provide a soothing touch of green foliage and a promise of cooling shade to the traveler. Tamarisks are able to survive because they either have small, scalelike leaves, which lose little moisture by transpiration, or no leaves at all. The larger of the tamarisks are valued for their wood in a region where wood is scarce. The wood was used for building and also as a source of an excellent type of charcoal.</p>

<p class="fl">There are 22 different Hebrew and Greek words used in Scripture to refer to spiny or prickly shrubs or weeds, and these are translated as “bramble,” “brier,” “cockle,” “thorn,” and “thistle.” At present, there are about 125 species of thorns and thistles that grow in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The bramble in the allegory of <a href="?bref=Judg.9.14-15">Judges 9:14-15</a> is believed to refer to the European boxthorn or desert-thorn, <span class="ital">Lycium europaeum.</span></p>
<p>The general consensus is that the “briers” of <a href="?bref=Isa.10.17">Isaiah 10:17</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.55.13">55:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Mic.7.4">Micah 7:4</a>, and <a href="?bref=Heb.6.8">Hebrews 6:8</a> are the Palestine nightshade <span class="ital">(Solanum incanum),</span> or “Jericho potato.”</p>
<p>The thistles of <a href="?bref=Gen.3.17-18">Genesis 3:17-18</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.9">2 Kings 14:9</a>, <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.18">2 Chronicles 25:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Hos.10.8">Hosea 10:8</a>, and <a href="?bref=Matt.7.16">Matthew 7:16</a>, as well as the thorns of <a href="?bref=Matt.13.7">Matthew 13:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.6.8">Hebrews 6:8</a>, are thought to be one of the species of the thistle, <span class="ital">Centaurea.</span> Among the more common thistles in the Holy Land are the true star-thistle <span class="ital">(Centaurea calcitrapa),</span> the dwarf centaury <span class="ital">(C. verutum),</span> the Iberian centaury <span class="ital">(C. iberica),</span> and the lady’s thistle <span class="ital">(Silybum marianum).</span> Some thistles attain a height of five to six feet (.9 to 1.8 meters). Thistles are characteristic of an area that is uncultivated and neglected. Many have beautiful flowers, but all are covered with sharp spines.</p>
<p>The references in <a href="?bref=Ezek.2.6">Ezekiel 2:6</a> to “briers” and <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.24">Ezekiel 28:24</a> to a “pricking brier” may be to the prickly butchers-broom or knee-holly, <span class="ital">Ruscus aculeatus.</span> The plant is common in rocky woods in the northern regions of the Holy Land, especially around Mt Tabor and Mt Carmel.</p>
<p>The cockle of <a href="?bref=Job.31.40">Job 31:40</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “weeds”) perhaps refers to the corn cockle, <span class="ital">Agrostemma githago.</span> This plant is common in grainfields throughout the Holy Land. It is a strong-growing and troublesome weed in grainfields, growing from one to three feet (.3 to .9 meter) tall.</p>
<p>Many commentators think that the “thorns” out of which the crown of thorns (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.29">Mt 27:29</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.2">Jn 19:2</a>) was made were from the Christ-thorn <span class="ital">(Paliurus spina-christi).</span> This belief has led to its specific name; the Christ-thorn is a spiny plant that ordinarily grows as a straggling shrub three to nine feet (.9 to 2.7 meters) tall. The flexible branches are armed at the base of each leaf with a pair of unequal, stiff, sharp spines. The unusual pliable texture of the young branches renders it particularly easy to plait into a crownlike wreath.</p>
<p>The thorns of <a href="?bref=Judg.8.7">Judges 8:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.7.19">Isaiah 7:19</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.9.18">9:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.55.13">55:13</a>, and <a href="?bref=Matt.7.16">Matthew 7:16</a> may refer to the Syrian Christ-thorn <span class="ital">(Zizyphus spina-christi),</span> a shrub or small tree 9 to 15 feet (2.7 to 4.6 meters) tall, sometimes growing into a 40-foot (12.2-meter) tree with smooth white branches bearing a pair of stout, unequal, recurved spines at the back of each leaf.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Tulip">Tulip <span class="ital">(Tulipa montana, T. sharonensis)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several bulbous plants of this family native to Asia. The rose of Sharon in <a href="?bref=Song.2.1">Song of Songs 2:1</a> may be the mountain tulip, <span class="ital">Tulipa montana,</span> or the closely related Sharon tulip, <span class="ital">T. sharonensis.</span> The former is an attractive plant that grows from a bulb and has leaves that are often wavy-margined. The species is common in the mountainous regions of Syria, Lebanon, and the Anti-Lebanon. It is primarily a mountainous species. The Sharon tulip <span class="ital">(T. sharonensis)</span> is found in sandy places on the Sharon coastal plains.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed <span class="ital">(Gundelia tournefortii, Anastatica hierochuntica)</span></p>
<p class="fl">The references in <a href="?bref=Ps.83.13">Psalm 83:13</a> to “whirling dust” and in <a href="?bref=Isa.17.13">Isaiah 17:13</a> to “wheel” or “rolling thing” (<span class="sc">niv</span> “tumbleweed”) seem to be to the Palestinian tumbleweed <span class="ital">(Gundelia tournefortii),</span> a member of the thistle family. It is a prickly herb with milky juice. It rolls over the land and gathers in tremendous heaps in hollows.</p>

<p class="fl">Scriptural references to vegetables are probably, in most cases, to the dried leguminous seeds of beans and lentils.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Vine">Vine <span class="ital">(Vitis vinifera)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any plant with a flexible stem that climbs, twines, or creeps along a surface or support. The common grapevine <span class="ital">(Vitis vinifera)</span> is mentioned throughout the Bible. The fruitful vine (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.5-10">Ez 17:5-10</a>) and the vine brought out of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Ps.80.8">Ps 80:8</a>) were symbolic of the Jewish people. Jesus compares himself to the true vine, of which his disciples were the branches (<a href="?bref=John.15.1-6">Jn 15:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>The grapevine of the Old World sometimes assumes the characteristics of a tree, with stems up to a foot and a half (45.7 centimeters) in diameter, the branches then being trained on a trellis and bearing bunches of grapes 10 to 12 pounds (4.5 to 5.4 kilograms) in weight, with the individual grapes the size of small plums. Bunches have been produced weighing as much as 26 pounds (11.8 kilograms). The vines of the Holy Land were always renowned both for the luxuriance of their growth and for the immense clusters of grapes they produced. Thus it does not seem improbable that the spies sent to the Promised Land should have employed a pole to transport some of the clusters home (<a href="?bref=Num.13.23-24">Nm 13:23-24</a>).</p>
<p>The wild grape <span class="ital">(Vitis orientalis)</span> is referred to in <a href="?bref=Isa.5.2-4">Isaiah 5:2-4</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.2.21">Jeremiah 2:21</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.15.2-6">Ezekiel 15:2-6</a>. It is known as the native wild fox grape and has small, black, acidic berries about the size of currants with little juice.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Walnut">Walnut <span class="ital">(Juglans regia)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of several trees of this genus having round, sticky fruit enclosing an edible nut. The reference in <a href="?bref=Song.6.11">Song of Songs 6:11</a> to “nuts” is thought to refer to the Persian or common walnut, <span class="ital">Juglans regia.</span> The tree is believed to have been indigenous to northern Persia, but it is actually found wild in many parts of northern India, eastward as far as China, and westward through Persia. At the time of Solomon, it was widely cultivated for its fruit throughout the East. Perhaps Solomon’s garden of nuts was a part of his extensive gardens at Etham, six miles (9.7 kilometers) from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WaterLily">Water Lily <span class="ital">(Nymphaea)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Any of numerous aquatic plants of this genus with floating leaves and showy flowers. The carved lily ornamentation of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.19-26">1 Kings 7:19-26</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.5">2 Chronicles 4:5</a> was probably patterned after the flowers of the water lily. Few flowers can equal the Egyptian lotus or water lily <span class="ital">(Nymphaea lotus)</span> in beauty. It looks very much like a large white rose and at one time floated in profusion on the waters of the Nile.</p>
<p>The common European white water lily <span class="ital">(N. alba)</span> was also familiar to the children of Israel. It grows not only in Europe but also in the Holy Land and North Africa. It is, however, not as common in Egypt as is the white lotus.</p>
<p>Another water lily with which the Israelites were probably familiar is the blue lotus, <span class="ital">N. caerulea.</span> Its leaves are 12 to 16 inches (30.5 to 40.6 centimeters) across and it has light-blue flowers that are three to six inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) in diameter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Wheat">Wheat <span class="ital">(Triticum aestivum, T. compositum)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Various cereal grasses of this family widely cultivated for its edible grain. Five kinds of wheat are native to—and still wild in—the Holy Land, and at least eight others are cultivated there today; probably most, if not all, were known in Bible times. The wild varieties were probably more abundant then than they are today. Among these are the einkorn <span class="ital">(T. monococcum),</span> the thaoudar <span class="ital">(T. thaoudar),</span> and the wild emmer <span class="ital">(T. dicoccoides).</span> The composite wheat <span class="ital">(T. compositum),</span> with its branched spikes, often bearing as many as seven heads per stalk, is definitely referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.41.5-57">Genesis 41:5-57</a>. It is depicted on numerous Egyptian monuments and on inscriptions and is still commonly seen in the Nile Delta, where it is known as “mummy wheat.” It is also cultivated in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The most frequently mentioned wheat of the Bible is undoubtedly the commonly cultivated summer and winter wheat, <span class="ital">Triticum aestivum.</span> It is an abundant annual grass cultivated in Egypt and other Eastern lands since earliest times. The exact place of its origin is unknown. Grains of wheat have been found in the most ancient Egyptian tombs and in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings in Switzerland. It was certainly the chief grain of Mesopotamia in Jacob’s time (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.14">Gn 30:14</a>).</p>
<p>Corn in biblical days often included a mixture of peas, beans, lentils, cummin, barley, millet, and spelt, but wheat was always its main constituent. Egypt was a great grain-producing country, and Abram (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.10">Gn 12:10</a>) and Joseph’s brothers (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.42.1-38">42</a>) naturally turned to Egypt for wheat when famine visited Canaan.</p>
<p>The mills, millstones, granaries, and threshing floors mentioned in the Bible all refer to equipment employed in processing grain to produce flour. The fine flour of which the showbread loaves were made (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.5">Lv 24:5</a>) was unquestionably wheat flour. Wheat intended for home consumption was often stored in the central part of the house; this explains the story told in <a href="?bref=2Sam.4.6">2 Samuel 4:6</a>. It was also sometimes stored in dry wells (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.19">2 Sm 17:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Wormwood">Wormwood <span class="ital">(Artemisia judaica, A. herba-alba)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Wormwood is a general name given to a group of woody plants with a strong aromatic odor. Wormwood plants have a strong, bitter taste, and their young shoots and branch tips furnish the “wormwood” of commerce. Its bitter taste accounts for its being spoken of with gall—as being symbolic of bitter calamity and sorrow (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.4">Prv 5:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.15">Jer 9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.15">23:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.3.15,19">Lam 3:15, 19</a>). <span class="ital">Artemisia herba-alba</span> is the common species of wormwood in the Holy Land today. It is strongly aromatic, smelling like camphor, and bitter. <span class="ital">A. judaica</span> occurs only in the Sinai.</p>
<p>Absinthe is made from species of this group. It first leads to greater activity and pleasant sensations and fills the mind with grandiose ideas (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.15">Lam 3:15</a>). The habitual use of it, however, brings on a stupor and gradual diminution of intellectual faculties, ending in delirium and even death. Perhaps the hemlock of <a href="?bref=Amos.6.12">Amos 6:12</a> was wormwood.</p>

<p class="fl">The OT contains all that we know of the poetry of Israel, and what we have occupies an important place in that literature. It was presumably well known throughout the ancient Near East, for its fame had spread even to Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ps.137.3">Ps 137:3</a>). Much of the OT is poetic in spirit and structure—a feature of the prophetic writings as well as the poetic literature. In the former are found passages of elevated poetry, studded with brilliant gems of imagery. The movement is rhythmical, with meter, parallelism, and strophic arrangement, as in the poetry books.</p>
<p>The English Revised Version of the Bible (1881) first rendered a great service to English readers by printing OT poetry in parallel lines. Where this is not done in the prophetic literature, the poetic quality of these books is obscured. Note that besides the OT books recognized as poetry—the Psalms, Job, Lamentations, Song of Songs, and Proverbs—Ecclesiastes and the Prophets consist of prose and poetry. The historical books also contain fine examples of poetry.</p>
<p>The Hebrew language was an ideal instrument for expressing poetic speech. Its simplicity of form combined intensity of feeling and pictorial power and allowed great play of imagination. Figures, metaphors, and hyperboles are extremely common. In its powerful imagery the genius of Hebrew poetry comes to its finest expression.</p>
<p>The normal unit of Hebrew verse is the couplet of two parallel lines. But this is not the only grouping of lines in Hebrew poetry. Units of three (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.1">Pss 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.5.11">5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-2">45:1-2</a>), four (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.3">Pss 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.55.21">55:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.15-16">Prv 27:15-16</a>), five (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.6-7">Ps 6:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.24.23-25">Prv 24:23-25</a>), six (<a href="?bref=Ps.99.1-3">Ps 99:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.21-23">Prv 30:21-23</a>), and even larger combinations of parallel lines occur.</p>
<p>As far as can be determined, meter is absent from biblical poetry. Certainly there is little concern for the careful meter that marks classic Greek and Latin, as well as much of English, poetry. The only exception is found in wailing songs or laments (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.18-20">Jer 9:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.1.1-4.22">Lam 1–4</a>). This is called the lamentation meter, where the verse is in two parts. Rhyme also is so rare as to be almost nonexistent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Hebrew poetry is rhythmical—one of its distinguishing features. Its rhythm recurs with stressed and unstressed syllables in relatively regular succession. There are usually three or four accents or beats to a line, but the rhythmic unit is not uniform. Rhythm in Hebrew poetry, however, is not confined to the balance of accents or beats in a line. The meaning of the words and their position in the line are also significant—a feature called parallelism. This distinguishing characteristic was first clearly recognized by Dr. Robert Lowth, who in 1753 developed the principle of parallelism.</p>
<p>He distinguished three types. The first is <span class="ital">synonymous parallelism,</span> where the thought expressed in the first part of the verse is repeated in the second part, in different but equivalent terms (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.4">Pss 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">19:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.36.1-2">36:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.11-12">103:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.13-18">Prv 3:13-18</a>). The second is <span class="ital">antithetic parallelism,</span> where the thought in the first part of the verse is contrasted with its opposite in the second (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.6">Ps 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.1-4,16-18">Prv 10:1-4, 16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.13.9">13:9</a>). The third is <span class="ital">synthetic parallelism,</span> where the idea expressed in the first line of a verse is developed and completed in the following lines (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.1">Pss 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.3.5-6">3:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.8-10">18:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.26.3">Prv 26:3</a>). There are more complicated forms of parallelism, but these three are the most common.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of biblical poetry is the use of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Psalms in which verses are linked together by this means are called acrostic. Today, an acrostic is formed by taking a name and beginning the successive lines of the short poem with the letters that make up the name. The Hebrews took only the alphabet and arranged the lines of the poem according to the succession of the letters.</p>
<p>Each line of a psalm may begin with a different letter, as in <a href="?bref=Ps.25.1-22">Psalm 25</a>. Or each of the stanzas may begin with the same letter until all 22 letters of the alphabet are exhausted, as in <a href="?bref=Ps.119.1-176">Psalm 119</a>. However, this psalm, which is the most conspicuous example of a Hebrew acrostic poem, is quite complicated in its arrangement. Not only does each stanza begin with a letter, but each of the eight lines of every stanza begins with the same letter, so that eight alphabetic arrangements move through the psalm in parallel lines. Other elaborate acrostics are <a href="?bref=Ps.9.1-20">Psalms 9</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.10.1-18">10</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.37.1-40">37</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.111.1-10">111</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1-10">112</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.145.1-21">145</a>.</p>
<p>The first four chapters of Lamentations also follow an acrostic arrangement. This example of acrostic arrangement is less noticeable to the English reader because the names of the Hebrew letters do not mark the beginning of the stanzas. In <a href="?bref=Lam.3.1-66">Lamentations 3</a> each letter of the alphabet begins three successive lines numbered as verses. Another acrostic occurs in <a href="?bref=Pr.31.10-31">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>. It is an alphabetic description of the virtuous woman.</p>
<p>Another poetic device giving unity to a poem and marking its divisions is the refrain. <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">Psalm 136</a> is an outstanding example of this arrangement. The refrain is “His faithful love endures forever” and is used to conclude every verse.</p>
<p>The meter of Hebraic poetry is dependent on accentuation; the unit is the couplet, in which the members may be of equal or varying length. Couplets are often arranged into strophes. The fundamental category of Hebrew poetry is the song or lyric. The song was accompanied by music (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.27">Gn 31:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.25.6">1 Chr 25:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.23.16">Is 23:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.29">30:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.5">Am 6:5</a>) and could be associated with dance (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20-21">Ex 15:20-21</a>).</p>
<p>Some complete poems in the OT are embedded in the narrative books and represent various types of Hebrew poems. The first recorded poem in the Bible is a battle song (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.23-24">Gn 4:23-24</a>). Other famous examples of this type are the Song of Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-18">Ex 15:1-18</a>) and the Song of Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Jgs 5:1-31</a>). Then there is the Taunt Song (<a href="?bref=Num.21.27-30">Nm 21:27-30</a>), the Song of the Well (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.17-18">17-18</a>), and songs of blessing. Of this latter type, well-known examples are the Blessing of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-27">Gn 49:1-27</a>), the Blessing of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.2-29">Dt 33:2-29</a>), and the four Blessings of Balaam (<a href="?bref=Num.23.7-10">Nm 23:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.23.18-24">23:18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.3-9">24:3-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.15-24">24:15-24</a>). There are also laments for the dead (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.19-27">2 Sm 1:19-27</a>) and didactic poems that warn against improvidence (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.6-11">Prv 6:6-11</a>) and drunkenness (<a href="?bref=Pr.23.29-35">23:29-35</a>). Common throughout all of these various types of poems is religious emotion and fervor. The songs of Moses and Deborah praise God as the giver of victory.</p>
<p>Most poems of distinctively religious fervor characterize the worship of the sanctuary. The psalms are religious poems sung with musical accompaniment. Many are private prayers, while others were composed for public worship, especially hymns of thanksgiving sung at the tabernacle or temple. It is in the Psalter that the soaring spirit of Hebrew poetry rises to a level never achieved by Israel’s pagan neighbors; the Hebrews worshiped God in spirit and in truth, and as they did so, they were giving expression to a personal experience of the living God in their soul.</p>
<p>The internal qualities of Hebrew poetry are in part influenced by the age, social conditions, and environment in which the writers lived. Although the OT is of divine authorship, it also comes within the scope of literature and should be appreciated as such. Though the Holy Spirit inspired the message of the Hebrew writers, their individual writing styles remain clearly evident. Using simple and vivid diction, figures of speech, and literary devices, each poet expressed a wealth of religious thought, experience, and emotion; simile, metaphor, allegory, hyperbole, personification, irony, and wordplay all variously enhanced each writer’s pattern of thinking. Hebrew poetry is the expression of the poet’s human spirit, and it is the literature of revelation—the Word of God to humankind.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT has a limited number of poetical passages. Probably the NT contains less poetry than the OT (relatively speaking) because the early Christians found the OT Psalter (in the Hebrew and LXX) adequate for their devotional purposes. All the writers of the NT were Jews, except Luke. He has given us some memorable poems: the Magnificat (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Lk 1:46-55</a>), the Benedictus (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.68-79">68-79</a>), and the Nunc Dimittis (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.29-32">2:29-32</a>). Interestingly, these poems are strongly Hebraic in form, character, and content. Matthew has given us the poetic Beatitudes (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">Mt 5:3-12</a>). These Beatitudes have the parallelism that is common in OT poetry—specifically, synthetic parallelism (where the second line of each verse completes the meaning of the first line). There is also a definite rhythmic quality in <a href="?bref=Matt.11.28-30">Matthew 11:28-30</a>. John’s Prologue to his Gospel of John (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-18">1:1-18</a>) is a fine example of Hellenistic poetry.</p>
<p>The NT Epistles contain a number of poetic passages, especially in the doxologies (see, for example, <a href="?bref=Rom.16.25-27">Rom 16:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.24-25">Jude 1:24-25</a>). Other sections are distinctly poetry and/or early Christian hymns. These include <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Philippians 2:6-11</a> (“The Humility of Christ” hymn/ poem); <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Colossians 1:15-20</a> (“The Preeminence of Christ” hymn/poem); and <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</a> (“The Incarnation” hymn/poem). The writer to Hebrews also produced a noteworthy poetic prologue (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-3">1:1-3</a>). Other sections of Paul’s writings display poetic language, where rhythm and exalted diction are prominent (see, for example, <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">1 Cor 13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.54-57">15:54-57</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Revelation also contains a number of poems of praise as well as hymns (see <a href="?bref=Rev.5.9-10,12-13">Rv 5:9-10, 12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.12">7:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.17-18">11:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.15.3-4">15:3-4</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">POLYCARP*</p>
<p class="fl">Early Christian leader and martyr in the postapostolic era.</p>
<p>Born to a Christian family, Polycarp identified himself as a disciple of “John,” presumably the apostle. Polycarp was appointed bishop of Smyrna in Asia Minor. Ignatius of Antioch, on his way to Roman martyrdom (c. 116), wrote letters to Polycarp and to the church at Smyrna. Near the end of his life, Polycarp visited Rome. He was serving as representative of the Asia Minor churches in a discussion over the observance of Easter. Polycarp was later arrested by civil authorities, who attempted to convince him to renounce his faith. When he refused, he was burned at the stake. The story of Polycarp’s death (recounted in a letter from the church of Smyrna to the church of Philomelium) is the earliest record of Christian martyrdom outside the New Testament.</p>
<p>As bishop of Smyrna, Polycarp wrote many letters to various churches. Only one of Polycarp’s letters has survived, however. This letter, addressed to the Philippians, was written in response to a letter they had sent him. Apparently, while Ignatius was on his way to martyrdom in Rome, his guards chose to make a stop in Philippi. While there, Ignatius encouraged the local church to write to the church in Antioch. So they sent a letter by way of Polycarp. They also requested copies of Ignatius’s letters to the Asian churches.</p>
<p>Polycarp’s reply to Philippi is the document now called his <span class="ital">Epistle to the Philippians,</span> written around <span class="era">AD</span> 120. It is the only example of the writing of this early church father. In his letter Polycarp assumes that Ignatius had already suffered death, but it seems that he was not certain of this. He asks the Philippians to send him what news they may have of Ignatius.</p>
<p>In his epistle Polycarp mentions the fame of the Philippians among the churches from the early days to that time. He refers to the apostle Paul’s instructions for the church there, making reference to more than one letter from the apostle. Polycarp warns against the love of money, which caused the downfall of one of the leaders of the church (Judas Iscariot). He also warns against those who deny the resurrection of Christ, the Docetist heretics. Polycarp instructs the Philippians on the duties of church leaders and other Christians.</p>
<p>While many critics have labeled Polycarp’s letter “unoriginal,” containing no new theological insights, the letter does provide insight into the available NT writings for the churches. There are no citations from the OT in this epistle, but there are quotations and allusions to Matthew, Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, and 1 Peter. He also makes use of Clement’s epistle and the Ignatian letters. It is interesting to note that Polycarp makes no reference to the Gospel of John, though tradition insists that he was a disciple of the apostle John.</p>
<p>The letter ends with Polycarp’s promise to forward the Philippians’ letter to Antioch. He also promises to send them Ignatius’s letters.</p>

<p class="fl">Roman province in northeastern Asia Minor, located along the southern coast of the Black Sea. Galatia, Cappadocia, and Armenia bordered Pontus. About 1000 <span class="era">BC</span> the first Greeks started to colonize the southeastern coast of the Black Sea, founding Sinope and Trebizond. Here Xenophon and his men reached the sea after their great eastern adventure. The famous geographer Strabo, to whom is owed knowledge of the ancient history of Pontus, was born in the inland city of Amasia. Mithridates Eupator, king of Amasia, was, according to the Romans, the most formidable enemy the republic ever encountered. He waged three wars against the Romans until his final defeat by Pompey around 60 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Aquila, the tentmaker who, with his wife, Priscilla, was a helpful coworker of the apostle Paul, was born in Pontus. Unlike Paul, however, he was not a Roman citizen; hence, he was subject to the edict of Claudius and expelled from Rome because he was a Jew (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.25-28">22:25-28</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Those lacking material wealth.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PovertyasaBadThing">Poverty as a Bad Thing</p>
<p class="fl">At times the Bible gives a very simple explanation of why people are rich or poor. If a person delights in the law of the Lord, he or she will get wealth and riches. Such people will prosper in everything they do (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.3">Pss 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.3">112:3</a>). With regard to Israel in OT days, these ideas are not quite so naive as they might seem. There was indeed a connection between sin and poverty. Israelite society was built on rules laid down by God, so if there was poverty, that must mean that somewhere the rules were being broken.</p>
<p>Whether a person’s poverty was due to his or her own sin or to someone else’s, the OT saw it as an evil to be combated, and the law made many provisions for the relief of it (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.22.21-27">Ex 22:21-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-10">Lv 19:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.1-15">Dt 15:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.10-22">24:10-22</a>). God cared for the needy and expected his people to do the same.</p>
<p>During the period between the testaments, that care continued to be exercised within Jewish communities scattered around the Mediterranean, and it was in due course taken up as a practical responsibility by the Christian church (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.29">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.17">24:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.26">Rom 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1">1 Cor 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.10">Gal 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.15-16">Jas 2:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.17">1 Jn 3:17</a>); for Christians also, the giving of alms was a duty plainly expected by their Lord (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.2-4">Mt 6:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.33">Lk 12:33</a>). It was not really a primitive communism that the early church practiced, for had they renounced personal possessions, they could not have done what they in fact did—namely, to <span class="ital">give</span> in cash or in kind “as any had need” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.45">Acts 2:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.35">4:35</a>).</p>
<p>Poverty, then, although it provides the wealthy with a chance to show the virtue of generosity, is in itself (in the NT as in the OT) a bad thing.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PovertyasaGoodThing">Poverty as a Good Thing</p>
<p class="fl">As we can see, there is a certain sense in which righteousness will make people prosperous and sin will make them poor. But ordinary life is more complicated than that. <a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-6">Psalms 1</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1-10">112</a>, referred to above, show only one side of the matter. What about the prosperity of the wicked (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.3">Ps 73:3</a>) and its corollary, the person who is righteous yet poor? The answer of Scripture (e.g., <a href="?bref=Job.21.1-34">Jb 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.37.1-40">Pss 37</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.49.1-20">49</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-28">73</a>) is that the wealth of bad people is a fleeting thing and that the righteous, though poor in worldly goods, have spiritual riches.</p>
<p>This thought—that far from being prosperous, the good person may often be poor—is sometimes curiously inverted. The righteous may be poor, but Scripture sometimes appears to reckon that to be poor is to be righteous. Of course, it is not automatically so (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.8-9">Prv 30:8-9</a>), but such references are frequent enough, especially in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.9.18">Pss 9:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.10.14">10:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.12.5">12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.6">34:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.10">35:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.74.19">74:19</a>), to deserve careful consideration. And on reflection, they are not so strange. As God is specially concerned about the poor, so the poor may be specially concerned about God, for two good reasons. First, if there was poverty in Israel, it was because those with power were misusing it; therefore, the poor would claim God’s help first because it is his rule that was being flouted, and he must vindicate himself. And second, poverty turns people to God because in those circumstances there is no one else to turn to. In this way “poor” becomes almost a technical term. “The poor” are the humble, and the humble are the godly (<a href="?bref=Ps.10.17">Pss 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.14.5-6">14:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.37.11">37:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.12-13">Zep 3:12-13</a>). Just as being rich can foster self-indulgence, self-confidence, pride, and the despising and oppression of one’s fellow human beings, so being poor should encourage the opposite virtues.</p>
<p>Instead of being an evil to be shunned, poverty thus becomes an ideal to be sought. Following the OT use of “the poor” and “the pious” as almost interchangeable terms, personal property was renounced by many Jews during the period between the testaments. Among them were the sect of the Essenes and the related community that was set up at Qumran near the Dead Sea. The latter actually called themselves “The Poor.” This tradition continued into NT times. Possibly “the poor” at Jerusalem means a definite group within the church there (or even the Jerusalem church as a whole; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.26">Rom 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.10">Gal 2:10</a>). Certainly there emerged later a Jewish-Christian sect called the “Ebionites” (from a Hebrew word for “poor”).</p>
<p>The NT teaches clearly, of course, that what really matters is the attitude of the heart. It is quite possible to be poor yet grasping, or rich yet generous. Even so, with the OT background outlined above, the general sense of these words in the Gospels is that rich = bad, poor = good. On the one hand, the Sadducees are rich in worldly wealth and the Pharisees in spiritual pride, and men of property are selfish, foolish, and in grave spiritual peril (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.23">Mk 10:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.13-21">Lk 12:13-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">16:19-31</a>). On the other hand, it is devout and simple folk, like Jesus’s own family and friends, who generally represent the poor.</p>
<p>In truth, therefore, the two versions of the first beatitude (Matthew’s and Luke’s) amount to the same thing. Matthew’s has the depth: “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3">Mt 5:3</a>). But Luke’s has the breadth. When he says simply “Blessed are you poor” (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.20">Lk 6:20</a>), he means those who in their need—in <span class="ital">any</span> kind of need—turn to the Lord. It was to bring the gospel to such people that Christ came into the world (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">Mt 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">Lk 4:18</a>). Jesus Christ himself embodies the same ideal. As Paul put it, “Though he was very rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.9">2 Cor 8:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Our helpless poverty is an evil from which he comes to rescue us; his deliberately chosen poverty is the glorious means by which he does so.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheBiblicalPerspective">The Biblical Perspective</p>
<p class="fl">The books that specifically cover the history of the postexilic or Persian period are Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah. These cover a period of over a century, only a portion of which is dealt with in detail, as the following table shows:</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="BooksOfPostexilicTimes"/>
<p class="h2" id="TheCollapseoftheBabylonianEmpire">The Collapse of the Babylonian Empire</p>
<p class="fl">This occurred with dramatic suddenness, largely because of internal resistance to the policies of the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus (555–539 <span class="era">BC</span>). His neglect of the traditional Babylonian deity, Marduk, in favor of the moon god, Sin, was particularly resented. Nabonidus lived in Taima during the last decade of his reign, refusing to enter Babylon, where his son Belshazzar ruled as virtual king, as noted in <a href="?bref=Dan.5.1-31">Daniel 5</a>. Babylon fell to the Persians in October 538 <span class="era">BC</span> and the entire empire passed into their control.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePolicyofPersia">The Policy of Persia</p>
<p class="fl">This is well documented through contemporary inscriptions, notably the record of Cyrus, the first king of the Persian Empire (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>), in the “Cyrus Cylinder.” A new phase in the relationship of conqueror to conquered peoples opened up, which contrasted with the policy of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires of crushing any opposition by massive force. Cyrus and his successors followed a conciliatory line, allowing exiled groups to return home, encouraging local faiths, posing as the champions of the territorial deities, and allowing local autonomy except where Persian interests were affected adversely. The cost of this operation, although considerable, must have been infinitesimal compared with that of keeping rebellious subjects under constant subjection.</p>
<p>The new enlightened policy is reflected in the decree of Cyrus, dated 538 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1">Ezr 1:1</a>) and preserved in two versions. The first (vv <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">1-4</a>) is clearly the official proclamation, while the second (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.3-5">6:3-5</a>) is a more prosaic memorandum dealing with building specifications, a record of Cyrus’s commitment stored in the official archives (vv <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.1-2">1-2</a>). The critical tendency to question the narrative in <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">Ezra 1</a>, especially on the score of the favorable references to the God of Israel and the vast financial support promised, has been nullified by the archaeological evidence, which shows an identical policy elsewhere. The Cyrus Cylinder, for example, notes, “The gods who live within them [i.e., the cities] I returned to their places. . . . All of their inhabitants I collected and restored to their dwelling places.”</p>
<p>In Judah itself there is no evidence for any warfare in this period, which suggests that the Persian takeover of the area was nonviolent. Judah was incorporated into the fifth Persian province, which included the entire area west of the Euphrates River (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.21">Ezr 7:21</a>). It was no more than a minor subdistrict, governed through Samaria.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheReturnfromExile">The Return from Exile</p>
<p class="fl">The continuance of a large Jewish community in Babylonia shows that not all the Jews responded to the invitation to return to their homeland, probably because of the prosperity acquired in exile. But 42,360 dedicated Jews (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.64">Ezr 2:64</a>) braved the challenge of a four-month 900-mile (1,448-kilometer) journey under Sheshbazzar (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.8">1:8</a>), the officially appointed leader, and Zerubbabel his nephew (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2">3:2</a>), who was probably the one to whom the Jews looked as leader. With great enthusiasm the Jews rebuilt the altar of sacrifice and resumed the observance of the traditional feasts (vv <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.1-6">1-6</a>), revealing both a sense of stewardship (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.68-69">2:68-69</a>) and careful attention to the requirements of the Law (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2-4">3:2-4</a>). Soon after, work on the second temple commenced—the materials and master craftsmen being imported from Tyre and Sidon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.7-9">Ezr 3:7-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-18">1 Kgs 5</a>). When the foundations were laid, the worshipers were doubtless aware that they were fulfilling God’s promise through Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.10-11">Ezr 3:10-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.33.10-11">Jer 33:10-11</a>). But their high hopes were thwarted when there was opposition from neighboring areas (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.4-5">Ezr 4:4-5</a>), selfishness in giving their own accommodations a higher priority than the Lord’s house (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.2-4,9">Hg 1:2-4, 9</a>), and a series of crop failures that further reduced morale (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.6,10-11">1:6, 10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.17">2:17</a>).</p>
<p>Work on the temple was not resumed until Haggai and Zechariah appeared in 520 <span class="era">BC</span>. They encouraged Zerubbabel and Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest, rebuked the people for their apathy and selfishness, and promised God’s presence and blessing upon the temple project (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.12-2.9">Hg 1:12–2:9</a>). Zechariah’s preaching went beyond the building of the temple, including the rebuilding of Jerusalem itself (<a href="?bref=Zech.2.1-5">Zec 2:1-5</a>) and its world reputation (<a href="?bref=Zech.2.1-5,11-12">2:1-5, 11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.22">8:22</a>). The two leaders were addressed in ways that anticipated the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.21-23">Hg 2:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.10-14">Zec 6:10-14</a>). But the Persian king Darius (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>) was not alarmed when the rebuilding operation was reported to him (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-6.13">Ezr 5:1–6:13</a>) and allowed the work to continue. In February 515 <span class="era">BC</span> it was dedicated (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.14-16">6:14-16</a>). The Jewish community again had a focal point for its religion, but the political situation remained difficult, with no real security in a still-shattered city.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheReturnofEzra">The Return of Ezra</p>
<p class="fl">The traditional date of Ezra’s return is 458 <span class="era">BC</span> (preceding that of Nehemiah in 445 <span class="era">BC</span>). This is based on the premise that the King Artaxerxes noted in <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7">Ezra 7:7</a> was Artaxerxes I Longimanus (464–424 <span class="era">BC</span>) and not Artaxerxes II Mnemon (404–359 <span class="era">BC</span>). However, some scholars, allowing that the king was Artaxerxes I, but believing that Nehemiah preceded Ezra, suggest that a tens unit has dropped out of “seventh” in <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7">Ezra 7:7</a>, and that the date of Ezra’s return should be the 27th (438 <span class="era">BC</span>) or 37th year (428 <span class="era">BC</span>) of Artaxerxes I, making Ezra’s return a few years after Nehemiah’s. While this is plausible, there remains strong support for the traditional view. It accords with the order of the two books in the OT and requires no textual emendation. It also accounts for the section in <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-23">Ezra 4:7-23</a>, where, in the reign of Artaxerxes, an abortive effort was made by a recently returned group to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem. <a href="?bref=Neh.1.1-4">Nehemiah 1:1-4</a> suggests that this was regarded as important and its abrupt termination, by a decree of the king, caused Nehemiah great distress. The probability is that Ezra, recently returned, realized that little could be done in the way of major religious reformation until Jerusalem was secure, but in attempting to rebuild the wall he exceeded his mandate and was not able to function adequately until Nehemiah arrived, when the new security of Jerusalem allowed the great Law-reading ceremony of <a href="?bref=Neh.8.1-12">Nehemiah 8:1-12</a> to take place.</p>
<p>Ezra’s ministry concerned the teaching of the Law of Moses, the Pentateuch, which had long been extant in its final form by this time. <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-28">Ezra 7</a> shows that Artaxerxes was following the traditional Persian policy of encouraging good relationships with his subject peoples. Ezra’s appointment (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.12">Ezr 7:12</a>) was to a state office; it has frequently been paraphrased as “Secretary of State for Jewish Religious Affairs.”</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TheThreeReturnsFromExile"/>
<p class="h2" id="NehemiahsReturnandMinistry">Nehemiah’s Return and Ministry</p>
<p class="fl">Hanani and others (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1-3">Neh 1:1-3</a>) informed Nehemiah of the complete failure of a recent attempt to rebuild the wall, probably that recorded in <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-23">Ezra 4:7-23</a>, and sought his mediation before the very king who had authorized the decree that compelled work on the wall to cease. A friend in high places was vital, and Nehemiah, a trusted and influential member of the court (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.11">Neh 1:11</a>), was approached for this delicate and dangerous task. <a href="?bref=Neh.1.4-2.8">Nehemiah 1:4–2:8</a> shows how well he prepared for and seized his opportunity. His appointment as the governor of Judah (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.14">5:14</a>) involved the removal of this area from the control of the governor of Samaria, which accounts for the unrelenting hostility of Sanballat (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1">4:1</a>). The evidence of <a href="?bref=Neh.3.1-32">Nehemiah 3</a> suggests that the extent of Judah at this time was limited, probably not reaching as far north as Bethel or as far south as Hebron. Nehemiah was faced with opposition that included ridicule (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>), armed force (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.8,11">4:8, 11</a>), discouragement (v <a href="?bref=Neh.4.10">10</a>), internal economic problems (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-18">5:1-18</a>), intrigue (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-2">6:1-2</a>), intimidation, and blackmail (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.6.5-14">5-14</a>). In spite of these obstacles, the wall was completed in the incredibly brief period of 52 days (v <a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">15</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to this monumental achievement, Nehemiah completely reorganized the social and economic life of Jerusalem, dealing with alienated mortgages, excessive interest rates (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-13">Neh 5:1-13</a>), mixed marriages (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.30">10:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-30">13:23-30</a>), Sabbath observance (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.31">10:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-21">13:15-21</a>), and temple supplies (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.32-40">10:32-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.10-13">13:10-13</a>). Almost certainly, it was this political and economic security that allowed Ezra, who probably arrived 13 years earlier, to proceed with his great religious reformation based on the Law. Nehemiah’s book, usually called the “Nehemiah Memoirs,” was probably presented by him in the temple as a “votive offering” (as indicated by the form of <a href="?bref=Neh.5.19">5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.14,22,31">13:14, 22, 31</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRemainderofthePersianPeriod">The Remainder of the Persian Period</p>
<p class="fl">Persian control, which probably centered on Lachish, was traditionally mild, except where her interests were directly threatened. There is no evidence of any major discontent in Judah, which enjoyed a considerable degree of autonomy. The Phoenician revolt of 351 <span class="era">BC</span>, which took Artaxerxes III (359–338 <span class="era">BC</span>) three years to subdue, was the only serious disturbance in the area. While Artaxerxes deported some Jews to Hyrcania, southeast of the Caspian Sea, that was probably a precautionary measure, and Judah does not appear to have been greatly involved in the revolt. The Jerusalem priests were allowed to mint their own coinage and levy a temple tax. Under the wider influence of the Persian Empire, Hebrew gradually fell out of popular usage as a spoken language, being replaced by Aramaic. As the international stature of Greece increased, so the influence of Hellenism began to be felt, even in Judah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ReligiousFeaturesofthePostexilicPeriod">Religious Features of the Postexilic Period</p>
<p class="h3">The Decline of Prophecy</p>
<p class="fl">There were three main reasons for this:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The prophetic movement as a whole became discredited after Jerusalem fell in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The large number of popular cult prophets who had foretold a sudden end to the Babylonian oppression (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-4">Jer 28:1-4</a>) were proved decisively wrong. The suspicion that henceforth became attached to prophecy was increased further in the Persian period, when large numbers of itinerant “prophets” of various religions traveled widely. <a href="?bref=Zech.13.2-6">Zechariah 13:2-6</a> shows the stern measures advocated against such false prophets and fortune-tellers.</p>
<p class="list">2. There was a markedly different historical situation. The chastened remnant that survived had turned away from the blatant apostasy that characterized the preexilic period, so that the prophetic condemnation was not required with the same urgency. The temple and the Law had acquired a new prominence, and postexilic prophecy generally was concerned either with the rebuilding of the temple (e.g., Haggai and Zechariah) or the purification of its cult (e.g., Malachi). Once this goal had been realized, the role of the prophet was diminished. Another historical factor was the relatively large number of priests who returned from captivity, doubtless encouraged by the prospect of serving in the rebuilt temple. The main need at this time was for the priest, who revealed God’s will on the basis of the Law.</p>
<p class="list">3. There was an increasing stress on the transcendence of God, caused partly by an emphasis upon priestly mediation and partly by a fear of God that resulted from the recent judgment. The apocalyptic movement, with its emphasis on angelic intermediaries between humans and a transcendent God, encouraged this tendency. Correspondingly, the prophetic appeal for a personal, moral walk with God weakened.</p>
<p class="h3">The Rise of the Synagogue</p>
<p class="fl">Some type of local worship, independent of the temple and its sacrifices, must have developed in the Captivity, with the Law increasingly occupying a dominant position. Later on, the prophetic books were read and expounded, but the primary stress was always on the Law. This mode of worship later took root in the homeland, and the synagogue gradually developed into the focal point of the community for social relationships, education, and worship. It facilitated the worldwide continuance and expansion of the Jewish faith, independent of Jerusalem.</p>

By the first millennium, the meaning “eunuch” was attached to the term; hence, the <span class="sc">neb</span>, following the Septuagint tradition, has “eunuch” in <a href="?bref=Gen.37.36">Genesis 37:36</a>. But most English versions are correct in rendering it “officer” or “official.” Little, if anything, is known of eunuchs in Egypt, and certainly they played no role in Pharaoh’s court in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>A second title held by Potiphar was “captain of the guard,” which seems to be a Semitic expression for an Egyptian title rather than a transliteration of an Egyptian phrase. This same title is applied to Nebuzaradan, Nebuchadnezzar’s general (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.8,11,20">2 Kgs 25:8, 11, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.39.9-11">Jer 39:9-11</a>). The Egyptian counterpart to this title suggests that this officer was an instructor for retainers who were attached to the king. The titles indicate that Potiphar was a man of some importance and status. His purchase of a Semitic slave to serve in domestic affairs is in keeping with the practice of Egyptians from 1800 <span class="era">BC</span> onward.</p>
<p>The name Potiphar seems to be a transliteration of the Egyptian name, meaning “he whom Re [the sun god] has given.” This name formula is known in Egypt beginning around the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>When falsely accused of trying to seduce Potiphar’s wife, Joseph was placed in prison (<a href="?bref=Gen.39.20">Gn 39:20</a>). Some think that Potiphar as “captain of the guard” would have been the warden. But <a href="?bref=Gen.39.21">Genesis 39:21</a> tells us that the “keeper of the prison” was impressed with Joseph’s abilities (something Potiphar had already learned—cf. vv <a href="?bref=Gen.39.2-6">2-6</a>), and so gave him special responsibilities. The warden’s discovery of Joseph’s talents while in prison suggests that he was a different man.</p>

On (or Heliopolis) was the center of the sun-god cult, and Potiphera was likely a high-ranking priest in the cult.

<p class="h1">POTTERY</p>
<p class="fl">The manufacture of clayware and earthenware.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoryandDevelopment">History and Development</p>
<p class="fl">The first pottery was made by hand, molded into the desired shape and dried in the sun. There are no records describing the work of the ancient potter and his or her place in society, although the walls of tombs and palaces in Egypt abound with pictures of potters at work and a great deal can be learned by observing the activities portrayed. The first potters are thought to have been women who, out of necessity, produced vessels for food preparation, while the men were out trying to bring in the food. This still seems to be the pattern in places like Africa, Anatolia, Kurdistan, and the southwestern United States. Eventually, the making of pottery became a profession, apparently practiced by certain people in a large village and often by itinerant craftsmen moving from village to village making pottery to meet the demand and then moving on.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientEgyptianBowlsAndVases"/>
<p>The discovery that moved pottery making from an occasional activity of a housewife to that of a profession was the invention of the potter’s wheel. The speed with which vessels could then be made industrialized the craft, and it eventually became primarily a male occupation, although there is evidence that people (one would assume women) continued to make some vessels at home. Until the discovery of the potter’s wheel, the techniques of making pots by laying coils of clay, one on top of the other, was the predominant method used, especially for large vessels. The first potter’s wheel found in excavations in the lands of the Bible come from Ur in Sumer around 3500 to 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. It may have been developed in emerging urban settlements due to a greater market for pottery. Jeremiah speaks of a potter’s workshop in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>: “So I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel. But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so the potter squashed the jar into a lump of clay and started again” (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.3-4">Jer 18:3-4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). There is evidence in Greece of large workshops in the classical period employing more than 50 workers.</p>
<p>Clay must be spun at least 100 revolutions a minute to create the centrifugal force necessary to “throw” the vessel. The oldest wheels were made of two stones, a lower one with a hole in the center and an upper one with a protrusion that fits into the lower hole, allowing the upper stone to be turned. The upper stone, with a larger board attached to it on which the vessel rested, was undoubtedly turned by an apprentice. By the Hellenistic period, after 300 <span class="era">BC</span>, the foot wheel was invented.</p>
<p>Another technique used in ancient pottery making was the mold. Molds were carved out of soft stone or made from clay for use in mass production of the same kind of vessel. Lamp molds are rather common in museums of the Middle East from the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Small oil lamps were made in two parts in the molds, an upper half and lower half, and then fused together before firing. Herodian lamps also had spatulated spouts that were formed independently of the other two parts.</p>
<p>The amount of diversity in both the size and shape of ancient pottery is remarkable. An average ancient home would have within it large vessels (amphorae and pithoi) to hold liquids such as wine or water. These were pointed on the bottom and designed originally to lie against the slope of a ship’s hull while being transported. In homes of the common people they were partially set into the ground and leaned against the wall. In taverns in Pompeii and Herculaneum they were stored in wooden racks. Large, open-mouthed jars would be partially buried in the ground to keep the liquid contained in them cool. Also, grains of various kinds could be kept in these, some of which were four feet (1.2 meters) in height and three feet (.9 meter) wide. Smaller water decanters holding a quart (.9 liter) or more were commonly used. Globular jugs were used to serve wine, having spouts that prevented spilling the precious liquid. Round canteens, with handles on either shoulder, were used to carry water on a journey. Bowls and dishes were common in various sizes and depths in ancient homes. Large-mouth dishes known as kraters were used for drinking. Cooking was done in medium-sized (about one gallon, or 3.8 liters) pots with rounded bottoms that would sit easily in the fire or in a dug-out place in the floor after being taken from the fire. They also had two looped handles, which allowed them to be hung over the fire.</p>
<p>Vessels were painted in classical Greece with vivid descriptions of religion, sex, warfare, and community life. Earlier vessels of Minoan and Mycenaean cultures contain beautiful artwork in the form of plants, animals, and marine life as well as geometric designs. From earliest times in the Middle East, variations in design were created by the use of dark and light shades of slip painted or poured randomly on vessels.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PotteryinScripture">Pottery in Scripture</p>
<p class="fl">There are many references to the potter and his work in the Bible. Typical are the following: “Israel, can I not do to you as this potter has done to his clay? As the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand” (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.6">Jer 18:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>); “<span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, you are our Father. We are the clay, and you are the potter. We are all formed by your hand” (<a href="?bref=Isa.64.8">Is 64:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In the Creation story God is portrayed as a potter making man from the ground (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>). His absolute sovereignty in the election of Israel is argued by Paul (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.20-21">Rom 9:20-21</a>) from an illustration used by Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.9">Is 45:9</a>) concerning a pot arguing with its potter: “Does a clay pot ever argue with its maker? Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying, ‘Stop, you are doing it wrong!’ Does the pot exclaim, ‘How clumsy can you be!’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah graphically prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem by breaking a potter’s earthen flask into so many pieces that it could not be restored (<a href="?bref=Jer.19.11">Jer 19:11</a>). The Jews, at the time of the destruction, though precious in God’s sight, were “treated like pots of clay” (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.2">Lam 4:2</a>)—an expression of their human frailty; they could be easily broken and destroyed.</p>
<p>A broken pottery vessel in the ancient world was considered so worthless that the pieces were swept aside or thrown out the window and a new one made. The potter’s art was widely known and vessels were readily available at a cheap price. People normally did not transport their vessels when they moved. It was easier to make or buy new ones than to try to carry them, especially the larger ones. Broken pieces, however, were not without some use. Job scraped the secretion from his sores with a potsherd, which is a broken piece of pottery (<a href="?bref=Job.2.8">Jb 2:8</a>). At a much later time, potsherds were used to write notes on and were called ostraca. The psalmist spoke of his strength as having dried up like a potsherd (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.15">Ps 22:15</a>)—a reference to the lack of moisture in a dried and fired pottery vessel. The eventual defeat of polytheistic and idolatrous pagan nations is described as vessels of pottery being dashed to the ground and broken to pieces by the righteous (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.9">Ps 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.27">Rv 2:27</a>).</p>

  <title>Power</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">POWER</p>
<p class="fl">Ability to do things, by virtue of strength, skill, resources, or authorization. In the Hebrew of the OT and the Greek of the NT, there are several different words used for power. What the Bible says about power may be subsumed under four headings: (1) the unlimited power of God; (2) the limited power God gives to his creatures; (3) the power of God seen in Jesus Christ; and (4) the power of God (by the Holy Spirit) in the lives of his people.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheUnlimitedPowerofGod">The Unlimited Power of God</p>
<p class="fl">God is almighty and all other power is derived from him and subject to him. Much that the Bible says is summed up in the words of <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.11-12">1 Chronicles 29:11-12</a> addressed to God in praise: “Thine, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. . . . thou rulest over all. In thy hand are power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength to all” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Using human terms, the OT often speaks of God’s “mighty hand” and his “outstretched arm,” both being used for the power of God in action (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6">Ex 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.7.4">7:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.2-3">Ps 44:2-3</a>). His power is seen in creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.65.6">Ps 65:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.26">Is 40:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.12">Jer 10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.5">27:5</a>), in his rule over the world (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.6">2 Chr 20:6</a>), in his acts of salvation and judgment (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.6">Ex 15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.26.8">Dt 26:8</a>), and in all that he does for his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.111.6">Ps 111:6</a>). The NT, as well as the OT, speaks of the mighty power of God. <a href="?bref=Eph.1.19">Ephesians 1:19</a> speaks of the immeasurable greatness of his power, and the words of Jesus in <a href="?bref=Matt.26.64">Matthew 26:64</a> show that the word could be substituted for the very name of God when he said that the Son of Man would be seen “seated at the right hand of Power.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLimitedPowerGodGivestoHisCreatures">The Limited Power God Gives to His Creatures</p>
<p class="fl">Animals have power, as is particularly evident in the wild ox, the horse, and the lion (<a href="?bref=Job.39.11,19">Jb 39:11, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.30">Prv 30:30</a>). There is power in wind and storm, thunder and lightning. Power is given to humans: physical strength (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.5-6">Jgs 16:5-6</a>), power to fight (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.12">6:12</a>), and the power to do good and the power to do harm (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.29">Gn 31:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.27">Prv 3:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.2.1">Mi 2:1</a>). Rulers have God-given power and authority (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.1">Rom 13:1</a>). The Bible also speaks of the power of angels (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.11">2 Pt 2:11</a>) and of spiritual beings known as “principalities and powers.” Certain powers are given to Satan (see <a href="?bref=Job.1.6-12">Jb 1:6-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.1-6">2:1-6</a>). Sin, evil, and death are allowed to have some power over men (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">Hos 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.53">Lk 22:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.9">Rom 3:9</a>). All of these, however, have only limited power, and God is able to give his people strength to conquer all these powers. He can save them from the power of animals (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.27">Dn 6:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.19">Lk 10:19</a>) and from the power of other people over them. To Pilate Jesus said, “You would have no power over me at all unless it were given to you from above” (<a href="?bref=John.19.11">Jn 19:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). He is able to deliver people from the power of sin and death, from Satan, and from all the spiritual forces of evil (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.4">2 Cor 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.10-18">Eph 6:10-18</a>). The “ruler of this world” could ultimately have no power over Christ (<a href="?bref=John.14.30">Jn 14:30</a>) and so cannot have power over those who rely on him.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePowerofGodSeeninJesusChrist">The Power of God Seen in Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospels and the book of Acts bear frequent witness to the power of Christ. Power was shown in his miracles (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.20">Mt 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.22">Acts 2:22</a>), in his works of healing and exorcism (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.36">Lk 4:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.17">5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.19">6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.38">Acts 10:38</a>). Power is shown supremely in his resurrection. Jesus speaks of his power to give up his life and power to take it again (<a href="?bref=John.10.18">Jn 10:18</a>), but the NT speaks most frequently of the power of God the Father shown in the raising of his Son from the dead (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.19-20">Eph 1:19-20</a>). In the end he will be seen coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Mt 24:30</a>). With regard to his human life on earth, however, it may be noted in the light of what follows that he lived and did his mighty works in the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.14">Lk 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.38">Acts 10:38</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePowerofGodintheLivesofHisPeople">The Power of God in the Lives of His People</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT it is often said that the weak are made strong by the power of God. He empowers those who are weak (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.29">Is 40:29</a>) so that they may increase from strength to strength (<a href="?bref=Ps.84.7">Ps 84:7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.68.35">Pss 68:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.138.3">138:3</a>). We read in particular of his power being given to prophets (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.8">Mi 3:8</a>) and kings (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.10">1 Sm 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.21.1">Ps 21:1</a>), and it is said that in an outstanding way power will be given to the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">Is 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.2">11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.4">Mi 5:4</a>). But to all God’s people power is offered that they may live for him and serve him (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.5">Is 49:5</a>). When we turn to the NT, we read of the gospel itself as being the power of God for salvation—to everyone who has faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>). “To all who received him [Jesus Christ], who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God” (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">Jn 1:12</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In that life as children of God, power is received from the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.8">Acts 6:8</a>), inner strength to live in his service (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.16">Eph 3:16</a>), power to be his witnesses (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.49">Lk 24:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>), power to endure suffering (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">2 Tm 1:8</a>), power for ministry (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.7">Eph 3:7</a>), power in the face of weakness (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.9">2 Cor 12:9</a>), power through prayer (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.16">Jas 5:16</a>), and power to be kept from evil (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.5">1 Pt 1:5</a>). Those who do great things in the service of Christ do not do them in their own strength (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.12">Acts 3:12</a>); he sent out his disciples confident only in the assurance that all things are under his authority and that they would have the power of his unfailing presence with them (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.18-20">Mt 28:18-20</a>).</p>

Originally it designated the tent of the general <span class="ital">(praetor)</span> in a military encampment. The meaning was extended to include the residence of a governor or other Roman official, as, for example, that of Pontius Pilate, the procurator of Judea. In looser usage the term may also have referred to a part of the residence—for instance, the barracks of the soldiers.</p>
<p>In English translations of the NT, the variety of terms used by translators indicates the uncertainty about the specific reference. The general reference to the headquarters of the Roman representative and military force is clear, however. According to the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, the praetorium was the location of the Roman soldiers’ mocking of Jesus after his appearance before Pilate. Mark also calls this place a “palace” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) or “courtyard” (<span class="sc">neb</span>, <span class="sc">tev</span>). According to the Gospel of John, the “praetorium” was the place within which Pilate examined Jesus about the charges brought against him. He went outside the praetorium to meet with the accusers who brought the charges.</p>
<p>Within Jerusalem, two locations are possible for Pilate’s headquarters. One is the fortress known as the Tower of Antonia at the northwest corner of the temple area. The other is the old palace of Herod the Great, in the western part of the city. Either one could have served as the praetorium, but the Gospel sources identify neither by name or description.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Acts.23.35">Acts 23:35</a>, on the other hand, the praetorium in which Paul is held in Caesarea (pending the arrival of his accusers) is called “Herod’s praetorium.” This probably means that the procurator Felix (and his predecessors) had taken over the old official residence of King Herod as their coastal headquarters.</p>
<p>The location of Paul’s imprisonment at the time he wrote to the Philippians is not clear. His mention of the “praetorium” in <a href="?bref=Phil.1.13">Philippians 1:13</a> suggests some center of Roman government. The phrase “the whole praetorium,” however, indicates that in this context he was referring to the personnel rather than to a building or a place. Recent translations reflect this meaning: “the whole praetorian guard” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>); “all at headquarters” (<span class="sc">neb</span>); “all the soldiers in the palace guard” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">PRAISE</p>
<p class="fl">Honor, commendation, and worship.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ToWhomPraiseIsOffered">To Whom Praise Is Offered</p>
<p class="fl">The one Lord who is God over all is alone worthy of praise. Frequently, the OT stresses that the praise due him is not to be offered to other gods or to idols of any kind (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.42.8">Is 42:8</a>). There is a place for the commendation of men and women for their qualities of life and their right actions (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.28-31">Prv 31:28-31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.14">1 Pt 2:14</a>). Ultimately, however, they should seek the praise and commendation of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.29">Rom 2:29</a>), not the praise of their fellows (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.1-6">Mt 6:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.43">Jn 12:43</a>), that others may be led to glorify God for whatever good is found in them (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.16">Mt 5:16</a>). Frequently the Bible speaks of praising “the name” of God (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.149.3">Ps 149:3</a>), meaning that he is to be praised for all that he is and has revealed himself to be. The often repeated word “Hallelujah” is simply the Hebrew equivalent of “Praise the Lord.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="ByWhomPraiseIsOffered">By Whom Praise Is Offered</p>
<p class="fl">God is praised perfectly by his angels in heaven (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.20">Pss 103:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.148.2">148:2</a>). They caroled their praise when Jesus was born (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.13-14">Lk 2:13-14</a>), and the book of Revelation (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rev.7.11-12">Rv 7:11-12</a>) speaks about their continual praise in heaven. All creation praises God in the sense that it shows his greatness as Creator (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">Ps 19:1-6</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.148.1-14">Psalm 148</a> lists sun, moon and stars, fire and hail, snow, rain, wind and weather, mountains and hills, fruit trees and cedars, wild animals, cattle, snakes and birds—all these—as praising God together. Heaven and earth are spoken of as involved in the praise of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.5">Pss 89:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.11">96:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.98.4">98:4</a>). The Psalter closes with the words “Let everything that lives sing praises to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>!” (<a href="?bref=Ps.150.6">150:6</a>). In the OT we read of the special role of priests and Levites (<a href="?bref=Ps.135.19-20">Ps 135:19-20</a>) and of the temple singers (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.21">2 Chr 20:21</a>) and of those who, like Miriam (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>) and David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.14">2 Sm 6:14</a>), led others in God’s praise. But it was the duty of all God’s people to praise him; their praise was intended, moreover, to lead the nations to know and to praise him (<a href="?bref=Ps.67.2-3">Ps 67:2-3</a>). The NT has this same emphasis (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.7-12">Rom 15:7-12</a>), and it stresses that God’s gifts are given to his people to be used to his praise and glory (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.6,12,14">Eph 1:6, 12, 14</a>). It is by a life of righteousness as well as by word of mouth that people are to praise him (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.11">Phil 1:11</a>). The redeemed people of God are appointed to show forth the praises of him who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>). The last book of the NT presents the praise of God in heaven, where the four living creatures (representing all creation) and the 24 elders (representing the people of God under the old and new covenants) unite in worship, adoring the mighty God who created them and the Lamb of God who redeemed them (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-5.14">Rv 4–5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="WhenGodIstoBePraised">When God Is to Be Praised</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT there were times of special praise, Sabbaths, new moons, and festivals. In <a href="?bref=Ps.119.164">Psalm 119:164</a> the psalmist says he praised the Lord seven times a day. “Everywhere—from east to west—praise the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” is the exhortation of <a href="?bref=Ps.113.3">Psalm 113:3</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). <a href="?bref=Ps.145.1">Psalm 145:1</a> says, “I will praise you, my God and King, and bless your name forever and ever” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). A dedication to a life of praise is expressed in <a href="?bref=Ps.146.2">Psalm 146:2</a>: “I will praise the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God even with my dying breath” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). In the NT, likewise, there are special times of praise, but the whole of the Christian’s life is intended to be devoted, in word and action, to the praise of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WherePraiseIstoBeOffered">Where Praise Is to Be Offered</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT the temple (and thus “Zion” or “Jerusalem,” where the temple was located) had a special place in the purpose of God: his people should praise him there. <a href="?bref=Ps.102.21">Psalm 102:21</a> pictures people declaring “in Zion the name of the Lord, and in Jerusalem his praise.” People are to praise God publicly before the congregation and before the leaders of the nation (<a href="?bref=Ps.107.32">Ps 107:32</a>), but they may also do so alone. For the whole of life is to be praise. Thus praise can come from unexpected places. Godly men and women can sing for joy as they lie on their beds (<a href="?bref=Ps.149.5">149:5</a>). Paul and Silas can sing praises to God in a Philippian prison (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.25">Acts 16:25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="HowGodIstoBePraised">How God Is to Be Praised</p>
<p class="fl">As there is no limit to time or place, so there is no limit to the ways in which God may be praised. He may be praised with singing (<a href="?bref=Ps.47.7">Ps 47:7</a>), with dancing (<a href="?bref=Ps.149.3">149:3</a>), or with instruments of music (<a href="?bref=Ps.144.9">144:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.150.3-5">150:3-5</a>). The Psalter provides us with many songs of praise, and others are scattered throughout the OT. The NT speaks of “psalms and hymns and spiritual songs” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.16">Col 3:16</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Eph.5.19">Eph 5:19</a>), and examples of Christian songs of praise are probably to be seen in <a href="?bref=Eph.5.14">Ephesians 5:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Philippians 2:6-11</a>, <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.17">1 Timothy 1:17</a>, and <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.11-13">2 Timothy 2:11-13</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WhyGodIstoBePraised">Why God Is to Be Praised</p>
<p class="fl">Creation provides impetus for the praise of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.3">Ps 8:3</a>), as does his preserving love and care (<a href="?bref=Ps.21.4">21:4</a>) and the fact that he is a prayer-answering God (<a href="?bref=Ps.116.1">116:1</a>). His redeeming work leads his people to worship him (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-2">Ex 15:1-2</a>). Some of the psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.107.1-43">Ps 107</a>) list many reasons why he should be praised. With the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, there is a fresh outburst of praise because the Messiah, the Savior, has come to his people (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.11">Lk 2:11</a>). All that he did by his life, death, and resurrection calls for praise. But ultimately praise will be made perfect when God reigns victorious over all. Thus John speaks in the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.6">19:6</a>): “Then I heard again what sounded like the shout of a huge crowd, or the roar of mighty ocean waves, or the crash of loud thunder: ‘Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">PRAYER</p>
<p class="fl">The addressing and petitioning of God. Prayer to a god or gods is a feature of many, if not all, religions, but here attention will be restricted to the biblical teaching and some of its implications. A classic definition of Christian prayer is “an offering up of our desires unto God, for things agreeable to his will, in the name of Christ, with confession of our sins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercies” (Westminster Shorter Catechism). Christian prayer is the end product of a long process of change and development in God’s relation to people, as a survey of the biblical data shows.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PrayerintheOldTestament">Prayer in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Newly created humans, made for fellowship with God, lived in close communion with him. Sin broke this intimate, direct relationship. Nevertheless, when the Lord formed his covenant with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Gn 15</a>), the relationship between the covenant partners was open again. Abraham’s prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">18</a>) is a striking combination of boldness and persistence and is a recognition of his own smallness and inferiority compared to God. The same could be said about Jacob’s wrestling with the angel at Peniel (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.32.1-32">32</a>). But boldness and directness are not to be confused with familiarity. Biblical prayer is characterized by the reality that there is a distance between the Creator and the creature due to human sin, bridged only by God’s grace. The basis of a person’s approach to God in prayer is never simply “man’s search for God” but God’s gracious initiative, the establishing of the covenant, and the promise of help and deliverance on the basis of that covenant. It is this covenant relationship that gives the <span class="ital">warrant</span> for prayer. Thus, in patriarchal times prayer was conjoined with sacrifice and obedience.</p>
<p>The reestablishing of the national consciousness of Israel at the time of their deliverance from Egypt marks another phase in the biblical development. Moses was not only the political leader of Israel but also their divinely appointed mediator and intercessor with the Lord. Repeatedly he “pleads the name of the Lord” in the face of the human uncertainties of the wilderness journey and his own people’s unbelief and disobedience. Pleading the name of the Lord is not to be thought of as an incantation but as a reminder to God of who he has revealed himself to be. (God’s revelation of himself to Moses at the burning bush is fundamental to an understanding of this.) In this revelation of himself, God made promises to his people, and in prayer Moses held God to these promises. Moses was by no means the only intercessor. Aaron, Samuel, Solomon, and Hezekiah were among those who interceded for the people.</p>
<p>With the formation of the priesthood and the establishment of the ritual worship of the tabernacle and later the temple, the worship of God seems to be characterized by distance. There is little indication that the people personally prayed to God, and—with the exception of <a href="?bref=Deut.26.1-15">Deuteronomy 26:1-15</a>—there is nothing about prayer in all the instructions for worship given to the people. However, there is indication in the psalms that sacrifice and prayer would be coupled together (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.7-15">Pss 50:7-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.55.14">55:14</a>). Many of the psalms are remarkable for the way in which personal perplexities are acknowledged, leading to “arguments with God” and an ultimate resolution of the conflict (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-28">Ps 73</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets were men who prayed, and it seems that God’s Word came to them in prayer (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.5-13">Is 6:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.1-4">37:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.20-23">Jer 11:20-23</a>). Jeremiah’s ministry was characterized by times of conflict in prayer (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.19-23">Jer 18:19-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.7-18">20:7-18</a>) as well as more settled times of fellowship with God (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.23-25">10:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.1-4">12:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.7-9">14:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.15-18">15:15-18</a>). At the exile, with the establishment of the synagogue, corporate prayer became an element in Jewish worship. After the exile there was an emphasis on spontaneity in prayer and on the need for devotion to be more than mechanical and routine (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.4">Neh 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.4,9">4:4, 9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PrayerintheNewTestament">Prayer in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT’s teaching on prayer is dominated by Christ’s own example and teaching. His dependence on his Father in his mediatorial work expresses itself in repeated prayer, culminating in his High Priestly prayer (<a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">Jn 17</a>) and the agony of Gethsemane with the prayer from the cross. His teaching on prayer, particularly in the Sermon on the Mount, is to be understood as contrasting with the Jewish practices at that time, not with OT ideals. Prayer is an expression of sincere desire. It is not to inform God of matters that he would otherwise be ignorant of, and the validity of prayer is not affected by length or repetitiveness. Private prayer is to be discreet and secret (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.5-15">Mt 6:5-15</a>).</p>
<p>The parables are another important source of Christ’s teaching, emphasizing persistence in prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.1-8">Lk 18:1-8</a>), simplicity and humility (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.18.10-14">10-14</a>), and tenacity (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.5-8">11:5-8</a>). A third source of teaching is the Lord’s Prayer. Once again there is the blend of directness (“Our Father”) and distance (“who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name”). The requests given in the Lord’s Prayer are concerned first with God, his kingdom and his glory, and then with the disciples’ needs for forgiveness and for daily support and deliverance. Occasionally, it seems from our Lord’s teaching that anything that is prayed for will, without restriction, be granted. But such teaching ought to be understood in the light of Christ’s overall teaching about prayer (“Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”).</p>
<p>Christ stated that when the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, came, the disciples would pray to the Father in the name of Christ (<a href="?bref=John.16.23-25">Jn 16:23-25</a>). Accordingly, we find that after the coming of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, the early church is characterized by prayer (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.42">Acts 2:42</a>) under the leadership of the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.4">6:4</a>). The church praises God for the gift of his Son and his Spirit, and petitions God in times of difficulty (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.24">4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.5,12">12:5, 12</a>).</p>
<p>It is in Paul’s writings that the theology of prayer is most fully developed. The NT believer is a son, not only a servant. The Spirit who, as a result of Christ’s triumph, has come to the church is the Spirit of adoption, enabling the Christian to come to God as his Father, with all his needs. Prominent among these needs, in the mind of the apostle, are a deepening of faith in Christ, love for God, and a growing appreciation of God’s love in turn (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.14-19">Eph 3:14-19</a>). Prayer is a part of the Christian’s armor against satanic attack (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.18">6:18</a>), the effective ministry of the Word of God depends on the prayers of God’s people (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.6.18-19">18-19</a>), and the Christian is encouraged to pray for all sorts of things, with thanksgiving (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.6">Phil 4:6</a>), and so to be free from anxiety. Paul’s own example in prayer is as instructive as the teaching he gives.</p>
<p>The Christian’s prayer is rooted, objectively, in Christ’s intercession; subjectively, in the enabling of the Holy Spirit. The church is a kingdom of priests, offering spiritual sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.15">Heb 13:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>), but Christ is the “great High Priest.” This thought is developed fully in Hebrews. Because of Christ’s human sympathy, the power of his intercessory work (i.e., the triumph of his atonement), and his superiority over the old Aaronic priesthood, the church is encouraged to come to God boldly, to find grace when it is needed (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-16">Heb 4:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.24">9:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.19-23">10:19-23</a>). Nowhere in either the OT or NT is there any encouragement to pray to individuals other than God. Nowhere in Scripture is it suggested that there is any other mediator between God and men except Christ (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.5">1 Tm 2:5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheElementsofPrayer">The Elements of Prayer</p>
<p class="fl">Although prayer is, typically, an unself-conscious activity in which the person praying devotes himself to God, it is possible to distinguish various elements in prayer, as will be apparent from the discussion of the biblical data. <span class="ital">Praise</span> involves the recognition of who God is and what he does. It is “giving God the glory,” not in the sense of adding to his glory, which would be impossible, but of willingly (and where appropriate, publicly) recognizing God as God. Typical expressions of such praise are to be found in the psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.148.1-14">Pss 148</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1-6">150</a>). When the recognition of God’s goodness is in respect to what he has done for the one who prays, or for others, then the prayer is one of <span class="ital">thanksgiving,</span> for life itself, for the use and beauty of the physical universe, for Christ and his benefits (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.15">2 Cor 9:15</a>), and for specific answers to prayer. <span class="ital">Confession</span> of sin recognizes the holiness of God and his supreme moral authority, together with the personal responsibility of the one making the confession. Confession thus involves the vindicating or justifying of God and an explicit and unreserved recognition of sin, both as it takes its rise in sinful motives and dispositions and as it finds outward expression. <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a>, David’s confession of sin regarding Bathsheba, is the classic biblical instance of a prayer of confession. <span class="ital">Petition</span> can be thought of as it concerns the one praying, and also as it concerns others, when it is <span class="ital">intercession.</span> Scripture never regards prayer for oneself as sinful or ethically improper, as can be seen from the pattern of prayer given in the Lord’s Prayer. Prayer for others is an obvious expression of love for one’s neighbor, which is fundamental to biblical ethics.</p>

  <title>Prayer of Manasseh*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PRAYER OF MANASSEH*</p>
<p class="fl">This short prayer, ascribed to King Manasseh of Judah, is often regarded as the finest composition in the entire English Apocrypha. During the Reformation, Protestants highly valued its piety. However, neither Protestants, Roman Catholics, nor the Eastern Orthodox regard it as Scripture.</p>
<p>The older title, The Prayer of Manasses King of Judah When He was Holden [Held] Captive in Babylon (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">erv</span>), is more helpful than the one commonly used today (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">neb</span>) or the Latin one, <span class="ital">Oration Manassae.</span> The older title alerts the reader to the supposed connection between this prayer and King Manasseh (696–642 <span class="era">BC</span>), who was taken captive to Babylon, where “at last he came to his senses and cried out humbly to God for help. And the Lord listened, and answered his plea by returning him to Jerusalem and to his kingdom!” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.12-13">2 Chr 33:12-13</a>, <span class="sc">tlb</span>; on the historicity of this account, see <a href="?item=ManassehPerson_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Manasseh</a> #3). The writer of 2 Chronicles indicates that this prayer was available to him from national archives and from another work (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.18-19">2 Chr 33:18-19</a>). The prayer was composed by an anonymous author, though the date is uncertain. On internal evidence it has been dated between 250 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 50. The oldest surviving Greek biblical manuscript containing it is Codex Alexandrinus (fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>), but the earliest evidence for its existence is its inclusion in a Syriac manual of church procedures known as <span class="ital">Didascalia</span> (third century <span class="era">AD</span>), which, in a revised and expanded form, also appeared as a part of the <span class="ital">Apostolic Constitutions</span> (<span class="era">AD</span> 380).</p>
<p>Most scholars believe that the prayer was originally composed in Greek, but for such a short book—about 400 words in English—the problem of determining the original language is difficult. Because the Prayer of Manasseh survives both in Greek and in Syriac, Latin (two forms), Ethiopic, Armenian, and Old Slavonic translation, it was clearly popular in the first three Christian centuries, among both Jews and Christians.</p>
<p>The Prayer of Manasseh is the prayer of a self-confessed sinner to a merciful God. The <span class="sc">rsv</span> (which is quoted below unless otherwise noted) and <span class="sc">neb</span> divide the Prayer of Manasseh into 15 verses. KJV and <span class="sc">erv</span> do not indicate verses, and a rarer system divides the prayer into 19 verses. The prayer uses several descriptions of God drawn from the OT. It begins by identifying God as “Lord Almighty” (Prayer of Manasseh 1:1; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.18">2 Cor 6:18</a>) and “God of our fathers” (Prayer of Manasseh 1:1, cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.6">2 Chr 20:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.12">33:12</a>) and of their righteous descendants. God is the Creator—glorious and powerful, wrathful yet merciful (Prayer of Manasseh 1:2-7a). He “made heaven and earth” (v 2; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.20.11">Ex 20:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.6">Neh 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.146.6">Ps 146:6</a>) “in their manifold array” (Prayer of Manasseh 1:2, <span class="sc">neb</span>). He “shackled the sea” and “confined the deep” (v 3; cf. <a href="?bref=Job.38.8-11">Jb 38:8-11</a>). No one can endure his glorious majesty (Prayer of Manasseh 1:5a; contrast <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-17">2 Pt 1:16-17</a>). His power makes every creature “shudder, and tremble” (Prayer of Manasseh 1:4), but his goodness is demonstrated in mercy and in salvation (vv 7, 14; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.63.7">Is 63:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Rom.2.4">Rom 2:4</a>), for he is compassionate, patiently long-suffering (forbearing), and very merciful (Prayer of Manasseh 1:7; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.86.5,15">Ps 86:5, 15</a>). God is “the Lord Most High” (Prayer of Manasseh 1:7; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.7.17">Ps 7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.47.2">47:2</a>).</p>
<p>Even so, Manasseh confesses that “none can endure thy menacing wrath against sinners” (Prayer of Manasseh 1:5b, <span class="sc">neb</span>). He recognizes that his idolatry has been evil in God’s eyes all along, even though he has just become aware that he has been “piling sin upon sin” (v 10, <span class="sc">neb</span>). He also knows now that he finds himself in irons and rejected by God because his idolatry has provoked God’s wrath (v 10; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.6">2 Chr 33:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.107.10">Ps 107:10</a>). God’s mercy is his only hope. It is unmeasurable and unfathomable (Prayer of Manasseh 1:6), boundless (v 7, <span class="sc">neb</span>), and great (v 14). God’s mercy is also available, because the Lord himself has “appointed repentance for sinners, that they may be saved” (v 7; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.5.31">Acts 5:31</a>), and for him in particular (v 8).</p>
<p>The heart of the prayer (vv 9-13a), in which he confesses his sin and appeals for forgiveness, contains three memorable lines: “My transgressions abound, O Lord, my transgressions abound. . . . Forgive me, O Lord, forgive me!” The turning point in the prayer comes in verse 11, after his confession of sin. The <span class="sc">rsv</span> preserves the figure of speech: “And now I bend the knee of my heart, beseeching thee for thy kindness.” Despite his unworthiness (vv 9, 14), he pleads with God not to destroy him, nor be eternally angry with him, nor condemn him to the grave, because the Lord is “the God of those who repent” (v 13). Manasseh becomes confident that God, in his goodness and mercy, will save him (v 14), and he shows the appropriate response of a forgiven sinner when he says, “I will praise thee continually all the days of my life” (v 15). A brief doxology about God’s praise and eternal glory concludes the prayer.</p>
<p>Despite its admirable parts, this prayer differs from Christian teaching in one significant way. The author erroneously assumes that there are two categories of people—those who are basically good (the righteous) and those who are basically bad (sinners). The prayer presents Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as righteous men who did not sin and did not need to repent. This is not true, but it shows Jewish thinking prior to Christian preaching (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.9.13">Mt 9:13</a>). Paul made it quite plain that no person is righteous on his own merit, because every person has sinned (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.10-12,21-26">Rom 3:10-12, 21-26</a>). Abraham’s righteousness was not inherent; it came by faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.3">Rom 4:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Phil.3.8-9">Phil 3:8-9</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PREPARATION, D<span class="lc">ay of</span></p>
<p class="fl">Term used in Scripture for the day before the Sabbath. Each of the Gospels refers to a day that it calls “the Preparation” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.62">Mt 27:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.42">Mk 15:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.54">Lk 23:54</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.14,31,42">Jn 19:14, 31, 42</a>), Mark calling it “the day before the Sabbath.” The Jews did not have specific names for the days (preferring to speak of “the first [second, etc.] day of the week.” But the Sabbath was distinctive, and the previous day was used to prepare for this weekly day of rest and worship. Thus, what we call “Friday” the Jews called “Preparation.” What was “prepared” is not said. But as no work could be done on the Sabbath, preparations had to be made for food and other necessities.</p>
<p>“The Preparation of the Passover” (<a href="?bref=John.19.14">Jn 19:14</a>) is often understood to mean “Passover eve,” the day before Passover, just as “the Preparation” means the day before the Sabbath. There appears, however, to be no specific extrabiblical examples of the day before Passover being called “the Preparation” or “the Preparation of the Passover.”</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Presbyter">
  <title>Presbyter*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PRESBYTER*</p>
<p class="fl">NT term referring to an elder in the church. Following the OT pattern of synagogues governed by a council of elders, the church of the NT had officers (<span class="greek">presbuteroi</span><span class="ital">,</span> “older persons”) whose task was to tend the flock of God that was under their care (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.2">1 Pt 5:2</a>). Thus, they were called to labor in preaching and teaching (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.17">1 Tm 5:17</a>); visit, pray over, and anoint the sick (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.14">Jas 5:14</a>); administer famine relief (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.29-30">Acts 11:29-30</a>); and generally oversee the affairs of the church (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.4">15:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.4">16:4</a>). There is evidence to suggest that all elders were of equal status and that the terms “presbyter” and “bishop” were at first used interchangeably (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.17,28">Acts 20:17, 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Phil 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.5-7">Ti 1:5-7</a>). In the second century, however, the presiding presbyter gradually emerged as a distinctive figure with a position of preeminence and as the source of authority. As the years passed, the designation “presbyter” was contracted to that of “priest,” and in churches of the episcopal order it remains so today. It is significant, nevertheless, that the NT nowhere links priestly functions with the office of presbyter. With the spread and development of Christianity, the priest became a powerful figure. With eucharistic theology, there grew up unbiblical accretions. These were exposed and rejected when the Reformers triumphed in the 16th century and stressed the priesthood of all believers. In Protestantism priests became ministers, pastors, or (in more modern times) clergymen. In non-Roman Episcopal churches, “priest” is found again today. Even where it is interpreted differently from Roman usage, most evangelical Anglicans refuse to use it. In Presbyterian and similar churches, the elders (whether teaching or ruling) are still officially called presbyters, and all are of equal status.</p>

<p class="h1">PRESENCE OF GOD, T<span class="lc">he</span></p>
<p class="fl">God’s manifestation of his spiritual being. Since God is spirit, believers experience him by sensing his invisible presence. God also makes himself known in other ways. He appears in nature, particularly in catastrophic forces—fire, lightning, and earthquake (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.11-13">1 Kgs 19:11-13</a>). He also appears in human form (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">Gn 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.32.22-32">32:22-32</a>). So God, who cannot be seen, has chosen ways to reveal himself.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="h3">The Angel of the Lord</p>
<p class="fl">The angel of the Lord was God’s emissary and Israel’s special helper, although it is not said that the same angel is meant in every instance (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.19">Ex 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.20">23:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.2">33:2</a>). After the angel vanishes, Hagar insists that she had seen God himself (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.13">Gn 16:13</a>). In Jacob’s experience the angel identifies himself with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.11-13">31:11-13</a>); while in <a href="?bref=Gen.21.18">Genesis 21:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.22.11">22:11</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.22.35">Numbers 22:35</a>, the “I” of deity signified God’s presence in the angel. There is also oscillation between God and the angel in <a href="?bref=Exod.12.23">Exodus 12:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.48.15-16">Genesis 48:15-16</a>. Here God was temporarily incarnating himself within the form of the angel, assuring his own that he was immediately present with them.</p>
<p class="h3">The Glory of God</p>
<p class="fl">Glory is what God possesses in his own right, a visible extension of his nature, a “concrete” form of his divine presence. The heavens are a visible form of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Pss 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">19:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.5">136:5</a>), for they are his glory. The glory that appeared to Israel as devouring fire on Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.43">Ex 29:43</a>) filled the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">40:34-38</a>). By it God consecrated the tabernacle as the place of his presence. In <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Isaiah 6</a> the glory appears as the normal expression of the divine presence. In Ezekiel the glory is identical with God (<a href="?bref=Ezek.9.3-4">Ez 9:3-4</a>). Throughout the OT the glory of God is the transcendent God making his presence and nearness visible to his own.</p>
<p class="h3">The Face of God</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT “presence” is used to represent the Hebrew word for “face”; when “face” is conjoined with a preposition, it means “in the presence of.” In <a href="?bref=Gen.32.30">Genesis 32:30</a> Jacob saw God “face to face.” A man’s personality and character are made visible on his face. In this sense a man’s face is the man. So, “the angel of his presence [face]” (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.9">Is 63:9</a>) may mean “the angel who is his face,” since the prophet may have intended the identification. The face of God is the revelation of the grace of God. So, when he hides his face, he is withholding his grace. But when he makes his face shine (<a href="?bref=Ps.31.16">Ps 31:16</a>), there is blessing (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.3">44:3</a>). The face of God, then, is the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.14">Ex 33:14</a>). To pray to God in a holy place was to “seek God’s face” (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.6">Ps 24:6</a>), his personal presence. Indeed, this sums up temple worship and private prayer in Israel (<a href="?bref=Ps.63.1-3">63:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.100.2">100:2</a>). The blessing of God consisted in his face shining upon them (<a href="?bref=Num.6.25">Nm 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.3,7,19">Ps 80:3, 7, 19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Name of God</p>
<p class="fl">Among Semites, the equation of the name and the person was a common idea. So also, the name of God was an interchangeable term for God himself, a symbol of his activity in revelation. The linking of man’s worship of God with the divine name of God was the medium of his operation (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.5">Pss 44:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.24">89:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.27">Is 30:27</a>), a designation for the power of God that radiates help and energy universally. God could act by his name. The angel of the Lord’s authority and power functioned because God’s name was in him (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.20-21">Ex 23:20-21</a>). As bearer of the divine name, he made real the hidden presence of God. The temple was the dwelling place of the name (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.36">1 Kgs 11:36</a>), not only because God’s name was invoked there but also because God’s presence—God himself—dwelt there.</p>
<p class="h3">The Spirit of God</p>
<p class="fl">In the Holy Spirit the transcendent God draws near to his people. The Spirit is the medium through whom God’s presence becomes real among his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.11-14">Is 63:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.12">Zec 7:12</a>) and by whom God’s gifts and powers operate among them (<a href="?bref=2Chr.15.1">2 Chr 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.14">20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20">24:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6">Zec 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>). The Spirit was the presence and power of God with his people—God himself acting in accordance with his essential nature. The sinner cannot be in the presence of God without the aid of God’s Holy Spirit; to be deprived of the Holy Spirit is to be deprived of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.11">Ps 51:11</a>). Without the Spirit, communion between God and humans is not possible.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT a new mode of God’s presence is revealed. It is in Jesus Christ the incarnate Word that God is present among his own (<a href="?bref=John.1.14-18">Jn 1:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.6,26">17:6, 26</a>). Jesus’ mission was to reveal God to humanity. This he did through his whole life’s work as well as through his words. His revelation of the name of God was expressed in his own name—Jesus (“The Lord Is Salvation”). And in the person of Jesus the function of the name of God found fulfillment. Christ was the new temple (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.21">2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">Col 2:9</a>). He was the locus of the tabernacling presence of God. But that was only a first installment of the unveiling of God’s presence.</p>
<p>The church now constitutes the temple of God in the NT. Christianity is essentially the religion of the presence of God and of communion with God. The body of Christ, “the spiritual temple” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.22">Eph 2:22</a>), made of “living stones” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>), is the residence of the presence of the glorious God.</p>
<p>And now, the individual Christian is also a temple of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16">2 Cor 6:16</a>). God is especially present in the Christian’s spirit; there God reigns, for there is his kingdom; there he is worshiped, for there his glory and his presence have consecrated the inner being into a temple (see <a href="?bref=John.14.23">Jn 14:23</a>).</p>

  <title>Pride</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PRIDE</p>
<p class="fl">A reasonable or justifiable self-respect; or improper and excessive self-esteem known as conceit or arrogance. The apostle Paul expressed a positive kind of pride when speaking of confidence in Christians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.4">2 Cor 7:4</a>) or of strength in the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.5,9">12:5, 9</a>). However, it is the latter, sinful meaning of “pride” that most frequently appears in the Bible, both in the OT and the NT.</p>
<p>The ten Hebrew and two Greek words generally used for pride refer to being high or exalted in attitude, the opposite of the virtue of humility, which is so often praised and rewarded by God. One other Greek word refers to a person’s being puffed up or inflated with pride or egotism. The idea is that one gives the impression of substance but is really filled only with air (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.2">1 Cor 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.4">13:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.18">Col 2:18</a>).</p>
<p>Pride is basically a sin of attitude and of the heart and spirit. Hence one reads, “Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin” (<a href="?bref=Pr.21.4">Prv 21:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.8">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a> speaks of being proud in spirit and the psalmist declares, “O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty” (<a href="?bref=Ps.131.1">Ps 131:1</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>). Pride is cited in the two lists of the most glaring sins in the Bible. Along with the sins for which God is going to judge the Gentiles, one finds insolence, arrogance, and boasting (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.30">Rom 1:30</a>). Included with the sins that will be prevalent in the last days, Paul includes boasting, arrogance, and conceit (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.2-4">2 Tm 3:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>As so many of the sins of attitude, pride cannot remain internalized. It can infect one’s speech; boasting is one way by which this sin can appear in one’s speaking (see the passages referred to above and also <a href="?bref=Mal.3.13">Mal 3:13</a>). Pride can also appear in the way one looks at another person. Hence, the Scriptures speak of “haughty eyes” in <a href="?bref=Pr.6.17">Proverbs 6:17</a>, or, as it could also be rendered, “a proud look.” The psalmist speaks of a person with haughty looks and arrogant heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.101.5">Ps 101:5</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Pr.30.13">Prv 30:13</a>). Pride may also take the ugly form of contemptible treatment of others (<a href="?bref=Pr.21.24">Prv 21:24</a>). One of the illustrations of this in the Bible is the way in which the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders treated and spoke of those beneath their social level (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.23.5-12">Mt 23:5-12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.34">Jn 9:34</a>). They especially despised tax collectors and sinners.</p>
<p>Outstanding examples of proud people can be found in both Testaments. Pride was the downfall of King Uzziah, who, because of this sin, dared to offer incense on the altar of incense and was smitten with leprosy as his punishment from God (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.16">2 Chr 26:16</a>). Hezekiah, after his healing by the Lord, became proud of heart and brought God’s anger upon himself, Judah, and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Chr.32.25-26">32:25-26</a>). The Pharisee praying in the temple, comparing himself with the humble tax collector, is another example (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.9-14">Lk 18:9-14</a>). Herod’s refusal to give God the glory for his greatness brought judgment from God; Herod was eaten by worms and died for his sin of pride (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.21-23">Acts 12:21-23</a>). In fact, <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.1-26">Ezekiel 28</a>, which describes the pride of the leader of Tyre, is taken by many biblical scholars to refer, in a deeper sense, to the fall of Satan back in the beginning.</p>
<p>Pride can bring about the downfall not only of individuals but also of nations. This was the sin that is specifically mentioned as leading to other sins and that ultimately brought about the removal of both Israel and Judah from the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.16">Is 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.15">5:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.50">Ez 16:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.6">Hos 13:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.11">Zep 3:11</a>). It is also the specific sin that brought about the downfall of the king of Assyria (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.12,33">Is 10:12, 33</a>) and of the king of Moab (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.29">Jer 48:29</a>). Because of its deadliness, Israel is specifically warned against pride and the tendency to forget God that so often stems from it (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.14">Dt 8:14</a>).</p>
<p>In the light of the preceding discussion, it is no surprise to read in the Bible that pride is one of the seven things that the Lord hates (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.17">Prv 6:17</a>). It is also said by two different writers that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (see <a href="?bref=Jas.4.6">Jas 4:6</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.5">1 Pt 5:5</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Pr.3.34">Prv 3:34</a> and <a href="?bref=Pr.18.12">18:12</a>, to which James and Peter may be referring). The words of Mary, the mother of Jesus, in her hymn of praise to God may summarize the attitude of God and the Bible toward pride: “His mighty arm does tremendous things! How he scatters the proud and haughty ones! He has taken princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.51-52">Lk 1:51-52</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

It is also used in the description of the whole church as “a royal priesthood” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>). To ascertain how this usage arose and to see what priesthood means, it is necessary to look briefly at both biblical and theological developments.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the covenant made between God and Israel, the whole people was seen as a “kingdom of priests” and thus a holy people (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>). Within this context, specific priestly activities belonged to three orders—high priest, priest, and Levite. “Priests” were male descendants of Aaron, who was a Levite (<a href="?bref=Num.3.10">Nm 3:10</a>), and “Levites” were other male members of the tribe of Levi. The chief functions of the priesthood took place in the temple. Priests looked after the ceremonial vessels and performed the sacrifices. In doing their duties they dressed in special, symbolic vestments. They were also teachers, passing on the sacred traditions of the nation as well as such matters as medical information (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-15.33">Lv 13–15</a>). The high priest was the spiritual head of Israel and he had special functions, such as entering the Holy of Holies on the Day of Atonement (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">16</a>). The Levites assisted the priests and served the congregation in the temple. They sang the psalms, kept the temple courts clean, helped to prepare certain sacrifices and offerings, and also had a teaching function. Through this threefold order, the priesthood of the nation was exercised. By it the people offered worship to God, made intercessions and petitions, and learned of God’s will. Thus what occurred in every pious home, as the head of the house guided his family in worship, occurred in a larger and more ceremonial way in the temple.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">It is remarkable that the term “priest” is never used in the NT of a minister or order in the church. Certainly the usage with reference to Judaism and paganism continues (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1,6">Acts 4:1, 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.13">14:13</a>), but it is never introduced into the church. The Letter to the Hebrews presents the OT priesthood as fulfilled in Jesus Christ. First of all, he has been appointed high priest by God himself (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.4-6">Heb 5:4-6</a>). Yet his is a superior priesthood to that of Aaron (ch <a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-28">7</a>). Second, being totally sympathetic to the needs of sinful people and tempted in all points like them, he is without sin (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">7:26</a>). Third, instead of offering animal sacrifices to take away sin, he offers himself, as the sinless Lamb, to take away sin. This is a perfect atonement (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.27">7:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.24-28">9:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.10-19">10:10-19</a>).</p>
<p>Not only was the OT sacrificial system fulfilled; it was also finished by the unique, unrepeatable, and unlimited sacrifice of Christ. Having risen from the dead, he is a priest forever (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.17">Heb 7:17</a>) and he remains the same yesterday and today and forever (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.8">13:8</a>). Part of his high priesthood is to offer intercession for his people (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.25">7:25</a>). He is the mediator of a new and better covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.22">7:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.6">8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.15">9:15</a>). Only through him are sinful human beings able to enter the holy presence of God and be accepted as children of God (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">Jn 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.18-20">2 Cor 5:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.5">1 Tm 2:5</a>). Therefore, whatever priesthood Christians have, they have it only in and through Christ, their high priest and Mediator.</p>
<p>The NT (quoted from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>) describes believers as “a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>); “priests to his God and Father” (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.6">Rv 1:6</a>); “a kingdom and priests to our God” (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.10">5:10</a>); “priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years” (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.6">20:6</a>).</p>
<p>What, then, does the priesthood of all believers mean in the NT? The high priesthood of Christ may be defined as his complete dedication and obedience to God, his Father, and unlimited compassion for his fellow human beings. At the center is his sacrificial death on the cross. On this basis and in union with him, the priesthood of Christians is their sacrificial obedience to God; this involves spiritual worship and love of God and compassionate activity and prayer for their fellow human beings. Paul wrote, “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship” (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.1">Rom 12:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Each Christian offers his whole body to Christ and each local church offers itself wholly to Christ, and Christ offers his whole body (the church) to God the Father. Thus, in and by Christ, the priesthood of believers is exercised and made effectual. In the hearts of believers is the indwelling Spirit, and it is in his power that acceptable service and worship is offered. Christ is the pattern of priesthood as well as being high priest.</p>

<p class="h1">PRIESTS AND LEVITES</p>
<p class="fl">Servants of God in the OT. There were three basic classes of religious personnel in ancient Israel: prophets, wise men, and priests and Levites. The classical prophets fulfilled a vocation but were not professionals; they were not paid for their task and functioned only in response to the particular call of God. The wise men were involved in government and education; some of their duties were secular, though they were also involved in moral education. The priests and Levites fulfilled a variety of essentially religious duties and were equivalent approximately to the clergy in modern times. They were professional men and were supported for their full-time religious work.</p>
<p>The role of the priesthood may be seen most clearly in the context of Israelite religion as a whole. At the heart of religion was a relationship with God; to be an Israelite or a Jew was to know and maintain a continuous relationship with the living God. This relationship found its outward expression in a variety of contexts: the covenant, the temple, worship, and every facet of daily life. Thus religion, understood as a relationship, had two perspectives: the relationship with God and that with fellow human beings. It had both a personal and a communal dimension to it. The priests were the guardians and servants of this life of relationship, which was at the heart of OT religion; all their functions can best be understood within the context of a relationship between God and Israel. The prophets, too, were servants of the covenant relationship. While the priests functioned as the normal servants of religion, the prophets’ role was more that of calling a delinquent people back to the relationship with God in times of crisis.</p>
<p>In the OT, there are frequent references to both priests and Levites; in a number of biblical texts, however, the distinction is not clear (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.18.1-8">Dt 18:1-8</a>). From the scholarly point of view, the precise relationship between priests and Levites is a continuing problem that has not yet been fully resolved. In general terms, only the sons of Aaron were to assume the role of priests; all other Levites would have religious functions, though technically they would not be priests. While this distinction is clear in most biblical texts, in others there is lack of certainty and clarity. It is clear, however, that <span class="ital">priests</span> (Levites descended from Aaron) and <span class="ital">Levites</span> (other than the descendants of Aaron) all had professional religious duties to perform. The precise nature of those duties varied from time to time in the course of Israel’s history.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheOriginsofthePriesthood">The Origins of the Priesthood</p>
<p class="fl">The priesthood in Israel began during the time of Moses and Aaron. The exodus from Egypt was not only the liberation of a group of Hebrew slaves but also the birth of the nation of Israel. The nation that was born in the exodus was given its constitution in the covenant of Sinai. The law of this covenant established the foundations and origins of Israelite priesthood. It provides insight into the three basic categories to be considered: the high priest, the priests, and the Levites.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheHighPriest">The High Priest</p>
<p class="fl">Any large and complex organization requires a head or leader, and this was true also of the Hebrew priesthood (though in its early days it was a small organization). The covenant was established through Moses, the prophet, through whom God gave the offer and substance of the covenant relationship; religious life within the covenant was to be the primary responsibility of Aaron, who was the first and chief priest.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of Israel’s priesthood, it is probable that the high priest’s office was relatively informal; he was chief or leader among his fellow priests. The office was significant, nevertheless, and involved a special ritual of investiture, special clothing, and certain special responsibilities. While the high priest’s duties were similar in principle to those of other priests, he had certain exclusive responsibilities. To some extent, his duties were administrative, pertaining to all the priests of whom he had charge. But his position was more weighty than that of an administrator; just as all priests were the servants and guardians of the covenant relationship, so the high priest was chief servant and chief guardian. In his hands rested spiritual responsibility for the entire people of God, and therein lay the true honor and gravity of his position.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="ChestpieceWornByTheHighPriest"/>
<p>This spiritual seniority of the high priest is seen most clearly in certain tasks he undertook within Israel’s life of worship. The clearest example may be seen in the annual observation of the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). On that day alone, the high priest entered the Holy of Holies and, standing before the “mercy seat,” he sought God’s forgiveness and mercy for the whole nation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-19">Lv 16:1-19</a>). It is in that ceremony that Israel’s covenant faith is seen most clearly. Israel’s religion was one of relationship with a holy God, and human evil disrupted that relationship. While all worship and sacrifices throughout the year were concerned with the continuation of the relationship, the Day of Atonement was the most solemn day of the year, in which the attention of all the people focused upon the meaning of their existence. Life held meaning only if the relationship with God could be maintained; the high priest had the great honor and heavy burden of seeking God’s mercy for all Israel.</p>
<p>The special clothing worn by the high priest was symbolic of the nature and importance of his office; although all the symbolism cannot be determined, some of it is made clear in the biblical text. There are three particular themes in the symbolism. The first is beauty. The sense of beauty emerges from the quality and design of all the items of clothing, together with the use of color and precious stones. But beauty is dominant in the breastplate; the Hebrew word translated approximately as “breastplate” has as its basic sense “beauty” or “excellence.” The clothing symbolizes beauty, while beauty describes the office; the two other themes associated with the symbolism bring out the excellence of the office.</p>
<p>The second theme is the role of the priest as representative of Israel before God. This essential dimension of the office of the high priest is explicitly identified in the names of the tribes of Israel in the two onyx stones in the ephod, and in the 12 precious stones attached to the breastplate. The high priest entered God’s presence to seek deliverance from God’s judgment (the breastplate is identified with judgment; <a href="?bref=Exod.28.15">Ex 28:15</a>) for his people and in order to keep the people constantly in God’s remembrance (v <a href="?bref=Exod.28.12">12</a>), as symbolized by the two onyx stones. The third theme is the role of high priest as the representative of God to Israel. This dimension of the office is seen in the Urim and Thummim, kept in the breastpiece, by means of which God made known his will to Israel. The high priest, Aaron, fully robed, was a splendid figure, and the splendor of his garments indicated the magnificence of the office with which he had been entrusted.</p>
<p>The high priesthood was to be passed on within the family (for the high priest was expected to be a married man), although in later history the practice was not always adhered to. On Aaron’s death, the office passed to Eleazar, one of his four sons.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePriests">The Priests</p>
<p class="fl">Priests took office not as the result of a particular vocation but by virtue of priestly descent. Thus the first priests were the four sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. These four were ordained at the same time that Aaron was ordained high priest (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.1">Ex 28:1</a>). Like him, they had special clothing, which was basically similar, though it lacked the distinctive garments of the high priest (the special ephod, the breastpiece, and the crown). The priesthood would be passed down through their sons.</p>
<p>The sanctity of the priestly office was such that it was preserved from degeneration through specific laws. A man must be a descendant of Aaron to be a priest, but he was also required to meet a variety of other qualifications. He would not marry a divorcée or a former prostitute (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.7">Lv 21:7</a>). If he was afflicted by certain kinds of disease or congenital defects, he was barred from priestly office (e.g., blindness, lameness, mutilation, being a hunchback or dwarf; vv <a href="?bref=Lev.21.16-23">16-23</a>). The principle involved was similar to that applying to animals used in sacrifice—only those free from defect or blemish were suitable for divine service.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of the priesthood there is some information provided in the biblical text concerning the specific duties of the priests. Eleazar had overall responsibility for the tabernacle and its offerings (<a href="?bref=Num.4.16">Nm 4:16</a>); assisted Moses in a number of duties, such as numbering the people and dividing the land (<a href="?bref=Num.26.1-2">26:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.32.2">32:2</a>); and later served as an adviser to Joshua. Ithamar was responsible for the construction of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.38.21">Ex 38:21</a>) and supervised the families of the Gershonites and Merarites (<a href="?bref=Num.4.28-33">Nm 4:28-33</a>). Nadab and Abihu, however, died soon after their ordination as a result of a sinful act in their priestly duties (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-7">Lv 10:1-7</a>), which may have been related in part to drunkenness (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.10.8-9">8-9</a>).</p>
<p>Priestly duties, in general, fell into three areas (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.8-10">Dt 33:8-10</a>). First, priests were responsible, in conjunction with the high priest, for declaring God’s will to the people. Second, they had responsibilities in religious education; they were to teach to Israel God’s ordinances and law (v <a href="?bref=Deut.33.10">10</a>). Third, they were to be the servants of the tabernacle, participating in Israel’s sacrifices and worship. There were a number of other duties that may have fallen to them, which they would have shared with the Levites in general.</p>
<p>The priests, along with all other Levites, did not own any land, as did the other Israelite tribes. Their task was to be entirely in the direct service to God. The absence of land, however, meant that they could not support and feed themselves as could other men and women. Consequently, the law specified that they could be supported for their services by the people as a whole. They were to receive, from worshipers, portions of animals that were brought to the tabernacle, as well as corn, wine, oil, and wool.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLevites">The Levites</p>
<p class="fl">This term includes the priests, in a broad sense, for the sons of Aaron belonged to the tribe of Levi. For practical purposes, however, the Levites were those of the tribe other than the priests. The Levites also functioned in the service of the tabernacle, though they had a subordinate position. They, too, were professional men and were paid in money and in kind for their services. Though they did not inherit tribal territory of their own, there were a number of cities set aside for their use (<a href="?bref=Num.35.1-8">Nm 35:1-8</a>), and pasturelands were designated outside those cities for their livestock.</p>
<p>The Levites were divided into three principal families, the descendants of Kohath, Gershon, and Merari (<a href="?bref=Num.4.1-49">Nm 4</a>). Each of these families had particular responsibilities with respect to the care and transport of the tabernacle. The sons of Kohath carried the tabernacle furniture (after it had been covered by the priests), the sons of Gershon cared for the coverings and screens, and the sons of Merari carried and erected the tabernacle’s frame. The priests, by contrast, were responsible for the transportation of the ark of the covenant. The role of each Levite, as servant of the tabernacle, was restricted; he undertook his professional duties between the ages of 25 and 50 (<a href="?bref=Num.8.24-26">8:24-26</a>).</p>
<p>Although many of the duties of the Levites were of a mundane nature, they also had a very significant religious role. The law required that all the firstborn, including firstborn sons, be given to God, recalling the slaying of the firstborn at the exodus from Egypt. The Levites’ role in religion was that of being accepted by God in the place of the firstborn sons of Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.3.11-13">Nm 3:11-13</a>); their cattle, too, were accepted in place of the Israelites’ firstborn cattle. In the census taken in the time of Moses, the firstborn Israelites exceeded the number of the Levites, and a five-shekel redemption fee had to be paid into the priestly coffers for each person in excess (vv <a href="?bref=Num.3.40-51">40-51</a>). The representative and substitutionary nature of the Levites can be seen in Israelite religion. Like the priests, they played a part in the larger activity of mediation between God and Israel.</p>
<p>The law of Deuteronomy specifies a number of duties that may have fallen upon both priests and Levites (though the texts are ambiguous). These duties included participation in the activity of the law courts as judges, perhaps with special reference to religious crimes (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.8-9">Dt 17:8-9</a>), taking care of the Book of the Law (v <a href="?bref=Deut.17.18">18</a>), controlling the lives and health of lepers (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.8">24:8</a>), and participating directly in the conduct of covenant renewal ceremonies (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.9">27:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheHistoryoftheInstitution">The History of the Institution</p>
<p class="fl">In theory, the covenant law of Moses determined the nature and course of the offices of priests and Levites for the future history of Israel. In practice, however, changing historical circumstances and changes in the shape of Israel’s religion and culture altered the shape of the priesthood and the role of the Levites from time to time. And even more significantly, the persons who held the offices shaped them and their effectiveness through their faithfulness or unfaithfulness.</p>
<p class="h3">The Priesthood before the Monarchy</p>
<p class="fl">In the time of Joshua, the priests continued to undertake their important task of carrying the ark of the covenant. The Levites assisted in the division and allocation of the newly acquired land among the Israelite tribes. In <a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-45">Joshua 21</a>, there is a detailed list of the allocation of cities to both priests and Levites, in fulfillment of the earlier legislation. In the days of the settlement, beyond the Conquest, there is some evidence that the Levites took over the priestly duty of transporting the ark (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.15">1 Sm 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.24">2 Sm 15:24</a>).</p>
<p>The writer of the book of Judges has recorded two stories that illuminate the lives of particular Levites. The first, the story of Micah (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-18.31">Jgs 17–18</a>), describes the establishment of a local shrine in which Micah’s son was appointed as a priest (though he was not of Levite or Aaronic descent). Later, Micah hired an itinerant Levite to function as a priest in his shrine, though subsequently that Levite was persuaded to serve the tribe of Dan as a priest. It is difficult to fit the details of this story into the theoretical model of priests and Levites, though the story may illustrate the confused state of Israel’s religion at the time. What is particularly significant is that the role of the Levite-priest was primarily oracular (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.5-6">18:5-6</a>). The second story in Judges is the rather horrifying account of a Levite and his concubine (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-30">19</a>). The story illustrates the moral decline and lack of law and order in Israel at the time, but it sheds little light on the role of the Levites.</p>
<p>More information is provided about the priesthood during the 11th century <span class="era">BC</span>, immediately before the establishment of the monarchy. The tabernacle (by now probably a semipermanent structure) and the ark of the covenant were located in Shiloh. The priest in charge of the sanctuary in Shiloh was Eli, who may have been a descendant of Aaron’s son Ithamar. His two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, also served as priests, indicating that the principle of family descent was still operative with respect to the priesthood. But although Eli was a faithful priest, his two sons abused the office.</p>
<p>The precise role of Samuel in this period is unclear. He was primarily a judge and a prophet, but it is difficult to determine whether he was also a priest. In the historical narrative, he is not called a priest, though <a href="?bref=Ps.99.6">Psalm 99:6</a> might be interpreted to indicate his priestly office. There are a number of passages, however, that indicate he acted like a priest. For example, he offered sacrifices (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.9-10">1 Sm 7:9-10</a>); as a young man he served in the sanctuary of Shiloh and wore an ephod (ch <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1-36">2</a>). Furthermore, one of the biblical genealogies implies priestly descent (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.23-30">1 Chr 6:23-30</a>). Nevertheless, he is not normally identified as a priest and the introduction to his story refers to him as an Ephraimite, by descent from his father (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1 Sm 1:1</a>), not a Levite. If the priest is perceived as a permanent servant of the sanctuary, as was Eli, then it is clear that Samuel was not a priest. But the priestly role of Samuel may perhaps be related to the fact that his mother “lent” him to God (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.28">28</a>) while he was still a boy.</p>
<p class="h3">The Priesthood during the Time of David and Solomon</p>
<p class="fl">Several radical changes took place during the reign of David and Solomon. These were a result, primarily, of the establishment of a permanent temple in Jerusalem and the installation of the ark of the covenant there. During the time of Saul, the first king of Israel, the social structure was essentially the same as it had been in the time of the judges. Saul, as king, was a military leader, but his relationship to religion and the priesthood was not clearly determined.</p>
<p>David changed the situation in many important respects. After his capture of the city of Jerusalem, he made that place the political and religious capital of his nation. The religious centrality of Jerusalem was assured by moving the ark of the covenant there, together with the tabernacle. Jerusalem now became the permanent location of the ark, and therefore the permanent center of religion; at the same time, the various regional shrines, which had developed in the premonarchical period, were gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>These changes had numerous implications for the priesthood and the Levites. During David’s reign, there were two principal priests, Abiathar and Zadok. Abiathar, a former priest of Nob, had joined David before his rise to power; he appears to have been a descendant of Eli, and through him of Ithamar, one of Aaron’s sons. Zadok’s background is less clear, though his lineage appears to go back to Aaron’s other son, Eleazar. These two priests are always named together in the texts describing David’s reign, and Zadok is always mentioned before Abiathar. Although neither is explicitly identified as high priest in the ancient texts, there is some evidence to suggest that Abiathar functioned as high priest (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.35">1 Kgs 2:35</a>); in NT times, he is identified as such (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.26">Mk 2:26</a>). Zadok, during David’s reign, may have been particularly responsible for the care of the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.24-25">2 Sm 15:24-25</a>). These two priests had a significant position in David’s royal establishment; they may also have shared overall responsibility for the priests, whose lives were now centered on the Jerusalem temple.</p>
<p>Much of David’s time was focused upon the preparations for building a permanent temple for God. In the preparation for the temple, and in its completion during the reign of King Solomon, the new activities of the Levites may be seen. (The construction of a permanent temple automatically removed their former responsibilities related to the care and transportation of the tabernacle.) Large numbers of Levites were employed as laborers in the actual building of the temple. Others found new tasks in the worship of God in the tabernacle during David’s reign and in the temple upon its completion. To the Levites, and especially to Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, was given primary responsibility for the music of worship; this involved not only singing but also the playing of a variety of instruments in the temple’s orchestra or band. The Levites had also a variety of other tasks; they worked as gatekeepers at the sanctuary, assisted the priests in the preparation of sacrifices, kept the sanctuary clean, and functioned as general administrative and legal officers (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.1-32">1 Chr 23:1-32</a>). Other Levites functioned as bankers, with primary responsibility for the temple treasuries (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.20-28">26:20-28</a>).</p>
<p>Following David’s death, there was a dispute over the royal succession, from which Solomon emerged as the new king. During his reign, the temple was brought to its completion and the regular worship of the nation was conducted there. In the matter of succession, however, Abiathar had supported a losing candidate, and when Solomon was made king, he lost his important office in the royal court. During Solomon’s reign, the control of the priesthood passed into the hands of Zadok.</p>
<p class="h3">The Priesthood during the Divided Monarchy</p>
<p class="fl">The great empire, which had been built by David and maintained by Solomon, collapsed after Solomon’s death. From the ruins, two new and relatively insignificant states emerged. The southern kingdom, Judah, retained Jerusalem as its capital and the temple as its center of worship. The northern kingdom, Israel, located its first capital at Shechem, from where it was later moved to Tirzah.</p>
<p>In the southern state of Judah, the priests and Levites continued to function normally within the Jerusalem temple. The office of high priest continued to be passed on by descent within the family of Zadok, who had held office in Solomon’s reign. The continuity of office in this family was to be retained down into the time of the second temple, when the Zadokite succession was interrupted about 171 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nevertheless, for all the continuity of religion in Jerusalem, all was not well with religion in Judah, neither during the reign of its first king, Rehoboam, nor during the reigns of his successors. During Rehoboam’s reign, there was a decline in religion and also in the priesthood, when popular forms of religion were introduced as a result of foreign influence (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.22-24">1 Kgs 14:22-24</a>). The history of the southern kingdom was marked by periods of religious decline followed by reform, often as a result of the activities of the prophets. The role of the priesthood was all too rarely one of spiritual leadership, and the priests themselves were often the subject of criticism by the prophets (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.2.8,26">Jer 2:8, 26</a>).</p>
<p>The northern kingdom, whose first king was Jeroboam I, inevitably had to introduce some radical changes in religion. Jeroboam could not recognize the temple of Jerusalem, partly because it lay outside his state and partly because it was intimately associated with the royal line of David. Jeroboam established two principal shrines in his kingdom, both of which were to retain importance during the relatively short life of the northern kingdom (200 years). The first was at Bethel, in the southern part of his kingdom near the border of Judah (it was only about 12 miles, or 19.3 kilometers, north of Jerusalem). The second shrine, or sanctuary, was at Dan, in the far northern part of his kingdom.</p>
<p>Both these sanctuaries had ancient associations with the Hebrew traditions. Bethel is referred to as early as the time of Abram (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.8">Gn 12:8</a>), and the sanctuary at Dan is known from the history of the judges (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">Jgs 18</a>). There may indeed have been priests and Levites still residing in these two places, descendants of the former servants of the sanctuaries. But Jeroboam established a non-Levitical priesthood to serve in these sanctuaries and in various smaller shrines or “high places,” thereby cutting off the religious tradition of the northern state even more radically from that of Judah. The royal sanctuary at Bethel, so close to the Jerusalem temple, may have been set up in deliberate competition with the Judean sanctuary.</p>
<p>The history of the priesthood in the northern kingdom is no more impressive than that of Judah. Many of the prophets, including Amos, Hosea, and Jeremiah, condemned the northern sanctuaries and their priests. Hosea was forceful in his condemnation: “As marauders lie in ambush for a man, so do bands of priests; they murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes” (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.9">Hos 6:9</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Those to whom the spiritual lives of the chosen people had been entrusted only rarely lived up to their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="h3">Priests and Levites during and after the Exile</p>
<p class="fl">The northern kingdom came to its end in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, defeated by the armies of Assyria, but religious life continued in Judah for a while longer. Eventually, the end of the southern state came about 586 <span class="era">BC</span>; the defeat of the state by the Babylonians was accompanied by the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.20">Lam 2:20</a>). The Babylonian commander took Seraiah, the high priest, and Zephaniah, his assistant, to Riblah, where, along with other officials, they were executed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.18-21">2 Kgs 25:18-21</a>). Then a policy of exile was established by the Babylonians; the most important and influential people of Judah were deported to Babylon, while the less significant were allowed to remain, for they were unlikely to cause trouble. Of those exiled from Judah, many may have been priests (<a href="?bref=Jer.29.1">Jer 29:1</a>), for they were men of influence. By way of contrast, it seems likely that a much smaller number of Levites was exiled, reflecting perhaps their inferior social position.</p>
<p>In the city of Jerusalem there was little normal religious life during the years of the exile; the altar had been destroyed and was not restored until after the exile. No doubt some kind of activity continued, but it was an impoverished form of religion. Most of the priests were in exile in Babylon, but they could not function, for there was no temple or sanctuary. Ezekiel implies that God himself was the only “sanctuary” for the exiles (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.16">Ez 11:16</a>). Not until the return from exile and the restoration of Jerusalem and its temple could the normal functions of priests and Levites resume.</p>
<p>When the Babylonian Empire was defeated, the new Persian conquerors instituted a policy whereby the Hebrew exiles could return to their homeland. Of those returning, 4,289 are designated as priests and members of priestly families, while only 341 were Levites (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.36-42">Ezr 2:36-42</a>); the imbalance probably reflects the imbalance in the number of those exiled initially. Under Joshua (Jeshua), the priest, and Zerubbabel, work began on the restoration. The priests played a significant role in the first year of the return, in the restoration of the altar in Jerusalem, so that sacrifice and worship to God could resume. Once the altar had been restored, the work began on the temple itself in the second year of the return. In this work, both the priests and the Levites were involved, and the laying of new foundations for the temple began. When the foundation had been laid, both priests, in their vestments, and Levites, in their role as singers and musicians, participated in the ceremony of dedication (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.8-13">3:8-13</a>). Again, when the temple had been rebuilt, both priests and Levites participated in the ceremony of dedication (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.16-18">6:16-18</a>). The restoration, however, was concerned with more than buildings; it also involved a moral and religious component. Though priests and Levites helped in this task, they were also affected by it. Many, for example, had married foreign wives (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1">9:1</a>), and thus had to conform to Ezra’s reform laws.</p>
<p>To some extent, the priests and Levites resumed their normal duties in the worship of the postexilic period. The priests were engaged in the conduct of the temple worship. The Levites assisted, as temple servants (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.3">Neh 11:3</a>), as treasurers and collectors of tithes (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.37-39">10:37-39</a>), and as instructors or teachers of the law of God (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.7-9">8:7-9</a>). Nevertheless, the history of the priesthood after the exile is not free of blemish. Condemnation of the abuses of the priestly office was delivered by the prophet Malachi (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.6-2.9">Mal 1:6–2:9</a>). Malachi catalogues a list of priestly evils reminiscent of the evil priests who lived during the time of the monarchy.</p>
<p>The office of high priest continued after the exile among the descendants of Zadok, being held first by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>). The different political circumstances, however, changed the nature of the high priestly office. Whereas in the days of the monarchy the high priest was subservient to the king, there was no king, in the proper sense, after the exile. From a political perspective, the Jews were members of a province or colony; for practical purposes, they were a community based upon a common religion. The high priest was no longer subject to the secular authority of a Jewish king, but his religious authority was considerable, and in some ways his functions were similar to those of a king in preexilic times.</p>
<p class="h3">The Priesthood in the Maccabean Period</p>
<p class="fl">During the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, some changes took place in the priesthood, particularly with respect to the office of high priest, which marked the end of the OT era and set the background for the NT period. Judea, in the second century, was ruled by the Seleucid kings, who had inherited a portion of the massive Greek Empire established by Alexander the Great. The Judean province was controlled internally under the high priesthood, whose authority was received from the Seleucid kings.</p>
<p>For the first three decades of the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the high priesthood remained with the Zadokite line of descent. The high priests were members of the (Zadokite) Oniad family: first, Onias III (198–174 <span class="era">BC</span>); then Jason, brother of Onias III (174–171 <span class="era">BC</span>). It was in the period of Jason that there began a series of events that would terminate the Zadokite tradition.</p>
<p>Onias III had opposed the Hellenization policy of Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), which threatened to undermine the Jewish faith. Antiochus replaced Onias by Jason, who in effect purchased the high priesthood from the Seleucid king. In purchasing the priestly office, Jason had set a dangerous precedent; although he was of Zadokite descent, his act implied that the office could be bought and that descent was not vital. The opponents of Jason, the Tobiads, were able to remove him from office and have their own candidate, Menelaus (who was not a Zadokite), appointed in his place. This act resulted in a civil war between those supporting Jason and those supporting Menelaus, and the war in turn culminated in ruthless repressive measures by Antiochus Epiphanes; there were massacres in Jerusalem, and the temple was desecrated (167 <span class="era">BC</span>). The desecration of the temple led to the Maccabean revolt, as a result of which the Jews regained their independence for a short time. Menelaus retained the office of high priest until 161 <span class="era">BC</span> and was succeeded by Alcimus (161–159 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>There then followed a period during which there was no high priest for seven years. The political climate, however, was such that it became unlikely that the Zadokite line would ever regain the high priesthood, which had been established in the time of King Solomon. The Maccabean Jonathan gained control of Jerusalem, and in 152 <span class="era">BC</span>, with the approval of the Seleucid king, he was formally invested with the high priest’s robes of office. He was succeeded as high priest and ruler by his brother Simon in 143 <span class="era">BC</span>, who also held the office with the approval of the Seleucids (Demetrius II). But in the third year of his reign (140 <span class="era">BC</span>), the high priesthood of Simon received public approval in a great religious assembly, and the family of Simon became “high priest forever” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.41-47">1 Macc 14:41-47</a>). That event marked the real termination of the Zadokite tradition and the foundation of the Hasmonean line.</p>
<p>The establishment of the high priestly office outside the Zadokite line did not go without challenge. It is probable that a sect within Judaism, now known as the Essenes, was born in reaction to the high priesthood of Simon. The Essenes (better known for the Dead Sea Scrolls) appear to have been founded by a Zadokite priest who rejected the authenticity and authority of Simon. Thus, in a limited sense, the Zadokite priests continued to survive.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePriesthoodinNewTestamentTimes">The Priesthood in New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">In the early NT period, both priests and Levites continued to function within the Jewish religion. Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, was a priest belonging to the division of Abijah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Lk 1:5</a>), and his wife was also of priestly descent. When Zechariah was visited by an angel, he was engaged at the time in priestly duties in the Jerusalem temple—various divisions of priests took responsibility for the temple services for a period of time and then returned to their homes (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.23">23</a>), as another division took over. The distinction between priests and Levites is also maintained in the NT (<a href="?bref=John.1.19">Jn 1:19</a>) and appears in Jesus’ parable concerning the Good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.31-32">Lk 10:31-32</a>). Both priests and Levites were among the earliest converts to Christianity; Barnabas was a Levite from Cyprus (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.36">Acts 4:36</a>), and several priests responded to the proclamation of the gospel (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.7">6:7</a>).</p>
<p>The office of high priest is frequently referred to in the NT. Several high priests are named, the plurality of current and former holders of the office reflecting the nature of the position as an essentially political appointment (as distinct from its oldest definition, that of an office passing from father to son on the death of the father). The two most significant high priests in the NT are those who held office during the lifetime of Jesus. Annas was high priest about <span class="era">AD</span> 6 to 15, but even after he ceased to hold the office formally, he continued to exert considerable influence through his son-in-law, the high priest Caiaphas (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 18–36). Both were significant figures in the trial of Jesus. At a later date, Ananias, son of Nedebaeus, was high priest (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 47–58) and president of the Sanhedrin during the time in which Paul was brought to trial.</p>
<p>The priesthood held considerable authority in NT times. Most internal and religious matters in the Roman province of Judea were within the authority of the Sanhedrin, which functioned as a kind of provincial government, though its powers were limited in certain matters by Rome. Its membership included the ruling and former high priests and a large number of Sadducees, many of whom belonged to influential priestly families. This priestly influence in the Sanhedrin was indicative of the important role of the temple in Jewish life during the first century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 70, following the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, a radical change came about in the significance of the priesthood in Judaism. The end of the temple removed in effect the purpose for the existence of the priesthood. Although the priesthood continued after a fashion until the Bar-Kochba rebellion in <span class="era">AD</span> 135, its days were numbered after <span class="era">AD</span> 70. Since the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, Judaism has developed without priests, and its course down to the present century has been charted by the rabbis, the spiritual descendants of the Pharisees.</p>

<p class="h1">PRIMOGENITURE*</p>
<p class="fl">Word not found in the Bible; derived from the Greek translation of the Hebrew word for “firstborn.” Primogeniture refers specifically to the exclusive right of inheritance that belonged to the firstborn male. If the firstborn died, the next oldest living male did not receive that exclusive right; neither did a female if she were the firstborn; nor the firstborn if he was born of a concubine or of a slave woman (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.21.10">Gn 21:10</a>). That the Scriptures attached much importance to the rights of the firstborn (primogeniture) can be seen in the distinction drawn between the firstborn and other sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.15">Gn 10:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.13">25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.15">36:15</a>), the double portion to be given to the firstborn (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>), as well as the paternal blessing given to them (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-14">Gn 21:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-29">27:1-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.48.18">48:18</a>).</p>

  <title>Principalities and Powers*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS*</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase familiarized by the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, occurring several times in Paul’s writings, and expressed by means of three Greek synonyms. The concept of principalities is signified by <span class="greek">exousia</span> and <span class="greek">archai</span><span class="ital">,</span> while powers is represented by <span class="greek">dunamis</span><span class="ital">.</span> In the NT, <span class="greek">exousia</span> describes the power inherent in authority as something confirmed by or derived from a position of prominence. There is nothing evil about this kind of authority; on the contrary, it is essentially right both morally and spiritually (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.23">Mt 21:23</a>). It thus applies most appropriately to the authority of the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.6">Mt 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.10">Mk 2:10</a>), of the apostles (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.8">2 Cor 10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.10">13:10</a>), and of human government (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.8.9">Mt 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.20">Lk 20:20</a>). <span class="greek">Archai</span> has several meanings but occurs 12 times in the sense of “command,” “rule,” or “sovereignty,” 9 of which (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.38">Rom 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.24">1 Cor 15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.21">Eph 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.10">3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.16">Col 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.10,15">2:10, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.1">Ti 3:1</a>) appear in Paul’s letters. Finally <span class="greek">dunamis</span><span class="ital">,</span> a common word for power, denotes the ability or strength to achieve an impressive goal (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.15">Mt 25:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.12">Acts 3:12</a>).</p>
<p>By using the expression “principalities and powers,” Paul was referring to the hierarchy of supernatural agencies, such as angelic beings, who worship and serve the Creator of the universe. Some commentators have divided this hierarchy into five categories, namely thrones, principalities, powers, authorities, and dominions. This categorization, however, can be arrived at only by general inference, since there is nothing in Scripture that points directly to such distinct groups. In using the phrase, Paul was probably expressing the cosmic lordship of Jesus in as colorful and dramatic a manner as possible.</p>
<p>In giving Jesus a name above every other name, Paul was demonstrating the supreme lordship of Christ over all created beings, whether good or bad (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.11">Rom 14:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.10">Phil 2:10</a>). As their Creator, the heavenly hosts were his subjects, acknowledging him as Lord of the universe. This affirmation was important for the Colossians, whose theology had apparently been tainted by unbiblical speculation (<a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Col 2:8</a>). The truth is that in Jesus there resided all the fullness of God, and this is transmitted to believers through the Lord’s Spirit.</p>

<p class="fl">Christian couple who were friends and possibly converts of the apostle Paul during his ministry at Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-3">Acts 18:1-3</a>). They are always mentioned together in the NT. Priscilla’s personal character or her leadership role in the church may account for her name coming before her husband’s in four out of six references (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18,26">Acts 18:18, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.3">Rom 16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19">2 Tm 4:19</a>).</p>
<p>Aquila was a Jew and a native of Pontus in Asia Minor. He had been expelled from Rome by the <span class="era">AD</span> 49 edict of Claudius (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). Suetonius records that the emperor “banished from Rome all the Jews, who were continually making disturbances at the instigation of one Chrestus.” From Rome, Aquila and Priscilla went to Corinth, where Paul (on his second missionary journey) met them. There they lived together and worked at the same trade of making tents. After such close association with Paul, they were able to instruct even the learned Apollos, a Jewish teacher who then became a Christian (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-28">24-28</a>).</p>
<p>Both Priscilla and Aquila were Paul’s loyal friends and trusted coworkers (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.3-4">Rom 16:3-4</a>). When he left Corinth, they accompanied him and remained at Ephesus after he returned to Syria (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18-19">Acts 18:18-19</a>). When Paul wrote the First Letter to Corinth, they were still at Ephesus, where their home was used as a place for Christians to gather (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>). Since the decree of Claudius was temporary, Priscilla and Aquila were again in Rome when Paul wrote to the Roman Christians (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.3">Rom 16:3</a>). When the Second Letter to Timothy was written, they were again in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19">2 Tm 4:19</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PRIZE</p>
<p class="fl">Reward given the winner of a contest. In the ancient Greek games (the Olympian and Isthmian), the prize usually consisted of a simple wreath woven with olive branches. The apostle Paul transposed this technical term from the athletic arena into the language of the early church for illustrative purposes. He alone uses the word, and in only two related passages: <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.24">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>, where he employs it literally, and <a href="?bref=Phil.3.14">Philippians 3:14</a>, where he applies it metaphorically.</p>
<p>Comparing the living of the Christian life to the running of a footrace, Paul exhorts his readers to live so that they may win the prize. The prize itself, whether defined as “eternal life” or “heavenly perfection” or “resurrection glory,” is a gift of grace; therefore, Paul’s figure of the race and the reward cannot be pressed to imply that man’s effort is the causative agent in the securing of the prize (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.16">Rom 9:16</a>), but only that strenuous effort must be exercised if the prize is to be enjoyed. The purpose of the illustration is to summon believers to live the Christian faith with the same self-denial, supreme exertion, and single-minded concentration as that manifested by the winner of the prize in the Grecian games.</p>

<p class="h1">PROMISE</p>
<p class="fl">Declaration by one person to another that something will or will not be done, giving the person to whom it is made the right to expect the performance of whatever has been specified.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TypesofPromise">Types of Promise</p>
<p class="fl">In biblical usage there are scattered examples of promises that people give either to one another (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.22.17">Nm 22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.4.7">Est 4:7</a>) or to God (e.g., <a href="?bref=Neh.5.12">Neh 5:12</a>), but the promises that God gives to man are far more significant. These divine promises are absolutely trustworthy because the one who gives them is totally able to perform that which he has promised (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.21">Rom 4:21</a>).</p>
<p>Divine promises in Scripture assure their recipients of many spiritual and temporal benefits, including sonship (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16-7.1">2 Cor 6:16–7:1</a>), forgiveness of sin (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.9">1 Jn 1:9</a>), answer to prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.9">Lk 11:9</a>), deliverance from temptations (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.13">1 Cor 10:13</a>), sustaining grace for difficult times (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.9">2 Cor 12:9</a>), provision for all needs (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.19">Phil 4:19</a>), reward for obedience (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">Jas 1:12</a>), and eternal life (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.29-30">Lk 18:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.22-23">Rom 6:22-23</a>). God’s promises are certain and sure, but participation in their blessing often requires that certain conditions on which they are predicated be met. Divine promises also are not always guarantees of blessing. Indeed, there are promises announcing the certainty of judgment on those who refuse to obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.8-9">2 Thes 1:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the promises of God, which have subjective and individual application to many different people in widely different times and places, there are a great many promises that pertain to the programmatic unfolding of God’s plan of redemption in a grand procession of historical events. These promises have neither repeated applications nor conditional natures. In such cases, promise becomes nearly synonymous with prophecy, and promises of this type, along with their subsequent fulfillment, are intricately intertwined in the entire fabric of redemptive history.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PromisesintheOldTestament">Promises in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The highlights of the promise theme in the OT can be seen in the promise of what is often termed the protevangelium (i.e., the first announcement of the gospel) given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden immediately after the fall into sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>). Subsequent promises are the covenants God made with Abraham (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-20">12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">17</a>) and with David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sm 7</a>), followed by the promise of a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.1-40">Jer 31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Protevangelium</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15b</a> says: “Your [Satan’s] offspring and her [Eve’s] offspring will be enemies. He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This statement is a promise that at some future time the offspring of the woman will crush Satan. The offspring of the woman is individualized in the “he” of the last phrase. “He” shall strike you (i.e., Satan) on the head, although Satan will inflict a wound on the offspring of the woman. Here, then, is the promise that gives Adam and Eve, as well as their descendants, the basis to expect the eventual destruction of their adversary Satan through their offspring.</p>
<p class="h3">The Promise to Abraham</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-7">Genesis 12:1-7</a> Abraham is told to leave his people and country and to go to a land that the Lord would show to him. God, in turn, promises him that (1) his offspring would become a great nation; (2) he would be blessed and his name made great; (3) through him other nations would be blessed; and (4) the land of Canaan would be given to his descendants. Of particular significance among these promises given to Abraham is that through his offspring he will bless many nations. This promise is repeated five times in the book of Genesis (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gn 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.18">18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.22.18">22:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.4">26:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.14">28:14</a>) and points back to the promise of <a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</a> as well as forward to Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">The Promise to David</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Samuel 7</a>, God gave a promise to King David that his dynasty would endure forever (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sm 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.34-37">Ps 89:34-37</a>). It is with this Davidic covenant that the promised line, which had previously run from Adam through Seth, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, is now narrowed to the royal line of the house of David. David is to be the ancestor of the Messiah-King to come (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.3,27-37">Ps 89:3, 27-37</a>). David thus became a central figure in the history of God’s plan to redeem the world. Jesus Christ is referred to as the son of David, the son of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Promise of a New Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-37">Jeremiah 31:31-37</a>, it is promised that in future days the Lord would make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah. The content of this new covenant reemphasizes and extends the basic promises of the former covenant: “I will be their God, and they will be my people. . . . I will forgive their wickedness and will never again remember their sins” (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.31.33-34">33-34</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). It would appear that the “new covenant” of Jeremiah is to be viewed as a restatement of the same basic promises included in the Abrahamic and Davidic covenants.</p>
<p>The new covenant was inaugurated with the first advent of Christ, and believers in Christ are now recipients by the Holy Spirit of the blessings of that new covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-13">Heb 8:6-13</a>). The complete and final realization of these blessings in all their fullness awaits the return of Christ, the complete establishment of his kingdom in its outward and final form, and the blessedness of life in the new heavens and new earth. In the intervening time, God’s people live in a day in which some of the benefits of the age to come are a present reality but the fullness of the new age is yet future.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePromiseThemeintheNewTestament">The Promise Theme in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">New Testament writers refer to the OT promises in a way that indicates that they did not view these promises as separate and isolated assertions but rather as portions of a unitary promise that is ultimately fulfilled in Christ (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.54-55,69-73">Lk 1:54-55, 69-73</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.23,32-33">Acts 13:23, 32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.6-7">26:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.20">2 Cor 1:20</a>). Jesus is the fulfillment of the promises made to the patriarchs and David, and these promises are accordingly to be viewed as having a single focal point in him.</p>
<p>In the books of Galatians and Ephesians, Paul develops this idea in more detail, saying to the Gentile Christians that they are made “heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.6">Eph 3:6</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). In fact, Paul says that Gentiles who trust in Christ are incorporated into the seed of Abraham and are thus heirs according to the promise (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.29">Gal 3:29</a>), and he even goes so far as to equate the gospel with the promise given to Abraham when he states, “The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: ‘All nations will be blessed through you’ ” (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.8">Gal 3:8</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). These and other NT texts establish the close connection between the coming of Christ and the fulfillment of the promise. The promises of God find their point of convergence in Christ and all that he accomplished, and will yet accomplish, for his people.</p>
<p>One further aspect of the promise particularly emphasized in the NT concerns the coming of the Holy Spirit. Paul refers to believers as sealed with the promised Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>), and as receiving the promise of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.14">Gal 3:14</a>). The gift of the Holy Spirit is not only the fulfillment of an OT promise (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">Is 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.27">Ez 36:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>), and that of Christ himself (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.49">Lk 24:49</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.16,20">Jn 14:16, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.4">Acts 1:4</a>), but it is also itself a promise of something yet future. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit’s presence within the believer as a guarantee of our inheritance (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.14">Eph 1:14</a>). The Holy Spirit is the “firstfruit” of future glory (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Rom 8:23</a>).</p>
<p>One final aspect of the promise theme in the NT concerns the assurance of Christ’s second advent and the establishment of the new heavens and the new earth (cf. <a href="?bref=John.14.1-3">Jn 14:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.4,9,13">2 Pt 3:4, 9, 13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PROPHECY</p>
<p class="fl">Term, along with its English cognates (“prophet,” “to prophesy,” “prophetism,” and “prophetic”), derived from a group of Greek words that, in secular Greek, mean “speak forth,” “proclaim,” “announce.” In biblical Greek, however, these terms always carry the connotation of speaking, proclaiming, or announcing something under the influence of spiritual inspiration.</p>

<p class="h2" id="ProphecyintheOldTestament">Prophecy in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">One of the clearest and most significant statements on the nature of prophetic inspiration in the OT is found in <a href="?bref=Num.12.6-8">Numbers 12:6-8</a>: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to them, ‘Now listen to me! Even with prophets, I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> communicate by visions and dreams. But that is not how I communicate with my servant Moses. He is entrusted with my entire house. I speak to him face to face, directly and not in riddles! He sees the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as he is’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Several important insights into the nature of prophetic inspiration are found in this passage: (1) The prophetic gift of Moses was unique in that he alone received revelations directly from God. (2) Ordinarily, prophetic revelation was received through the medium of a dream or a vision. (3) The meaning of prophetic revelation is not always completely clear; prophecy is sometimes ambiguous.</p>
<p>Further insight into the nature of prophetic revelation is found in <a href="?bref=Deut.18.18">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>: “I [God] will raise up for them a prophet like you [Moses] from among their brethren; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). While this passage is of interest because Jesus was identified as “the prophet like Moses” who came in fulfillment of this prediction (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.22">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.37">7:37</a>), the more immediate historical reference is to the succession of prophets that guided Israel from Joshua to Malachi. The phrase “I will put my words in his mouth” refers to the process of divine inspiration and is reminiscent of the common OT prophetic formula “the word of the Lord came to [such and such a prophet]” (for examples, see <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.10">1 Sm 15:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.11">2 Sm 24:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.9">1 Kgs 19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.1.1">Jon 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.1,20">2:1, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.1,8">Zec 7:1, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.1">8:1</a>). A true prophet is one who speaks (or repeats) all that God has told him.</p>
<p class="h3">Modes of Prophetic Inspiration</p>
<p class="fl">Dreams were a commonly recognized mode of inspiration throughout the ancient world, though they were more highly regarded in Greece than in ancient Israel. Revelatory dreams in the Bible fall into two major categories: (1) dreams whose meaning is self-evident, and (2) symbolic dreams that usually require the expertise of an interpreter of dreams. Both types normally involve both visual and auditory elements. In those dreams whose meaning is self-evident, normally a supernatural being (God or an angel) appears to the dreamer and speaks to him or her in a straightforward manner.</p>
<p>More frequently, revelatory dreams have symbolic elements that require interpretation. The two great dream interpreters of the OT are Joseph and Daniel; the latter is clearly a prophet. The two symbolic dreams that Joseph himself dreamed (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.5-11">Gn 37:5-11</a>) had sufficiently self-evident meaning so that his brothers and father were able to interpret them immediately. More complex were the dreams of the butler and baker (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.1-19">40:1-19</a>) and of Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.1-36">41:1-36</a>), which Joseph was able to interpret with the help of God. Similarly, Daniel was enabled to interpret the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.25-45">Dn 2:25-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.4-27">4:4-27</a>). The skill in interpreting such dreams was attributed by both Joseph and Daniel to God (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.8">Gn 40:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.16,25">41:16, 25</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.27-30">Dn 2:27-30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.4.9">4:9</a>). While dreams are used almost interchangeably with visions in referring to modes of prophetic inspiration (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>), dreams do not occupy a significant part in the prophetic revelations of any of the OT prophets, with the exception of Daniel.</p>
<p>One of the most characteristic modes of prophetic inspiration was the vision (<a href="?bref=Num.12.6">Nm 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.4,16">24:4, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.10">Hos 12:10</a>). The revelatory visions experienced by the prophets were not limited to visual phenomena alone but also included the auditory dimension as well. In <a href="?bref=Isa.1.1">Isaiah 1:1</a>, the author describes his entire prophetic book as a “vision”: “These visions concerning Judah and Jerusalem came to Isaiah son of Amoz during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah—all kings of Judah” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Yet in the very next verse, Isaiah says, “Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! This is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> says.” Again, in <a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">Amos 1:1</a>, “The <span class="ital">words</span> of Amos, who was among the shepherds of Tekoa, which he <span class="ital">saw</span> concerning Israel” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, emphasis added).</p>
<p class="h3">Manifestations of Prophetic Inspiration</p>
<p class="fl">All prophecy, whether biblical or not, presupposes that the prophet either possessed or was possessed by a personal supernatural power. The external behavioral manifestations of this possession can exhibit great variety.</p>
<p>The prophetic phenomenon generally designated “ecstatic” prophecy appears to have existed in Canaan prior to the arrival of the Hebrew tribes in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. The first reference to ecstatic prophecy in Israel occurs in <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5-13">1 Samuel 10:5-13</a> (11th century <span class="era">BC</span>), and it persisted at least till the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Jer.29.26">Jer 29:26</a>).</p>
<p>The ecstatic prophet achieves a trancelike state by self-induced means. The most common devices used to achieve a state of ecstasy were musical instruments, such as the harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>). Among the prophets of Baal, self-flagellation was another means of inducing ecstasy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.28-29">1 Kgs 18:28-29</a>).</p>
<p>This kind of prophetic ecstasy was usually practiced by groups of prophets (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>), and such ecstasy was contagious. When Saul met a band of such prophets, the Spirit of God came upon him and he, too, began to prophesy (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.10-13">10-13</a>), a phenomenon that occurred repeatedly to various messengers sent by Saul on a later occasion (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.20-22">19:20-22</a>). At that time Saul again prophesied, and his ecstatic behavior is described in <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.24">1 Samuel 19:24</a>. When Elisha was asked to prophesy for King Jehoram of Israel, he first requested a minstrel. When the minstrel played, the power of the Lord came upon him (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.15">2 Kgs 3:15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TypesofOldTestamentProphets">Types of Old Testament Prophets</p>
<p class="fl">There are two basic types of prophetic commission in the OT. One type is that of a narrative call by God to a particular individual whose objections to the call are gradually overcome in a dialogue between himself and God. The classic example of this type of prophetic commission is found in <a href="?bref=Jer.1.4-8">Jeremiah 1:4-8</a>:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave me a message. He said, “I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my spokesman to the world.”</p>
<p class="extract">“O Sovereign <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,” I said, “I can’t speak for you! I’m too young!”</p>
<p class="extract">“Don’t say that,” the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> replied, “for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you. And don’t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and take care of you. I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, have spoken!” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>)</p>
<p class="sp">Similar prophetic commissions including such dialogues are associated with the calls of Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4.17">Ex 3:1–4:17</a>) and Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.11-17">Jgs 6:11-17</a>).</p>
<p>The second major form of prophetic commission is the “throne vision.” An outstanding example is <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-8">Isaiah 6:1-8</a>:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord. He was sitting on a lofty throne, and the train of his robe filled the Temple. . . .</p>
<p class="extract">Then I said, “My destruction is sealed, for I am a sinful man and a member of a sinful race. Yet I have seen the King, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Almighty!”</p>
<p class="extract">Then one of the seraphim flew over to the altar, and he picked up a burning coal with a pair of tongs. He touched my lips with it and said, “See, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven.”</p>
<p class="extract">Then I heard the Lord asking, “Whom should I send as a messenger to my people? Who will go for us?”</p>
<p class="extract">And I said, “Lord, I’ll go! Send me.” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Here we have an account of the visionary presence of a prophet in the heavenly council; in this case, however, the prophet participates in the deliberations and thereby receives a prophetic commission. Though few prophets have left accounts of their divine commissions, most of them appear to have been conscious of having been “sent” by God (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.16">Is 48:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.14-15">Am 7:14-15</a>). According to Jeremiah, false prophets did not receive such divine commissions (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.21,32">Jer 23:21, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.15">28:15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMessageoftheProphets">The Message of the Prophets</p>
<p class="h3">The Form of the Message</p>
<p class="fl">The most common introductory formula for prophetic oracles in the OT is the phrase “Thus says the Lord,” which occurs hundreds of times in prophetic contexts. This formula clearly implies that the pronouncement so introduced is not the word of the prophet who utters the oracle but of the God of Israel who delivered his word to his prophet. The use of this formula also reiterates the prophet’s sense of divine commission. In oracles introduced in this manner, God speaks in the first person. In fact, virtually all Israelite prophetic utterance is formulated as the direct speech of the God of Israel.</p>
<p>The prophets used many literary forms in which to express their oracles. Two of the more widely used forms of prophetic speech are the judgment speech and the oracle of salvation. The judgment speech is composed of at least two central elements: the speech of rebuke or invective, and the pronouncement of judgment (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.3-4">2 Kgs 1:3-4</a>). The second common prophetic speech form is the oracle of salvation (see <a href="?bref=Isa.41.8-13">Is 41:8-13</a>). Other fixed forms of prophetic speech include the prophecy of salvation (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.14-21">43:14-21</a>), the proclamation of salvation (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.17-20">41:17-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.14-17">42:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.16-21">43:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.7-12">49:7-12</a>), and the woe oracle (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.8-10">Is 5:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.1-4">10:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-24">Am 5:18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.1-7">6:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.2.1-5">Mi 2:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Content of the Message</p>
<p class="fl">The common adage that OT prophets were not “foretellers” but “forthtellers” is not strictly correct. All of the prophets predict the future. Such prediction, however, is based not on human curiosity of what the future will hold but rather is rooted in the future consequences of past or present violations of the covenant, or on a future act of deliverance that will provide hope for a discouraged people. Most of the prophetic speeches that have been preserved in the OT were originally delivered as public proclamations or sermons. Most of these prophetic proclamations were evoked by the iniquity and apostasy of Israel. Hosea and Jeremiah condemned Israel because she had broken the covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.2-3">Jer 11:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets are frequently associated with social justice and social reform, and these elements were unquestionably an important dimension of their message. Amos denounced the rich who afflicted the poor (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-8">Am 2:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.11">5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.4-6">8:4-6</a>). He railed against sexual immorality (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-8">2:6-8</a>) and against those who take bribes (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.12">5:12</a>). Hosea provided a list of prevalent vices, including lying, killing, stealing, adultery, and idolatry (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.2">Hos 4:2</a>). Idolatry was a particular target for his denunciations (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.5">8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.2">11:2</a>). The background for such heated denunciations of Israel’s behavior is God’s unquenchable love for Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.4">Is 43:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.3">Jer 31:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.1">Hos 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1-4">11:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.4">14:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.1.2">Mal 1:2</a>), which is inseparable from his election of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.1">Is 43:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.24">Jer 33:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.5">Ez 20:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.1-5">Hos 3</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets were concerned not only with the transgressions of Israel and the historical judgment that would inevitably follow but also with the achievement of a final future time of bliss. The message of many of the prophets is thoroughly eschatological (i.e., pertaining to the end times). One such eschatological concept is that of the Day of the Lord. The concept of the Day of the Lord first appears in Amos, where the emphasis lies on the disaster that will befall Israel on that day. Amos’s emphasis on disaster notwithstanding, the Day of the Lord is a conception that had both salvific as well as judgmental overtones for Israel. While the disaster that will occur in the Day of the Lord can be viewed in terms of a literal historical fulfillment in the tragic events of 722 <span class="era">BC</span> (the fall of Samaria) and 586 <span class="era">BC</span> (the fall of Judah), there are nevertheless features of these predictions that transcend historical fulfillment and reach toward eschatological fulfillment.</p>
<p>Since the Israelite conception of “salvation” was largely temporal in its dimensions, it included such blessings as length of life, fruitfulness of the womb and field, peace and victory over one’s enemies, the abundance of water, and so on. In harmony with this conception of salvation, the future age is conceived in precisely those terms, as in <a href="?bref=Amos.9.13-15">Amos 9:13-15</a>.</p>
<p>The prophets pictured a time when David himself, or someone very much like him, would return and inaugurate a golden era reminiscent of the great Davidic and Solomonic period. The covenant of God with David was not a conditional covenant but rather one that was absolutely inviolable (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.4-17">2 Sm 7:4-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">Ps 89</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.19-22">Jer 33:19-22</a>), and it was with this knowledge that the prophets could look forward confidently to a restoration of David’s throne (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.24-26">Jer 17:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.14-15">33:14-15</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="ProphecyintheNewTestament">Prophecy in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In contrast to the few self-proclaimed prophets of the intertestamental period, early Christianity began with a flurry of prophetic activity that lasted well into the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. Jesus, his disciples and followers, and the early Christians were convinced that the times in which they lived were times in which OT prophecy was being fulfilled (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-15">Mk 1:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.16-21">Acts 2:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.25-27">Rom 16:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.11">1 Cor 10:11</a>). Yet this era was not only one of fulfillment but also one of the renewal of the prophetic gift.</p>
<p class="h3">John the Baptist</p>
<p class="fl">John the Baptist is remembered in the NT primarily as the forerunner of Jesus whose coming was predicted by Malachi (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.5-6">Mal 4:5-6</a>). Yet, in his own right, John proclaimed the imminent judgment of God with a flair of denunciation and rebuke reminiscent of the OT prophets. John’s costume, consisting of a hairy cloak and a leather girdle (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>), was reminiscent of the typical garb of OT prophets (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.19">1 Kgs 19:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.8">2 Kgs 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.13-14">2:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.4">Zec 13:4</a>). John was regarded as a prophet by people everywhere (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.5">Mt 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.10-13">17:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.11-13">Mk 9:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.32">11:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.76">Lk 1:76</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.26">7:26</a>). Luke reports, in a style similar to the OT prophetic narratives, that “the word of God came to John” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.2">Lk 3:2</a>). Two short prophetic speeches have been preserved in <a href="?bref=Matt.3.7-10">Matthew 3:7-10</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.3.7-9">Lk 3:7-9</a>) and <a href="?bref=Mark.1.7-8">Mark 1:7-8</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.3.11-12">Mt 3:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.15-18">Lk 3:15-18</a>). In the first speech, John denounced those of his generation who had transgressed the covenant law and exhorted them to change their manner of life. In the second speech, John predicted the coming of the Mighty One, Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.7">Mk 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.15,27,30">Jn 1:15, 27, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.25">Acts 13:25</a>). John’s style, however, was not precisely that of the OT prophets. His pronouncements were made on his own authority; never did he use formulas such as “thus says the Lord,” or present his prophetic utterances as if they were speeches made by God. Yet, in spite of these differences, John is appropriately regarded as the last representative of the OT prophetic tradition (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.13">Mt 11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.16">Lk 16:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus of Nazareth</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus was popularly regarded as a prophet (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.14">Mt 16:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.10-11">21:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.14-15">Mk 6:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.28">8:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.16,39">Lk 7:16, 39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.8,19">9:8, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.14">Jn 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.40,52">7:40, 52</a>). This assessment was based as much on the mighty deeds Jesus performed as on his prophetic speeches and predictions. Though Jesus nowhere claimed prophetic status directly, that claim is implicit in <a href="?bref=Mark.6.4">Mark 6:4</a>: “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown” (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.13.57">Mt 13:57</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.24">Lk 4:24</a>). It is implicit as well in <a href="?bref=Luke.13.33">Luke 13:33</a>: “Yes, today, tomorrow, and the next day I must proceed on my way. For it wouldn’t do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem!” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). In Acts, Jesus is regarded as “the prophet like Moses” predicted in <a href="?bref=Deut.18.18">Deuteronomy 18:18</a> (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.22">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.37">7:37</a>). Matthew presents Jesus as the New Moses, but he does not particularly emphasize his prophetic role. John, however, like Luke, emphasizes Jesus’ role as the prophet (<a href="?bref=John.4.19">Jn 4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.14-15">6:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.40">7:40</a>).</p>
<p>While the Gospels and Acts reflect the notion that Jesus was a prophet, they also emphasize the fact that he was much more than a prophet. Nevertheless, the notion of prophetism was sufficiently important in early Judaism that Jesus’ recognition as a prophet is very significant. There are 12 solid reasons for regarding Jesus as a prophet in the OT tradition: (1) The sovereign authority of Jesus’ teaching (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.27">Mk 1:27</a>), a feature underlined by his use of the introductory formula “(Amen) I say to you,” which is reminiscent of the formula “thus says the Lord” used by the OT prophets. (2) The poetic character of many of Jesus’ sayings is unlike contemporary rabbinic teaching but is similar to the poetic rhetoric of the OT prophets. (3) Jesus experienced visions (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.18">Lk 10:18</a>) like the ancient prophets. (4) Jesus, like the prophets, made many predictions (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.38">Mt 23:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.2">Mk 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.58">14:58</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.35">Lk 13:35</a>; etc.). (5) Like the OT prophets, Jesus performed symbolic acts (such as the cleansing of the temple, the entry into Jerusalem, and the Last Supper). (6) Jesus, like the prophets, when necessary, rejected the formal observance of religious ritual and emphasized the moral and spiritual dimensions of obedience to God. (7) Jesus announced the imminent arrival of the kingdom of God—an eschatological proclamation similar to those made by the prophets. (8) Like the OT prophets, Jesus functioned as a preacher of repentance. (9) Jesus, like many of the prophets, was conscious of a special calling of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.24">Mt 15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.37">9:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.36">14:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-26">Lk 4:18-26</a>). (10) Jesus, like the prophets, received divine revelation through intimate communion with God (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.27">Mt 11:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.22">Lk 10:22</a>). (11) Like the prophets, Jesus represented God; to obey him was to obey God, to reject him was to reject God (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.37">Mk 9:37</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.30-33">Ez 33:30-33</a>). (12) Like the prophets, Jesus was conscious of a mission to all Israel (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.24">Mt 15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.30">Lk 22:30</a>).</p>
<p>Among the many prophetic predictions of Jesus are the following:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Predictions of the imminent arrival of the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.7-8,23">Mt 10:7-8, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.39">23:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.1">9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.28-29">13:28-29</a>)</p>
<p class="list">2. Predictions of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.37-39">Mt 23:37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.2">24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.61">26:61</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.40">27:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.2">Mk 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.58">14:58</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.29">15:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.34-35">Lk 13:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.6">21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.19-21">Jn 2:19-21</a>)</p>
<p class="list">3. Predictions of the coming of the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.23,32-33">Mt 10:23, 32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.40-41">13:40-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.27,37-39">24:27, 37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mk 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26-27">13:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">14:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.26">Lk 9:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.30">11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.8-9">12:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.24,26">17:24, 26</a>)</p>
<p class="list">4. Predictions of the end of the age. The longest prophetic section in the Gospels is the eschatological discourse of Jesus in <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-32">Mark 13:1-32</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-36">Mt 24:1-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.5-33">Lk 21:5-33</a>), in which a number of predictions concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the age are woven into a lengthy discourse to the disciples.</p>
<p class="h3">Prophecy as a Gift for the Believers</p>
<p class="fl">The beginning of prophetic activity in early Christianity, according to Acts, coincided with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the earliest Christians on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-21">Acts 2:1-21</a>). Peter’s sermon on the Day of Pentecost indicates that the outpouring of the Spirit fulfilled Joel’s prophecy (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.4,17-21">Acts 2:4, 17-21</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Jl 2:28-32</a>). Further, since the Spirit had been poured out upon all early Christians (that Spirit being a Spirit of prophecy), all are actual or potential prophets.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28">1 Corinthians 12:28</a> (see also <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6">Rom 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>), God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, and third teachers. The names of several early Christian prophets have been preserved. These include Agabus (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-28">Acts 11:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.10-11">21:10-11</a>); Judas and Silas (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.32">15:32</a>); Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, and Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">13:1</a>); and the four virgin daughters of Philip the evangelist (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.8-9">21:8-9</a>). John, the author of Revelation, was certainly a prophet (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.3">Rv 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.9,18">22:9, 18</a>), though he never directly assumed that title.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRoleoftheChristianProphet">The Role of the Christian Prophet</p>
<p class="fl">Christian prophets were leaders in early Christian communities (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28">1 Cor 12:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>), who exercised their gift in church gatherings (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">Acts 13:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-28">11:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-14.40">1 Cor 12–14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.10">Rv 1:10</a>). Since the Spirit of God was particularly active in Christian worship, prophecy was a major means whereby God communicated with his people. Prophets, like apostles and teachers, did not hold offices in local communities like bishops, elders, and deacons. Rather, they were chosen, not by individual congregations, but by divine commission and so were honored and accepted in all local communities.</p>
<p>Early Christian prophets were both itinerant and settled, though itinerant prophets seem to have been more prevalent in Syria-Palestine and Asia Minor than in the European churches.</p>
<p class="h3">The Function of Prophecy</p>
<p class="fl">According to Paul, the central purpose of prophecy (as of all other spiritual gifts) is that of building up or edifying the church. According to <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.3">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>, “one who prophesies is helping others grow in the Lord, encouraging and comforting them” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Again, in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.4">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>, Paul states that the “one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church.” Paul discussed the subject of spiritual gifts, particularly tongues speaking and prophecy, because the Corinthians had placed an excessive emphasis on speaking in tongues. Paul did not object to speaking in tongues (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.18,39">1 Cor 14:18, 39</a>), but he did point out that, since it was generally incomprehensible, the church could not be edified by it. Prophecy, which consisted of comprehensible speech inspired by the Spirit, contributed to the mutual edification, encouragement, and consolation of all present (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.20-25,39">1 Cor 14:20-25, 39</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Content of Christian Prophecy</p>
<p class="fl">We know only a little about the content of prophecies uttered in the first-century church. Prophetic utterance occasionally provided divine guidance in making important decisions in early Christianity. Through a prophetic utterance, Paul and Barnabas were selected for a particular mission (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">Acts 13:1-3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.18">1 Tm 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">4:14</a>). Probably through prophetic utterance, Paul and Timothy were forbidden to preach the gospel in Asia (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a>), and they were similarly forbidden by the Spirit of Jesus to go into Bithynia (v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.7">7</a>). Perhaps the most frequent use of prophecy is the prediction of the future. Agabus predicted a universal famine (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">11:28</a>) and the imminent arrest of Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.11">21:11</a>). Other prophets had also predicted his impending imprisonment (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.23">20:23</a>). The prophecies contained in the Revelation of John are all oriented toward the future events that will gradually unfold in the last days. Yet the purpose of John’s elaborate prophecy is not to satisfy the curiosity of his audience but rather to comfort and encourage them in the midst of persecution.</p>
<p class="h3">The Form of Christian Prophecy</p>
<p class="fl">Unlike the prophets of the OT, Christian prophets did not always present their message in the form of a direct speech from God or Jesus. There are few, if any, formal indicators of the presence of prophetic speech in early Christian literature. The book of Revelation is one notable exception.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Introduction">Introduction</p>
<p class="fl">When Jesus raised the widow’s son from the dead, the onlookers responded by saying, “A great prophet has arisen among us!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">Lk 7:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.6.15">Mk 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.28">8:28</a>). In Jewish religious thought, the most vivid and formative religious happenings found their focus in the call and ministry of a prophet, through whom God communicated his word to his people. In their appraisal of Jesus, the people were in fact more correct than they knew, for in him God had in reality visited them and he, though so much more than a prophet, was in fact the crown and climax of the prophetic order predicted by Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.15-19">Dt 18:15-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTitlesandHistoryoftheProphets">The Titles and History of the Prophets</p>
<p class="fl">The main words used to describe such individuals in the OT are “prophet” (see <a href="?bref=Judg.6.8">Jgs 6:8</a>), “man of God” (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.9">2 Kgs 4:9</a>) and “seer” (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.9">1 Sm 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.11">2 Sm 24:11</a>).</p>
<p>The word translated “prophet” seems to have the idea “called” as its first emphasis: God takes the initiative, selects, summons, and sends the prophet (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.1.4-5">Jer 1:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.25">7:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.14">Am 7:14</a>). “Man of God” speaks of the relationship into which the prophet is brought by his call: he is now “God’s man” and is recognized as belonging to him (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.9">2 Kgs 4:9</a>). “Seer” indicates the new and remarkable powers of perception granted to the prophet. In Hebrew, as in English, the ordinary verb “to see” is used also of understanding (“I see what you mean”) and of the power of perception into the nature and meaning of things (“He sees things very clearly”). In the case of the prophets, their powers of “perception” were raised far above normal because the Lord inspired them to become vehicles of his message.</p>
<p>The line of great prophets upon whose shoulders the story of the OT moves forward began with Moses, who is recognized as the prophet par excellence (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.10">Dt 34:10</a>). This was a correct perception, for all the distinctive marks of a prophet belonged to Moses: the call (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4.17">Ex 3:1–4:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Is 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.1.4-19">Jer 1:4-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-3.27">Ez 1–3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.1.2">Hos 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.14-15">Am 7:14-15</a>), the awareness of the importance of historical events as the acts of God in which he confirmed his word (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.12">Ex 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.4.21-23">4:21-23</a>), ethical and social concern (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.11-13">2:11-13</a>), and championship of the helpless (v <a href="?bref=Exod.2.17">17</a>).</p>
<p>But the comment in <a href="?bref=Deut.34.10">Deuteronomy 34:10</a> not only looks back to the greatness of Moses but also looks forward to the coming of a prophet like Moses. This accords with his own prediction (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.15-19">Dt 18:15-19</a>), which undoubtedly anticipates a single, great individual prophet. Moses makes a striking comparison with himself—the coming prophet will fill just such a role as Moses filled at Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.16">Dt 18:16</a>). On that occasion, Moses acted as the prophetic mediator of the voice of God in a unique sense, for at Sinai God fashioned the old covenant into its completed form. In expecting a prophet cast in this mold, Moses was therefore looking forward to another covenant-mediator, Jesus Christ himself.</p>
<p>The expectation for this great prophet was kept alive as God kept sending prophets to his people. In each case, such a prophet was known to be true by his likeness to Moses; in each case he would be viewed with excitement by genuine believers to see whether he was the great one come at last. In this light we can understand the excitement of the people who saw Jesus raise the dead (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">Lk 7:16</a>).</p>
<p>The OT mentions the existence of prophetic groups, sometimes called “schools.” Elisha clearly had such a group under his instruction (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.1">2 Kgs 6:1</a>), and “sons of the prophets” (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.3,5">2 Kgs 2:3, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.14">Am 7:14</a>) probably refers to “prophet in training” under the care of a master prophet. “Guilds” would be a better description of the groups in <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5-11">1 Samuel 10:5-11</a>. Such groups enjoyed an enthusiastic, ecstatic worship of the Lord, touched with a marked activity of the Spirit of God. But at the heart of their devotion was “prophecy”—that is, a declaration of the truth about God himself. After this early period, the prophetic groups seem to have diminished in significance (judging by the disappearance of plain references similar to those in 1 Samuel), and the gradual change of things from ecstasy to a more direct ministry of the word could well lie behind the comment in <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.9">1 Samuel 9:9</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Inspiration">Inspiration</p>
<p class="fl">The Spirit of the Lord whose inspiration lay behind the activities of the ecstatic groups (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.6,10">1 Sm 10:6, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.20,23">19:20, 23</a>) was active in all the prophets, and the claim to divine inspiration is plainly registered from time to time (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.24">1 Kgs 22:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.30">Neh 9:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.7">Hos 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">Jl 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.8">Mi 3:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.18">1 Chr 12:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.1">2 Chr 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.14">20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20">24:20</a>). The Spirit inspired men and women to speak the very words of God (cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.21">2 Pt 1:21</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah claims that the hand of God was laid on his mouth, putting the words of God into his lips (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.9">Jer 1:9</a>); Ezekiel records how he was made to eat a scroll, by which means he received the words the Lord had written and was thus enabled to speak what the Lord called “my words” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.7-4.4">Ez 2:7–4:4</a>). The miracle is stated in a nutshell at the beginning of Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1,3">1:1, 3</a>): “The words of Amos . . . Thus saith the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.” Though the words were truly Amos’s words, the words were also the Lord’s.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TrueandFalseProphets">True and False Prophets</p>
<p class="fl">False prophets were to be separated from true prophets by means of three tests. The first test was doctrinal. In <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-18">Deuteronomy 13</a> the motive of the false prophet was to draw the people away from the God who had revealed himself in the exodus (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.2,5-7,10">Dt 13:2, 5-7, 10</a>). Notwithstanding that the word of the false prophet might be supported by apparent signs and wonders (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-2">1-2</a>), it was to be refused—not simply because it introduced novelty (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.13.2,6">2, 6</a>) but because that novelty contradicted the revelation of the Lord at the exodus (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.13.5, 10">5, 10</a>). The first test was thus doctrinal and required that the people of God have knowledge of the truth whereby they could, by comparison, recognize error.</p>
<p>The second test was practical and required patience. It is stated in <a href="?bref=Deut.18.21-22">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>: the word of the Lord always comes to pass. This requires patience because, as <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-2">Deuteronomy 13:1-2</a> indicates, a false word may be supported by an apparent spiritual proof. The call of <a href="?bref=Deut.18.21-22">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a> is a call for patience. Should there be any real doubt about whether a prophetic word is true or false, wait for the confirmatory turn of events.</p>
<p>The third test is moral and calls for watchful discernment. Jeremiah, of all the prophets, was most afflicted in his spirit by the presence of false prophets and gave the longest and most sustained consideration to the problem (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.9-40">Jer 23:9-40</a>). His answer is striking and challenging: the false prophet will be found out as a man of unholy life (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.23.11-14">11-14</a>) whose message has no note of moral rebuke but rather encourages men in their sin (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.23.16-22">16-22</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheFunctionoftheProphet">The Function of the Prophet</p>
<p class="fl">It is sometimes said that prophets are not “foretellers” but “forthtellers.” As far as the OT is concerned, however, the prophets are forthtellers (declaring the truth about God) by being foretellers (predicting what God will do). Prediction is neither an occasional nor a marginal activity in the OT; it is the way the prophet went about his work. <a href="?bref=Deut.18.9-15">Deuteronomy 18:9-15</a> explains the function of the prophet in Israel: the surrounding nations are revealed as probing into the future by means of a variety of fortune-telling techniques (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.18.10-11">10-11</a>); these things are forbidden to Israel on the ground of being abominable to the Lord (v <a href="?bref=Deut.18.12">12</a>). Israel’s distinctiveness is maintained in that the nations probe the future by diviners, whereas the Lord gives Israel a prophet (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.18.13-15">13-15</a>). Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.27">2 Kgs 4:27</a>) is surprised when foreknowledge is denied him; Amos teaches that foreknowledge is the privilege of the prophets in their fellowship with God (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.7">Am 3:7</a>). But prediction in Israel was totally unlike prognostication among the nations, for in no way was it motivated by a mere curiosity about the future.</p>
<p>First, biblical prediction arose out of the needs of the present. In <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-8">Isaiah 39</a> it is the faithless commitment of Hezekiah to rely for security on a military understanding with Babylon that prompts Isaiah to announce the future Babylonian captivity. Isaiah does not snatch the name Babylon out of thin air; it is given to him within the situation in which he was called to minister.</p>
<p>Second, prediction aimed at giving knowledge of the future was to result in moral reformation in the present. The moral exhortations of the prophets find their explanation in what the Lord is about to do (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.31.6-7">Is 31:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.6">Am 5:6</a>).</p>
<p>Third, the predicted course of events was aimed at stabilizing the faith of the true believer in dark times. For example, various passages in Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-7">Is 9:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-16">11:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-3">40:1-3</a>) have the effect of lifting the eyes out of the immediately preceding grim tragedy to the coming glory.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MethodsofCommunication">Methods of Communication</p>
<p class="fl">In foretelling, the prophets were forthtelling—they were proclaiming the wonderful works of God (cf. the definition of prophecy in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.11,17">Acts 2:11, 17</a>). For the most part, this proclamation was by direct word of mouth. The prophets were men of the word. Their words were like messengers sent by God (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.11">Is 55:11</a>), endowed with all the divine efficacy of the creative word of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.3">Genesis 1:3</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6">Ps 33:6</a>). Sometimes the efficacy of the word was enhanced by being accompanied by a sign or symbolic action (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.13.1-11">Jer 13:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.19.1-15">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-17">Ez 4:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.24.15-24">24:15-24</a>), or identified intimately with a person (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Is 7:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.8.1-4">8:1-4</a>). Such things were like visual aids, whereby the word would be made clearer to those present. But it would seem that the intention of the symbolic action (sometimes called an “acted oracle”) was not so much to make understanding easier but to give more power and effect to the word as it was sent like a messenger into that situation. This is the conclusion to be drawn from <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.14-19">2 Kings 13:14-19</a>, where the extent to which the king “embodied” the word in action determined the extent to which the word would prove effective in bringing events to pass.</p>
<p>The final embodiment of the words of the prophets is in the books that have been preserved. <a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-32">Jeremiah 36</a> may be taken as an object lesson in the fact that the prophets took the time and trouble to record their spoken messages in writing: there was stress on careful word-by-word dictation (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.6,17-18">Jer 36:6, 17-18</a>). But the actual literary form of the messages themselves tells the same tale. What we find in the books of the prophets cannot be the preached form of their words but rather the studied wording in which they preserved (and filed away) their sermons. It stands to reason that men who were conscious of communicating the very words of God would see to it that those words were not lost. We may take it for granted that every prophet preserved a written record of his ministry. Whether each of the named prophets was himself directly responsible for the final form of his book, we are not told and have no way of knowing. The careful way in which the books of Isaiah or Amos, for example, are arranged is best suited by assuming that the author was also his own editor.</p>

<p class="fl">Spokesmen, heralds, or messengers falsely speaking for, or on behalf of, someone else. The false prophet was often motivated not by loyalty to God but by a desire for popularity. This was the main difference between Jeremiah and his contemporaries. While Jeremiah was foretelling doom (<a href="?bref=Jer.4.19">Jer 4:19</a>), the false prophets were assuring the people of peace (<a href="?bref=Jer.6.14">6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.11">8:11</a>). The people preferred it that way; they said, “Don’t tell us the truth. Tell us nice things. Tell us lies” (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.10">Is 30:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The false prophet’s message frequently appealed to national pride: Israel was God’s people; God’s temple was in their midst; therefore, all would be well (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.10">Jer 7:10</a>). Jeremiah, however, warned them not to be fooled into thinking that just because they had the temple they would never suffer (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.7.12-15">12-15</a>). Such confrontation between the prophet of God and the national cult is exemplified in Amos’s encounter with Amaziah the priest of Bethel, who accused Amos of conspiring against Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-13">Am 7:10-13</a>). Yet Amos was proved right when the northern kingdom fell to the Assyrians in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> and the Jews were taken into exile.</p>
<p>The message of the false prophet was usually spurred by self-interest and given to please the people. It was not necessarily his intention to speak falsely, yet when spoken with wrong motivation, his message was often in error. This sometimes means that even a true prophet could become false and occasionally a false prophet could be used of God for the right purpose. For example, Balaam, a non-Israelite with whom God entrusted a vision, found himself in the difficult position of having to please Balak, who had hired him, and the God of Israel, who spoke to him (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-23.30">Nm 22–23</a>). A fascinating story is told in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-34">1 Kings 13</a> of two nameless prophets—one true and the other false—who abruptly change roles when the lying prophet speaks truth and the true prophet is proven false by disobedience. In the case of Jeremiah in confrontation with Hananiah the son of Azzur, the two prophets meet in the temple to pitch prophecy against prophecy. Hananiah was proved false, though he appeared as a legitimate prophet from Gibeon (<a href="?bref=Jer.28.1">Jer 28:1</a>). He prophesied the very thing the people in Jerusalem wanted to hear, namely, the imminent fall of Babylon. Subsequent events, however, proved this thinking wishful. We may therefore say that false prophecy is self-centered, wrongly motivated, and detached from reality.</p>
<p>The concept of the false prophet is carried over into the NT. Our Lord warns against those who disguise themselves as harmless sheep but are in fact wolves ready for the kill. Jesus also warned his disciples that false christs would arise who would try to deceive God’s elect (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.24">Mt 24:24</a>). The early church must have been plagued by such pseudoprophets, for the apostolic letters further warn against such men (cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1">2 Pt 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1">1 Jn 4:1</a>). In the context of these letters “prophets” and “teachers” are interchangeable, though the original text speaks of them as “false prophets.” While pretending to be Christians, they are deceptive teachers because their instruction is perverse. These people even perform miracles, but with the help of evil spirits, not the Spirit of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.13.11-15">Rv 13:11-15</a>).</p>
<p>False prophets, fraudulent spirits, and wrong teachings are recurring problems in the church. Believers should constantly stand guard against those who cleverly lie about the truth (cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.14-16">Eph 4:14-16</a>); they should discern the spirits of prophets to determine whether they are from the evil one or from God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.10-11">1 Cor 12:10-11</a>). We are told not to believe everyone who claims that his or her message is from God, but to “test” the spirits to see whether their message is from the Holy Spirit and whether it agrees with the truth that Jesus is the Son of God in human form (cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1-3">1 Jn 4:1-3</a>).</p>

  <title>Propitiation*</title>

<p class="h1">PROPITIATION*</p>
<p class="fl">The act of appeasing another person’s anger by the offering of a gift. The word was often used by the pagans in antiquity, for they thought of their gods as unpredictable beings, liable to become angry with their worshipers for any trifle. When disaster struck, it was often thought that a god was angry and was therefore punishing his worshipers. The remedy was to offer a sacrifice without delay. A well-chosen offering would appease the god and put him in a good mood again. This process was called propitiation.</p>
<p>Understandably, some modern theologians have reacted against using the term in reference to the God of the Bible. They do not see him as one who can be bribed to become favorable, so they reject the whole idea. When they come to the term in the Greek NT, they translate it by “expiation” or some equivalent term that lacks any reference to anger. This is an unjustified avoidance because, in the first place, the Greek term for propitiation occurs in some important biblical passages (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">Heb 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.10">4:10</a>). In the second place, the idea of the wrath of God is found throughout the Bible; it must be taken into account in the way sin is forgiven.</p>
<p>The idea that God cannot be angry is not based on the OT or the NT. God does have anger for the sins of the human race. Whenever his children sin, they provoke the anger of God. Of course, his anger is not an irrational lack of self-control, as it so often is with humans. His anger is the settled opposition of his holy nature to everything that is evil. Such opposition to sin cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand. It requires something much more substantial. And the Bible states that it was only the cross that did this. Jesus is “the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). This is not the only way of looking at the cross, but it is an important way. If God’s anger is real, then it must be taken into account in the way that sin, which caused that wrath, is dealt with. When the NT speaks of “propitiation,” it means that Jesus’ death on the cross for the sins of mankind put away God’s wrath against his people once and for all.</p>

<p class="fl">Gentile who converted to Judaism by being circumcised, baptized, and offering a sacrifice in the temple.</p>
<p>Foreigners who resided on some fairly permanent basis in Palestine in OT times were encouraged to become integrated into the full religious life of Israel through circumcision (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.48">Ex 12:48</a>). But “proselytizing,” or bringing willing Gentiles into the covenant community, occurred more frequently in the Jewish communities outside Palestine. Jews, living in most areas of the known world due to exile or commercial or military reasons, naturally carried their religious faith and practice with them. This Jewish way of life, particularly its monotheistic faith and high ethical standards, was attractive to many of the surrounding Gentiles accustomed to polytheism. The result was that many Gentiles attached themselves in varying degrees to the Jewish faith through the life of the synagogue (see <a href="?bref=Isa.56.1-8">Is 56:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.1.11">Mal 1:11</a>). Extrabiblical Jewish sources (Philo, Josephus) and Roman sources (e.g., Horace, Seneca, Tacitus) reveal that Jews carried on an aggressive mission to Gentiles in the centuries immediately preceding the life of Christ and then on into the early NT era (see <a href="?bref=Matt.23.15">Mt 23:15</a>).</p>
<p>The more zealous of those attracted to Judaism at this time became full members of the Jewish community through a rite involving three elements: circumcision (if male), a baptism representing a break with pagan background, and an offering in the temple at Jerusalem. Termed “proselytes,” these converts were considered true Jews in the sense of being obligated to follow the entire OT law.</p>
<p>There were other Gentiles who admired the monotheism and moral superiority of Judaism and were attracted to synagogue life but did not desire to take such a final step as circumcision. These were termed “God-fearers” (see <a href="?bref=Acts.10.22">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.16,26">13:16, 26</a>) or “devout” ones (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.2">10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.4,17">17:4, 17</a>) and were regarded favorably by some Jews. But they were disregarded by others as no better than Gentiles.</p>

<p class="h1">PROSTITUTE, PROSTITUTION</p>
<p class="fl">Person guilty of illicit sexual relationships; figuratively, one who worships an idol. The term “prostitute” translates four different words found in the Bible. One type of prostitute was the man or woman, married or unmarried, who committed immoral acts (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.31">Gn 34:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.2">Jgs 19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.27">Prv 23:27</a>). A different kind of prostitute was the temple prostitute of heathen religions in which fornication was part of the worship (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.21-22">Gn 38:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.23.17">Dt 23:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.14">Hos 4:14</a>). Such prostitution was forbidden by the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.29">Lv 19:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.21.9">21:9</a>). The “strange woman” was another kind of prostitute (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1">1 Kgs 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.5.20">Prv 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.24">6:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.7.5">7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.27">23:27</a>). There are different opinions for why that name was given to prostitutes. One explanation is that it referred to a man leaving his own wife for another, who ought to be a stranger to him (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.17-20">Prv 5:17-20</a>). It may also have referred to a foreign woman (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1">Nm 25:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.13">Jos 23:13</a>). “Prostitute” also refers to any woman, married or single, who practices unlawful sexual indulgence, whether for lust or monetary gain (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.31-32">Mt 21:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.30">Lk 15:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15-16">1 Cor 6:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.31">Heb 11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.25">Jas 2:25</a>).</p>
<p>Prostitution appeared early in Israel’s life and continued throughout biblical history. Most biblical passages strongly condemn the practice of prostitution in any form. The priestly law of <a href="?bref=Lev.21.9">Leviticus 21:9</a> provided that a priest’s daughter who practiced prostitution was to be burned to death. A priest could not marry a prostitute (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.29">Lv 19:29</a>), and the wages of prostitution could not be used to pay vows in the temple (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.18">Dt 23:18</a>). These prohibitions served to keep the worship of the Lord free from the practice of cult prostitution.</p>
<p>The sons of Jacob killed Hamor and his son Shechem, justifying their act by saying: “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?” (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.31">Gn 34:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Amaziah’s wife was to become a prostitute (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.17">Am 7:17</a>) as punishment for his treatment of the prophet Amos.</p>
<p>In the first century, prostitutes and tax collectors were equally detested by the Jews (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.32">Mt 21:32</a>). According to Paul, the body of a Christian belongs to Christ and should not be joined to a prostitute’s body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15-16">1 Cor 6:15-16</a>). Proverbs is replete with warnings to those who would go in to prostitutes.</p>
<p>A few biblical passages do, however, seem to accept the prostitute as a member of the community. Tamar temporarily served as a prostitute to remind her father-in-law of his promise to her (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.14-15">Gn 38:14-15</a>). Rahab the prostitute had a special place in Hebrew history because she had befriended the Hebrew spies (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.4-16">Jos 2:4-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.31">Heb 11:31</a>).</p>
<p>The words “prostitute” and “prostitution” were used figuratively for idolatry, especially in the prophetic books (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.20">Jer 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.1,5,15-16">Rv 17:1, 5, 15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.2">19:2</a>). This figurative use was based on the marriagelike relationship of the Lord and his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.20">Jer 3:20</a>). When the people gave their allegiance to idols rather than to God, he charged that they were prostitutes for other gods (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.33">Jgs 8:33</a>). The same idea is found in the NT (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.1-18">Rv 17</a>).</p>

In the protevangelium we have the protorevelation of the humanity (her offspring) and the divinity (crushing the head of serpent) of the great Deliverer.

<p class="h2" id="Authors">Authors</p>
<p class="fl">While there is an underlying unity of thought in the book of Proverbs, there is no presumption of unity of authorship, since the writers of the seven or more sections into which the book is divided are, in most cases, clearly noted.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.1.1-9.18">1:1–9:18</a></p>
<p class="fl">There is a division of opinion as to whether the opening verse refers to the Solomonic authorship of this section or whether it simply underscores the name of the main contributor to the entire book. It is objected that the man who wrote so carefully about the danger of promiscuous relationships with immoral women—one of the main themes of this section—is not likely to be Solomon, who failed significantly in the matter of mixed marriages (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-8">1 Kgs 11:1-8</a>). There are flaws in such an argument. One may be capable of giving excellent advice without necessarily having the strength of character to follow it oneself, and there is a distinction between the seductive prostitutes or adulteresses of <a href="?bref=Pr.5.1-21,6-35,7-27">Proverbs 5:1-21, 6:20-35, 7:1-27</a> and Solomon’s polygamous but respectable relationships. However, the question of authorship is probably best left open. Those who question the Solomonic origin of this section regard <a href="?bref=Pr.1.2-7">1:2-7</a> as setting out the purpose of the whole book. <a href="?bref=Pr.1.8-9.18">Proverbs 1:8–9:18</a> is a series of 13 practical discourses on wisdom, lovingly and honestly given as by a father to a son. This provides an indispensable foundation for the more popular proverbial teaching in the remainder of the book.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.10.1-22.16">10:1–22:16</a></p>
<p class="fl">Solomon is specifically noted as the author or compiler of this main section of Proverbs. The probability that he played a major part in the production of the book of Proverbs finds strong support in the historical books. Soon after his coronation he was endowed with the spirit of wisdom—in response to his request (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.5-14">1 Kgs 3:5-14</a>). The incident concerning the two prostitutes (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.16-28">16-28</a>) provided public proof of this. His universal reputation, especially in connection with proverbial wisdom, is attested to in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.29-34">1 Kings 4:29-34</a> and in the visit of the queen of Sheba (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-13">10:1-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.22.17-24.34">22:17–24:34</a></p>
<p class="fl">The title “the words of the wise” (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.17">Prv 22:17</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>) is incorporated into the opening verse of this section. An evident difference of style, replacing the simple, one-verse proverb by a more discursive approach that deals with a subject over several verses, and the title of the next subsection “These also are sayings of the wise” (<a href="?bref=Pr.24.23">24:23</a>), strongly suggest the independence of this collection. Of major interest is the remarkably close parallel between <a href="?bref=Pr.22.17-23.11">22:17–23:11</a> and the Egyptian book of Amenemope, which has been dated variously between the 13th and 7th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. Scholars have detected as many as 30 connections between the two. Most think that this section in Proverbs is an adaptation of an Egyptian original (such selection and modification being entirely congruous with the doctrine of inspiration). However, a minority of scholars, including several prominent Egyptologists, argue persuasively on the basis of grammatical structure that Amenemope is derived from a Hebrew original.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.25.1-29.27">25:1–29:27</a></p>
<p class="fl">Some material of Solomon’s has here been edited and incorporated by “the men of Hezekiah king of Judah” (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.1">25:1</a>). In this section there is a tendency to group together proverbs dealing with specific subjects—for example, the relationship between a king and his subjects (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.25.2-7">2-7</a>), the lazy man (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.13-16">26:13-16</a>), and the mischief maker (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.26.17-27">17-27</a>). Solomon and Hezekiah were frequently linked together in Jewish thought (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Chr.30.26">2 Chr 30:26</a>), and rabbinic tradition credited Hezekiah with the production of both Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. The national prestige during the reigns of both kings would have been conducive to literary pursuits.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.30.1-33">30:1-33</a></p>
<p class="fl">Nothing is known of Agur, of his father, Jakeh of Massa, or of the two other characters mentioned, Ithiel and Ucal. According to <a href="?bref=Gen.25.14">Genesis 25:14</a>, Massa was one of the 12 sons of Ishmael, and it is likely that Agur came from north Arabia, an area traditionally renowned for its wisdom.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.31.1-9">31:1-9</a></p>
<p class="fl">Lemuel, the author of this section, also came from Massa, but apart from this is unknown. The inclusion of wisdom sayings from sources outside Israel illustrates the international connections of the wisdom movement during the period of the monarchy.</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Pr.31.10-31">31:10-31</a></p>
<p class="fl">It is possible that Lemuel’s authorship includes this superb acrostic poem on the ideal wife; its inspiration may have come from his mother, like the earlier section. But the pattern of life would fit more easily into the context of a prosperous, agricultural community in Palestine rather than in an Arabian nomadic or seminomadic community. For this reason, most scholars regard the poem as anonymous.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The larger part of the book may, with confidence, be ascribed to Solomon (ruled c. 970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>). But the considerable contribution of Hezekiah and his men rules out a date for the completion of the book before 700 <span class="era">BC</span>. The inclusion of sections by non-Israelites, like Agur and Lemuel, is more likely in the preexilic period, with its wider international interests, than in the more particularistic atmosphere of postexilic Judaism. Probably the final, sophisticated acrostic poem was the last section to be included, but there is nothing in the book that demands a date later than the early seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. In rabbinic tradition Proverbs was invariably grouped with Psalms and Job in the third section of the Jewish canon, the Writings or Holy Books. While the content of the Writings was not authoritatively finalized until the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, it is likely that Proverbs was accepted as inspired long before this, as witnessed by its inclusion in the Septuagint, the principal Greek translation. The order in our English versions may have been influenced by the rabbinic tradition that linked the books of Job, Psalms, and Proverbs with Moses, David, and Hezekiah, respectively.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Proverbs is included in the OT corpus of books known as the Wisdom Literature. This corpus is further represented in Scripture by the books of Job and Ecclesiastes and some of the Psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-6">Pss 1</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.37.1-40">37</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-28">73</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.119.1-176">119</a>). Proverbs represents one major class of this literature. Individual proverbs contain sharp, practical applications of wisdom covering many facets of life. Job and Ecclesiastes focus on one major problem, or a group of interrelated problems, in monologue or dialogue form.</p>
<p>In the ancient Near East, wisdom was originally connected with all skills, manual as well as intellectual, and was considered to be the gift of the gods. Gradually it acquired a dominantly intellectual significance, particularly in a cultic setting, in such magical or semimagical arts as exorcism. A wide range of wisdom literature from Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia, of the two basic types noted in the preceding paragraph, has survived, making it possible to see its Hebrew counterpart against this background. There is no duplication, however, and the spirit of the Hebrew Wisdom Literature is markedly superior to anything comparable in the ancient world. This is due principally to the strong religious foundation in Israel, where wisdom’s first step was to trust and revere the Lord (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">Prv 1:7</a>).</p>
<p>When Israel emerged as a nation in the Mosaic period, it was in a world where individuals or groups of “the wise” already existed. Israel shared this inheritance, with both men and women being involved, as witnessed by the wise women of Tekoa and Abel in Beth-maacah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.2">2 Sm 14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.16">20:16</a>) and the professional military or civic court counselors Ahithophel and Hushai (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-2,31">2 Sm 15:1-2, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.15-19">16:15-19</a>). Proverbs shows this group of “the wise” at its best; the life of uprightness, diligence, honesty, and self-control that it advocates sets a standard of morality that accords with the law on which it was based. But it is probable that many proverbs predate the emergence of a class of the wise. Most communities develop their own collections of short, witty sayings that express practical wisdom and form a store of primitive philosophy. Solomon’s part in giving definitive shape to Israel’s proverbs (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.32">1 Kgs 4:32</a>) has already been noted. The antithetic form of Hebrew poetry, where the parallelism of the second line allows either a sharp contrast (as generally in <a href="?bref=Pr.10.1-15.33">Proverbs 10–15</a>) or further support (i.e., synonymous parallelism, as in chs <a href="?bref=Pr.16.1-22.29">16–22</a>) is an ideal medium for the proverb. When the class of “the wise” developed, this popular wisdom became part of their provenance.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheology">Purpose and Theology</p>
<p class="h3">The Close Relationship between Religion and Everyday Life</p>
<p class="fl">While the general tone of Proverbs is dominantly rational, the importance of fearing (showing reverence to) the Lord is stressed throughout the book (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.7">1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.2.5">2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.7">3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.8.13">8:13</a>; etc.). This “fear of the Lord” is one of the main definitions of religion in the OT, the other being “the knowledge of God” stressed especially by Hosea and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.24">Jer 9:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.1">Hos 4:1</a>). Both are found in parallel in <a href="?bref=Pr.2.5">Proverbs 2:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Pr.9.10">9:10</a>. Far from there being an unbridgeable gap between religion and the secular world, Proverbs shows the results, in noble character and harmonious, happy homes, when the whole of life is brought under God’s control. A danger exists when the moral elements are taken in isolation from the religious foundation that is assumed throughout. Then the pursuit for happiness or success can become selfish, inward-looking, and ultimately self-defeating.</p>
<p class="h3">Proverbs and the Prophetic Movement</p>
<p class="fl">There are many similarities between Proverbs and the Prophets, including a down-to-earth realism; a championing of the poor and underprivileged groups (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.14.31">14:31</a>); a realization of the inefficacy of sacrifice apart from morality (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.8">15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.21.27">21:27</a>); and an emphasis on the individual, which was sometimes overlooked because of the strong sense of corporate identity within the covenant community. Jeremiah and Ezekiel, especially, restated strongly the theme of individual responsibility (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.29-30">Jer 31:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.1-32">Ez 18</a>). But there is a vital difference that Proverbs shares with the remainder of biblical Wisdom Literature, namely, the absence of any clear, historical reference to Israel’s election and covenant relationship with God. This was the consistent point of appeal of the great preexilic prophets. Similarly, Jerusalem and its temple theology are not mentioned, although the wisdom movement, especially as reflected in Proverbs, flourished under the patronage of the Davidic monarchy. Even the name Israel does not occur. This has lent strength to the view that Proverbs is the clearest and most comprehensive manual of universal, practical ethics existing in the ancient world. An educated contemporary Egyptian would have found Proverbs readily comprehensible and uplifting, and although this was not its primary purpose, the book still has a strong appeal to the moral non-Christian.</p>
<p class="h3">Proverbs and Deuteronomy</p>
<p class="fl">Proverbs shares many features with the book of Deuteronomy, especially its emphasis on retribution and reward (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.22">Prv 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.9-10">3:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.27-30">10:27-30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Dt 28</a>). This doctrine could be perverted into an invariable equation: the righteous are always rewarded and the wicked are always punished. That is a view against which Job (<a href="?bref=Job.21.7-34">Jb 21:7-34</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.12.1-4">Jer 12:1-4</a>) protested strongly. It could also result in a hypocritical, self-seeking approach; I want the blessings promised (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.3.9-10">Prv 3:9-10</a>), therefore I will “honor” God in the matter of tithes. This substitution of an outward show for the inward dynamic of love, gratitude, and faith was often the curse of Israel’s formalized religion. However, the principle itself—that those who honor God and live in cooperation with him and his laws are generally those who are God-blessed (not necessarily in material terms)—is a scriptural one, and the authors of Proverbs must not be blamed for the perversions that arose subsequently.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Introduction: <a href="?bref=Pr.1.1-7">1:1-7</a></p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Pr.1.1-7">Proverbs 1:1-7</a> sets out the purpose of the wisdom movement in Israel. The subtitle of the whole book is found in verse <a href="?bref=Pr.1.2">2</a>: “The purpose of these proverbs is to teach people wisdom and discipline, and to help them understand wise sayings” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The question of the authorship of this section has already been discussed, but there is certainly nothing incongruous about Solomon’s authorship. In the earlier part of his reign, Solomon showed a deep longing for the wisdom that was required to govern his people rightly (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.7-9">1 Kgs 3:7-9</a>), and there is the earnest desire here that his subjects might have a similar understanding. Verses <a href="?bref=Pr.1.1-6">1-6</a> form one sentence in Hebrew and include no fewer than 11 different aspects of wisdom. The first of them, “wisdom,” occurs 37 times in Proverbs and indicates an informed, skillful use of knowledge. It is only by taking the first step of trusting in the Lord that a person can enter into wisdom. Morality is not situational, nor an absolute in itself; it requires an unchanging point of reference that can only be found in God.</p>
<p class="h3">Lessons on Wisdom: <a href="?bref=Pr.1.8-9.18">1:8–9:18</a></p>
<p class="fl">This section is composed of 13 distinct lessons on wisdom, most of which are introduced by “My son” or something similar. The final lesson (<a href="?bref=Pr.8.1-9.18">8:1–9:18</a>) is given by Wisdom herself. This method indicates the warm, personal relationship between the teacher and his pupils, who, in the ancient Near East, would be exclusively male. A similar style is found in both Egyptian and Mesopotamian wisdom literature and could well have been adopted by Solomon, who, in the humility and God-fearing concern for the national well-being of his earlier years, would have been a teacher par excellence.</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 1: Avoiding Evil Companions (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.8-33">1:8-33</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Three voices are raised: (1) the specious voice of those who promise quick gains by violence (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.1.10-14">10-14</a>); (2) the wise man himself (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.1.15-19">15-19</a>), who reinforces the advice of parents patiently given over the years (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.1.8-9">8-9</a>) and who advocates a clean break with violent men doomed to a violent end; and (3) Wisdom (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.1.20-33">20-33</a>), whose appeal is not furtive but open and who seeks to give others her own spirit of wisdom (v <a href="?bref=Pr.1.23">23</a>). Those who spurn the voice of wisdom will experience judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.1.29-33">29-33</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 2: The Rewards of Wisdom (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.1-22">2:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">While wisdom is ultimately God-given (v <a href="?bref=Pr.2.6">6</a>), people must seek it with an intensity of desire that characterized the psalmist (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.2-4">Prv 2:2-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.63.1">Ps 63:1</a>). There is no contradiction here, but a paradox that underlines the fact that God’s gifts are not given lightly but are given to those who, by their attitude of heart and will, merit them. The benefits of wisdom outlined (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.7-22">Prv 2:7-22</a>) have both negative and positive and both material and spiritual elements. The peril of associating with immoral women, which is referred to so frequently in Proverbs, is mentioned for the first time (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.2.16-19">16-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h4"> Lesson 3: The Rewards of Complete Trust in God (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.1-10">3:1-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">For the Jew there was always the temptation to try to ensure blessing by an outward show of religion, and verses <a href="?bref=Pr.3.9-10">9-10</a> could be misinterpreted. But the context stresses the requirement of heart loyalty and obedience (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.3.1-8">1-8</a>). “God first” (v <a href="?bref=Pr.3.6">6</a>) is the fundamental need; without this an individual or a nation is impoverished (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1-11">Hg 1:1-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 4: The Need for Discipline (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.11-20">3:11-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of the major themes in Proverbs is discipline, especially that of a father chastising his son (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.11-12">Prv 3:11-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-11">Heb 12:5-11</a>). The other theme here is the praise of wisdom and the benefits it bestows.</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 5: Wisdom and Common Sense (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.21-35">3:21-35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Wisdom and common sense will result in safety (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.3.23-26">23-26</a>) and guard against unwise acts (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.3.27-32">27-32</a>). But the underlying security is found in verse <a href="?bref=Pr.3.26">26</a>: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is your security.”</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 6: Determination (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.1-9">4:1-9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Here the teacher gives his own testimony and shows that he is drawing on the accumulated wisdom of an earlier generation (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.4.1-6">1-6</a>). There is an emphasis upon determination, with the will resolutely set to gain wisdom, as the verbs in verses <a href="?bref=Pr.4.5-9">5-9</a> show.</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 7: The Straight Path (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.10-19">4:10-19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">An equal determination is necessary to keep clear of evil men and their pursuits (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.4.14-17">14-17</a>). Note the graphic description, both beautiful and frightening, of the two paths (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.4.18-19">18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h4"> Lesson 8: Pursuing Righteousness and Avoiding Evil (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.20-27">4:20-27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The single-minded pursuit of righteousness and its corollary, the avoidance of every kind of evil (cf. <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.22">1 Thes 5:22</a>), involves our hearing (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.20">Prv 4:20</a>), memories (v <a href="?bref=Pr.4.21">21</a>), hearts (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.4.21,23">21, 23</a>), sight (v <a href="?bref=Pr.4.25">25</a>), and wills (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.4.26-27">26-27</a>). It means total commitment to God.</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 9: Sexual Purity (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.1-23">5:1-23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In blunt language that cannot possibly be misunderstood, the perils of sexual prostitution and the wisdom of faithfulness within marriage are underscored. In sexual relationships there can be no purely private morality; others are necessarily involved, and God is more than a concerned spectator (v <a href="?bref=Pr.5.21">21</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 10: The Things God Hates (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.1-19">6:1-19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">First (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.6.1-5">1-5</a>), there is straightforward advice about the need to avoid rash pledges. If one is foolish enough to be already involved, the sensible thing is to swallow one’s pride and extricate oneself as soon as possible. The second lesson—to emulate the ants in their diligent preparation for future need (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.6.6-11">6-11</a>)—anticipates the contrasting attention later given to the sluggard (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.13">22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.26.13-16">26:13-16</a>). The third lesson describes in detail the slick, deceitful “con man” (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.12-19">6:12-19</a>). He is to be avoided.</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 11: Illicit Sexual Relationships (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.20-35">6:20-35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section continues with the subject of illicit sexual relationships, showing God’s attitude to this particular form of sin. The wounded husband will prove a formidable adversary, should he discover infidelity (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.6.33-35">33-35</a>), and the effect upon the adulterer himself will be utterly disastrous (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.6.26-32">26-32</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 12: The Wiles of the Prostitute (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.1-27">7:1-27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This chapter gives a graphic illustration of the wiles of a prostitute. Speciously, the pleasures she offers appear alluring, enhanced by the element of risk, but in fact the night’s adventure invariably proves to be the road to hell (v <a href="?bref=Pr.7.27">27</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Lesson 13: Wisdom’s Direct Appeal (<a href="?bref=Pr.8.1-9.18">8:1–9:18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In contrast to the smooth-tongued, deadly seductress of chapter <a href="?bref=Pr.7.1-27">7</a> and the brazen, loud-mouthed prostitute of <a href="?bref=Pr.9.13-18">9:13-18</a>, there are two complementary pictures of Wisdom. The first, in <a href="?bref=Pr.8.1-36">8:1-36</a>, is one of the most remarkable examples of personification in the OT. Wisdom seeks not the ruin of one but the welfare of all (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.8.1-5">1-5</a>). Wisdom and integrity, righteous conduct and frankness are pictured as inseparable entities (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.8.6-13">6-13</a>). But there remains an emphasis on the blessings that result from the quest for wisdom (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.8.14-21">14-21</a>). Kings, judges, and rulers are dependent on her, and success of the most desirable kind is her gift to her followers. Verses <a href="?bref=Pr.8.22-31">22-31</a> are virtually a theological explanation for the preeminence of Wisdom, showing her close association with God’s creative activity.</p>
<p>Understandably, many Christians have seen in these verses an anticipation of Christ himself. The NT sees Christ as the answer to two of the most vital religious issues: how does God approach mankind, and how did he create the world? Here is the answer—by Wisdom. The connection may be carried into the next section (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.8.33-36">33-36</a>), where Wisdom, like Christ in the NT, is seen as the one absolutely essential and desirable thing.</p>
<p>In the second picture of Wisdom (<a href="?bref=Pr.9.1-6">9:1-6</a>), she is seen as a gracious, generous hostess, offering a banquet that issues in life (cf. Jesus’ parable in <a href="?bref=Luke.14.15-24">Lk 14:15-24</a>). A further contrast with the immoral woman in <a href="?bref=Pr.9.13-18">Proverbs 9:13-18</a> notes, pointedly, that the latter’s guests end up in hell. A series of proverbs on the contrast between the wise and foolish (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.9.7-12">7-12</a>) come between the two pictures. They show how teachable the wise man is, in contrast to the fool. Once more the true foundation of life is clearly defined (v <a href="?bref=Pr.9.10">10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Collected Proverbs of Solomon: <a href="?bref=Pr.10.1-22.16">10:1–22:16</a></p>
<p class="fl">The 375 proverbs in this section were probably selected from the 3,000 for which Solomon is credited (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.32">1 Kgs 4:32</a>). Each verse is a unit, with a contrast or a comparison between its two lines. There are understandable repetitions (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.14.12">Prv 14:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.25">16:25</a>), almost inevitable in a large collection of this kind. The common sense of the proverbial sayings, each of which has been proved in experience, is evident, but one must allow for varying levels; some appear rather mundane and close to worldly wisdom. But taken as a whole, they provide a practical guide, sanctioned by God, for everyday life. Again, it must be stressed that the religious life, based on the law and the covenant relationship, is assumed. God is vitally concerned with the minute details of life, and religious issues are not entirely bypassed (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.10.27-29">10:27-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.14.27">14:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.16,33">15:16, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.10">18:10</a>). This section in Proverbs cannot be read quickly; each verse demands a pause to allow its point to penetrate the mind. Since there is no systematic arrangement of the proverbs, the most helpful way of approach into this section may be by a consideration of the principal themes. It would be a valuable study to collate the references to each subject:</p>
<p class="list-space"> 1. The rewards of the righteous and the end of the ungodly (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.2,7,16,27-30">10:2, 7, 16, 27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.3-9">11:3-9</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 2. The fool. The three Hebrew words translated “fool” can all have the sense of stubborn rebelliousness as well as dullness of intellect, so “rebel” is often an apt rendering. The fool gives his parents grief and is a menace to society. His mind is completely closed to reason and his unbridled words cause untold damage. In his case, correction is pointless; he is beyond hope.</p>
<p class="list"> 3. The simple. The reference here is to the large, uncommitted group, neither fools nor wise, but those who are open to the gentle persuasion of concerned wisdom teachers. The main appeal of this section is to this group rather than to the wise and prudent, who have already “graduated.”</p>
<p class="list"> 4. The lazy. This person is often contrasted with the industrious (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.10.4-5">10:4-5</a>) and is mercilessly satirized for his apathy and weak excuses.</p>
<p class="list"> 5. The power of words. They can wound or heal (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.18">12:18</a>). The stress on honest speech, in contrast to deceitful, thoughtless words, is well illustrated in the same chapter (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.12.6,13-14,17-19,22">12:6, 13-14, 17-19, 22</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 6. Wisdom. Chapter <a href="?bref=Pr.13.1-25">13</a> shows how it may be derived from parents (v <a href="?bref=Pr.13.1">1</a>), the Scriptures (v <a href="?bref=Pr.13.13">13</a>), the class of the wise (v <a href="?bref=Pr.13.14">14</a>), and good company (v <a href="?bref=Pr.13.20">20</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 7. Justice. The stress on this echoes the great prophets. In particular, bribery is condemned (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.8,23">17:8, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.16">18:16</a>), as are false witnesses (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.5,9,28">19:5, 9, 28</a>), while open-mindedness is commended (<a href="?bref=Pr.18.17">18:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 8. Neighborliness. Fair-weather “friends” are often referred to (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.19.4-7">19:4-7</a>) and contrasted with the true friend (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.17">17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.24">18:24</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 9. Riches and poverty. These conditions are approached in a variety of ways, but always with an emphasis on moral and spiritual rather than merely material prosperity (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.21.6">21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.1,4">22:1, 4</a>). Care for the poor is frequently demanded (<a href="?bref=Pr.21.13">21:13</a>)—to be accompanied with the highest motives (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.2">22:2</a>).</p>
<p class="list">10. Family life. There is an attractive picture of an ideal family, with its industrious husband, an understanding wife who is a blessing to him (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.4">12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.14.1">14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.22">18:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.19.14">19:14</a>), and obedient children, disciplined when necessary by punishment (<a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.13-14">23:13-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Final Section—More Wise Advice: <a href="?bref=Pr.22.17-31.31">22:17–31:31</a></p>
<p class="fl">While the subjects considered and the general outlook are unchanged, the proverbs in this section are generally longer and there is an evident attempt to group together proverbs dealing with particular subjects—for example, the perils of strong drink (<a href="?bref=Pr.23.29-35">23:29-35</a>). The religious motive of the editor of this section is evident; he writes that people should trust in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.19">22:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Additional Proverbs: <a href="?bref=Pr.22.17-24.34">22:17–24:34</a></p>
<p class="fl">This may be viewed as a supplement to the previous section dealing further with the subjects of justice, wise business policy, slander, and laziness. The humorous but pointed proverb of the lazy man’s field is the longest in the book.</p>
<p class="h4">Additional Solomonic Proverbs: <a href="?bref=Pr.25.1-29.27">25:1–29:27</a></p>
<p class="fl">From the many Solomonic proverbs not included in the main collection (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.1-22.16">10:1–22:16</a>), the aides of Hezekiah selected and edited a further group of Solomon’s proverbs. Again, there is evidence of an effort to group related proverbs—for example, the place of kings (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.2-7">25:2-7</a>); unwise litigation (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.25.8-10">8-10</a>); the fool (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.1-12">26:1-12</a>); laziness (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.26.13-16">13-16</a>); and the troublemaker (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.26.17-27">17-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Wisdom of Agur: <a href="?bref=Pr.30.1-33">30:1-33</a></p>
<p class="fl">The humility of the wise man in the presence of an all-wise God emerges clearly in Agur’s introduction (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.30.1-4">1-4</a>), a passage paralleled in <a href="?bref=Job.38.1-39.30">Job 38–39</a>. His teaching method was apparently to confront his students with a number of examples of a point under discussion, the “two . . . three . . . four” method, indicating that the catalogue was not complete and encouraging them to add further illustrations from their own experience. Agur was evidently in close and perceptive touch with life at every level.</p>
<p class="h4">The Wisdom of Lemuel: <a href="?bref=Pr.31.1-9">31:1-9</a></p>
<p class="fl">This section, inspired by his mother, deals yet again with sexual relationships, the perils of intoxication, and the need to champion the poor and oppressed. Lemuel’s name, meaning “belonging to God,” probably tells us still more about his mother.</p>
<p class="h4">The Ideal Wife: <a href="?bref=Pr.31.10-31">31:10-31</a></p>
<p class="fl">Every verse of this poem, which was possibly anonymous, begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet, a device that often signified completeness. Coming at the end of Proverbs (a book that is forthright when dealing with the subject of the immoral woman), it gives, in antithesis, a refreshing picture of a cultured, well-to-do housewife and mother. At the same time, it provides an enlightening insight into several facets of contemporary life. As elsewhere in the book, her underlying relationship to God (v <a href="?bref=Pr.31.30">30</a>) results in desirable virtues that include trustworthiness (v <a href="?bref=Pr.31.11">11</a>), immense application (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.31.13-19,24,27">13-19, 24, 27</a>), charity (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.31.19-20">19-20</a>), foresight (vv <a href="?bref=Pr.31.21,25">21, 25</a>), wisdom, and kindness (v <a href="?bref=Pr.31.26">26</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">PROVIDENCE*</p>
<p class="fl">God’s activity throughout history in providing for the needs of human beings, especially those who believe in him.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SignificanceofProvidence">Significance of Providence</p>
<p class="fl">All through the centuries of human existence there have been those who took great comfort in God’s providential care. God has not left this planet alone in the vast universe or forgotten for a moment the human situation. God visits, touches, communicates, controls, and intervenes, coming before and between people and their needs. Providence is ground for thankfulness.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CounterfeitConceptsofProvidence">Counterfeit Concepts of Providence</p>
<p class="fl">The fact that the nonbelieving world has so many erroneous ideas about providence proves that this is an immensely realistic issue. At the heart of every nonbiblical proposal about providence is the denial of the personhood of God. In its place stands some cold principle or force dominating man and clashing with his life. It may be all-pervasive or local. It may be rational or irrational, consistent or arbitrary. False providences include:</p>
<p class="h3">Fate</p>
<p class="fl">Countless numbers of people have believed themselves to be trapped by a sometimes fickle and always foreboding fate. “As fate would have it,” they say.</p>
<p class="h3">Luck</p>
<p class="fl">Life is indeed fortuitous at times. Optimists speak of “fortune,” or less solemnly of “luck.” But then, since this is all so impersonal, fortune-tellers arose, and someone dreamed up “lady luck.”</p>
<p class="h3">Serendipity</p>
<p class="fl">This is the term used by the one who takes credit for unintentional discoveries of good things along the way in life. But he refuses to acknowledge that God was there before him and so he does not give thanks.</p>
<p class="h3">History</p>
<p class="fl">Some Marxist propagandists have championed their cause by saying, “History is on our side.” They were appealing to a supposed inevitability of future events that would lead to a Communistic world. “History” in such a statement appears to have taken on a divine dimension. Likewise, when American leaders have affirmed a “manifest destiny” for the United States to be the superior power in the Western hemisphere or in the world at large, the same kind of reasoning is employed.</p>
<p class="h3">Progress</p>
<p class="fl">The development of science and technology, education and social evolution, and territorial conquests have made some people believers in progress as something more than what is seen. Until the two world wars, there was the illusion of a relentless momentum pushing upward and onward forever. In some respects, progress is but providence by another name, but not to the degree that people assume for themselves the glory that belongs to God.</p>
<p class="h3">Nature</p>
<p class="fl">Men like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau of 19th-century New England attributed to nature the gifts of providence. But nature is impersonal and abstract.</p>
<p class="h3">Natural Selection and the Survival of the Fittest</p>
<p class="fl">Charles Darwin’s classic on biological evolution, <span class="ital">The Origin of the Species,</span> appeared in 1859. It popularized two relatively new theories. For millions of people, the mysterious decisions behind “natural selection” intrigued the thoughtful more than the notion of God’s providence. And the idea that “the fit survive” necessarily makes providence altogether unnecessary.</p>
<p>These counterfeit views compete with the idea of God’s providence. Of course, they cannot all be true. Nor can they satisfy the inquirer whose personhood calls insistently for a personal providence that reflects a knowledge of his individual needs and uniqueness. Only the Christian doctrine of providence provides that.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalMeaningofProvidence">Biblical Meaning of Providence</p>
<p class="fl">Providence is basically God’s provision for the needs of people on time. The classic statement is found in Abraham’s confession of faith in his life’s most difficult test. He was under the duress of God’s command to provide something he could not afford—his son in sacrifice. He struggled with the dilemma of losing his son or losing God’s friendship. In answer to Isaac’s question about a sacrifice for God, Abraham exclaimed, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son” (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.8">Gn 22:8</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The word “providence” means literally “to see before,” and therefore by implication to do something about the situation. In this case, there was already upon Mt Moriah a suitable sacrifice, “a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.22.13">13</a>). The unbelieving analysis of that situation would understand only that through an ordinary process an animal had become entangled in dense underbrush, and coincidentally Abraham and Isaac happened to arrive on the scene. But to believing Abraham, who was led for three days toward that one point in time and space in desperate need of a divine provision, it was altogether clear to him that God, by whatever process, had stationed the ram at the place of sacrifice for his use. “Provision” and “providence” are coordinately related to their verbal root, “provide,” and are essentially and etymologically the same. However, they are theologically distinguished in usage by providence’s having come to mean divine provision on the basis of foresight.</p>
<p>The great text on providence in the NT is also set in a context of sacrifice pleasing to God. Paul had reason to commend the Philippians’ sacrificial support of his missionary work. To them he stated his unbounded confidence in the providential care of God: “This same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.19">Phil 4:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The sacrifice of Christ Jesus for us confirms the doctrine of providence with a most reasonable certitude. What God initially required of Abraham but did not ultimately require (the sacrifice of his son), he required of himself and did fulfill two millennia later. It is God’s nature to supply, to foresee man’s need and to provide for him.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ProvidenceandtheNatureofGod">Providence and the Nature of God</p>
<p class="fl">Immediately following his reassuring words to the Philippians about the treasury of providence (“his riches in glory”—<a href="?bref=Phil.4.19">Phil 4:19</a>), the apostle Paul wrote a doxology to God “our Father” (v <a href="?bref=Phil.4.20">20</a>). Providence is appropriately pictured in the fatherhood of God. His fatherhood is the attribute, and providence is the act that expresses it. Fathers provide and guide. Fathers construct conditions of opportunity for children without crowding their freedom. They exercise governance in a context of caring. Providence, therefore, as an activity of God, flows naturally from God’s fatherly nature.</p>

<p class="h1">PSALM 151*</p>
<p class="fl">A noncanonical psalm that, prior to the Qumran discoveries, was known only through ancient translations (LXX, Latin, and Syriac). At Qumran the psalm was included in the Hebrew Psalm Scroll (11Q). The Hebrew text indicates two separate poems. The first poem (designated as 151A) is a commentary on <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-13">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>. It relates how David was set over his father’s flocks but was made king over God’s people after God had looked upon his heart. The second poem (151B) is a commentary on <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Samuel 17</a> and deals with David and Goliath. It is thought by some to show the bravery of David in contrast to his humility, as is shown in 151A.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Authors">Authors</p>
<p class="h3">The Evidence of the Titles</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew Bible credits David with 73 psalms, compared with 84 in the Septuagint and 85 in the Latin Vulgate. Korah and Asaph, the leaders of the Levitical singing groups, are connected with 11 and 12 psalms, respectively (although <a href="?bref=Ps.43.1-5">Ps 43</a> is almost certainly to be attributed to Korah also). Two psalms are ascribed to Solomon (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-20">Pss 72</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.127.1-5">127</a>), one to Moses (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-17">Ps 90</a>), and one to Ethan (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">Ps 89</a>), while Heman shares the credit for one psalm with the sons of Korah (<a href="?bref=Ps.88.1-18">Ps 88</a>). The remainder are sometimes called “orphan psalms” because of their anonymity.</p>
<p>The preposition “of” found in the titles (for example, “A Psalm of David”) usually indicates authorship. But in the case of groups, such as the sons of Asaph or Korah, it may simply indicate that the psalms were included in their repertoire. Less plausible is the idea that it may also be rendered “for the use of.” For example, some of the “Psalms of David” might be “for the use of” the Davidic king on some occasion.</p>
<p class="h3">Historical Allusions in the Titles</p>
<p class="fl">Many of the titles refer to specific events in the life of David (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.3.1-8">Pss 3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.7.1-17">7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.30.1-12">30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">51</a>). There is evidence that the titles were added at an early date. When the psalms were translated into Greek, there appears to have been some difficulty in translating the titles, possibly because of their antiquity. If the historical references were added at a late date, there is no reason why plausible backgrounds could not have been supplied for all the Davidic psalms, instead of only a few. Moreover, the apparent disparity between the title and the actual content of some psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.30.1-12">Ps 30</a>) indicates that the titles were supplied by those who knew about a connection unknown to a later editor. Admittedly, there are minor discrepancies between the titles and the references in the historical books. For example, in <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">Psalm 34</a> David acts the madman before Abimelech, whereas in 1 Samuel it is before Achish. But probably Abimelech was the general name (like Pharaoh for the kings of Egypt) for all the Philistine kings (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.21.32">Gn 21:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.26">26:26</a>).</p>
<p>Evidence of authorship and historical background in the titles, therefore, may be taken as a reasonably reliable guide. But the internal difficulties, together with the freedom exercised by successive translators into Greek, Syriac, and Latin, indicates that they were not regarded as inspired.</p>
<p class="h3">The Case for Davidic Authorship</p>
<p class="fl">Five points can be offered to support David’s authorship of several psalms:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The authenticity of David’s lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.19-27">2 Sm 1:19-27</a>) is generally accepted. This indicates a deeply poetic spirit and a generous temperament that prepares us to accept those psalms ascribed to David that evidence similar characteristics. “The last words of David” is another Davidic poem in the historical books (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.1-7">2 Sm 23:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. David had a reputation as a skillful musician at Saul’s court (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.16-18">1 Sm 16:16-18</a>). Amos comments on his inventiveness as a musician (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.5">Am 6:5</a>), while the Chronicler repeatedly stresses his contribution to the musical aspect of temple worship (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.31">1 Chr 6:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.7">16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.10">Ezr 3:10</a>). The Jewish historian Josephus said that David composed songs and hymns to God in varied meters. The probability is that David, as well as amassing materials and preparing the plans for Solomon’s temple, also gave attention to the temple worship. This is his place in Jewish tradition.</p>
<p class="list">3. The early monarchy, with a freshly secured independence, national prestige, and a new prosperity, would most likely be a time of artistic creativity. David was at the heart of this movement.</p>
<p class="list">4. There is a close correspondence between David’s life as described in the historical books and certain psalms, for example, his sin concerning Bathsheba and Uriah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.2-12.25">2 Sm 11:2–12:25</a>) and <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a>, as witnessed in the title. David’s lapses and genuine repentance, as well as the varied aspects of his career—shepherd, fugitive, warrior, and so on—find expression in many of the psalms attributed to him. The correspondence between the David of the psalms and the David of the historical books is close, especially in the display of strong faith in God.</p>
<p class="list">5. Although some scholars believe that when “David” is mentioned in the NT, it is simply a reference to the book of Psalms and not an ascription of authorship, a straightforward interpretation of the NT text strengthens the case for Davidic authorship. David is specifically named as the author of various psalms in <a href="?bref=Matt.22.41-45">Matthew 22:41-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.16">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.25,34">2:25, 34</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.6">Romans 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.9">11:9</a>.</p>
<p class="sp">In conclusion, there is strong support for the view that the substantial nucleus of the Psalter is Davidic. Moreover, it is probable that some of the anonymous psalms were the work of the “sweet psalmist of Israel” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.1">2 Sm 23:1</a>). <a href="?bref=Heb.4.7">Hebrews 4:7</a> refers one of these, <a href="?bref=Ps.95.1-11">Psalm 95</a>, to David (see also <a href="?bref=Acts.4.25">Acts 4:25</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Ps 2</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Once David’s authorship of several psalms is established, then it must follow that these psalms are dated during David’s life. Thus, most of the psalms formed the hymnbook of Israel in the period of the monarchy. Other psalms were written later. For example, <a href="?bref=Ps.137.1-9">Psalm 137</a> is clearly exilic, and <a href="?bref=Ps.107.2-3">Psalms 107:2-3</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.126.1">126:1</a> allude to the return from captivity. <a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-26">Psalms 44</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.79.1-13">79</a> are probably, but not conclusively, postexilic.</p>
<p>The book of Psalms was probably the product of a considerable period of growth. The incidence of Davidic psalms in the first section indicates that it was completed early, possibly toward the end of David’s reign. The remainder of the process of compilation is difficult to reconstruct, but the fact that the titles, with their allusions to authors, events, and musical directions, become less frequent in the two final collections (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-150.6">Pss 90–150</a>) lends support to the probability that the collections were combined chronologically in the sequence in which they are found today. Ezra is traditionally credited with the final grouping and editing of the psalms, a hypothesis that appears reasonable in light of his vital contribution to the systematic reshaping of the national religious life. In any case, the process was completed before the translation of the Psalter into Greek (the Septuagint) at the end of the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, since the traditional order is found there. General, but not complete, support comes also from the evidence of the Dead Sea Scrolls. At some point minor dislocations occurred. <a href="?bref=Ps.9.1-20">Psalms 9</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.10.1-18">10</a> may have originally formed one psalm (as in the Septuagint), and there is a strong case for combining <a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-11">Psalms 42</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.43.1-5">43</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">As the book of Psalms lies before us, its connection with temple worship is apparent. Fifty-five psalms are addressed to the choirmaster, and as we have noted, 23 or 24 are linked with the two main guilds of Levitical singers, Asaph and Korah. The musical instruments, such as stringed instruments (<a href="?bref=Ps.55.1">Ps 55 title</a>) and flutes (<a href="?bref=Ps.5.1">Ps 5 title</a>) are noted. Probably other terms concern musical directions: <span class="hebrew">Selah</span><span class="ital">,</span> which occurs 71 times, may indicate a pause or crescendo; <span class="hebrew">Higgaion</span> (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.16">Ps 9:16</a>) may recommend a meditative attitude. Seemingly obscure references like “The Hind of the Dawn” (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.1">Ps 22 title</a>), “Lilies” (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Pss 45</a> title; 80 title) and “The Dove on Far-off Terebinths” (<a href="?bref=Ps.56.1">Ps 56 title</a>) may indicate the tunes to which the psalms were to be sung. The precise meaning of other terms, such as <span class="hebrew">Shiggaion</span> (<a href="?bref=Ps.7.1">Ps 7 title</a>) or <span class="hebrew">Alamoth</span> (conjecturally a choir of ladies, <a href="?bref=Ps.46.1">Ps 46 title</a>), may also be in the realm of musical directions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Structure">Structure</p>
<p class="fl">The Psalter, possibly in conscious imitation of the five books of Moses in the Law, is divided into five sections (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-41.13">Pss 1–41</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-72.20">42–72</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-89.52">73–89</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-106.48">90–106</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.1-150.6">107–150</a>), separated by four doxologies (<a href="?bref=Ps.41.13">41:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.72.18-19">72:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.52">89:52</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.48">106:48</a>). While the editorial comment in <a href="?bref=Ps.72.20">Psalm 72:20</a> notes that the psalms of David were ended, Davidic psalms are found later in the book (<a href="?bref=Ps.86.1-17">Pss 86</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.101.1-8">101</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-22">103</a>), suggesting that at least some of these sections circulated independently until their inclusion in the final collection. Such independence is further indicated by the duplications in the various sections (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.14.1-7">Pss 14</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.53.1-6">53</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.13-17">40:13-17</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.70.1-5">70</a>) and by the use of different names for God, who is usually referred to as “Lord” in the first collection and as “God” in the second.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Canonicity">Canonicity</p>
<p class="fl">In the various recensions of the third section of the Hebrew canon, the Writings or Holy Books, the book of Psalms is almost invariably placed first. It was clearly regarded as the most important book in this section, and in <a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">Luke 24:44</a>, “Psalms” is synonymous with “Writings” as its title. While the canonicity of all the contents of the Writings was not finalized until the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, it is likely that the book of Psalms was accepted as inspired long before this, probably by 300 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>It must not be inferred that all the psalms had their origin in the cultic life of the community, but the sanctuary was the focal point of Israel’s worship for the greater part of the OT period. Prayer was possible elsewhere, but whenever practicable, it was customary for the worshiper to present his petitions at the main sanctuary. And thanksgiving in ancient Israel was almost invariably connected with a thank offering, vow offering, or freewill offering. The psalms could have been composed by individuals, like David, who had the requisite technical ability. And it must be appreciated that poetry, an unfamiliar medium to most Western civilizations, was the natural way for the ancient Easterner to express his emotions. Or the individual could have engaged a member of the Levitical guilds of musicians to frame either his supplication or his thanksgiving. Gradually, a comprehensive collection of psalms would be available for the use of individuals, the congregation, and even the entire nation in any conceivable situation. Once finalized, this collection served not only the subsequent needs of Israel but the devotional requirements of successive generations of Christians as well. Whatever the origin of an individual psalm, each has finally been incorporated in a cultic setting, and it may be assumed that the best of Israel’s psalmody has thus been preserved.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheology">Purpose and Theology</p>
<p class="h3">The Doctrine of God</p>
<p class="fl">In both adversity and prosperity, the psalmists indicate a strong faith in God and a clear conception of his attributes. Understandably, anthropomorphisms (ascribing human characteristics to nonhuman things) abound, with references to God’s voice, words, ears, eyes, face, or hands and fingers. No exception needs to be taken to this. Anthropomorphisms of this kind are, in fact, widely used by present-day Christians. Their great value is that they make God real to the worshiper. How else could humans describe God, except in terms of their own understanding?</p>
<p>The monotheism of the psalms emerges clearly in <a href="?bref=Ps.115.3-8">Psalms 115:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.15-18">135:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-24">139</a>. God is viewed as the Creator (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.3">Pss 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.11">89:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.95.3-5">95:3-5</a>), with references to the creation mythology of surrounding nations (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.89.10">Ps 89:10</a>) serving merely as illustrations of his almighty creative power. He is proclaimed as the Lord of history (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-26">Pss 44</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">78</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1-19">80</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.81.1-16">81</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.105.1-45">105</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1-48">106</a>) and as the sovereign controller of nature (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.7">Pss 18:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">19:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.65.8-13">65:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.26-42">105:26-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.5-7">135:5-7</a>). The psalmists never tired of celebrating God’s absolute greatness.</p>
<p class="h3">The Human Perspective</p>
<p class="fl">The Psalter is a God-centered book, but humanity has a worthy place, in spite of the vast gulf between them and their Creator (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.3-4">Pss 8:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.145.3-4">145:3-4</a>) and the limitations of their earthly life (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.9-10">Ps 90:9-10</a>). By the will of God, humans occupy a responsible, mediating position between God and all other created beings (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.5-8">Ps 8:5-8</a>). The relationship with a righteous God is endangered by sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.1-48">Ps 106</a>), but God is gracious and long-suffering (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-22">Ps 103</a>), faithful and forgiving (<a href="?bref=Ps.130.1-8">Ps 130</a>). While references to the sacrificial system are not lacking (<a href="?bref=Ps.20.3">Pss 20:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.50.8-9">50:8-9</a>), the emphasis is upon a personal piety that demands obedience and a surrendered heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.40.6-8">Ps 40:6-8</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a> indicates a depth of sin with which the sacrificial system was totally inadequate to cope; the psalmist could only cast himself, in total penitence, upon God’s mercy. Man’s moral obligations (<a href="?bref=Ps.15.1-5">Pss 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.24.3-5">24:3-5</a>) and loyalty to the law (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.7-11">Pss 19:7-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.1-176">119</a>) are fully accepted. Throughout, there is the revelation of a strong personal relationship that encourages prayer and praise and invites trust.</p>
<p class="h3">The Afterlife</p>
<p class="fl">The Psalms maintain the traditional Hebrew view of Sheol as the abode of the departed, without distinction between the good and evil, where all but mere existence has perished. The chief complaint of the devout man was that, in Sheol, all meaningful relationship with God ceased (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.5">Pss 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.10-12">88:10-12</a>). However, it was recognized that, since God was almighty, even Sheol was not exempt from his reach (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.8">Ps 139:8</a>). Added to this was the preciousness and strength of fellowship with God, which could not be terminated even by death. <a href="?bref=Ps.16.9-11">Psalms 16:9-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.49.15">49:15</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.73.23-26">73:23-26</a> well illustrate this insight. The Psalter, therefore, witnesses to an important transitional phase in Israel’s belief.</p>
<p class="h3">Universal Recognition of God</p>
<p class="fl">Passages like <a href="?bref=Ps.9.11">Psalms 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.47.1-2,7-9">47:1-2, 7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.66.8">66:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.67.1-7">67</a>; and <a href="?bref=Ps.117.1">117:1</a> call upon all nations to acknowledge and praise God and show an awareness of his sovereignty over all nations. But this universalism does not appear to involve any desire to convert the heathen nations and, indeed, it is balanced by strong particularistic elements. God’s covenant relationship with his people and his mighty deeds on their behalf are the chief items for which the praise of all nations is summoned (<a href="?bref=Ps.47.3-4">Pss 47:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.66.8-9">66:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.126.2">126:2</a>). As elsewhere in the OT, the role of Israel is passive; her continued existence witnesses to God’s faithfulness and brings glory to him.</p>
<p class="h3">Lasting Value</p>
<p class="fl">Whatever the emotion of the psalmists, be it bitter complaint, anguished lament, or joyous exultation, all the psalms reflect one or other of the many aspects of communion with God. The reader may look “into the heart of all the saints” (so said Luther) as they faced life’s experiences in the awareness of a God who was all-seeing, all-knowing, and all-powerful. The strength of that personal relationship with God that typified OT worship at its best is exemplified here, and the many echoes of the psalms elsewhere in Israel’s literature show the powerful influence of these testimonies on the faithful. The fact that, almost invariably, little specific detail is given of the psalmists’ actual conditions has made it easier for the Psalter to become the universal hymnbook and devotional treasury of God’s people, in both public and private worship, until and including the present day. Modern life, materially, is vastly different from that of ancient Israel, but God remains unchanged and so do the basic needs of the human heart. The Holy Spirit, therefore, can still use this spiritual treasury as a means of revelation and communication between God and man. Few books in the Bible have exercised so profound an influence or been so widely used.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Introduction</p>
<p class="fl">It is more helpful to describe the psalms in categories than to explain them one by one in canonical order. The psalms can be categorized as follows:</p>
<p>Psalms of praise</p>
<p>Royal, messianic psalms</p>
<p>Passion psalms</p>
<p>Psalms about Zion</p>
<p>Laments</p>
<p>Imprecatory psalms</p>
<p>Penitential psalms</p>
<p>Wisdom psalms and historical psalms</p>
<p>Psalms of trust</p>
<p class="h3">Psalms of Praise</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew title, “Praises,” defines accurately a large part of the contents of the book. Each of the first four sections concludes with a doxology, while the fifth section concludes with five psalms, each of which begins and ends with one or two “Hallelujahs.” The last of these, <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1-6">Psalm 150</a>, sounds the call to total praise. God is to be praised for his being, for his great acts in creation, nature, and history on both the individual and the communal level.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Individual praise. In comparison with the number of individual laments, there are relatively few psalms in this category. Those normally included are <a href="?bref=Ps.9.1-20">Psalms 9</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">18</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">32</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.116.1-19">116</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.138.1-8">138</a>. This may, in part, be due to the universal tendency to complain rather than to express thanks. But a number of the laments do, in fact, include the note of thanksgiving for the anticipated deliverance, and the normal round of congregational thanksgiving would allow the individual to express his personal praise. However, it was customary in temple worship to give a verbal act of thanksgiving before the whole assembly whenever a vow offering or a thank offering was made. Such public testimony, and the communal meal associated with this type of sacrifice, is indicated in <a href="?bref=Ps.22.22-26">Psalms 22:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.66.13-20">66:13-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.116.17-19">116:17-19</a>. The inclusion of such opportunities for personal praise and testimony must have added warmth and significance to worship. Each act of deliverance and every experience of God’s mercy became part of salvation history, which was a cumulative, ongoing concept, not simply a recital of God’s deeds in earlier centuries.</p>
<p class="list">2. General communal praise. This is sometimes entitled “hymns” or “descriptive praise,” its main feature being linked to a particular act of deliverance. God is usually referred to in the third person, not directly. <a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-22">Psalm 103</a> may be taken as representative of this group. It begins and ends with individual references (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-5,22">1-5, 22b</a>), but the central section (esp. vv <a href="?bref=Ps.103.6-14">6-14</a>) shows that the psalmist was part of a worshiping community. There is first of all the imperative call to praise God for the full range of his mercy to each individual, including physical and spiritual deliverance and his sustaining and satisfying grace. Then the focus changes to his great works in history (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.103.6-7">6-7</a>). This forms a natural basis for the recital of those gracious qualities revealed so consistently during the course of the national history, especially his tender, fatherly care (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.103.8-14">8-14</a>). The frailty of humanity contrasts with God’s constancy (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.103.15-18">15-18</a>), and his rule, being universal and absolute (v <a href="?bref=Ps.103.19">19</a>), merits the praise of all things, living and inanimate, in heaven and on earth (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.103.19-22">19-22</a>). There is, however, a great number of possible variations in the way in which God is celebrated, as <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-9">Psalms 113</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">136</a>, which come within this class, illustrate.</p>
<p class="list">3. Specific communal praise. Occasionally termed “declarative praise,” this type of psalm connects with a particular outstanding evidence of God’s mercy and would most naturally follow soon after the event itself. Deliverance from an enemy provides the occasion for most of the psalms in this category (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.124.1-8">Pss 124</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.129.1-8">129</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.66.8-12">Psalm 66:8-12</a>, now the nucleus of an expanded recital of God’s goodness, was possibly once complete in itself. <a href="?bref=Ps.46.1-48.14">Psalms 46–48</a> may form a trilogy connected with the remarkable deliverance of Jerusalem from Sennacherib’s Assyrians in 701 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17-19.37">2 Kgs 18:17–19:37</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.67.1-7">Psalm 67</a> was probably composed in gratitude for a particular harvest. It is easy to see how psalms of this type could, in the process of time, acquire a more general usage.</p>
<p class="list">4. Praise for the God of nature. The first part of <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-14">Psalm 19</a> pictures the praise of God sounding from the heavens; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.1-11">Psalm 29</a> celebrates him as the God of the thunderstorm, which, sweeping in from the Mediterranean near Lebanon, pursues its awe-inspiring path southward into the wilderness of Kadesh, with the result that “in his temple” (the created world?) all are praising, “Glory, glory to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (v <a href="?bref=Ps.29.9">9</a>). His sovereignty and self-sufficiency in this world are celebrated in <a href="?bref=Ps.50.10-12">Psalm 50:10-12</a>; he is the God of growth and harvest (<a href="?bref=Ps.65.9-13">Ps 65:9-13</a>); in <a href="?bref=Ps.104.1-35">Psalm 104</a>, often called the “Hymn of Creation,” he sustains and supplies everything on the earth and in the seas and is the absolute Lord of all life (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.104.29-30">29-30</a>). There is no confusion between God and his creation; even the seemingly permanent heaven and earth will perish, but “you go on forever” (<a href="?bref=Ps.102.25-27">Ps 102:25-27</a>). Nature’s role is to proclaim the glory of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">Ps 19:1</a>) and to praise him (<a href="?bref=Ps.148.1-14">Ps 148</a>). People see themselves as insignificant when set against those forces of nature, which are themselves dwarfed by God—hence, the awareness of the immeasurable gulf between God and people that God has bridged by his grace (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Ps 8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Praise for God’s kingship. A relatively small group of psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.47.1-9">Pss 47</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.93.1-5">93</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.96.1-99.9">96–99</a>) celebrate the kingship of God in a way that goes beyond the ascription of praise noted in the foregoing groups. They are marked by acclamation, by both shouting and clapping when God “ascends.” Presumably, the reference is to his throne (<a href="?bref=Ps.47.1-5">Ps 47:1-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1-2">99:1-2</a>). “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> reigns” (<a href="?bref=Ps.93.1">Pss 93:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.1">97:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1">99:1</a>) is the frequent cry, and the nature of his reign is extolled (<a href="?bref=Ps.99.4-5">Ps 99:4-5</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Royal, Messianic Psalms</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Psalms 2</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">18</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.20.1-9">20</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.21.1-13">21</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">45</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.61.1-8">61</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-20">72</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">89</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.101.1-8">101</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-7">110</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.132.1-18">132</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.144.1-15">144</a> are usually included as the royal psalms. They do not form a literary category, since psalms of various types are included, but they all have some reference to the king, the nature of his rule, and his relationship to God. Since the Davidic monarchy was terminated in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, these psalms, almost certainly, were composed before that date. The language in these psalms often shows the king as being God’s vice-regent. For example, <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalm 45</a>, a royal marriage psalm, contains the assertion “Your throne, O God, endures for ever and ever” (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.6">45:6</a>). But this is best understood in terms of the throne being regarded as the Lord’s, occupied by the king as his representative. Similarly, the wording in <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Psalm 110:1</a>, “Sit at my right hand,” indicates the privileges and prerogatives that the king enjoys as God’s vice-regent. The balance of the OT evidence concerning the king shows that the monarchy in Israel was qualified by the nature of God’s covenantal relationship with his people; the king did not enjoy the absolutism claimed by most of the rulers of surrounding kingdoms.</p>
<p>Most of the royal psalms can also be called messianic psalms. They were interpreted as such in the early Christian church, as witnessed in Jesus Christ’s general statement that the psalmists wrote of him (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">Lk 24:44</a>) and by particular NT quotations. The main psalms concerned, and the NT references, are the following:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Psalm 2</a> (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.33">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.5">Heb 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5">5:5</a>), while linked with the Davidic king, nevertheless speaks of a universal vindication and rule, which far transcended even David’s rule. Further, the picture of the Davidic king, anointed to rule on the earth as the representative of God, who is enthroned in heaven, strongly suggests Christ’s mediating, incarnate ministry.</p>
<p class="list">2. <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalm 45</a> (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.8-9">Heb 1:8-9</a>), a marriage psalm for one of the Davidic kings, possibly Solomon, speaks not only of love and marriage but also a permanence and quality of rule. In the most obvious translation of verse <a href="?bref=Ps.45.6">6</a>, the writer addresses God, “Your divine throne endures for ever and ever.” The writer to the Hebrews clearly accepted this interpretation (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.8-9">Heb 1:8-9</a>) and used it in contrast to the exalted status of even the angels, reinforcing it with two other quotations from the psalms that originally applied to God (<a href="?bref=Ps.97.7">Ps 97:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.102.25-27">102:25-27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.1.6,10-12">Heb 1:6, 10-12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-7">Psalm 110</a> is the most frequently quoted messianic psalm (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.43-45">Mt 22:43-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.34-35">Acts 2:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">Heb 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5-10">5:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.20">6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.21">7:21</a>). The language, speaking of the privileges, universal victory and continuing priesthood of David and his successors, would be considered hyperbolic and possibly misleading except for its fulfillment in “great David’s greater Son.” In contrast to the angels, who are privileged to stand in God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.19">Lk 1:19</a>), Christ the Son sits in the place of power and authority (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.13">Heb 1:13</a>).</p>
<p class="sp">Other psalms that could also be designated messianic but are not specifically included among the royal psalms are <a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Psalm 8</a> (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.27">1 Cor 15:27</a>); <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">Psalm 40</a> (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.5-10">Heb 10:5-10</a>); <a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-20">Psalm 72</a>, with its idealized picture of the nature, consequences, and extent of the rule of God’s representative; <a href="?bref=Ps.118.22-23">Psalm 118:22-23</a>; and <a href="?bref=Ps.132.1-18">Psalm 132</a> (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.30">Acts 2:30</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Psalm23NltRenditionByTimothyRBotts"/>
<p class="h3">Passion Psalms</p>
<p class="fl">The four psalms in this group (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">Pss 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-36">69</a>; some scholars would also include <a href="?bref=Ps.102.1-28">Pss 102</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.109.1-31">109</a>) may also be regarded as messianic. They connect with that line of OT prophecy that interprets the Messiah’s ministry in terms of the Suffering Servant who features prominently in Isaiah (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-9">Is 42:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>). Of these four, <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a> is the most remarkable. Jesus recited part of it when he was on the cross (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.1">Ps 22:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Mt 27:46</a>), and other connections with the crucifixion scene are noteworthy (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.22.6-8,14-18">Ps 22:6-8, 14-18</a>). Some further considerations are even more significant: there is no suggestion of any awareness of sin; the suffering of the psalmist appears completely unjustified; there is no imprecatory element, even in the face of bitter persecution. This connects with the sinless Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>), who could even pray for his executioners (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.34">Lk 23:34</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Psalm 16:10</a> anticipates the triumph of the incorruptible Christ over the grave (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.24-31">Acts 2:24-31</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.40.6-8">Psalm 40:6-8</a> foreshadows the Incarnation and self-giving redemptive work of Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.5-10">Heb 10:5-10</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-36">Psalm 69</a> refers to the isolation resulting from a commitment to God’s cause (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.8-9">Ps 69:8-9</a>) and anticipates the part played by Judas in what was fundamentally God’s work in Christ (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.25-26">Ps 69:25-26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.109.8">Ps 109:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.53.10">Is 53:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.20">Acts 1:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Psalms about Zion</p>
<p class="fl">This group could have been classified as a subsection of communal praise, but due to the close historical connection between God’s choice of the house of David and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.68-72">Pss 78:68-72</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.11-13">132:11-13</a>), and their subsequent interrelated fortunes, we consider them at this point. There was a biting satire in the request of the Babylonians to the refugees of a shattered city to “Sing us one of the songs of Zion!” (<a href="?bref=Ps.137.3">Ps 137:3</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>), but it witnesses to the existence of such a collection. Praise of Zion was, in fact, almost synonymous with the praise of the Lord who dwelt there. Jerusalem’s continued survival, in spite of its difficulties, was ample demonstration of God’s enduring greatness (<a href="?bref=Ps.48.11-14">Ps 48:11-14</a>) and peculiar affection for the city that housed his temple (<a href="?bref=Ps.87.1-3">Ps 87:1-3</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-14">Psalms 48</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.76.1-12">76</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-12">84</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.87.1-7">87</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.122.1-9">122</a> are the main psalms in this category, but the theme itself appears widely throughout the psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.102.16">102:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.125.1">125:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.126.1-3">126:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.133.3">133:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.147.2">147:2</a>). The basis of the NT concept of a heavenly Jerusalem, the spiritual home of the regenerate of all nations, finds its origin in this concept, especially in <a href="?bref=Ps.87.1-7">Psalm 87</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">Laments</p>
<p class="fl">These are associated with specific occasions of distress and are of two types:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. National. The prophetic and historical books give several examples of the kind of occasion, such as drought, locust infestation, or enemy attack, that could prompt national laments, and also the inward and outward attitudes that accompanied them (e.g., <a href="?bref=Judg.20.23,26">Jgs 20:23, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.1-12">Jer 14:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.36.9">36:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.13-14">Jl 1:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.12-17">2:12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.5">Jon 3:5</a>). There is a regular structure in the psalms of this class: the distressing situation is first described; God is petitioned to come to the aid of his people, often with the reminder of his past mercies for Israel; finally, there is often an expression of confidence that God would heed their cry. Israel’s adversaries are clearly in mind in <a href="?bref=Ps.14.1-7">Psalms 14</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-26">44</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.60.1-12">60</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.74.1-23">74</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1-19">80</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.83.1-18">83</a>, while <a href="?bref=Ps.58.1-11">Psalms 58</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1-48">106</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.125.1-5">125</a> reflect situations less critical.</p>
<p class="list">2. Individual. There are so many of this type (approximately 50) that it is frequently described as the backbone of the Psalter. Their most obvious features are the sharpness of complaint and the bitterness of attack upon those responsible. As in the national laments, there is often complaint against God, especially for his lack of attention or his tardiness in intervening. The basic components of this type are almost identical to the national laments, except that they often conclude with the avowal to praise God in anticipation of deliverance (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.13.5-6">Ps 13:5-6</a>). Frequently, the lament is accompanied by thanksgiving for the deliverance sought and experienced, as illustrated in the two sections of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-21">Psalms 22:1-21</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.28.1-9">28:1-9</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">Imprecatory Psalms</p>
<p class="fl">Approximately 20 psalms contain passionate pleas for the overthrow of the wicked, in language that is often shocking. Any instant condemnation of this attitude must, however, be tempered by certain relevant considerations:</p>
<p>The cry for vengeance was not purely personal; it was firmly believed that God’s honor was at stake (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.109.21">Ps 109:21</a>). In an age where there was a less developed view of an afterlife, it was axiomatic that rewards and punishments resulting from obedience or disobedience to God, must be observable within this lifetime. Whenever this was not apparent, it would seem that no righteous God existed, and the name of God was dishonored (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.74.10">Ps 74:10</a>). This burning desire for the eradication of evil and evil men sprang from a consciousness of a moral God and virtually demanded the triumph of truth.</p>
<p>The poetic language is also prone to hyperbole—a feature not confined to the psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Neh.4.4-5">Neh 4:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.14-18">Jer 20:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.17">Am 7:17</a>). Such language is startling; indeed, part of its function was probably to startle—to express and promote a sense of outrage.</p>
<p>In the pre-Christian period, therefore, such outbursts were not completely unjustifiable. But in the light of the fuller revelation in the NT, such an attitude cannot be condoned. The Christian is to love as Christ loved (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>), to pray for his enemies and to forgive them (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.38-48">Mt 5:38-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.13">Col 3:13</a>). The theme of judgment continues into the NT and is indeed heightened there, since Christ’s coming has left people without excuse to live in sin (<a href="?bref=John.16.8-11">Jn 16:8-11</a>), but there can be no place for purely private vengeance.</p>
<p class="h3">Penitential Psalms</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">Psalms 32</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.38.1-22">38</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">51</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.130.1-8">130</a> are the clearest examples of penitential psalms, although traditionally the church has also included <a href="?bref=Ps.6.1-10">Psalms 6</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.102.1-28">102</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.143.1-12">143</a>, where there is no explicit confession of sin. In an age when adversity in its various forms was seen as God’s judgment for wrongdoing, the admission of distress was tantamount to a confession of guilt. In the four main examples there is an intensity of feeling and a deep sense of the enormity of sin in God’s sight, although, as elsewhere, there is no indication of specific sin, even in <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a>, which is surely to be connected with David’s sin against Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-12.31">2 Sm 11–12</a>). Significantly, David bypasses the sacrificial system, which was totally inefficacious in his case, casting himself entirely on the mercy of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.1,16">Ps 51:1, 16</a>). The burden of unconfessed sin is clearly revealed in <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">Psalm 32</a>, and sin’s searing and corrupting effect in <a href="?bref=Ps.38.1-22">Psalm 38</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">Wisdom Psalms and Historical Psalms</p>
<p class="fl">While it is accepted that prophets, priests, and wise men all functioned at the major sanctuaries, some overlap in their modes of expression is to be expected. Proverbial forms are not infrequently found in the psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.5,8,16,21-22">Pss 37:5, 8, 16, 21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.111.10">111:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.127.1-5">127:1-5</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-6">Psalm 1</a>, probably an introduction to the whole Psalter, contrasts the diverging paths of the righteous and ungodly (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1-10">Ps 112</a>), while <a href="?bref=Ps.127.1-5">Psalms 127</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.128.1-6">128</a> concentrate on the blessings given to the godly. <a href="?bref=Ps.133.1-3">Psalm 133</a> is written in praise of unity. The problem of explaining the sufferings of a righteous person and the apparent prosperity of evil people, dealt with in the Wisdom Literature in the book of Job and in the prophets also (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.12.1-4">Jer 12:1-4</a>), is taken up in <a href="?bref=Ps.37.1-40">Psalms 37</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.49.1-20">49</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.73.1-28">73</a>.</p>
<p>The historical psalms should be included in this category, since they underscore the lessons arising from the favored nation’s often bitter experience. It is apparent that Israel delighted in the recital of salvation history. The main psalms, and the periods covered are <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">Psalm 78</a>, from the exodus to the establishment of the Davidic monarchy (note the declared intention to teach in vv <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-4">1-4</a>); <a href="?bref=Ps.105.1-45">Psalm 105</a>, from Abraham to the conquest of Canaan; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1-48">Psalm 106</a>, from Egypt to the judges; and <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">Psalm 136</a>, from the Creation to the Promised Land.</p>
<p class="h3">Psalms of Trust</p>
<p class="fl">While some of these may also be classified as laments, the dominant feature of this group is the serene trust in God revealed, which makes them particularly suitable for devotional use. Many of these psalms begin with an affirmation of gratitude to and affection for God. <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1-6">Psalms 23</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.27.1-14">27</a> are the outstanding examples of this type, which could also include <a href="?bref=Ps.11.1-7">Psalms 11</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">16</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.62.1-12">62</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.116.1-19">116</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.131.1-3">131</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.138.1-8">138</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">The difficulties in any precise categorization of psalms are obvious; many do not neatly fall into one group—hence, the occasional overlap. What is clearly evident is a pulsating, vital devotional life that has found its clearest expression in the book of Psalms. To say that it expresses the worship and devotion of the ordinary person is a simplification; kings and priests, wise men and prophets all contributed to this remarkable collection. Yet there remains the truth that, in God’s sight, all people, regardless of human achievement or privilege, are “ordinary,” for all are sinners in need of God’s grace and goodness. So the worshiping community of ancient Israel, and the saints of every succeeding generation, in the vastness of their diversity, have found the expression of their own hearts’ condition, desires, and devotion in this unique treasury—the Psalms.</p>

  <title>Ptolemaic Empire*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PTOLEMAIC EMPIRE*</p>
<p class="fl">Empire named from Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian general of Alexander the Great who got himself appointed satrap, or governor, of Egypt shortly after Alexander died in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>. At its height during the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, the empire included Egypt, Cyrenaica (Cyrene), south Syria, Palestine, Cyprus, the south coast of Asia Minor, and some Aegean islands. Throughout the history of the empire, the Ptolemaic dynasty (all taking the name Ptolemy) occupied the imperial chair.</p>
<p>Ptolemy Soter was forced to engage in numerous struggles with governors of other parts of Alexander’s empire. Generally successful, he felt secure enough to assume the title of king in 305 <span class="era">BC</span>. The following year he fought on the side of Rhodes against Macedonia. For saving Rhodes’s independence, he won the title of Soter (savior). The ancients did not number kings of the same name, as it is now customary to do, but distinguished them by titles instead.</p>
<p>Ptolemy Soter managed to win control of Palestine on his fourth invasion of the area (301 <span class="era">BC</span>), and his successors were destined to hold it for over a century. On his abdication (285 <span class="era">BC</span>), he left a well-ordered kingdom in which the Greek population was loyal to the administration and the native population had been wooed by efforts of conciliation. Alexandria had become his great capital. There he founded a famous library and museum and patronized the arts.</p>
<p>Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 <span class="era">BC</span>) maintained a splendid court in Alexandria, which is often compared to that of Versailles under Louis XIV for its pageantry and its vices. He patronized the arts and scientific research and added to the library in the capital. Ptolemy II was also a formidable power in the ancient world, and he came to exercise naval control over the Mediterranean and the Aegean. His commercial efforts were extensive and included the shores of the Red Sea after he dug a canal linking the Nile and the Red Sea.</p>
<p>Ptolemy III Euergetes (246–221 <span class="era">BC</span>) continued to maintain the empire’s naval power but allowed the army to decline after successful ventures against the Seleucids in Mesopotamia early in his reign. In fact, under Ptolemy III the empire may be regarded as having reached its height. He was also a liberal patron of the arts and built numerous public buildings and temples.</p>
<p>Ptolemy IV Philopator (221–203? <span class="era">BC</span>) was a wretched and debauched person under whom the Ptolemaic Empire began its decline. During his rule, conflict with the Seleucids continued, but the Egyptians won a great victory over Antiochus III of Syria in 217 <span class="era">BC</span>. This Egyptian triumph was accomplished in part because the Greek administration armed native Egyptians. This fact gave rise to a series of native rebellions during the next 30 years.</p>
<p>Ptolemy V Epiphanes (203?–181 <span class="era">BC</span>) was only about five when he came to the throne. Antiochus III of Syria and Philip V of Macedon decided to take advantage of the weakness of Egypt at that time and divide the Ptolemaic Empire between them. In the process Syria took control of Palestine after a century of Ptolemaic rule. In this difficult period Egypt became quite closely linked with Rome, which intervened on Ptolemy’s behalf.</p>
<p>Ptolemy VI Philometor (181–145 <span class="era">BC</span>) likewise came to the throne as a minor and the country was further weakened under another regency. His regents launched a war against Syria to regain Palestine but were unsuccessful. When Syria invaded in 170 <span class="era">BC</span> and captured him, Rome intervened and restored him to his throne. Rome again intervened and restored Ptolemy VI to his throne when Ptolemy VII sought to unseat him in 163 <span class="era">BC</span>. As a kindly and reasonable man, Ptolemy Philometor is sometimes considered to be the best of the Ptolemies.</p>
<p>His successor, Ptolemy VII Physcon (145–116 <span class="era">BC</span>), is represented as just the opposite—as a cruel man untouched by natural affections and afflicted with a loathsome corpulence. After his death, the royal household was plunged into domestic strife for several years, and the dynasty was never again destined to be very stable. During the first century <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome increasingly intervened in Egyptian affairs on behalf of one or the other of the Ptolemies. After several weak reigns, Rome more effectively entered Egyptian affairs during the days of Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra VII, annexing Egypt after the suicide of Cleopatra in 30 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

  <title>Punishment</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="fl">The intentional infliction of pain or loss (e.g., loss of liberty or money) by an authorized individual on another because of an offense committed. There can be no punishment without authority, and none without a guilty party.</p>
<p>Some argue that punishment is justifiable if it will deter the offender (and other potential offenders) from committing offenses in the future, or if it will act as an instrument of reform. This means that punishment will influence the offender so that he will not want to commit other offenses. If punishment does not either reform or deter him, they contend, there is no justification for it.</p>
<p>There are others who argue that the guilty—simply because they are guilty and for no other reason—ought to be punished. Appeal is made either to the moral law of God or to some abstract principle of justice. This view, called the retributive view, is not to be confused with mere bloodthirstiness or the desire for revenge, which can often be selfish and unwarranted.</p>
<p>Both general views, the deterrent/reformative and the retributive, have the problem of what degree of punishment is to be inflicted in particular cases. Clearly, people could be deterred from committing fairly trivial offenses by severe punishments or the threat of them. In the case of retribution, only in comparatively rare cases could the punishment exactly match the offense.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the death of Christ cannot be understood except in retributive terms. His atonement was a vicarious, penal offering to his Father to satisfy divine justice as the representative of those for whom he died. Christ’s death removes the sinner’s guilt by satisfying divine justice (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.8">Rom 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>).</p>
<p>Given the retributive character of Christ’s death, a Christian cannot consistently maintain that retribution should play no part in punishment. But the question can still be raised concerning the extent to which a system of punishment should today be retributive. In favor of the view that it should be retributive, the following arguments have been offered: (1) There are explicit scriptural injunctions regarding capital punishment (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.5-6">Gn 9:5-6</a>), and such a divine command is not among those moral and ceremonial commands that are done away with in Christ. Coupled with this is the approving NT description of the powers that be as the bearer of the sword, God’s minister of vengeance (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.1-5">Rom 13:1-5</a>). (2) Besides such explicitly scriptural arguments, further support can be found from an appeal to principles of justice, and in particular to the important consideration that retribution can be a barrier against arbitrary and tyrannical government in that it sets clear and definite bounds to the power of the state in the punishment of offenders. For example, it cannot hold an individual indefinitely for “treatment” or order ferocious reprisals. Such a view of punishment emphasizes individual responsibility and the presumption of individual freedom until an offense has been committed, and hence it emphasizes predictability in human relations. The argument that capital punishment is only compounding the original offense would apply to all punishments.</p>
<p>Against these arguments for retribution are those that appeal to utilitarian considerations according to which it is argued that punishment ought only to be inflicted if a greater good is likely to be achieved by punishing than by not punishing. Further, there is the argument that since humanity is a brotherhood, no one person or group can have the right to punish another. The first of these arguments would appear to allow punishment without limit (provided that a greater good would probably result), while the second seems to be incompatible with government of any kind for fallible and sinful people.</p>
<p>One final matter concerns the kind of punishment to be permitted in a penal system. In earlier centuries many offenders were hung, drawn and quartered, broken on the wheel, or had limbs or ears or tongues cut off as a punishment for often trivial offenses. Most today would regard such punishments as barbaric and inherently degrading to the individual. There is clearly an element of relativity here. It is perhaps arguable, for instance, that corporal punishment of certain kinds is less degrading than the modern alternative of confinement with other criminals in filthy conditions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Scripture teaches that the general judgment of all people, which follows death, will be final and retributive, guided by God’s unerring wisdom, justice, and mercy.</p>

<p class="fl">Town identified with the modern Feinan, lying on the eastern side of the Arabah in the hill country of Edom. Punon lay conveniently on the road from Edom through the Negev to Egypt. It enjoyed an abundant supply of water and the presence of copper. Punon became an ancient smelting center of copper (c. 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>), which was mined in the vicinity or was imported to Punon. When the Israelites passed by Punon on their way into Transjordan (<a href="?bref=Num.33.42-43">Nm 33:42-43</a>), Punon was at a low point in her industrial history. Remains of slag heaps abound in the vicinity. Archaeological evidence indicates that Punon was an extensive settlement at the time of the patriarchs (middle Bronze Age) and that after a period of 500 years of no settled occupation it was resettled around 1300 <span class="era">BC</span>. The mining and smelting operations lasted until 700 <span class="era">BC</span> and were then renewed in the age of the Nabateans. Eusebius reports that Christians worked in the mines along with criminals at Punon. In the Byzantine period the Christians built a basilica and monastery here. An inscription bearing the name of Bishop Theodore (c. 587 <span class="era">BC</span>) was found in the monastery.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">PURSE</p>
<p class="fl">A small bag or receptacle in which money and often other small objects would be carried. There are basically three Hebrew words and three Greek words referring to such a purse or pouch. The first refers to a purse or bag in which money or stone weights used with the balance scales were carried (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.13">Dt 25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.1.14">Prv 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.6">Is 46:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.11">Mi 6:11</a>). It could be made of leather or stout cotton. Another Hebrew word referring to much the same kind of pouch is found in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.23">2 Kings 5:23</a>. This same word also appears in a list of ladies’ finery in <a href="?bref=Isa.3.22">Isaiah 3:22</a> and may therefore have been a more ornamentally woven pouch than the first described above. The third Hebrew word appears in <a href="?bref=Gen.42.35">Genesis 42:35</a> and refers to a little bag with an open mouth. This was the small bag or purse in which Joseph’s brothers’ money had been placed before it was put into their sacks of grain.</p>
<p>The corresponding Greek word for the Hebrew words discussed above means a money bag or purse. When Jesus sent out his disciples two by two, he prohibited them from taking, among other things, a purse (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.4">Lk 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.35-36">22:35-36</a>). In <a href="?bref=Luke.12.33">Luke 12:33</a> this same word for purse is used figuratively for treasure in heaven that cannot be exhausted, stolen, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Another Greek word indicates another normal place for the carrying of money, the girdle or the belt, which was an essential part of dress for both men and women in the ancient East. When made of leather, they were made hollow or with slots for the purpose of carrying coins. When made of cloth, they were folded in such a manner that money could be carried in the folds, which served as pockets (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.9">Mt 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.8">Mk 6:8</a>).</p>
<p>The Greek word for the “money bag” that Judas is said to have kept for the disciples refers to a case or container for the mouthpiece of a wind instrument. By NT times it had become the Greek word for a money box or possibly a money bag (<a href="?bref=John.12.6">Jn 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.29">13:29</a>), and hence another NT word for purse.</p>

<p class="h1">PUT (<span class="lc">Place</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient nation, descended from a man of the same name. It is commonly identified as Libya, although it has been argued that it was the Punt of Egyptian records, somewhere along the northeast coast of Africa, perhaps Somalia. Its association with Egypt, Cush, and Canaan, and the usage of the name in the OT, make the Libyan location probable. In the OT the Libyan people are called Lubim, a name that always appears in the plural.</p>
<p>Ancient Libya was situated to the west of Egypt, the site of modern Libya, on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. The Egyptians distinguished among several groups of Libyans. The Tjehenu, who inhabited the coastal region, were primarily herdsmen. They were represented in Egyptian art as having long hair and wearing only a belt and a penis sheath. They were listed among the Nine Bows—the nine traditional enemies of Egypt. The Tjemehu were nomads and were physically different from other African ethnic groups in that they had blond hair and blue eyes. Their relationships with Egypt date back to the Old Kingdom, and from time to time they tried to make their way into Egypt. The Libu (after whom the country was named) and the Meshwesh (western Libyans) are described as fair-skinned, tattooed, and with long leather garments.</p>
<p>The Egyptians had commercial and military contacts with Libya throughout its history. The Libyans periodically attempted to penetrate Egypt from the northwest. From the Middle Kingdom there is the story of Sinuhe (c. 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>), which begins with the death of Amenemhet I while his son, Senusert (Sesostris), was fighting the Libyans in the western Delta. Later, Libyans did infiltrate the Delta, but Seti I and Ramses II kept them under control. The Stele of Merneptah (c. 1224–c. 1214 <span class="era">BC</span>), which mentions Israel, is largely devoted to Egypt’s victory over the Libyans. Ramses III drove them out of the western Delta in connection with his victorious land and sea struggles with the Sea Peoples.</p>
<p>Eventually, Libyans gained control of Egypt and made up the 22d (Bubastite) dynasty (c. 946–c. 720 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the 23d (Tanitic) dynasty (c. 792–c. 720 <span class="era">BC</span>). Their kings bore foreign names like Sheshonk (the Shishak of the OT, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.40">1 Kgs 11:40</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">14:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.2-9">2 Chr 12:2-9</a>), Osorkon, and Takelot.</p>
<p>The first occurrence of Put in the Bible is in the table of nations (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Gn 10</a>), where Put is listed as a son of Ham, along with Cush (Nubia, Ethiopia), Egypt, and Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.6">Gn 10:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.8">1 Chr 1:8</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-28">Jeremiah 46</a> speaks of the battle of Carchemish and refers to the warriors of Ethiopia (Cush) and Put, “who handle the shield,” among the hosts of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.9">Jer 46:9</a>). Ezekiel names Persia, Lud, and Put as being in the army of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.10">Ez 27:10</a>). Nahum mentioned “Put and the Libyans” among the allies of Thebes who were unable to stop the onslaught of the Assyrians against Egypt (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.9">Na 3:9</a>). Daniel predicts that the Antichrist will have the Libyans, Egypt, Cush, and others in submission (<a href="?bref=Dan.11.43">Dn 11:43</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Isa.66.19">Isaiah 66:19</a> the Hebrew text reads “Pul,” while the Greek version gives “Put,” which most of the English translations follow. (<span class="sc">nlt</span> reads “Libyans,” with footnote to Hebrew and Greek readings.) Here, Put is listed between Tarshish and Lud in a list of nations that will be told of the glory of God. In <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.5">Ezekiel 30:5</a> the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">Put</span> is thought to be a country equivalent to Libya. However, other scholars consider <span class="hebrew">Cub</span> also to be Libya in this same verse (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In the records of King Xerxes of Persia (485–465 <span class="era">BC</span>), Libya is listed among the nations subject to Xerxes.</p>
