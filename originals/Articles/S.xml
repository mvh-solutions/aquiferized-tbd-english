<p class="h1">SABBATH</p>
<p class="fl">Derivation of a Hebrew word that means “cease” or “desist.” The Sabbath was a day (from Friday evening until Saturday evening in Jesus’ time) when all ordinary work stopped. The Scriptures relate that God gave his people the Sabbath as an opportunity to serve him and as a reminder of two great truths in the Bible—Creation and redemption.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The relationship between Creation and the Sabbath is first expressed in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.2-3">Genesis 2:2-3</a>. God “ceased” his work in Creation after six days and then “blessed” the seventh day and “declared it holy.” In the fourth commandment (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>), God’s “blessing” and “setting aside” of the seventh day after Creation (the words used are the same as those in Genesis) form the basis of his demand that people should observe the seventh day as a day of Sabbath rest.</p>
<p>The idea of God resting from his work is a startling one. It comes across even more vividly in <a href="?bref=Exod.31.17">Exodus 31:17</a>, where the Lord tells Moses how he was refreshed by his day of rest. This picture of the Creator as a manual laborer is one the Bible often paints. No doubt it is presented in vividly human terms in Exodus to reinforce the fundamental Sabbath lesson that people must follow the pattern their Creator has set for them. One day’s rest in seven is a necessity for individuals, families, households, and even animals (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.10">Ex 20:10</a>).</p>
<p>The Sabbath’s setting in the biblical account of Creation implies that it is one of those OT standards that are meant for all people and not just for Israel. The inclusion of the Sabbath law in the Ten Commandments underlines this important truth. The Decalogue occupied a special place in OT law. Alone of all God’s instructions, it was spoken by his audible voice (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1">Ex 20:1</a>), written by his finger (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.18">31:18</a>), and placed in the tabernacle ark at the heart of Israel’s worship (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.16">25:16</a>). The NT, too, confirms the strong impression that the Decalogue as a whole embodies principles that are permanently valid for all people in all places at all times. Whether or not Sunday is recognized as the Christian Sabbath, one is obliged to accept the central principle of this biblical teaching as far as the Sabbath is concerned. God’s instructions require people to observe a regular weekly break from work.</p>
<p>Significantly, the second main strand of the Bible’s Sabbath teaching—that of redemption—also features in a list of the Ten Commandments. The Sabbath law (already noted in <a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>) reappears in <a href="?bref=Deut.5.12-15">Deuteronomy 5:12-15</a>, but here a different reason is attached to its observance: “Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt and that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God brought you out with amazing power and mighty deeds. That is why the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day” (v <a href="?bref=Deut.5.15">15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The differences between these two accounts of the fourth commandment are important. The first (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-26">Ex 20</a>) is addressed, <span class="ital">through</span> Israel, to all people as created beings. The second (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.1-33">Dt 5</a>) is directed <span class="ital">to</span> Israel as God’s redeemed people. So the Sabbath is God’s signpost, pointing not only to his goodness toward all people as their Creator but also to his mercy toward his chosen people as their Redeemer.</p>
<p>There is one other significant point in Deuteronomy’s version of the Sabbath commandment that must not be missed. The prohibition of all work on the Sabbath day is followed by an explanatory note—“On that day no one in your household may do any kind of work. This includes you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen and donkeys and other livestock, and any foreigners living among you. All your male and female servants must rest as you do” (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.14">Dt 5:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Practical concern for others is a feature of all the OT’s covenant teaching. So God’s loving concern for Israel in her Egyptian slavery must be matched by the Israelite family’s loving concern for those who served them. The Sabbath offered an ideal outlet for the practical expression of that concern. Jesus was especially keen to rescue this humanitarian side of Sabbath observance from the mass of callous regulations that threatened to suffocate it in his day (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.3.1-5">Mk 3:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>The OT’s provision for a “sabbatical year” develops this humanitarian theme further (see <a href="?bref=Exod.23.10-12">Ex 23:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-7">Lv 25:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.1-11">Dt 15:1-11</a>; also the regulations for the “year of jubilee” in <a href="?bref=Lev.25.8-55">Lv 25:8-55</a>). Every seventh year the land was to lie fallow and be uncultivated (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.4">Lv 25:4</a>). It needed a regular rest just as much as the people it sustained. The primary purpose of this law was benevolent: “But you, your male and female slaves, your hired servants, and any foreigners who live with you may eat the produce that grows naturally during the Sabbath year. And your livestock and the wild animals will also be allowed to eat of the land’s bounty” (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.25.6-7">6-7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). <a href="?bref=Deut.15.1-11">Deuteronomy 15:1-11</a> extends the same humanitarian principle into the world of commerce. The sabbatical year must see the canceling of all debts within God’s redeemed community. For the tight-fisted who might be tempted to refuse a loan if the sabbatical year was imminent, the law added a warning and a promise: “Do not be mean-spirited and refuse someone a loan because the year of release is close at hand. If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, you will be considered guilty of sin. Give freely without begrudging it, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will bless you in everything you do” (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.9-10">Dt 15:9-10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Observing the sabbatical year was obviously a great test of the people’s obedience to God and of their willingness to depend on him for their livelihood. Sometimes the temptation to turn a blind eye was too strong. But history testifies to Israel’s courage in observing the letter of this law on many occasions, despite threats of invasion and famine. Both Alexander the Great and the Romans excused Jews from paying taxes every seventh year in recognition of the depth of their religious convictions.</p>
<p>Returning from the seventh year to the seventh day, the OT law codes go to considerable lengths to buttress the Sabbath ban on work by defining what may and may not be done by God’s people on the Sabbath day. The prohibitions were not meant to rule out activity of any kind. Their aim was to stop regular, everyday work, because if God had set aside the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.11">Ex 20:11</a>), the most obvious way of profaning it was to treat it just like any other day. Rules were spelled out in specific terms that the farmer (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.21">34:21</a>), the salesman (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.27">Jer 17:27</a>), and even the housewife (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.2-3">Ex 35:2-3</a>) would understand.</p>
<p>The details may seem trivial, but obedience to the Sabbath law was seen as the main test of the people’s allegiance to the Lord. It was made quite clear that willful disobedience was a capital offense (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.2">Ex 35:2</a>), and the fate of the person found gathering wood in defiance of Sabbath regulations showed that this was no idle threat (<a href="?bref=Num.15.32-36">Nm 15:32-36</a>).</p>
<p>Hemmed in by so many rules and regulations (and with the death penalty overhanging all), the Sabbath easily could have become a day of fear—a day when the people were more afraid of committing an offense than worshiping the Lord and enjoying a weekly rest. But the Sabbath was intended to be a blessing, not a burden. Above everything else, it was a weekly sign that the Lord loved his people and wanted to draw them into an ever-closer relationship with himself. Those who valued that relationship enjoyed the Sabbath, calling it a delight (<a href="?bref=Isa.58.13-14">Is 58:13-14</a>). Nowhere does the OT express its sheer joy in Sabbath worship more exuberantly than in <a href="?bref=Ps.92.1-15">Psalm 92</a>, which has the title “A Song for the Sabbath.”</p>
<p>The later prophets, were, however, far from blind to the darker side of human nature. They knew that a great deal of Sabbath observance was a sham. Many people treated the Sabbath day more as holiday than holy day, an opportunity for self-indulgence rather than delighting in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.58.13">Is 58:13</a>). Some greedy tradesmen found its restrictions an annoying irritant (<a href="?bref=Amos.8.5">Am 8:5</a>).</p>
<p>As God’s spokesman, the prophets did not shrink from exposing such neglect and abuse (<a href="?bref=Ezek.22.26">Ez 22:26</a>). Those who go through the motions of Sabbath worship with unrepentant hearts nauseate the Lord, Isaiah said (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.10-15">Is 1:10-15</a>). As a symptom of rebellion against God, Jerusalem’s Sabbath breaking will bring destruction on the city, thunders Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.27">Jer 17:27</a>). The Lord has been very forbearing with his people, warned Ezekiel, but prolonged neglect of his Sabbath makes judgment a certainty (<a href="?bref=Ezek.20.12-24">Ez 20:12-24</a>).</p>
<p>When the ax of judgment fell (in the exile to Babylon, 586 <span class="era">BC</span>), the surviving remnant of the nation took the lesson to heart. Sabbath keeping was one of the few distinctive marks faithful Jews could retain in a foreign land, so it assumed extra significance. At the prompting of prophets like Ezekiel, who set out rules for Sabbath worship in the rebuilt temple at Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezek.44.24">Ez 44:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.17">45:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.46.3">46:3</a>), and under the leadership of men like Nehemiah, the returning exiles were more careful than their predecessors in observing the Sabbath day (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.31">Neh 10:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-22">13:15-22</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Prior to the first century, some Jews in Palestine developed several rules for promoting the observance of the Sabbath. Two tractates of the Mishnah are devoted exclusively to these Sabbath rules and regulations. Their main purpose is to define work (one tractate does so under 39 headings) in an attempt to show every Israelite what is and is not permitted on the Sabbath. Unfortunately, this led to such hairsplitting complexities and evasions that ecclesiastical lawyers often differed among themselves in their interpretations, with the inevitable result that the main purpose of the Sabbath became lost beneath a mass of legalistic detail. The rabbis themselves were aware of how much they were adding to the straightforward teaching of the OT. As one of them put it, “The rules about the sabbath . . . are as mountains hanging by a hair, for Scripture is scanty and the rules many.”</p>
<p>Jesus had many confrontations with the Jewish religious leaders over Sabbath observances. From their perspective, Jesus was a Sabbath breaker and therefore a lawbreaker. Jesus, however, never saw himself as a Sabbath breaker. He went to synagogue regularly on the Sabbath day (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16">Lk 4:16</a>). He read the lesson, preached, and taught (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.21">Mk 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.10">Lk 13:10</a>). He clearly accepted the principle that the Sabbath was an appropriate day for worship.</p>
<p>His point of collision with the Pharisees was the point at which their tradition departed from biblical teaching. He made this clear when he defended his disciples by appealing to Scripture, after they had been accused of breaking Sabbath tradition by walking through grainfields and breaking off heads of wheat (which fell into the category of “harvesting,” according to the Pharisees; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.23-26">Mk 2:23-26</a>). He followed this up with a remark that took his hearers straight back to God’s Creation purpose for the Sabbath: “The Sabbath was made to benefit people, and not people to benefit the Sabbath” (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.27">Mk 2:27</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Rabbinic tradition had exalted the institution above the people it was meant to serve. By making it an end in itself, the Pharisees had effectively robbed the Sabbath of one of its main purposes. Jesus’ words must have sounded uncomfortably familiar in his opponents’ ears. A famous rabbi had once said, “The Sabbath is given over to you, but you are not given over to the Sabbath.”</p>
<p>More than anything else, Jesus’ Sabbath healings put him on a collision course with rabbinic restrictions. The OT does not forbid cures on the Sabbath day, but the rabbis labeled all healing as work, which must always be avoided on the Sabbath unless life was at risk. Jesus fearlessly exposed the callousness and absurd inconsistencies to which this attitude led. How, he asked, could it be right to circumcise a baby or lead an animal to water on the Sabbath day (which tradition allowed) but wrong to heal a chronically handicapped woman and a crippled man, even if their lives were not in immediate danger (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.10-17">Lk 13:10-17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.21-24">Jn 7:21-24</a>)? The Sabbath, he taught, was a particularly appropriate day for acts of mercy (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.4-5">Mk 3:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus, the man from heaven, claimed that he was Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.28">Mk 2:28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.12.5-8">Mt 12:5-8</a>). Just as God kept working, despite his Creation rest, to sustain the world in his mercy, so Jesus would continue to teach and to heal on the Sabbath day (<a href="?bref=John.5.2-17">Jn 5:2-17</a>). But one day his redemptive work would be complete, and then the Sabbath’s purpose as a sign of redemption would be accomplished.</p>
<p>Living on the other side of Jesus’ death and resurrection, Paul was quick to grasp the significance of both for Sabbath observance. He did not go so far as to ban all observance of the Jewish Sabbath. Indeed, he attended many Sabbath synagogue services himself in his evangelistic travels (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.13.14-16">Acts 13:14-16</a>). Jewish Christians who insisted on keeping up their Sabbath practices were free to do so, provided they respected the opinions of those who differed (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.5-6,13">Rom 14:5-6, 13</a>). But any suggestion that observing the Jewish calendar was necessary for salvation must be resisted (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.8-11">Gal 4:8-11</a>). For Paul considered the Sabbath to be a shadow, while Christ himself is the reality of that shadow (<a href="?bref=Col.2.17">Col 2:17</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, it is the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews who explains how the twin biblical “sabbath themes” of creation and redemption find their joint fulfillment in Christ. He did so by linking together the ideas of God’s rest after Creation and his redemptive act in bringing Israel to her “rest” in Canaan, and by showing how both relate to the present and future rest that Christians can and do enjoy in Jesus (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.1-11">Heb 4:1-11</a>).</p>
<p>God intends all his people to share his rest—that is, his promise (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.1">Heb 4:1</a>). He showed this intention clearly when he brought Israel to the Promised Land, but that did not mark the complete fulfillment of his promise. The full, complete rest still waiting for the people of God is in heaven. Christ has already entered there. He is resting from his work, just as God did after the Creation. And because of his redeeming work, he invites all those who believe in him to share that same “sabbath rest” now (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.9">9</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Regulation derived from Jewish literature limiting travel on the Sabbath. The prohibition against work on the Sabbath was interpreted to exclude extensive travel (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.27-30">Ex 16:27-30</a>). A person was permitted to travel 2,000 cubits (about a half mile, or 900 meters; see <a href="?bref=Josh.3.4">Jos 3:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg) but no further. This was determined by the distance between the ark and the people following it (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.4">Jos 3:4</a>) or from the pasturelands to the Levitical cities (<a href="?bref=Num.35.4-5">Nm 35:4-5</a>). Thus, in the former instance, one would not go further to worship or in the latter to pasture an animal. The only biblical reference describes the distance from the Mt of Olives to Jerusalem (which, according to Josephus, was 1,000 to 1,200 yards, or 914.4 to 1,097.3 meters) as “a Sabbath day’s walk” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.12">Acts 1:12</a>).</p>
<p>The rabbis invented ways to at least double the distance. One could establish his home 2,000 cubits away by carrying food sufficient for two meals: one to be eaten and the other to be buried—thereby to mark a temporary domicile. He might alternatively fix his gaze upon a location 2,000 cubits away as his legal home for the Sabbath. He could, separately or in conjunction with a preceding modification, view the entire town as his home and so figure the Sabbath day’s journey from the village limits.</p>

<p class="h1">SACKCLOTH</p>
<p class="fl">Poor quality material or a garment of goat hair usually worn as a symbol of mourning, but also worn by some prophets and captives.</p>
<p>Sackcloth was coarse and probably dark in color (<a href="?bref=Isa.50.3">Is 50:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.12">Rv 6:12</a>). The shape of the garment is disputed. Two views are prominent. One view is that the garment was rectangular, sewn on both sides and one end with spaces left for the head and arms. This shape resembles the grain sacks used by Joseph’s brothers in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.25-27,35">Gn 42:25-27, 35</a>) and the sacks used by the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.4">Jos 9:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.11.32">Lv 11:32</a>). A second view is that sackcloth was a small garment resembling a loincloth. Asiatic captives are pictured in such garb. The Hebrew practices of girding the loins with sackcloth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.31">2 Sm 3:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.15.3">Is 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.22.12">22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.8">Jer 4:8</a>) and the placing of sackcloth on the loins (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.34">Gn 37:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.31">1 Kgs 20:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.37">Jer 48:37</a>) support this view, though more than one type of garment could have been made from sackcloth. Sackcloth was associated primarily with mourning (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.34">Gn 37:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.27">1 Kgs 21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.2.10">Lam 2:10</a>).

Kings (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.27">1 Kgs 21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.30">2 Kgs 6:30</a>), priests (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.13">Jl 1:13</a>), elders (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.10">Lam 2:10</a>), prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.2">Is 20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.4">Zec 13:4</a>), and cattle (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.8">Jon 3:8</a>) all wore sackcloth. Sackcloth was found on the penitent (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.1">Neh 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.26">Jer 6:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.11.21">Mt 11:21</a>) though such usage was not restricted to Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.3">Is 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.3">Jer 49:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.31">Ez 27:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.5">Jon 3:5</a>). It has been suggested that the coarse fabric produced physical discomfort and was used to inflict self-punishment on the wearer. There is no evidence, however, to support this position.</p>

<p class="h1">SADDUCEES</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish sect cited 14 times in the NT, not referred to in the OT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheirHistory">Their History</p>
<p class="fl">A number of suggestions have been made as to the origin of the name. First, it has been connected with the Hebrew word for “righteous” (<span class="hebrew">saddik</span>). This is difficult from an etymological point of view, as there would have been a change from <span class="ital">i</span> to <span class="ital">u</span> in the word. Nor is there reason to think that they made such a claim to be the “righteous ones.” Second, the name has been connected with Zadok (sometimes written <span class="greek">Saddouk</span> in Greek), a priest in the days of David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sm 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.24-29">15:24-29</a>) who anointed Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.32-39">1 Kgs 1:32-39</a>) and in his reign became chief priest (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.35">2:35</a>). He is said to have descended from Eleazar, the son of Aaron (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3-8">1 Chr 6:3-8</a>), and Zadokite priests seem to have been responsible for priestly duties in the temple until the exile. In the blueprints for the restoration of the worship of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ez 40–48</a>), it is the Zadokite priesthood that is again given charge to minister as “Levitical priests” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.44.15-16">44:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.11-12">48:11-12</a>). After the exile, we read of Joshua (Jeshua) the son of Jehozadak as high priest (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>), and his lineage was traced back to Zadok (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.8-15">1 Chr 6:8-15</a>). The significance of the Zadokite priesthood continues to be stressed in writings of the early second century <span class="era">BC</span>, but it is by no means clear that the Sadducees made a stand for the Zadokite priesthood. It may be added that the double <span class="ital">d</span> in the word is not readily explained by this view of Sadducean origins.</p>
<p>Third, a late rabbinic tradition is that the Sadducees took their name from another Zadok who lived in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>. There is little to commend this view.</p>
<p>Finally, the British NT scholar T. W. Manson suggested that their name is to be connected with the Greek word <span class="greek">sundikoi</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “members of the council,” thus designating the Sadducees as councillors under the Hasmonean rulers.</p>
<p>The first historical knowledge of the Sadducees is in the time of Jonathan Maccabeus, who led the Jewish struggle against the Seleucids from 160 to 143 <span class="era">BC</span>. Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.5.9) said that they were a party at this time, and that when John Hyrcanus was head of the Jewish state (135–104 <span class="era">BC</span>) there was strife between the Pharisees and the Sadducees (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.10.6). It is possible that the Sadducees stood in some sense for the Zadokite priesthood or for the claim that the Jerusalem priesthood of their day was Zadokite in origin, but this is far from clear. Josephus says that the Sadducees had the rich on their side, while the Pharisees had a following among the common people. In the days of Salome Alexandra (76–67 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Pharisees were in the ascendancy, but when Judea became a Roman province and Roman governors began to put one high priest down and raise another up, it appears that most of the high priests were from high-born Sadducean families. While they could temporize with the Romans, these Sadducean families had power and influence in the land. As hostilities developed between the Jews and their Roman overlords, the influence of the Sadducees declined. After the fall of Jerusalem to the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the Sadducees fade from history.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the Gospel narrative they first appeared, together with Pharisees, at John’s baptism. He addressed them as “sons of snakes” and challenged them to show repentance in their lives (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.7-10">Mt 3:7-10</a>). Later, the Sadducees came along with some Pharisees to “test” Jesus, asking him to show them a sign from heaven (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.1">16:1</a>). Jesus told his disciples to beware of the Sadducees (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.16.6,11-12">6, 11-12</a>).</p>
<p>A great difference begins to emerge between Pharisees and Sadducees in <a href="?bref=Matt.22.23-33">Matthew 22:23-33</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.12.18-27">Mk 12:18-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.27-38">Lk 20:27-38</a>). The Sadducees, who, like others, wanted to embarrass Jesus with their questions, came with a trick question that showed their doubts concerning the resurrection of the dead. The Sadducees were described in this context as those who say there is no resurrection after death. They cited the case of a woman who had seven brothers as her husbands in succession. “Whose wife will she be in the resurrection?” they asked, implying that because of such a problem, the resurrection could not be a reality. Jesus answered by speaking of the error of their view caused by their ignorance of the Scriptures and of God’s power.</p>
<p>In the early days of the church in Jerusalem, the priests and the captain of the temple police and the Sadducees became annoyed because the disciples were proclaiming the resurrection from the dead (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-2">Acts 4:1-2</a>). The Sadducees seem to have led the opposition to the apostles and their preaching. Later the high priest and Sadducees determined to arrest the apostles and put them in the prison (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.17">5:17</a>). The only other reference to them in the NT is in <a href="?bref=Acts.23.6-8">Acts 23:6-8</a>, in the record of Paul’s trial before the Jewish Sanhedrin. On that occasion, Paul deliberately spoke about his belief in the resurrection so as to cause a division between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, who did not believe in resurrection.</p>
<p>Thus from these NT passages one realizes something of the basic tenets of the Sadducees, of their prominence among the high priestly families, and of the differences between Pharisees and Sadducees.</p>
<p>Josephus, the Jewish historian who wrote in the closing years of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, adds to the information in the NT about this party. He said that the Sadducees, in contrast to the Pharisees and Essenes, gave no place to the overruling providence of God but emphasized that all that happens to us is the result of the good or evil that we do (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.5.9; <span class="ital">War</span> 2.8.14). Josephus, in a way comparable to the NT, spoke of the Sadducees’ rejection of “the immortal duration of the soul, and the punishments and rewards in Hades” (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.8.14). “Souls die with the bodies” was what they said (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.4). Early Christian writers—Hippolytus, Origen, and Jerome—said that the Sadducees accepted only the Pentateuch and not the other OT books. It would seem, however, that they were not opposed to other OT books as a whole (though it is doubtful whether they accepted books such as Daniel, with its clear statement of the resurrection of the dead), but rather that they opposed the legal regulations introduced by the Pharisees and were saying that only the OT law should be considered mandatory. In this, as in their stand against belief in angels and in life after death, they appear to have regarded the Pharisees as innovators and themselves as conservatives.</p>
<p>The other main source of knowledge about the Sadducees is the Mishnah, the collection of the teaching of the rabbis, put down in writing in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. The Sadducees opposed many of the detailed regulations that the Pharisees sought to impose on the people (<span class="ital">Parah</span> 3.3,7). It also indicates that they had a greater tendency to compromise with the ways of the Gentiles than other Jewish parties (<span class="ital">Niddah</span> 4.2).</p>

In the NT, “saints” became the apostle Paul’s favorite name for Christians (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.7">Rom 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.27">8:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.13">12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.25-26,31">15:25-26, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.2,15">16:2, 15</a>; plus 31 other places in Paul’s letters). The name is also used 14 times in the book of Revelation. Other NT writers used it occasionally (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.10">Heb 6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.24">13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.3">Jude 1:3</a>). The name indicates that Christians are expected to be holy (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.10">Heb 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.11">Rv 22:11</a>) because they have been consecrated to God as a holy priesthood and have rejected the ways of the world (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.15-16">1 Pt 1:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5,9">2:5, 9</a>). More than that, they are the people of the coming age, who will reign with God over the earth and over angels.</p>

Tradition states that the city was 1,000 years old when the missionaries arrived, having been founded by Teucer after his return from the Trojan war.</p>
<p>For centuries, it was a major seaport, shipping copper, timber, ceramics, and agricultural products to Europe, Africa, and Asia. The Ptolemies encouraged Jews to settle there, which is why Barnabas and Saul found Jewish synagogues there.

<p class="list-space">1. Woman who followed Jesus and was perhaps Mary’s sister and the mother of James and John. In <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mark 15:40</a>, the evangelist describes the women who stood at the foot of the cross, and names three of them: Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the lesser and of Joses, and Salome. Similarly, when describing the women who arrived at the tomb at dawn, Mark recounts that Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome had brought spices to anoint the body (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mk 16:1</a>). Matthew speaks of two women named Mary, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who could have been Salome (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">Mt 27:56</a>). John speaks of four women: (1) Mary the mother of Jesus; (2) Mary the wife of Clopas; (3) Mary Magdalene; and (4) Mary’s sister—unnamed (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>).

<p class="fl">Valley in the southern vicinity of the Dead Sea. The Valley of Salt was the scene of two major military campaigns recorded in the OT. Initially, it was where David made a name for himself by routing the Edomite army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.13">2 Sm 8:13</a>). Abishai, one of David’s mighty men, was credited with killing 18,000 Edomites there (<a href="?bref=1Chr.18.12">1 Chr 18:12</a>). Later, King Amaziah of Judah defeated the Edomite army in this valley and captured Sela, an Edomite stronghold in the nearby hill country (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.7">2 Kgs 14:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.11">2 Chr 25:11</a>).</p>
<p>The location of the Valley of Salt is not altogether certain. Some identify it with Wadi el-Milh (meaning “salt”) east of Beersheba in Judah. A more probable suggestion is with es-Sebkha, a lifeless saline plain south of the Dead Sea positioned in the Arabah, leading to the hill country of Edom.</p>

  <title>Salvation</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SALVATION</p>
<p class="fl">God’s way of providing people deliverance from sin and death. Scripture reveals God but it also reveals his plan to save the human race. In that sense, salvation is a major theme in both the OT and NT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The concept of salvation is represented by various terms and situations in both Testaments. Among several Hebrew words that mean “deliver” or “save,” the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">yasha‘</span> and derivatives are most frequently translated by English versions as “save” or “salvation.” Frequency in the English Bible depends upon the version considered. For example, in the OT “salvation” is found 74 times in the <span class="sc">nlt</span>, 80 times in the <span class="sc">niv</span>, 90 times in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>, 111 times in the <span class="sc">nasb</span>, and 119 times in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. Salvation is not used as a technical term in the OT and is ascribed to both individuals and God. Leaders like Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.5">Jgs 13:5</a>) or David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.6">2 Sm 8:6</a>) are used of the Lord to bring deliverance to God’s people.</p>
<p>Israel’s concept of salvation was rooted in the historical experience of the exodus. This momentous occasion was an opportunity to witness the salvation of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.13">Ex 14:13</a>) firsthand. Poets (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.8">Ps 106:8</a>) and prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.3">Is 43:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.4">Hos 13:4</a>) later reiterated God’s salvation when recalling the exodus experience. Israel’s understanding of salvation was worked out in historical instances like Sennacherib’s attack on Jerusalem in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the Lord declared that he would save the city for his name’s sake (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.34">2 Kgs 19:34</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.30,35">18:30, 35</a>). Israel’s opportunity to see God’s salvation through various leaders and situations corroborated this understanding of God as the God of salvation.</p>
<p>Israel’s response to God’s deliverance was primarily praise, as evidenced so often in the psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.3.8">Pss 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.9.14">9:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.21.1">21:1</a>) and earlier poetic passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.2">Ex 15:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1">1 Sm 2:1</a>). In addition, they directed petitions and pleas for help to the Lord for his salvation—whether from enemies (<a href="?bref=Ps.35.3">Pss 35:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.38.22">38:22</a>), sickness (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.29">69:29</a>), or battle (<a href="?bref=Ps.140.7">140:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.10-11">144:10-11</a>)—and in faith expected his deliverance (<a href="?bref=Ps.35.9">35:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.65.5">65:5</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets emphasized the eschatological (end-time) aspect of salvation. God’s ability to save was revealed by his great works in the past, which thus promoted the anticipation of his work of deliverance in the future. This future hope was for the nation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.17">Is 45:17</a>) but anticipated universal deliverance (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">49:6</a>). The prophets looked forward to deliverance and return from exile in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.25-26">Is 49:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.27">Jer 46:27</a>), yet they also spoke of an abiding future salvation (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.17">Is 45:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.6-8">51:6-8</a>). The messianic hope is indicated in passages that speak of an individual who will bring God’s salvation. Isaiah speaks of the Servant who brings salvation to the ends of the earth (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">49:6</a>), while Jeremiah writes of deliverance by God’s righteous Branch (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>). The mention of the king who brings salvation in <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zechariah 9:9</a> reflects this messianic theme and is applied to Jesus Christ in <a href="?bref=Matt.21.4-5">Matthew 21:4-5</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In classical Greek the verb <span class="greek">sozo</span> (“to save”) and noun <span class="greek">soteria</span> (“salvation”) are used for the concept of “rescue,” “deliverance” or “salvation,” and even “well-being” or “health.” The Septuagint most frequently uses <span class="greek">sozo</span> to render the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">yasha‘</span> (“to save”), and the NT primarily employs <span class="greek">sozo</span> and its derivatives for the idea of salvation.</p>
<p>These Greek terms are generally used theologically in the NT, but examples of nontheological usage occur. In <a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-44">Acts 27</a>, these words refer to the threat and deliverance of the soldiers, sailors, and prisoners from shipwreck (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.20,31">20, 31</a>), as well as their well-being (v <a href="?bref=Acts.27.34">34</a>).</p>
<p>In the Gospels “salvation” is clearly connected with the OT concept of salvation; it is applied to the coming of Christ in Zechariah’s prophecy (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.69,71">Lk 1:69, 71</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.106.10">Pss 106:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.17">132:17</a>) and in Simeon’s hymn of praise (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.30">Lk 2:30</a>). While <span class="greek">soteria</span> does not occur frequently in the Gospels, the concept of salvation is implied in Jesus’ statement about entrance into the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.24-26">Mt 19:24-26</a>) and his miracles of healing (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.19">Lk 17:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.42">18:42</a>).</p>
<p>The NT teaches that salvation has its source in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10">2 Tm 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.9">Heb 5:9</a>), who is the “author” and mediator of salvation (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.10">Heb 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.25">7:25</a>). Salvation is God’s work (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.9">1 Thes 5:9</a>) and is offered by his grace (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.8-9">Eph 2:8-9</a>). The message of salvation is contained in the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.15">2 Tm 3:15</a>) and is carried by those who proclaim the word of truth (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>). The appropriate response is repentance (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.10">2 Cor 7:10</a>) and faith (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.15">2 Tm 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.9">1 Pt 1:9</a>). This was the preaching of the early church as it proclaimed the Savior Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.12">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.23-26">13:23-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.30-31">16:30-31</a>). Paul especially proclaimed the universality of God’s offer of salvation (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.11">Ti 2:11</a>). His desire was for Jews to be saved (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.1">Rom 10:1</a>), though he primarily preached the message of salvation to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.11-13">11:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>Within the Scriptures there are many other terms associated with the concept of salvation. The new birth speaks of being made alive in Christ (“born again,” <a href="?bref=John.3.3">Jn 3:3</a>). Justification envisions one’s legal standing before God, while redemption speaks more of the means of salvation—the payment of a price to bring one back to God. Reconciliation speaks of a change in relationship and propitiation, which evokes the OT sacrificial system and points to the turning away of God’s wrath. These terms and others share some common ground with the biblical concept of salvation, but all point to the person and work of Jesus Christ the Savior.</p>

<p class="h1">SAMARIA</p>
<p class="fl">Capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, identified with the hill on which the village of Sebastieh is located.</p>
<p>The hill was purchased by King Omri from Shemer, the clan who had occupied it. He built his new capital there (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.24">1 Kgs 16:24</a>). A village was evidently there, dating at least from the 10th or perhaps the 11th century <span class="era">BC</span>. It became the center of the revived kingdom and enjoyed the new prestige of the Omride dynasty. But it was also subject to siege. Ben-hadad of Syria (Aram-Damascus) came up against it with an alliance of 32 kings (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.1-43">1 Kgs 20</a>), but the Israelites succeeded in driving them off. During the reign of Ahab’s son Joram, Ben-hadad came again (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.24-7.20">2 Kgs 6:24–7:20</a>) and almost conquered the city with a lengthy siege.</p>
<p>After a series of wars and the coup d’état by Jehu, which resulted in the slaughter of the priests of Baal in Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.18-28">2 Kgs 10:18-28</a>), the city returned to the worship of Yahweh under Jehu’s descendants. Nevertheless, the Asherah cult remained in Samaria under Jehoahaz (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.6">13:6</a>). Syria continued to have the upper hand militarily (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.7">7</a>).</p>
<p>During the eighth century, the balance changed in Israel’s favor (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.14-25">2 Kgs 13:14-25</a>), and under Jeroboam II, Samaria enjoyed great prosperity (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23-28">2 Kgs 14:23-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.3.10,15">Am 3:10, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.1,4-6">6:1, 4-6</a>). In the late eighth century, the internal strife in Israel left the kingdom open to subjection by the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.1-38">2 Kgs 15</a>). Finally, after Galilee, Transjordan, and perhaps the coastal plain were already detached, Samaria fell to Sargon II (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.9-12">18:9-12</a>). During the ensuing decades, foreign exiles were transported there.</p>
<p>In the Persian period (sixth through fourth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>), Samaria was the center of an administrative district governed by a dynasty of rulers whose names included several Sanballats (see <a href="?bref=Neh.2.10-20">Neh 2:10ff</a>.), usually every other generation. The resultant Samaritan people considered themselves part of Israel but were rejected by the Judeans (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-3">Ezr 4:1-3</a>). They were consulted, however, by the Jews of Elephantine when help was needed to rebuild the temple in Egypt.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Samaria"/>
<p>When Alexander the Great came to the Levant in 331 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Samaritans at first curried his favor (Josephus, <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 11.8.4), but later they murdered his governor. Their leaders evidently took refuge in the Wadi Dalieh cave, where they were trapped with their personal documents (papyri) and suffocated.</p>
<p>Samaria was taken in 108–107 <span class="era">BC</span> (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.10.2; <span class="ital">War</span> 1.2.7) by John Hyrcanus, who destroyed the city. It was rebuilt by Pompey and further restored by Gabinius. King Herod changed the name of the city to Sebaste in honor of Caesar Augustus (Sebastos) and built a large temple to him there. At Sebaste, Herod entertained Agrippa, killed his wife Mariamne, and strangled his sons. During the first Jewish war, the Sebastenes went over to the Romans.</p>

<p class="h2" id="OriginsoftheSect">Origins of the Sect</p>
<p class="fl">It is difficult to determine precisely when the Samaritan sect arose and when the final break with Judaism occurred. The OT conception of the origin of the Samaritan sect is that they stemmed from repopulated foreign peoples whose worship of God was only a veneer for underlying idolatry. According to <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-41">2 Kings 17</a>, the Samaritan sect arose from the exchange of peoples following Israel’s defeat by Assyria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. Removing the Israelites from the land, the king of Assyria repopulated the area with conquered peoples from Babylon, Cuthah, and various other nations.</p>
<p>The Samaritans offer a vastly different interpretation of their origin. They claim descent from the Jewish tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (see <a href="?bref=John.4.12">Jn 4:12</a>) and hold that the exile of Israelites in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> by Assyria was neither full-scale nor permanent. To account for the mutual hostility that developed between their group and the Jews, the Samaritan version holds that the Jews were guilty of apostasy, setting up heretical sanctuaries during the time of Eli, rather than staying with the only holy place on Mt Gerizim. The Samaritans therefore considered themselves true Israelites in descent and worship.</p>
<p>From Assyrian records of this period, an exchange of population is in fact affirmed for the northern kingdom, but apparently a total deportation was not carried out (see <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.9">2 Chr 34:9</a>). This would suggest that there were two elements in the land: first, the native Israelite remnant not exiled; and second, the foreign exiles who were gradually won over to the faith of the native residents, although syncretism no doubt existed during the early period of assimilation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RelationsbetweentheSamaritansandtheJews">Relations between the Samaritans and the Jews</p>
<p class="fl">The history of relations between the Samaritans—situated on the north around Mt Gerizim (their holy mountain), Shechem, and Samaria—and Jewish populations in Judea and then later in Galilee is one of fluctuating tensions. The ancient tension between the northern and southern kingdoms was revived with the return of exiles to Jerusalem under the Persian ruler Cyrus’s edict (c. 538 <span class="era">BC</span>). The entire southern area was at the time being governed from Samaria in the north by Sanballat, a native ruler of Palestine under Persian authority. The return of exiles to Jerusalem, particularly with their intentions of rebuilding the Jerusalem temple, posed an obvious political threat to his leadership in the north (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-24">Ezr 4:7-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-9">Neh 4:1-9</a>).</p>
<p>Opposition was at first politically motivated but became religious when sometime later, possibly in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, a rival temple was erected on Mt Gerizim. An example of Jewish hostility toward the Samaritans about this time comes from <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.50.25-26">Ecclesiasticus 50:25-26</a> (written approximately 200 <span class="era">BC</span>), where the Samaritans are placed below the Edomites and Philistines in esteem and are termed a “foolish people” (cf. Test. Levi 7:2).</p>
<p>Jewish disregard for the Samaritans was increased by the Samaritans’ lack of resistance to Antiochus Epiphanes’ campaign (c. 167 <span class="era">BC</span>) to promote Hellenistic worship in the area. While part of the Jewish community resisted the transforming of the Jerusalem temple to a temple for Zeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.62-64">1 Macc 1:62-64</a>) and eventually followed the Maccabees in revolt (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.42-43">1 Macc 2:42-43</a>), sources suggest that the Samaritans did not (see <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.6.2">1 Macc 6:2</a>).</p>
<p>Poor relations came to a climax during the brief period of Jewish independence under the Hasmoneans, when the Jewish ruler, John Hyrcanus, marched against Shechem, conquering and destroying the Samaritan temple on Mt Gerizim (c. 128 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Under Herod the Great, Samaria’s fortunes improved, although animosity still continued between the Samaritans and Jews in Judea and Galilee. Holding the Jerusalem temple to be a false cultic center, and excluded from the inner courts by the Jerusalem authorities, a group of Samaritans desecrated the Jerusalem temple in approximately <span class="era">AD</span> 6 by spreading human bones within the temple porches and sanctuary during Passover. Hostility toward Galilean Jews traveling through Samaria on the way to Jerusalem for various feasts was also not uncommon (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.51-53">Lk 9:51-53</a>).</p>
<p>This animosity continued in Jesus’ day. Both groups excluded the other from their respective cultic centers, the Jerusalem temple and the Samaritan temple on Mt Gerizim. The Samaritans, for example, were forbidden access to the inner courts of the temple, and any offering they might give was considered as if it were from a Gentile. Thus, although probably more accurately defined as “schismatics,” it appears Samaritans were in practice treated as Gentiles. All marriage between the groups was therefore forbidden, and social relations were greatly restricted (<a href="?bref=John.4.9">Jn 4:9</a>). With such proscribed separation, it is not surprising that any interaction between the two groups was strained. The mere term Samaritan was one of contempt on the lips of Jews (<a href="?bref=John.8.48">8:48</a>), and among some scribes it possibly would not even be uttered (see the apparent circumlocution in <a href="?bref=Luke.10.37">Lk 10:37</a>). The disciples’ reaction to the Samaritan refusal of lodging (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.51-55">9:51-55</a>) is a good example of the animosity felt by Jews for Samaritans at the time.</p>
<p>Although there is less evidence for similar attitudes from the Samaritan side, we can assume they existed. It is probable to speculate, therefore, that the Samaritan shunning of hospitality in <a href="?bref=Luke.9.51-55">Luke 9:51-55</a> was not uncommon toward other Jews whose “face was set toward Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="SamaritanBeliefs">Samaritan Beliefs</p>
<p class="fl">The main beliefs of the Samaritans demonstrate both the close affinities with and obvious divergences from mainstream Judaism. They held in common with Judaism a strong monotheistic faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In contrast, however, there was an elevating of Mt Gerizim in the north as the only holy place for sacrifice, based on several divergent passages in Deuteronomy and Exodus in the Samaritan text. Mt Gerizim came to be identified with the site of Abel’s first altar (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.4">Gn 4:4</a>), the site of Noah’s sacrifice after the Flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20">8:20</a>), the meeting place of Abraham and Melchizedek (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18">14:18</a>), the site of Isaac’s intended sacrifice (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-24">22</a>), and many other associations.</p>
<p>The Samaritans held only the first five biblical books (Pentateuch) to be inspired and based their dogma and practice exclusively on these books. Such a narrow canon not only determined the direction of Samaritan theology but further separated them from contemporary Jewish thought. Moses, for example, was more highly exalted by the Samaritans than by the Jews. He was considered not only the chief prophet but also, in later thought, was described as the choicest of men, preexisting from Creation, interceding with God for Israel, and being to man “the light of the world.” The messianic hope of Samaritan theology also reflects this narrow canon. A Messiah from the house of David could not be anticipated, as no evidence for such could be found in the Pentateuch. Rather, the Samaritans awaited a “prophet like Moses” based on <a href="?bref=Deut.18.15-18">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>. This anticipated prophet was also designated the “Taheb,” the Restorer, for he would in the last days restore proper cultic worship on Mt Gerizim and bring the worship of the heathen to that site.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that it was primarily the claim of supremacy for Mt Gerizim that separated this group theologically and culturally from their Jewish neighbors.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusandtheSamaritans">Jesus and the Samaritans</p>
<p class="fl">The common Jewish perspective on Samaritans as being nearly Gentile was evidently held to some extent by Jesus as well. Jesus refers to the Samaritan leper as “this foreigner” (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.18">Lk 17:18</a>) and prohibits his disciples, during their commissioning, from taking the message of the kingdom to either the Samaritans or the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.5">Mt 10:5</a>).</p>
<p>Yet the overwhelming evidence in the Gospels is that Jesus’ attitude toward the Samaritans differed radically from that of his Jewish contemporaries. When his disciples display the usual Jewish animosity in asking to have the “fire of judgment” rain down upon the inhospitable Samaritans, Jesus “rebuked them” (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.55">Lk 9:55</a>). Moreover, he did not refuse to heal the Samaritan leper but honored him as the only one of the ten who remembered to give glory to God (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.11-19">17:11-19</a>). So also in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.30-37">10:30-37</a>) Jesus clearly breaks through the traditional prejudices in portraying the despised Samaritan, not the respected Jewish priest or Levite, as the true neighbor to the man in need. Here as elsewhere, Jesus, in confronting his audience with God’s demand, breaks through traditional definitions of “righteous” and “outcast.”</p>
<p><a href="?bref=John.4.4-43">John 4:4-43</a> records not only the fascinating exchange between Jesus and the Samaritan woman but also Jesus’ subsequent two-day stay in the town of Sychar, a Samaritan city. Here we see Jesus not only risking ritual uncleanness by contact with the Samaritan woman at the well (vv <a href="?bref=John.4.7-9">7-9</a>) but also offering the gift of salvation to her (v <a href="?bref=John.4.10">10</a>) and the entire Samaritan town (vv <a href="?bref=John.4.39-41">39-41</a>). Through Jesus’ knowledge of her marital life (vv <a href="?bref=John.4.16-18">16-18</a>), the woman concludes he must be a “prophet.” Remembering that the Samaritans were expecting a “prophet like Moses” in the last days, it is possible that the woman was wondering if Jesus was their long-awaited prophetic Messiah (vv <a href="?bref=John.4.19,25-26">19, 25-26</a>). Jesus not only breaks through the rigid animosity of Jews toward Samaritans by doing the unthinkable in staying with this despised people, but he also accepts their faith in him as “Messiah” (v <a href="?bref=John.4.26">26</a>) and “Savior of the world” (v <a href="?bref=John.4.42">42</a>). Here, as with his association with the outcasts of Jewish society, Jesus redefines righteousness not according to descent or religious practice but according to faith in himself. In so doing, he shatters the racial and cultural distinctions of his day and lays the foundation for the gospel’s subsequent spread to the entire gentile world.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SamariaintheMissionoftheEarlyChurch">Samaria in the Mission of the Early Church</p>
<p class="fl">In the great commission given prior to his ascension, Jesus told his disciples to take the gospel to Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>). The missionary activity of the early church did indeed include this region. When, following the martyrdom of Stephen, many Christians were forced to leave Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1">8:1</a>), one such Christian, Philip, spread the gospel in the city of Samaria (v <a href="?bref=Acts.8.5">5</a>). The response was so great to the miracles performed that Peter and John (representing the apostles in Jerusalem) were sent to investigate and to confirm the presence of the Holy Spirit among them. Evidence from the second century <span class="era">AD</span> suggests, however, that Christianity did not gain a strong foothold among the Samaritans. For the most part, the Samaritans retained their own religion. A small remnant of the Samaritan sect continues to exist to this day, living near Mt Gerizim (Shechem) and in various cities in Israel.</p>

<p class="h1">SAMOTHRACE</p>
<p class="fl">Island in the northeastern part of the Aegean Sea off the coast of the Roman province of Thrace. It was named Samothrace, or “Samos of Thrace,” to distinguish it from the other Samos (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.20.15">Acts 20:15</a>), which was also in the Aegean Sea but a little southwest of Ephesus. Samothrace was about halfway between Troas and Neapolis, the seaport of Philippi.</p>
<p>This island was the stopping place for the apostle Paul on his way from Troas to Neapolis on his second missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.11">Acts 16:11</a>). It is not clear whether Paul landed on the island or whether his boat only anchored off its coast before sailing for Neapolis the next day. The usual anchorage was on the north side of the island, since boats were thereby protected from the southeast wind. Apparently, Paul’s voyage from Troas to Neapolis via Samothrace was made with a fair wind behind the boat because it took two days. Returning, it took five days (see <a href="?bref=Acts.20.6">20:6</a>).</p>

<p>Samothrace is a mountainous island, with its central peak the highest point in the northern part of the Aegean, second in height only to Mt Athos on the mainland. The island has always been, in clear weather, an ancient landmark for sailors sailing between Troas and Neapolis. It is about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) in circumference.</p>

  <title>Samson</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SAMSON</p>
<p class="fl">Manoah’s son, from Dan’s tribe. His mother, whose name is not given in the Bible, had been barren. The angel of the Lord announced to her that she would have a son, who was to be a Nazirite all of his life (i.e., he was not to drink wine or strong drink, not to eat anything ceremonially unclean, and not to allow a razor to touch his head, <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-6">Nm 6:1-6</a>). She was also told that he would begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines, who had subjugated them for 40 years (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.1-5">Jgs 13:1-5</a>). She reported this to her husband, Manoah, and Manoah prayed concerning this angelic visit (v <a href="?bref=Judg.13.8">8</a>). The angel of the Lord appeared again and gave instructions about the child who was to be born. Manoah made a burnt offering, and the angel of the Lord ascended to heaven in the smoke. Manoah feared that they would die, for he now realized that they had seen God (v <a href="?bref=Judg.13.22">22</a>). The child was born and the Lord blessed him as he grew. The Spirit of the Lord moved upon him in Mahaneh-dan (v <a href="?bref=Judg.13.25">25</a>).</p>
<p>Samson went to Timnah and saw a Philistine woman whom he wished to marry. The Lord was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines, and in Samson’s case these occasions came through Philistine women. When he and his parents went to Timnah to arrange the marriage, a lion came out of the vineyards, and Samson, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord came mightily, tore the lion in half. Later he found that a swarm of bees had made honey in the carcass of the lion (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.2-9">Jgs 14:2-9</a>).</p>
<p>Samson made a feast at Timnah, as was the custom, and told the Philistine men a riddle that involved the lion and the honey. A wager was made on the riddle and the Philistines prevailed upon his wife to learn the answer and disclose it to them. When they came up with the answer, Samson knew what had happened, so he went out and killed 30 Philistine men to pay for his bet (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.19">Jgs 14:19</a>). Samson went home, and his father-in-law gave Samson’s wife to Samson’s best man.</p>
<p>When Samson returned to see his wife, he was not allowed to visit her, so he took 300 foxes, tied them in pairs tail to tail, fixed a torch to each pair, and turned them loose in the grainfields of the Philistines, so that the shocks and standing grain were burned. Consequently, the Philistines came and burned his wife and her father. In revenge, Samson went out and slaughtered many of them (<a href="?bref=Judg.15.1-8">Jgs 15:1-8</a>).</p>
<p>During these days, the Philistines came against Judah, and the people of Judah bound Samson with new ropes to turn him over to the Philistines. When they came to Lehi, where the Philistines were camped, the Spirit of the Lord came on him mightily. He snapped the ropes, seized the jawbone of a donkey, and killed 1,000 Philistines. Being very thirsty, he cried to the Lord, so God opened a spring of water at Lehi (<a href="?bref=Judg.15.9-20">Jgs 15:9-20</a>).</p>
<p>Samson’s weakness for Philistine women continued to create trouble for both him and the Philistines. He went down to Gaza, where he became involved with a prostitute (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.1">Jgs 16:1</a>). The men of the city learned that he was there and plotted to kill him at dawn, but he arose at midnight and walked off with the doors, posts, and bar of the city gate and put them on top of the hill before Hebron.</p>
<p>Then he found Delilah, from the valley of Sorek. The Philistines enlisted her by bribery to find out the source of his strength (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.4-5">Jgs 16:4-5</a>). She kept pestering him, so he told her that if they bound him with seven fresh bowstrings he would be as weak as other men. So she bound him and cried, “The Philistines are upon you.” He easily broke the bowstrings. In response to her continued questions, he kept lying to her about the secret of his strength. In succession, she bound him with new ropes and seven locks of his hair woven together and attached to a loom. Finally, she wore him down and he told her the truth. If someone shaved his head and broke his Nazirite vow, his strength would be gone. While Samson slept with his head on her knees, she called a barber, who shaved off his hair. This time when she cried, “The Philistines are upon you,” the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes, and took him to Gaza (v <a href="?bref=Judg.16.21">21</a>).</p>
<p>At Gaza, Samson was bound with bronze fetters and forced to grind at a mill, during which time his hair began to grow again. At a time when the Philistines were having a great festival at the temple of their god, Dagon, they celebrated their victory over Samson and asked that he be brought so they could mock him. Some 3,000 people watched while Samson entertained them. At his request, Samson was placed between the two pillars supporting the temple. He asked the Lord for strength and pushed against the pillars, so that the entire building collapsed. Samson died with the Philistines as he had requested, but he killed more Philistines in this final act than he had previously (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.1-30">Jgs 16:1-30</a>).</p>
<p>Samson’s family came to retrieve his body, and they buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father, Manoah. He had served as “judge,” or leader, of Israel for 20 years (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.31">Jgs 16:31</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SAMUEL (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Last of the judges, his name means “name of God” or “his name is El” (El is the name of the God of strength and power). The play on words in <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.20">1 Samuel 1:20</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.2.10">Ex 2:10</a>) is not intended to be an explanation of the meaning of Samuel’s name; Hannah’s words recall only her prayer and the circumstances surrounding her son’s birth.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PersonalHistory">Personal History</p>
<p class="fl">Samuel’s parents were a devout couple who went annually to the sanctuary at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3">1 Sm 1:3</a>). His father, Elkanah, was a Levite (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.26">1 Chr 6:26</a>) and a resident in Ramah, territory of Ephraim. His mother, Hannah, was unable to bear children early in their marriage. Elkanah had a second wife, Peninnah.</p>
<p>On a visit to Shiloh, Hannah prayed in the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.6-11">1 Sm 1:6-11</a>), vowing that, if the Lord would give her a son, she would dedicate him as a Nazirite (<a href="?bref=Num.6.1-21">Nm 6:1-21</a>) to God’s service for life. The Lord heard Hannah’s prayer and granted her request. She had no other children until after Samuel’s dedication.</p>
<p>When Samuel was presented to Eli and began his service in the sanctuary, he bowed before the Lord and “worshiped the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> there” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.28">1 Sm 1:28</a>). Three ingredients—a feeling of worth, a knowledge of his parents’ love (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.19">2:19</a>), and a sense of purpose—laid the foundation of his personality and his future accomplishments.</p>
<p>Further proof of Samuel’s valuable early training is evidenced in <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1-36">1 Samuel 2</a>. Eli’s sons had followed the licentious practices of the pagan religions about them. Eli was old, indulgent, and powerless to restrain them. Samuel neither developed irreverence for Eli nor followed his sons in the path of evil. God determined to judge Eli and his house for their sins. When God announced his purpose to Samuel, Samuel responded with reverence and respect. His personal and spiritual growth indicated that he had been marked out as a future prophet of the Lord.</p>
<p> When everyone did what was right in his or her own eyes (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.17.6">Jgs 17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.21.25">21:25</a>), God allowed an adjacent nation to serve as his instrument to chasten his people, until a judge arose to deliver them. When the Philistines again invaded the land (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-6.21">1 Sm 4–6</a>), the Israelites mustered their army at Ebenezer, only to be defeated. Believing that the ark of the covenant would guarantee success, they sent to Shiloh for it. The next day the Israelites were again defeated and the ark captured. When this news reached Eli, he fell from his stool and died.</p>
<p>Twenty years elapsed before Samuel’s name is mentioned again (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.2-3">1 Sm 7:2-3</a>). Evidently, following the destruction of Shiloh (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.7.12-14">Jer 7:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.26.6,9">26:6, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.60">Ps 78:60</a>), he lived in Ramah and went on annual preaching missions that included Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, “judging” the people in these places (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.16.18-22">Dt 16:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.8-13">17:8-13</a>). Samuel probably also founded “schools of the prophets” during this period. Schools were established at Bethel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.3">2 Kgs 2:3</a>), Gilgal (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38">2 Kgs 4:38</a>), Ramah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.20">1 Sm 19:20</a>), and elsewhere (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.5">2 Kgs 2:5</a>), perhaps as a natural outgrowth of Samuel’s ministry.</p>
<p>After a 20-year ministry, Samuel thought it timely to move toward spiritual and national unification. He convened a meeting at Mizpah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.1-17">1 Sm 7</a>). There, with a symbolic rite expressive of deep humiliation and in keeping with the libations of a treaty, the Israelites poured out water on the ground, fasted, and prayed.</p>
<p>The Philistines mistook the nature of the convocation and decided to attack the defenseless worshipers, who entreated Samuel to pray for them. He offered a sacrifice and the Lord sent a violent thunderstorm, causing the invaders to flee in panic. The pursuing Israelites won a significant victory at Ebenezer (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.12">1 Sm 7:12</a>).</p>
<p>In Samuel’s declining years, the elders rejected his leadership in favor of a king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1-22">1 Sm 8</a>). Following earnest prayer, he received new direction from the Lord, acceded to their request, and later anointed Saul prince over God’s people. Samuel then summoned the Israelites to Mizpah, where God’s choice was made official, and Saul was hailed as king. Following Saul’s victory over Nahash (ch <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-15">11</a>), Samuel at Gilgal confirmed Saul’s kingship. Thereafter, Samuel retired to Ramah to train men to carry on his ministry.</p>
<p>Samuel twice had to reprove Saul, first for impatience and disobedience (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.5-14">1 Sm 13:5-14</a>), and then for disobeying the express command of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.20-23">15:20-23</a>), who rejected him as king. Samuel was then sent to the home of Jesse in Bethlehem, where he anointed David as the chosen one of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-13">16:1-13</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">1 Samuel 25:1</a> is a brief account of Samuel’s passing, when all Israel gathered together and mourned for him. He was buried in Ramah. The only subsequent mention of Samuel is in <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.1-25">1 Samuel 28</a>. Summoned by the witch of Endor at Saul’s request, Samuel announced that on the following day Saul and his sons would die in battle (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.4-19">4-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Character">Character</p>
<p class="fl">Samuel overcame many problems through piety, perseverance, and dedication to the service of the Lord. His overriding concern was for the good of his people. Wise and courageous, he boldly rebuked king, elders, and people when necessary, always from the sure ground of the revealed will of God.</p>
<p>While Samuel served as judge and priest, he was preeminently a prophet. Through his ministry the spiritual life of the Israelites improved. In inaugurating the monarchy, he led the people from tribal disunity to national solidarity. He appointed gatekeepers to the tent of meeting (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.17-26">1 Chr 9:17-26</a>), organized observance of the Passover so memorably that it was still spoken about in Josiah’s day (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.18">2 Chr 35:18</a>), put into writing how a king and his kingdom should be (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.25">1 Sm 10:25</a>), and penned “The Chronicles of Samuel the Seer” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>).</p>
<p>Samuel well deserves a place among the great men of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.32">Heb 11:32</a>). He was the last of the judges (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.6,15-17">1 Sm 7:6, 15-17</a>) and the first of the prophets (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.20">1 Sm 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.24">Acts 3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.20">13:20</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Name">Name</p>
<p class="fl">First and Second Samuel derive their names from the individual whom God used to establish kingship in Israel. Samuel is the most prominent figure in the early narratives of 1 Samuel. His key role in leading the nation of Israel through the transition from the period of the judges to that of the monarchy warrants the use of his name as the title for the book.</p>
<p>These books, however, have not always been so designated, nor was the material originally divided into two books. As far as is known, the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT dating from the third century <span class="era">BC</span>) translators were the first to separate the material of Samuel into two books (they made a similar division in the material of Kings). The Hebrew original of these books was written, as is characteristic of Hebrew, with symbols only for consonants and none for vowels. When translated into Greek, it was necessary to use symbols for both vowels and consonants, thus greatly lengthening the manuscript. Presumably the practical consideration of the length of the scroll was the cause for dividing the material of both Samuel and Kings into two books (scrolls) instead of retaining just one. The Septuagint translators, recognizing the continuity of content and emphasis in Samuel and Kings, designated what is now known as 1 and 2 Samuel as “The First and Second Books of Kingdoms” and then designated what now is known as 1 and 2 Kings as “The Third and Fourth Books of Kingdoms.” The Latin Vulgate (the Latin translation of the Bible prepared by Jerome in the late fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>) slightly modified the Septuagint titles to “First, Second, Third, and Fourth Kings.” These titles were utilized all through the Middle Ages and were modified into our present titles by the Protestant Reformers in the 16th century <span class="era">AD</span> in agreement with Jewish rabbinic tradition. The Reformers, however, retained the division into two books, and this has been followed in modern English versions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AuthorandDate">Author and Date</p>
<p class="fl">Even though Samuel is prominent in the early part of the book, and the book bears his name in our English versions, it is clear that he is not the author of the entirety of 1 and 2 Samuel. Samuel’s death is recorded in <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">1 Samuel 25:1</a>, prior to the time of the accession of David to the throne in place of Saul. Who wrote the material of 1 and 2 Samuel if it was not Samuel? On the basis of the statement in <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>, it has been suggested by some that Samuel composed the early narratives of the book and that his work was later supplemented by the writings of the prophets Nathan and Gad. Others have suggested one of David’s contemporaries, such as Ahimaaz (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.27,36">2 Sm 15:27, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.17">17:17</a>), Hushai (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.32">2 Sm 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.16">16:16</a>), or Zabud (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.5">1 Kgs 4:5</a>). Presumably, these men would have had access to the writings of Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, as well as to other sources (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.18">2 Sm 1:18</a>) pertaining to the life and reigns of Saul and David. Who the real author was, however, cannot be determined from available evidence. Whoever it was, it is clear that he lived after the death of Solomon and the division of the kingdom in 930 <span class="era">BC</span> (see references to “Israel in Judah” in <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.8">1 Sm 11:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.52">17:52</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.16">18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.5">2 Sm 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-9">24:1-9</a>; and “kings of Judah” in <a href="?bref=1Sam.27.6">1 Sm 27:6</a>). Thus, 1 and 2 Samuel was published in its final form sometime after 930 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The theme binding together the narratives of 1 and 2 Samuel pertains to the relationship between kingship and the covenant. Kingship as requested by the people was a denial of the covenant; kingship as instituted by Samuel was compatible with the covenant; kingship as practiced by Saul failed to correspond to the covenantal idea; and kingship as practiced by David was an imperfect but true representation of the ideal of the covenantal king.</p>
<p>It has often been pointed out that there is ambivalence in the description of the establishment of kingship in Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1-12.25">1 Sm 8–12</a>), because in some places it seems to be suggested that kingship is improper for Israel, while in other places it seems to be suggested that kingship was God’s will for his people. Resolution to this tension is provided in <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.1-25">1 Samuel 12</a>, when Samuel inaugurates Saul as Israel’s first king in the context of a covenant renewal ceremony by which Israel renews its allegiance to the Lord. Here it becomes clear that kingship in itself was not wrong for Israel; God desired Israel to have a king. But kingship of the type Israel desired (“like the other nations”) and for the reasons she wanted a king (to give a sense of national security and lead her to victory in battle) involved a denial of the Lord as her ultimate sovereign. Samuel defined the role of the king in Israel and presented Saul to the people in a ceremony in which they renewed their allegiance to the Lord. The monarchy in Israel was first established in a form that was compatible with the covenant. The king in Israel, as every other citizen of the nation, was to be subject to the law of the Lord and to the word of the prophet. From this perspective, the author depicts the reign of Saul as failing to correspond to the covenantal requirements, while the reign of David, although imperfect, reflected the covenantal ideal.</p>
<p>There are at least two other important themes recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel. The first of these is that David conquers and acquires the land promised to Abraham. It is in the time of David that Israel’s borders are extended from Egypt to the Euphrates, as had been promised. A second event of major significance for the remainder of the Bible is David’s selection of Jerusalem to be the political and religious center of Israel.</p>

<p class="h3">Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-7.17">1 Sm 1–7</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">Samuel’s Youth (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-3.21">1 Sm 1–3</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">God granted the request of Hannah for a son after a long period of barrenness. She named her son Samuel (a wordplay on the Hebrew expression “heard of God”) and dedicated him to the service of the Lord—with Eli the priest at the tabernacle in Shiloh. Hannah’s beautiful song of praise to God, who hears and answers prayer (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1-10">2:1-10</a>), exalts the sovereignty of God and prophetically anticipates not only the establishment of kingship in Israel but ultimately the highest fulfillment of the royal office in Christ himself (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.10">10</a>). The evil practices of the sons of the priest Eli are described in verses <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.11-26">11-26</a>. These men not only used their office for personal gain (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12-17">12-17</a>) but also committed immoral acts with the women serving at the entrance to the tabernacle (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.22">22</a>). Although Eli rebuked his sons (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.22-25">22-25</a>), his warnings were too little too late. It was in this lax environment that Samuel grew up (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.18-21,26">18-21, 26</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.27-36">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>, an unnamed prophet pronounced judgment on Eli and his priestly line. The prediction of the imminent death of Hophni and Phinehas, Eli’s sons, was fulfilled when the Philistines took the ark and destroyed the tabernacle at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.11">4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.14">Jer 7:14</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Sam.3.1-4.1">1 Samuel 3:1–4:1</a>, Samuel is called to be a prophet, and he too is given a message of judgment for the house of Eli (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.11-14">3:11-14</a>). As the reliability of Samuel’s words are attested, it is recognized by the people that he was a true prophet of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.19-4.1">3:19–4:1</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="KeyPlacesin1Samuel"/>
<p class="h4">The Loss and Return of the Ark (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-6.21">1 Sm 4–6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In a battle with the Philistines, the prophecy of <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.27-36">2:27-36</a> and <a href="?bref=1Sam.3.11-14">3:11-14</a> was partially fulfilled. The Israelites were defeated, the ark was taken, and Hophni and Phinehas were killed. Upon hearing the report of these calamities, Eli also died (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.17-18">4:17-18</a>). The Philistines placed the ark of the Lord in the temple of their god Dagon in Ashdod (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>). However, when the idol of Dagon broke in pieces and fell before the ark and a plague broke out in Ashdod, the ark was moved to Gath. When the plague broke out in Gath, it was moved to Ekron. When the plague erupted in Ekron, the Philistines were compelled to return the ark to Israel—as a test, it was placed on a cart pulled by two nursing cows. These cows, going against their motherly instincts, left their penned-up calves and headed for the Israelite border and the town of Beth-shemesh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.1-21">6:1-21</a>). By this the Lord demonstrated that the victory over the Israelites and the capture of the ark could not be attributed to the Philistines’ god Dagon.</p>
<p class="h4">The Defeat of the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.1-17">1 Sm 7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Twenty years went by. Samuel assured the people of deliverance from Philistine oppression if they would confess their sin and turn from the worship of Baals and Ashtaroths. He called for a national assembly at Mizpah to renew allegiance to the Lord. While the Israelites were assembled, the Philistines attacked and the Lord gave the Israelites a miraculous victory, thereby demonstrating that obedience to covenant obligations would ensure national security (see <a href="?bref=Exod.23.22">Ex 23:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.1-4">Dt 20:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Kingship Established in Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1-12.25">1 Sm 8–12</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">The People Request a King (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1-22">1 Sm 8:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">When Samuel was an old man, the elders of the nation approached him and requested that he give them a king. Samuel immediately perceived that their request was tantamount to a rejection of the Lord, who was their King, for the people desired a king “like the other nations”—as a symbol of national unity and military security. Nevertheless, the Lord told Samuel to give the people a king. At the same time, however, he told Samuel to warn the people concerning what having a king “like the nations” would mean. The warning, descriptive of the practices of contemporary Canaanite kings, fell on deaf ears; the people persisted in their desire for a king.</p>
<p class="h4">Samuel Privately Anoints Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1-10.16">1 Sm 9:1–10:16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The narrative of Saul’s search for the lost donkeys of his father and his encounter with Samuel in the process of his search is given to explain how Samuel and Saul first met, and how the Lord indicated to Samuel who the person was that he was to anoint as Israel’s first king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.16-17">9:16-17</a>). After Samuel privately anointed Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">10:1</a>), he was given three signs to confirm that his new calling came from the Lord.</p>
<p class="h4">Saul Publicly Chosen by Lot at Mizpah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.17-27">1 Sm 10:17-27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After the private designation and anointing of Saul to be king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1-10.16">9:1–10:16</a>), Samuel convened a national assembly at Mizpah to make the Lord’s choice known to the people (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.20-24">10:20-24</a>) and to define the king’s task (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.25">25</a>). Again, at this assembly, Samuel emphasized that the people had rejected the Lord in requesting a king because they sought a king for the wrong reasons and failed to recognize the Lord’s past faithfulness in delivering them from their enemies. But again it was clear that the time for kingship in Israel had come and it was the Lord’s desire to give the people a king. Samuel’s explanation of the “regulations of the kingship” was an important step in resolving the tension between, on the one hand, Israel’s sin in desiring a king, and on the other, the Lord’s intent to give them a king. This document, which was preserved at the tabernacle, probably contained an enlarged version of the “law of the king” in <a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> and spelled out regulations governing the role of the king in Israel for the benefit of both the king and the people. This document undoubtedly distinguished Israelite kingship from that of the kings of the surrounding nations.</p>
<p class="h4">Saul Leads Israel to Victory over the Ammonites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-13">1 Sm 11:1-13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">When Nahash, king of the Ammonites, attacked Jabesh-gilead, a town east of the Jordan in the territory of Manasseh, Saul left his farmwork to lead a volunteer army in support of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead. The victory over the Ammonites under Saul’s leadership placed another seal of divine approval on his selection to be king. Saul attributed the victory to the Lord rather than to his own military strategies.</p>
<p class="h4">Saul Inaugurated as King (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.14-12.25">1 Sm 11:14–12:25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The victory at Jabesh-gilead prompted Samuel to call for a national assembly at Gilgal to renew the kingdom and make Saul king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.14-15">11:14-15</a>). At the Gilgal assembly, Samuel led the people in confessing the sin of their initial request for a king and in renewing their allegiance to the Lord. In the context of this covenant renewal ceremony, Saul was formally inaugurated in his office as king. By inaugurating Saul in this manner, Samuel effectively provided for covenantal continuity in the transition from the period of the judges to that of the monarchy.</p>
<p class="h3">Saul Rejected as King (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.1-15.35">1 Sm 13–15</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">Saul’s Disobedience (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.1-22">1 Sm 13:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">When Saul was threatened with an imminent attack from the Philistines, he gathered troops at Gilgal and awaited Samuel, as he had been instructed (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.8">10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.8">13:8</a>). When it appeared that Samuel would not come within the prearranged time, Saul became impatient and offered a sacrifice himself (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.9">13:9</a>). Just as the sacrifice was completed, Samuel appeared and rebuked Saul for not keeping the commandment of the Lord. In disobeying Samuel’s previous instructions, Saul had violated a fundamental requirement of his office. He was seriously mistaken in thinking he could strengthen Israel’s hand against the Philistines by sacrifice to the Lord when this was done in violation of the Lord’s specific command. Samuel told Saul that because of his disobedience his dynasty would not endure (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.14">14</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Jonathan’s Victory (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.23-14.52">1 Sm 13:23–14:52</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Saul’s son Jonathan and Jonathan’s armor bearer skillfully and courageously attacked a Philistine outpost, killing about 20 men (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.8-14">14:8-14</a>). The Lord used this defeat, along with an earthquake, to bring panic to the entire Philistine force. In the meantime, Saul sought divine guidance on whether to join the fray with his own forces. When the Lord’s answer did not come immediately, Saul concluded that waiting for the Lord’s word might jeopardize his military advantage. Here again he demonstrated that he trusted more in his own insight than in waiting upon the Lord. Saul further damaged his own stature in the eyes of his troops by pronouncing a foolish curse on any who would eat food before the battle was won. This nearly cost Jonathan his life; he was spared only because of the intervention of the troops in his defense.</p>
<p class="h4">Saul Rejected as King (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.1-35">1 Sm 15:1-35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Saul was commanded by the Lord through Samuel to attack the Amalekites and totally destroy them, sparing neither human nor animal life. The Amalekites had previously attempted to destroy Israel shortly after their exodus from Egypt while journeying to Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">Ex 17:8-16</a>). Saul disobeyed the Lord in sparing the best of the animals for sacrifice and in sparing Agag, the Amalekite king. The Lord sent Samuel again to rebuke Saul for his disobedience. Samuel charged Saul with rebellion against the Lord and told him that, because he had rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord had rejected him as king.</p>
<p class="h3">Saul and David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1--2Sam.1.27">1 Sm 16:1—2 Sm 1:27</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">Samuel Anoints David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-13">1 Sm 16:1-13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Lord instructed Samuel to go to the house of Jesse in Bethlehem to anoint one of his sons to be king in place of Saul. By divine leading, Jesse’s youngest son, David, was shown to be the one whom the Lord had chosen. When Samuel anointed him as king, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him with power.</p>
<p class="h4">David in the Service of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14-17.58">1 Sm 16:14–17:58</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">When Saul became plagued by an evil spirit, his attendants sought a harpist whose music would soothe him. David was the one chosen for this purpose. The position at the court, however, was not permanent, and David divided his time between the court and his home duties. In due time, the Philistines, led by the giant Goliath, encamped against the Israelites. Goliath challenged any Israelite who dared to meet him in individual combat. No Israelite ventured to accept his challenge until David, who was visiting the camp of the Israelite forces to bring food to his brothers, heard the challenge and responded in the strength and power of the Lord. The Lord gave David a great victory because he acknowledged that “the battle is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.47">17:47</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h4">Saul’s Hatred toward David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.1-19.24">1 Sm 18:1–19:24</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the aftermath of David’s victory over Goliath, Saul’s son Jonathan pledged loyalty to David in a covenant of friendship. As David achieved further successes in leading Israel’s armies, and as his public acclaim grew, Saul began to fear that David was a threat to his throne (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.14-16,28-30">18:14-16, 28-30</a>). Saul, hating David, made several attempts to kill him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.17,25">18:17, 25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.1,10">19:1, 10</a>). David was finally forced to flee and sought refuge with Samuel at Ramah. When Saul and three of his messengers went to Ramah to arrest David, they were so overcome by the Spirit of God that they were incapable of fulfilling their mission.</p>
<p class="h4">David and Jonathan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.1-42">1 Sm 20:1-42</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David’s absence from the royal table at the new moon festival provoked Saul to again threaten David’s life. Jonathan met with David at a prearranged place to inform him of the danger and say good-bye. Jonathan and David again pledged themselves to mutual loyalty and kindness. In the encounter it is clear that both men knew that David, not Jonathan, would be the successor to Saul on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p class="h4">David at Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-9">1 Sm 21:1-9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David went to the priest Ahimelech at Nob and, indicating he was on a secret mission for Saul, asked for bread and for the sword of Goliath, both of which were given to him. One of Saul’s servants, Doeg the Edomite, who was at Nob, observed the transaction.</p>
<p class="h4">David at Gath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.10-15">1 Sm 21:10-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David then went into Philistine territory to King Achish at Gath. When his identity was discovered, he feigned insanity in order to escape.</p>
<p class="h4">David at Adullam (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.1-5">1 Sm 22:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">From Gath David went to the cave of Adullam where he was joined by about 400 supporters. He took his parents to Moab for their own protection and then returned to the Forest of Hereth in Judah.</p>
<p class="h4">Saul Kills the Priests at Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.6-23">1 Sm 22:6-23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Doeg the Edomite reported to Saul that Ahimelech the priest had given assistance to David. At Saul’s command Doeg massacred all the priests at Nob except Abiathar, who escaped with the ephod and joined David.</p>
<p class="h4">David at Keilah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-13">1 Sm 23:1-13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David and his men delivered the citizens of Keilah from Philistine raiders but were forced to leave the city when it was apparent that its unthankful inhabitants were prepared to hand David over to Saul.</p>
<p class="h4">David in the Desert of Ziph (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.14-29">1 Sm 23:14-29</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">While David was in the desert of Ziph, he was encouraged by a visit from Jonathan, who again pledged to him his loyalty. Although the Ziphites promised to aid Saul in capturing David, a Philistine attack forced Saul to abandon his attempt to apprehend him.</p>
<p class="h4">David Spares Saul’s Life (<a href="?bref=1Sam.24.1-22">1 Sm 24:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">While hiding deep in a cave at En-gedi, David was unexpectedly provided the opportunity to take Saul’s life when Saul relieved himself at the entrance to the cave. Nevertheless, because Saul was “the anointed of the Lord,” David spared his life and shamed him into confessing his own wickedness. David did this by showing Saul a piece of his robe that he had cut off while Saul was in the entrance to the cave.</p>
<p class="h4">David, Nabal, and Abigail (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1-44">1 Sm 25:1-44</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David was badly mistreated by a sheepherder named Nabal. David was deterred, however, from foolishly taking the man’s life by the discerning words of Nabal’s wife, Abigail. Shortly after this incident, Nabal died and David took Abigail as his wife.</p>
<p class="h4">David Spares Saul’s Life a Second Time (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1-25">1 Sm 26:1-25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">For a second time, the Ziphites joined Saul in attempting to capture David. While Saul and his men were sleeping, David and Abishai crept into their camp and took Saul’s spear and water jug. On the next day, David was again able to demonstrate to Saul that he did not seek to steal the kingship from his hands.</p>
<p class="h4">David among the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.1-12">1 Sm 27:1-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David eventually became weary of hiding from Saul in Israelite territory; in a time of discouragement, he went again to Philistia to seek refuge beyond Saul’s reach. Ingratiating himself with Achish, a Philistine ruler, he was given the town of Ziklag as a place for himself and his men to reside. From Ziklag, David raided various tribes inhabiting the area south of Philistia, but deceived Achish into thinking he was raiding the territory of Judah.</p>
<p class="h4">Saul and the Medium of Endor (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.1-25">1 Sm 28:1-25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Philistines again gathered an army to fight Israel, and Saul, terrified and seemingly anticipating an imminent defeat, vainly sought for some word from the Lord concerning the outcome of the battle. When this was denied, he went in disguise to a medium at Endor and requested her to bring up to him the spirit of Samuel. Saul was told by this spirit that Israel would be defeated and that he and his sons would die in the upcoming battle.</p>
<p class="h4">The Philistines Mistrust David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1-11">1 Sm 29:1-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Although Achish desired David to join the Philistine army in its battle with Israel, the other Philistine commanders mistrusted him and forced Achish to send David and his men back to Ziklag. This turn of events rescued David from a serious dilemma created by his apparent friendship with Achish.</p>
<p class="h4">David Defeats the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-31">1 Sm 30:1-31</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Upon returning to Ziklag, David discovered that in his absence the city had been raided and burned by the Amalekites and that their wives, children, and cattle had been taken captive. After inquiring of the Lord through Abiathar the priest, David and his men went in pursuit of the Amalekites and recovered all they had taken and more. He divided the plunder among his troops and sent gifts from it to various towns in Judah.</p>
<p class="h4">The Death of Saul and His Sons (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1--2Sam.1.27">1 Sm 31:1—2 Sm 1:27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">As had been predicted, the battle with the Philistines ended in a disastrous defeat for Israel, in which Saul took his own life after being seriously wounded. Jonathan and two other sons of Saul were killed. David mourned for Saul and Jonathan and exalted their memory in his tribute to them recorded in <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.19-27">2 Samuel 1:19-27</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-24.25">2 Sm 2–24</a>)</p>

<p class="h4">David Anointed King over Judah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-7">2 Sm 2:1-7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Subsequent to Saul’s death, the Lord instructed David to go to Hebron, where the tribe of Judah anointed him as their king.</p>
<p class="h4">David, Ishbosheth, and Abner (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-4.12">2 Sm 2:8–4:12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Although David became king over Judah, the remaining tribes—under the influence of Abner, commander of Saul’s army—recognized Ishbosheth as Saul’s successor (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-10">2:8-10</a>). Ishbosheth was a son of Saul who had survived the battle with the Philistines. Conflict quickly broke out between the men of David, led by Joab, and the men of Ishbosheth, led by Abner. In this conflict Asahel, Joab’s brother, was slain by Abner. As David grew stronger and Ishbosheth weaker, Abner shifted his allegiance from Ishbosheth to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.1-21">3:1-21</a>). Joab, however, avenged the blood of his brother Asahel by murdering Abner under the pretense of negotiating with him. Although David detested this act, mourned for Abner, and cursed Joab, the crime was not punished until early in the reign of Solomon (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.5-6,29-34">1 Kgs 2:5-6, 29-34</a>). Shortly afterward, Ishbosheth was killed by two soldiers, who brought his head to David at Hebron, expecting to be rewarded (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.1-8">2 Sm 4:1-8</a>). David, however, had them both put to death. The only male survivor of Saul’s line was the crippled son of Jonathan named Mephibosheth.</p>
<p class="h4">David King over All Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.1-25">2 Sm 5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After Ishbosheth’s death, David was made king over all the tribes at Hebron. One of David’s first acts as king was to capture the fortress of Zion from the Jebusites. David established Zion as his capital and built a palace there for his residence.</p>
<p class="h4">The Ark Brought to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-23">2 Sm 6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Recognizing the importance of the ark as a symbol of God’s presence with his people, David determined that it should be brought to Jerusalem from the obscurity of the house of Abinadab in Kiriath-jearim, where it had remained throughout the entirety of Saul’s reign. Violation of prescriptions for handling the ark led to the death of Uzzah, one of Abinadab’s sons, and delayed the ark’s conveyance to Jerusalem for three months. In a second attempt David led a joyful procession into the city of Jerusalem, where the ark was placed in a tent that had been prepared for it.</p>
<p class="h4">David, Nathan, and the Temple (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sm 7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">It soon became David’s desire to build a temple to house the ark and provide a center for Israel’s worship of the Lord. The Lord told David through Nathan the prophet that he was not to build the Lord a house (temple) but that the Lord would build him a house (a dynasty) that would endure forever. Here the line of the promised seed is narrowed to the house of David within the tribe of Judah. This promise finds its fulfillment in the birth of Jesus, who was the “son of David, the son of Abraham” (see <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>). It would be the task of Solomon, David’s son, to construct the temple (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.13">2 Sm 7:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">David’s Victories (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.1-18">2 Sm 8</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David was able to defeat numerous surrounding peoples, to extend Israel’s borders, and to establish a time of prosperity and rest for the nation.</p>
<p class="h4">David and Mephibosheth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.1-13">2 Sm 9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Remembering his covenant with Jonathan (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.1-3">1 Sm 18:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.20.13-16,42">20:13-16, 42</a>), David inquired concerning survivors of the house of Saul to whom he could show kindness. When Mephibosheth was sought out, David brought him to the court to enjoy the honor of eating at the king’s table.</p>
<p class="h4">David and Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-12.31">2 Sm 10–12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">During a war with the Ammonites, David committed adultery with the wife of one of his soldiers, Uriah the Hittite. When Bathsheba became pregnant, David attempted to get Uriah to sleep with her. When this failed, David arranged for Uriah’s certain death in battle. These sinful acts provoked God’s wrath (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.10-12">2 Sm 12:10-12</a>) and David experienced the bitter fruits of his misconduct during the remainder of his life.</p>
<p class="h4">Amnon, Absalom, and Tamar (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.1-39">2 Sm 13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David’s oldest son, Amnon, feigned sickness in order to arrange for his half sister, Tamar, to care for him. When Tamar refused Amnon’s sexual advances to her, he raped her. This incident enraged Tamar’s full brother Absalom, who determined to avenge his sister by killing Amnon. Absalom waited two years and then arranged for the murder of Amnon during the festivities of the time of sheepshearing. He then fled to Geshur, a small city-state in Syria, where his maternal grandfather was king.</p>
<p class="h4">David and Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.1-19.43">2 Sm 14–19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Absalom remained in exile for three years until Joab arranged for his return by securing a renunciation of blood revenge from David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.1-27">14:1-27</a>). Upon Absalom’s return, however, David refused to see him for two years, until they were finally reconciled. In this whole episode David sidestepped the issues of repentance and justice and took no effective disciplinary action. In the meantime Absalom conspired to take the throne from David his father by attempting to discredit his administration of justice, and by seeking to win the favor of the people and members of David’s court. After four years, Absalom proclaimed himself king in Hebron and gathered sufficient military strength to force his father to flee from Jerusalem (ch <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-37">15</a>). Failure to immediately pursue David led to the defeat of Absalom’s forces and to Absalom’s own death at the hand of Joab, David’s commander. David mourned for his son Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.1-8">19:1-8</a>), but he was able to return to Jerusalem and to reestablish his government. David disciplined Joab for killing Absalom by replacing him as commander of his troops with Amasa.</p>
<p class="h4">Rebellion of Sheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.1-26">2 Sm 20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the unsettled conditions immediately after David’s return to Jerusalem, another abortive revolt was attempted by Sheba of the tribe of Benjamin. Joab, in defiance of David’s disciplinary action, killed Amasa, pursued Sheba, and crushed his revolt.</p>
<p class="h4">David and the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-14">2 Sm 21:1-14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">At some unspecified time during David’s reign, the land suffered a three-year famine. It was revealed to David by the Lord that the famine was due to Saul’s violation of an Israelite treaty with the Gibeonites (see <a href="?bref=Josh.9.15,18-27">Jos 9:15, 18-27</a>). This offense was atoned for by giving seven descendants of Saul to the Gibeonites for execution.</p>
<p class="h4">David and the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.15-22">2 Sm 21:15-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this pericope four episodes of heroic accomplishments by David’s mighty men against the Philistines are recounted.</p>
<p class="h4">David’s Song of Praise (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.1-51">2 Sm 22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In a beautiful song of praise, David described his deliverance from his enemies and the help with which the Lord sustained him. The same song occurs with minor variations in <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">Psalm 18</a>.</p>
<p class="h4">David’s Last Words (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.1-7">2 Sm 23:1-7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In a brief statement, David acknowledges the work of God’s Spirit in enabling him to speak God’s word, and proclaims his confidence in the realization of the Lord’s promise to him and his dynasty.</p>
<p class="h4">David’s Mighty Men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.8-39">2 Sm 23:8-39</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This pericope contains a list of 37 of David’s warriors and a description of some of their accomplishments.</p>
<p class="h4">The Census and David’s Punishment (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-25">2 Sm 24:1-25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">David’s decision to take a census of his fighting men reflected an improper trust in military-political organization and power. The Lord judged him by sending a plague on the land that killed many people. At the word of the Lord through Gad the prophet, David built an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah, which was later to become the site of the temple (see <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.1">2 Chr 3:1</a>). The Lord responded to David’s sacrifices and prayers on behalf of the people; the plague was stopped.</p>

<p class="fl">Leading political official of Samaria residing at Beth-horon in Ephraim. In a letter from Elephantine of Egypt, Sanballat was named as the governor of Samaria in 407 <span class="era">BC</span>. Sanballat, along with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arab, were adversaries of Nehemiah. They tried to prevent him from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem during the postexilic period (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.10,19">Neh 2:10, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1,7">4:1, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-14">6:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.28">13:28</a>). The Judean province probably had been included under Samaritan rule since its defeat by Babylon under Nebuchadnezzar in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>.

  <title>Sanctification</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SANCTIFICATION</p>
<p class="fl">Term meaning “being made holy, or purified.” It is used broadly of the whole Christian experience, though most theologians prefer to use it in a restricted sense to distinguish it from related terms, such as “regeneration,” “justification,” and “glorification.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Definition">Definition</p>
<p class="fl">A comprehensive definition of sanctification by the New Hampshire Baptist Confession (1833) states,</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">We believe that Sanctification is the process by which, according to the will of God, we are made partakers of his holiness; that it is a progressive work; that it is begun in regeneration; and that it is carried on in the hearts of believers by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit, the Sealer and Comforter, in the continual use of the appointed means—especially the Word of God, self-examination, self-denial, watchfulness, and prayer. (Article X)</p>
<p class="sp">This definition helps us to distinguish sanctification from regeneration in that the latter speaks of the inception of the Christian life. Sanctification is also distinguished from glorification, which focuses on the consummation of God’s work in the believer. Put quite simply, then, regeneration refers to the beginning, sanctification to the middle, and glorification to the end of salvation.</p>
<p>The distinction between sanctification and justification, on the other hand, calls for more detailed attention, both because it is subtle and because it is fundamental. In the first place, “justification,” like “regeneration,” refers (though not exclusively) to the beginning of the Christian experience, whereas the above definition emphasizes the progressive character of sanctification. Second, justification refers to a judicial act of God whereby believers are at once absolved of all their guilt and accounted legally righteous, whereas sanctification, like regeneration and glorification, calls attention to the transforming power of the Holy Spirit upon the character of God’s children.</p>
<p>This distinction played an important role at the time of the Reformation. The Roman Catholic Church, in the opinion of the Reformers, confused these two doctrines by insisting that justification “is not remission of sins merely, but also the sanctification and renewal of the inward man” (Decrees of the Council of Trent, Sixth Session, 1547, ch. VII). In contrast, the Reformers emphasized that the two doctrines, although inseparable, must be distinguished. Calvin argued that, to be sure, these two elements of God’s saving act cannot be torn into parts any more than Christ can be torn: “Whomever, therefore, God receives into grace, on them he at the same time bestows the spirit of adoption, by whose power he remakes them to his own image. But if the brightness of the sun cannot be separated from its heat, shall we therefore say that the earth is warmed by its light, or lighted by its heat?” (<span class="ital">Institutes of the Christian Religion,</span> 3:11.6). In short, then, justification is a once-for-all, declarative act of God as Judge, whereas sanctification is a progressive change in the character of the person justified.</p>
<p>One more element in the New Hampshire Baptist Confession definition requires comment, namely, the statement that “we are made partakers of his holiness.” A complete survey of what the Bible has to say about sanctification is not possible here, since practically the whole of Scripture addresses this issue in one way or another. One central theme in that teaching, however, must be emphasized: “You shall be holy as I am holy” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.45">Lv 11:45</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.16">1 Pt 1:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.48">Mt 5:48</a>). According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647), by sanctification “we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God” (Question 34; see <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>). Nothing can be more crucial to our view of sanctification than this truth. The standard of holiness is complete conformity to Christ’s image (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>); anything less than that is a lowering of the scriptural standard and thus a dilution of the doctrine. The definition above, however, implies that Christ is more than our pattern: he himself provides his holiness for those united with him—he <span class="ital">is</span> our sanctification (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.30">1 Cor 1:30</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="InitialSanctification">Initial Sanctification</p>
<p class="fl">The progressive nature of our sanctification is explicit in many passages, particularly Paul’s statement that Christians are transformed “from glory to glory” into the Lord’s image (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-2">Rom 12:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.14">Phil 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.1">Heb 6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.18">2 Pt 3:18</a>). Moreover, the numerous commands found in Scripture imply that the Christian experiences growth.</p>
<p> At the same time, however, a number of expressions in Scripture reveal that sanctification is given to the believer concurrent with regeneration. For example, Paul frequently refers to Christians as “saints,” that is, “holy ones” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.7">Rom 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.1">Eph 1:1</a>; etc.); this language suggests that sanctification is already the possession of believers. In fact, Paul specifically says that the Corinthian Christians “have been sanctified” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>), and he even coordinates sanctification with washing (= regeneration?) and justification as though all three elements had taken place at the same time (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.11">6:11</a>). Perhaps more impressive is the apostle’s declaration that Christians have died to sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.2">Rom 6:2</a>). One can hardly think of a more powerful figure than death, suggesting as it does a permanent, irrevocable dissolution of the believer’s relationship with sin.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, of course, that these passages do not teach absolute perfection for every Christian upon conversion. Such an interpretation would bring us into conflict with the clear teaching of Scripture as a whole. Furthermore, one should note that the Corinthian “saints” were marked by woeful immaturity (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.1-3">1 Cor 3:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.8">6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.17-22">11:17-22</a>).</p>
<p>How, then, should these passages be interpreted? Some writers have suggested that Paul is speaking of “potential” sanctification—that is, although our relationship with sin has not been actually severed, God has given us what we need for that to take place. There is an element of truth in this formulation, but it hardly does justice, by itself, to the force of Paul’s language. Coming somewhat closer to an adequate explanation is to speak of “positional” sanctification. According to this view, Paul is speaking in judicial terms regarding our status before God. One should certainly recognize a judicial element in Paul’s discussion (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.7">Rom 6:7</a> uses the word “justified”), but if that is all that is said, then it suggests that <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">Romans 6</a> simply restates the doctrine of justification—a doubtful conclusion. Much more satisfactory is the view that Paul’s teaching contains both a judicial element and an actual, experiential reference.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ProgressiveSanctification">Progressive Sanctification</p>
<p class="h3">Historical Survey</p>
<p class="fl">Although all Christian groups recognize the need to become transformed by the renewing of the mind (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>), considerable differences are found among them regarding specific issues. The Reformers, generally speaking, held to what some call a “pessimistic” view of personal sanctification. This perspective is clearly reflected in the Westminster Confession of Faith (1647), which states that sanctification “is imperfect in this life; there abideth still some remnants of corruption in every part, whence ariseth a continual and irreconcilable war” within the believer (XIII.ii). Although the confession goes on to emphasize the overcoming power of the Spirit, some Christians believe that its basic thrust obscures the need and possibility of spiritual victory.</p>
<p>To some extent, the teachings of John Wesley (1703–91) may be viewed as a reaction to the usual Calvinistic and Lutheran formulations. Strongly influenced by the Pietistic movement of his day, Wesley paid much attention to the experiential side of Christianity and eventually formulated, though not with great consistency, the doctrine that “entire sanctification” is possible in this life. During the 19th century, interest in the possibility of perfection (not understood in an absolute sense, however) spread to many Christian circles. According to some, perfection resulted from the eradication of sin; according to others, spiritual victory was gained by counteracting the sin that remains even in the Christian’s heart. The latter approach became characteristic of the so-called Victorious Life Movement. These various “perfectionist” groups were subjected to a searching criticism by the Princeton theologian Benjamin B. Warfield (1851–1921). The debate has continued, though not as vigorously, ever since then.</p>
<p class="h3">The Agency in Sanctification</p>
<p class="fl">Much of the controversy focuses on the human role in sanctification. While all Christians agree that holiness would be impossible without God’s help, it is difficult to define precisely how that truth affects one’s own activity. In the Roman Catholic tradition so much stress has been placed on the cleansing power of baptism and on the meritorious character of good works that one may rightly question whether the significance of divine grace is not thereby ignored. At the other extreme stand some exponents of the Victorious Life Movement, whose stress on “let go and let God” (a slogan that has some value if properly used) sometimes suggests that believers remain completely passive in sanctification.</p>
<p>No passage of Scripture is more relevant to this issue than <a href="?bref=Phil.2.12-13">Philippians 2:12-13</a>, where Paul juxtaposes the command for one to work out one’s own salvation with the declaration that it is God who provides the spiritual strength necessary for the task. It may be tempting to emphasize the first part of the statement so as to ignore the fundamental significance of the second, or else to become so arrested by Paul’s stress (here and elsewhere) on divine grace that the weight of personal responsibility is overlooked. The apostle, however, appears to have deliberately and carefully preserved a fine balance between these two truths.</p>
<p>Sanctification requires discipline, concentration, and effort, as is clear by the many exhortations of Scripture, especially those where the Christian life is described with such figures as running and fighting (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.24-27">1 Cor 9:24-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.10-17">Eph 6:10-17</a>). But Christians must always resist the temptation to assume that they in effect sanctify themselves, that spiritual power comes from within them, and that they may therefore rely on their own strength. This is a difficult tension, though no more puzzling than the paradox of prayer (“Why pray when God, who knows our needs and who is all-wise and sovereign, will always do what is best anyway?”). Yet perhaps the real “secret” of holiness consists precisely in learning to keep that balance: relying thoroughly on God as the true agent in sanctification, while faithfully discharging one’s personal responsibility.</p>

<p class="h1">SANCTUARY</p>
<p class="fl">Translation of two Hebrew words, <span class="hebrew">kodesh</span> and <span class="hebrew">midkosh</span><span class="ital">,</span> both of which are derived from the verb “to be clean” and/or “to be holy.” It appears approximately 60 times in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers where the building, moving, and initial use of the tabernacle is reported. Places of revelation, sacrifice, and worship are referred to in Deuteronomy but not by the term “sanctuary.” The term appears over 60 times in Ezekiel, Daniel, and postexilic writings because of the importance the sanctuary had in the life of Israel during and after the exile.</p>
<p>“Sanctuary” refers to the place where God appeared and/or dwelt, as indicated by the presence of the ark. God’s Word was kept there and issued forth from it. There God’s people gathered for sacrifice, for hearing the covenant word, for worship and prayer, and for the celebration of the major feasts.</p>
<p>The patriarchs had places of worship (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.24-25">Gn 26:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.16-22">28:16-22</a>) but no actual sanctuary. The first reference to sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.17">Ex 15:17</a>) speaks of it as a symbol of God’s dwelling among his people and ruling over them from within it. The tabernacle, moved from place to place, was the central sanctuary until the time when Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem. It must be emphatically stressed that God’s people were to have one central sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.4-7">Dt 12:4-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.5-8">16:5-8</a>).</p>
<p>The NT refers to the OT sanctuary as a type of a foreshadowing of God’s eternal dwelling with and among his people (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.5-6">Heb 8:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1-14">9:1-14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SANHEDRIN*</p>
<p class="fl">Supreme judicial council (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “high council”) of Judaism with 71 members, located in Jerusalem. It figures prominently in the Passion narratives of the Gospels as the body that tried Jesus, and it appears again in Acts as the judicial court that investigated and persecuted the growing Christian church.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">The history of the Sanhedrin is difficult to reconstruct. Jewish tradition recorded in the Mishnah views it as originating with Moses and his council of 70, but this is doubtful (Mishnah tractate <span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 1:6; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.11.16">Nm 11:16</a>). These were probably informal gatherings of tribal elders (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1">1 Kgs 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.1">2 Kgs 23:1</a>). The likely origin of the Sanhedrin is to be found in the postexilic period, when those who reorganized Israel without a king made the ancient ruling families the basis of authority. The legislative assembly that emerged was a union of the nobility of the land and the priestly aristocracy (see <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.5">Ezr 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.16">Neh 2:16</a>). The influence of this council increased due to the relative freedom enjoyed under the Persians.</p>
<p>The advent of Hellenism in Israel in the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> affirmed this government. Hellenistic cities commonly possessed democratic assemblies and a council. Jerusalem hosted an aristocratic council that was given its appropriate Greek title, <span class="greek">Gerousia</span><span class="ital">.</span> This council is first noted by Josephus, who records the decree of Antiochus III after his seizure of Jerusalem (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.3.3). Yet even though the political climate shifted drastically, the council still remained in force. Judas Maccabeus expelled the old line of elders and installed another hereditary rulership stemming from the Hasmonean families. Thus the Gerousia continued as a council of the nobility. But in the first century <span class="era">BC</span>, as the tensions between Sadducees and Pharisees were pulling apart the fabric of Judaism, the council underwent a transformation. From the time of Alexandra (76–67 <span class="era">BC</span>), scribes of Pharisee persuasion entered the council. Thereafter, the Gerousia was a mixture: aristocratic nobility on the one hand (both lay and priestly) and the popular Pharisees on the other.</p>
<p>The Romans left the council intact but more carefully defined the limits of its jurisdiction. As Judaism lost its self-government, the council lost much legislative and political power. Rome appointed the true powers of the land. For instance, Herod the Great began his rule in severe conflict with the old aristocracy, and in the end executed most of the Sanhedrin members (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.9.4). The prefects appointed the high priests and, as a symbol of control, from <span class="era">AD</span> 6 to 36 they kept the priests’ vestments in the Antonia fortress.</p>
<p>The name Sanhedrin (Greek, <span class="greek">sunedrion</span><span class="ital">,</span> from <span class="greek">sun</span><span class="ital">,</span> “together,” and <span class="greek">hedra</span><span class="ital">,</span> “seat”) occurs for the first time in the reign of Herod the Great (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.9.3-5). This is the term used throughout the NT (22 times), along with “the elders” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.66">Lk 22:66</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.5">Acts 22:5</a>) and “gerousia” (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.21">Acts 5:21</a>). The Mishnah provides still more titles: The Great Tribunal (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 11:2), the Great Sanhedrin (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 1:6), and the Sanhedrin of the 71 (<span class="ital">Shebuoth</span> 2:2).</p>
<p>After the great war of <span class="era">AD</span> 70, when the final vestiges of Jewish autonomy were destroyed by Rome, the Sanhedrin reconvened in Jamnia. Its power, however, was only theoretical (addressing religious issues primarily), and the Romans gave it little consideration.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Character">Character</p>
<p class="fl">Little is known about the procedure for admission into the Sanhedrin, but because the council had aristocratic roots (and was not truly democratic), appointments were probably made from among the priests, leading scribes, and lay nobility. The Mishnah stipulates that the sole test of membership was rabbinic learning along with true Israelite descent (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 4:4). The council had 71 members (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 1:6) divided into the following three categories: the high priests, the elders, and the scribes.</p>
<p class="h3">The High Priests</p>
<p class="fl">Usually from Sadducean backgrounds, these were the most powerful men of the Sanhedrin. Some scholars believe that they comprised an executive council of ten wealthy and distinguished citizens, on the pattern of several Greek and Roman cities. Tiberias in Galilee, for instance, was ruled by such a board, and Josephus refers to them as a body of “the ten foremost men” (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.8.11; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>). One was the captain of the temple, who supervised temple proceedings and was commander of the temple guard (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.24-26">Acts 5:24-26</a>). Others served as treasurers who controlled the wages of priests and workers and monitored the vast amount of money coming through the temple. Income came from sacrifices and market taxes; the payroll included as many as 18,000 men during Herod’s reconstruction of the temple. There was a president of the Sanhedrin who also headed this council and was called “the high priest” (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.10.5). In the NT he is a leading figure: Caiaphas ruled in Jesus’ day (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.3">Mt 26:3</a>), and Ananias in Paul’s day (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.2">Acts 23:2</a>). In <a href="?bref=Luke.3.2">Luke 3:2</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>, Annas is termed a high priest, but his title is emeritus, since his reign ended in <span class="era">AD</span> 15.</p>
<p class="h3">The Elders</p>
<p class="fl">This was a major category and represented the priestly and financial aristocracy in Judea. Distinguished laymen, such as Joseph of Arimathea (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.43">Mk 15:43</a>), shared the conservative views of the Sadducees and gave the assembly the diversity of a modern parliament.</p>
<p class="h3">The Scribes</p>
<p class="fl">These were the most recent members of the Sanhedrin. Mostly Pharisees, they were professional lawyers trained in theology, jurisprudence, and philosophy. They were organized in guilds and often followed celebrated teachers. One famous Sanhedrin scribe, Gamaliel, appears in the NT (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.34">Acts 5:34</a>) and was the rabbinic scholar who instructed Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">22:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In Jesus’ Day</p>
<p class="fl">The domain of the Sanhedrin was formally restricted to Judea, but there was a de facto influence that affected Galilee and even Damascus (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.9.2">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.5">22:5</a>). The council was chiefly concerned to arbitrate matters of Jewish law when disagreements arose (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 11:2). In all cases, its decision was final. It prosecuted charges of blasphemy, as in the cases of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.65">Mt 26:65</a>) and Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.12-14">Acts 6:12-14</a>), and participated in criminal justice as well.</p>
<p>It is still not known if the Sanhedrin had the power of capital punishment. Philo seems to indicate that violations to the temple could be prosecuted in the Roman period (<span class="ital">Legatio to Gaius,</span> 39). This may explain the deaths of Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.58-60">Acts 7:58-60</a>) and James (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.9.1). At any rate, Gentiles caught trespassing in the temple precincts were warned about an automatic death penalty. But the NT and the Talmud disagree with this. In the trial of Jesus, the authorities are compelled to involve Pilate who alone can put Jesus to death (<a href="?bref=John.18.31">Jn 18:31</a>). According to the Talmud, the Sanhedrin lost this privilege “forty years before the destruction of the temple” (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> I 18a, 34; VII 24b).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JudicialProcedure">Judicial Procedure</p>
<p class="fl">Despite the serious irregularities of Jesus’ trial, the formal procedures of Sanhedrin law describe a court that was fair and exceedingly concerned about the miscarriage of justice. Unfortunately, the procedural notes in the Mishnah only address guidelines for lesser courts (Sanhedrins with 23 members), but it can be reasonably conjectured that similar rules applied to the Great Sanhedrin of 71. In sections four and five of the Mishnah tractate <span class="ital">Sanhedrin,</span> these guidelines are carefully set forth.</p>
<p>The Sanhedrin sat in semicircular rows so that members could view one another. Two clerks sat at either end, taking notes and recording votes. Facing the assembly sat three rows of students, who were usually disciples of leading scribes. The accused stood in the middle facing the elders. He was required to show abject humility: he was dressed in a black robe as if in mourning and wore his hair disheveled (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.9.4). After questioning, he was dismissed and deliberations were private.</p>
<p>The procedures for capital cases illustrate the concern for fairness. The defense would be heard first and then the accusations. An elder who had spoken for the defense could not then speak against the accused. Students could speak only for but never against the accused (but in noncapital cases they could do either). Members stood to vote, beginning with the youngest. Acquittal required a simple majority, but condemnation demanded a majority of two.</p>
<p>In noncapital cases, the trial was heard during the daytime and the verdict could be given at night. In capital cases, both trial and verdict were during the day and thus open to more public scrutiny. In noncapital cases, any verdict could be reached the same day. In capital cases, the verdict of guilt (which was immediately followed by execution) had to be postponed one day because its consequences were irreversible. Hence, these trials were not to be held on the eve of the Sabbath or a festival day (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 4:1).</p>
<p>The trial of Jesus as recorded in the Gospels shows many departures from the usual pattern of Sanhedrin justice. It seems clear that a miscarriage of justice was evidenced in Jesus’ arrest, interrogation, and death.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SARAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Wife of Abraham whose name was originally Sarai (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.29">Gn 11:29</a>). Her name was changed to Sarah (“princess”) when she was promised that she would bear a son and become the mother of nations and kings (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-16">17:15-16</a>). Sarah was both the wife and the half sister of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.12">20:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Sarah accompanied Abraham in his journey from Ur of the Chaldees to Haran and eventually into the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">Gn 11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.12.5">12:5</a>). She remained barren for much of her marriage. When God promised Abraham that he would make of him a great nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">12:2</a>) and that the land of Canaan would be given to his seed (v <a href="?bref=Gen.12.7">7</a>), Sarah was still barren.</p>
<p class="list-text">After 10 years had passed (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.4">Gn 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.16.16">16:16</a>) and Sarah continued without children, she gave her Egyptian slave, Hagar, to Abraham as a concubine. Hagar conceived and bore a son, Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.3-4">16:3-4</a>). God promised that a nation would come from Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.20">17:20</a>) but indicated that he was not to be the child of the promise. Sarah herself was to be the mother of this child, even though she laughed when the birth was predicted. The fulfillment of this prediction took place with the birth of Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.2-3">21:2-3</a>), when Sarah was 90 years old, 25 years after the original promise of a seed to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.5">21:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When famine forced Abraham and Sarah to journey down into Egypt shortly after their entrance into Canaan, Sarah was represented to the Egyptians as Abraham’s sister. This resulted in Sarah’s being taken into the harem of Pharaoh because of her great beauty (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.11-15">Gn 12:11-15</a>), and Abraham’s being well treated and rewarded by the Egyptians instead of being killed. God intervened to protect the marriage of Abraham and Sarah by plaguing the house of Pharaoh to force Sarah’s release. A similar tactic was followed by Abraham and Sarah on another occasion in Gerar (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">20</a>), where she was taken into the household of Abimelech the king of Gerar. Again God protected Sarah, preserved her as the mother of the promised seed, and prevented any suspicion or doubt concerning who was the father of Isaac. Significantly, Isaac was born not long after this incident (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-5">21:1-5</a>), his birth having been promised about a year earlier (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.21">17:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.10-14">18:10-14</a>). Sarah died at the age of 127 and was buried in the cave at Machpelah, which Abraham had purchased from Ephron the Hittite (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">23</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Apart from the book of Genesis, Sarah is referred to in the OT only in <a href="?bref=Isa.51.2">Isaiah 51:2</a>.

<p class="h1">SARDIS</p>
<p class="fl">Important city in the Roman province of Asia, once the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia. It lay astride great highways linking it to the coastal regions to the west and to eastern Asia Minor. It was a cultural, religious, and commercial center. Under King Croesus (c. 560–547 <span class="era">BC</span>), its wealth became legendary. In his day gold and silver coinage came into use. The geography and topography of Sardis were advantageous. The Pactolus River lay on its eastern side and flowed eventually into the Hermus River. The broad ridge of Mt Tmolus, springing from the central plateau, dominates the Hermus Valley to its north, and a series of steep spurs jut out into the plain, offering strongholds. Sardis lay on one of these. The site of Sardis proper lay 1,500 feet (457.2 meters) above the plain and assumed a position of great importance from the earliest days of the Lydian kingdom (13th century <span class="era">BC</span>), although it was occupied in earlier times; the lower city spread to the valley floor. The king lived in the great acropolis, which became a place of refuge in time of war.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientTheaterAtSardis"/>
<p>In 334 <span class="era">BC</span> the city surrendered to Alexander the Great, who left a garrison on the acropolis. Following Alexander’s death, Sardis changed hands several times. It was controlled first by Antigonus, then by the Seleucid rulers, and then by Pergamum, which had broken away from the Seleucids. When Antiochus III (231–187 <span class="era">BC</span>) sought to restore the city to his rule, the lower city was burned (216 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the citadel entered (214 <span class="era">BC</span>). After the defeat of Antiochus III by Pergamum and the Romans, Sardis was placed under Pergamum’s jurisdiction until 133 <span class="era">BC</span>. Later it became a Roman administrative center and, although enjoying considerable prosperity during the first three centuries <span class="era">AD</span>, it never again held the prominence of earlier centuries. It was overlooked in <span class="era">AD</span> 26 when the cities of Asia Minor vied with one another for the honor of building a second temple for the Caesar cult. A great earthquake destroyed the city in <span class="era">AD</span> 17, and Emperor Tiberius assisted in its rebuilding on the valley floor.</p>
<p>Christianity took root here before the end of the first century and later included a bishopric. The NT letter to “the angel of the church in Sardis” (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.11">Rv 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>) gives insight into the condition of the church at that time. After the Arab invasion of <span class="era">AD</span> 716, the city declined. Today the small village of Sart preserves its name.</p>
<p>Extensive excavations in recent years have identified many Roman public buildings: a theater, a temple of Artemis, a gymnasium, and an impressive late-Jewish synagogue, suggesting that it became an important center for the Jewish Diaspora.</p>

  <title>Sargon</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SARGON</p>
<p class="fl">Assyrian monarch from 722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>, whose military campaigns are historically well documented. Excavations have revealed his palace at what was probably Nineveh as well as an incomplete palace at Khorsabad. Sargon II bore the name of an illustrious conqueror who lived and fought some 1,500 years earlier (Sargon I of Agade). His true identity has not been easily discerned. Previous generations, thinking that his name was an “alias,” incorrectly identified him as Shalmaneser V (727–722 <span class="era">BC</span>), Sennacherib (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>), or Esar-haddon (699–681 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>The only place in the Bible where Sargon is specifically mentioned is <a href="?bref=Isa.20.1">Isaiah 20:1</a>. Despite warnings of the prophet Isaiah against placing any trust in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.9">Is 10:9</a>), Judah was moving contrary to her best interests by considering just such an alliance. But in 713 <span class="era">BC</span> the Philistine city of Ashdod rebelled against Assyria, thereby instigating a campaign by the forces of Sargon against this strategically important metropolis. A man named Yamani sought to secure support from Egypt, Ethiopia, and even Judah in mounting an effective coalition against the might of Sargon. However, in 711 <span class="era">BC</span> Ashdod was subjugated by Sargon’s army under his delegated official, “the Tartan” (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.1">Is 20:1</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>Sargon finished the task of conquering Samaria, begun by his predecessor, Shalmaneser V. Apparently, Shalmaneser V had besieged the northern kingdom of Israel for three years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-6">2 Kgs 17:5-6</a>) and had virtually completed that campaign when he died. While other military victories earmark the public life of Sargon, many of his battles were indecisive. A large part of his reign was spent suppressing rebellions and handling major domestic problems. He was finally killed on the battlefield in a remote area known as Tabal. Sargon’s son, Sennacherib, succeeded him in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

  <title>Satan</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SATAN</p>
<p class="fl">Spirit being who opposes God and seeks to frustrate his plans and lead his people into rebellion.</p>
<p>Satan is seldom mentioned in the OT. He is pictured as an angel who acts as the heavenly prosecutor (<a href="?bref=Job.1.6-12">Jb 1:6-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.1-7">2:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.1-2">Zec 3:1-2</a>). As such, he is called “the satan” or “the accuser,” and there is nothing in the context to indicate that the angel is evil. It is not until the late OT period that Satan appears as a tempter: in <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, the story of <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1">2 Samuel 24:1</a> is retold with Satan (used for the first time as a proper name) substituted for God and pictured as an evil figure. The OT, then, has no developed doctrine of Satan but contains the raw material from which the later doctrine came. (Some people see Lucifer of <a href="?bref=Isa.14.12">Is 14:12</a> as a reference to Satan, but the context is clearly referring to the king of Babylon; it is therefore unlikely that any reference to Satan was intended.)</p>
<p>The Jews further developed the idea of Satan during the intertestamental period, also calling him Belial, Mastema, and Sammael. Three differing conceptions appear. First, the Satan of the OT reappears in the roles of tempting people, of accusing them in heaven before God, and of hindering God’s saving plan (Jubilees 11:5; 17:16; Assumption of Moses 17; 1 Enoch 40:7). Second, the Dead Sea Scrolls present Satan (Belial) as the leader of the evil forces and attacker of the righteous. This development was probably influenced by the evil god of Zoroastrian religion. But unlike the Zoroastrian idea, the scrolls never present two gods but rather one God who has created both Belial and the Prince of Light (who is sure to win in the end, for God is with him). Third, in this literature Satan is often identified with OT stories from which his name was originally absent: he lusted after Eve and therefore caused the fall (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.2.24">Wisd of Sol 2:24</a>), he controls the angels who fell in <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Genesis 6:1-4</a> (Jubilees 10:5-8; 19:28), or he is a fallen angel himself (2 Enoch 29:4).</p>
<p>The NT has a developed portrayal of Satan, and he comes with a whole list of names: Satan (Hebrew for “accuser”), devil (the Greek translation of Satan), Belial, Beelzebul, the Adversary, the Dragon, the Enemy, the Serpent, the Tester, and the Wicked One. Satan is pictured as the ruler of a host of angels (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>) and the controller of the world (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.6">Lk 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.18">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4">2 Cor 4:4</a>), who especially governs all who are not Christians (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.15">Mk 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.44">Jn 8:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.10">Acts 13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.13">Col 1:13</a>). He is opposed to God and seeks to alienate all people from God; therefore, he is an especially dangerous foe of Christians (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.33">Lk 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.5">1 Cor 7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8">1 Pt 5:8</a>), who must steadfastly resist him and see through his cunning (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.11">2 Cor 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.11">Eph 6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.7">Jas 4:7</a>). Satan works his evil will by tempting persons (<a href="?bref=John.13.2">Jn 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.3">Acts 5:3</a>), by hindering God’s workers (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.18">1 Thes 2:18</a>), by accusing Christians before God (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.10">Rv 12:10</a>), and by controlling the evil persons who resist the gospel (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.9">2 Thes 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.9,13">Rv 2:9, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.2">13:2</a>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, the NT teaches us that this being, who has been evil from the beginning (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.8">1 Jn 3:8</a>), has now been bound and cast out of heaven through the ministry of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.18">Lk 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-18">Rv 12</a>). While Satan is still a dangerous enemy, Jesus himself prays for us and has given us the powerful weapons of prayer, faith, and the efficacy of his blood. Satan can still cause physical illness when allowed by God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.7">2 Cor 12:7</a>), and persons can be delivered over to him for punishment (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.20">1 Tm 1:20</a>). Satan will always be under God’s control, who will eventually destroy him (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.20">Rom 16:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10">Rv 20:10</a>).</p>

  <title>Saul</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SAUL</p>
<p class="fl">Name meaning “asked,” with the implication being “asked <span class="ital">of God.”</span> A name with a usage extending far back into prebiblical times, it is attested in third-millennium texts from Tell Mardikh in Syria (ancient Ebla) and appears also to have been used in the second millennium in the city of Ugarit on the coast of Syria.</p>
<p>In addition to the conventional spelling, it is sometimes spelled Shaul in older English versions. Apart from King Saul, the most famous bearer of the name, one other person called Saul (Shaul) is referred to in the OT, though little is known about him (<span class="ital">see</span> Shaul).</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Saul, king of Edom, is mentioned in an ancient list of kings who ruled Edom (in Transjordan) in pre-Israelite times (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.37-38">Gn 36:37-38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.48-49">1 Chr 1:48-49</a>). He is described as coming from “Rehoboth on the river,” the “river” perhaps referring to a small river in the vicinity of Edom.</p>
<p class="list">2. Saul, the first king of Israel, is the best known and documented person with his name in the OT. He was a member of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the smallest of the Israelite tribes, whose territory was located just north of the Canaanite city of Jerusalem. His father was Kish, son of Abiel. Saul was born in Gibeah, a small town just a few miles north of Jerusalem in the hill country, and apart from his travels and military expeditions, Gibeah was Saul’s hometown for his entire life. He was a married man with one wife, Ahinoam, and five children—three sons and two daughters (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.49-50">1 Sm 14:49-50</a>). His best-known son, Jonathan, later served him in a senior military capacity; three of Saul’s sons died with him in battle (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.2">31:2</a>). Of his two daughters, the best-known is Michal, the younger daughter, who married David.</p>
<p class="h2-list">Saul the Soldier</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">Saul lived during a critical period in the history of the Israelite tribes. Though the dates cannot be determined with any certainty, he lived during the latter half of the 11th century <span class="era">BC</span> and probably ruled as king from about 1020 to 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Before he became king, the Israelite tribes were on the verge of military collapse. The Philistines, a powerful military people, had settled along the Mediterranean coast; they were well established on the coast and planned to move eastward and take control of Palestine as a whole. In order to do this, they first had to eliminate the Israelites, who were settled in the hill country on the west of the Jordan and also in Transjordan. The absence of any strong and permanent military authority among the Israelites meant that the Philistines were a grave military threat to the continued existence of Israel.</p>
<p class="list-text">The immediate crisis, which was to contribute to Saul’s rise to power, was a crushing defeat of the Israelite army by the Philistines at Ebenezer, in the vicinity of Aphek (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-22">1 Sm 4:1ff</a>). The victory gave the Philistines more or less complete control of Israelite territories lying to the west of the Jordan; they attempted to maintain that control by establishing military garrisons throughout the country they had captured. Israel, weakened by the Philistine defeat, became vulnerable to enemies on other borders. The nation of Ammon, situated to the east of the Israelites’ land in Transjordan, attacked and laid siege to the town of Jabesh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1">11:1</a>). Saul, summoning an army of volunteers, delivered the inhabitants of Jabesh and defeated the Ammonites (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.11">11</a>). It was after this event that Saul became king. He had already been anointed a prince or leader among the people by Samuel; after his military success at Jabesh, he assumed the office formally at the sanctuary in Gilgal (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.15">15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The defeat of the Ammonites provided a significant boost to Israelite morale, but it did not change the military crisis and threat posed by the Philistines. Indeed, the location of Saul’s appointment to kingship is significant. Gilgal, in the Jordan Valley near Jericho, was chosen partly because the earlier shrine of Shiloh was held by the Philistines. Gilgal was in one of the few areas remaining outside Philistine control. Hence, if Saul’s kingship was to mean anything, he had to address the Philistine problem immediately; if he did not, there would be no Israel to rule.</p>
<p class="list-text">Saul acted promptly. Although the precise historical details are difficult to reconstruct, a general view of Saul’s anti-Philistine campaign is provided in the biblical text. He attacked garrisons at Gibeah and, later, at Micmash, about four miles (6.4 kilometers) northeast of Gibeah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.16-23">1 Sm 13:16ff</a>.). He had great success at Micmash, thanks in part to the military aid of his son Jonathan. The Philistines were routed and retreated from that portion of the hill country (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.15-23">14:15-23</a>). Saul established his military base in his hometown, Gibeah, and built a citadel there.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the years that followed this initial campaign against the Philistines, Saul was constantly engaged in other military activities. He continued to fight with enemies on his eastern borders, particularly Ammon and Moab, to the east of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sm 14:47</a>). He engaged in a major campaign on the southern border with the old enemies of the Israelites, the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.7">15:7</a>); in this, too, he was successful. And throughout all this, he had to keep constant watch on Philistine activity on his western border.</p>
<p class="list-text">Saul was faced with an extraordinarily difficult task as military commander. His home ground had the advantage of being reasonably easy to protect, for most of it was mountainous countryside. But he was surrounded on all four sides by enemies who wanted his land, he had inadequate weapons (Philistines controlled the supply of iron), he had no large standing army, he had inadequate communication systems, and he did not have the wholehearted support of all the Israelites. For several years he was relatively successful against almost impossible odds, but eventually his military genius failed.</p>
<p class="list-text">The Philistines assembled a large army in the vicinity of Aphek (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1">1 Sm 29:1</a>), but instead of attacking Saul’s mountain territory directly, the army moved northward and then began to penetrate Israelite territory at a weak point in the vicinity of Jezreel (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.29.11">11</a>). Saul attempted to gather an adequate military force to meet the Philistine threat, but he was unable to do so. With inadequate preparation and insufficient forces, he prepared for battle at Mt Gilboa (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1">31:1</a>); he should never have entered that battle, for it could not have been won. His sons were killed on the battlefield, and Saul, rather than fall into the hands of the Philistines, committed suicide (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.2-6">2-6</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">From a military perspective, Saul had become king at a time of crisis; he had averted disaster and gained some respite for his country. But the battle in which he died was a disaster for Israel; the country he left behind after his death was in worse straits than it had been on his assumption of power.</p>
<p class="h2-list">Saul the King</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">If Saul had a difficult task as Israel’s military commander, he had an even more difficult task as Israel’s king. Before Saul’s time, there had been no king in Israel. The absence of any form of monarchy in Israel was largely a religious matter. God was the one and only true King of Israel; he was the one who reigned (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.18">Ex 15:18</a>). Consequently, although there had been single, powerful rulers in Israel’s earlier history (Moses, Joshua, and certain judges), nobody had assumed the title or office of king, for it was thought that that would undermine the central position of God as King. However, provision had been made for the rise of kingship in the law (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.14-20">Dt 19:14-20</a>); for more on kingship in Israel, <span class="ital">see</span> King, Kingship. </p>
<p class="list-text">It was sheer necessity that brought a monarchy to Israel, a necessity created by the constant military threat of the Philistines. A brief external threat could have been met by a temporary ruler, a judge. But a permanent and serious threat to Israel’s existence could not be thwarted by such temporary measures. If Israel was to survive as a nation (and it very nearly did not), it needed a central military government with recognized authority over the various tribes that constituted the nation of Israel. Thus the kingdom was established and Saul became the first king, facing incredible difficulties.</p>
<p class="list-text">Since there had never been a kingdom before in Israel, there were no precedents. What were his responsibilities? Primarily, they were military, for that was why the monarchy had been established. In this area, Saul was successful in the early years of his reign. But apart from his military responsibilities, King Saul faced an enormously difficult task. Given the nature of Hebrew theology, it was inevitable that many Israelites were opposed to the idea of kingship from the beginning. Indeed, Samuel, who was instrumental in the initial anointing of Saul and then in the formal coronation, appears to have been ambiguous in his attitudes toward the kingship (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.6">1 Sm 8:6</a>), and later toward Saul himself (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.23">15:23</a>). Furthermore, nobody had specified precisely what it was that the leader could do. He was a soldier—that much was clear. But did he also have religious responsibilities? Though the judgment of history upon Saul is often harsh, it is wise to recall the difficulty of the task he undertook. The military problems alone would have been more than sufficient for most great men; Saul also had to fashion the new role as king. In practical matters, Saul’s leadership was modest and praiseworthy. He sought none of the pomp and splendor of many Eastern kings. He had a small court, located in his military stronghold of Gibeah; there is little evidence that it was characterized by great wealth. For practical purposes, he had no standing army; he had only a few men close to him, in particular his son Jonathan and his general Abner. He also sought out young men of promise, like David. Saul’s court was rustic and feudal in comparison to the later splendor of David and Solomon. But Saul, as national leader, ran into difficulties with Samuel, who had appointed him and had influenced Israel prior to his kingship. While the responsibility for the trouble may lie primarily with Saul, Samuel himself does not appear to have been particularly supportive and helpful. On one occasion, Saul was roundly criticized and condemned by Samuel for assuming the priestly role of offering sacrifices in the absence of Samuel at Gilgal (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.8-15">1 Sm 13:8-15</a>). The judgment was no doubt deserved, though one can perceive Saul’s dilemma. Did the king have a priestly role or not? This issue had not been made clear. Furthermore, Saul was at the time in a state of crisis; he had waited seven days for Samuel to turn up, and as each day passed, his army was reduced by deserters. So Saul acted. Perhaps he may not be excused, but his actions may easily be understood, and the incident itself is indicative of the difficulty of being a nation’s first king. Again, after the Amalekite war, Saul was subject to divine condemnation through Samuel.</p>
<p class="list-text">Saul was Israel’s first king but not its greatest. Yet no criticism of Saul’s leadership should be so harsh as to ignore his strengths. He faced extraordinary difficulties and for a while was successful. Few other men could have done what he did. Ultimately, he died in failure, yet his achievements might have been better remembered if he had been succeeded by any other leader than David. David’s gifts and competence were so magnificent and unusual that Saul’s modest achievements paled and only his failures are remembered.</p>
<p class="h2-list">Saul the Man</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">The writers of the OT have presented the story of Saul in a fascinating manner. While some OT characters remain shadowy figures, Saul stands out, with all his strengths and weaknesses, as a fully human figure. He was, in many ways, a great man, but there were also flaws in his personality that emerged more and more in the later years of his life. Born of a wealthy father, Saul is described as being tall and handsome (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1-2">1 Sm 9:1-2</a>). He was a man of immense courage, and part of his military success was rooted in his fearlessness. In his early years as king, Saul is portrayed as a man whose basic instincts were generous; he was kind and loyal to his friends and did not easily carry a grudge or hatred toward those who opposed him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.12-13">11:12-13</a>). But the real strength of Saul, in his early days, was in his relationship to God. For all his natural gifts and abilities, Saul became king as a result of divine appointment (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">10:1</a>) and because the “Spirit of the Lord” came upon him (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.6">6</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In his later life, a change came over Saul that transformed him into a tragic, pitiable person. The many incidents in Saul’s relationship to the young David provide insight into the transformation. Once a friend, then perceived as an enemy, David became the object of Saul’s unfounded suspicions and irrational jealousy. Saul’s periods of sanity became punctuated by periods of depression and paranoia. The paranoia affected his rational thought. Instead of warring against the invading Philistines, his energy was diverted toward the pursuit of David. The biblical writers describe this change as “the departure of the Spirit of God from Saul” and “an evil spirit from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> tormenting him” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14">1 Sm 16:14</a>). Many modern writers have interpreted this as the onset of a form of mental illness, perhaps manic-depression, the alternation between active and lucid periods, followed by intense depression and paranoia. But there is a certain danger in psychoanalyzing the figures of ancient history, principally because the literary sources are rarely adequate to the task. The biblical writers indicated a theological basis for the change in Saul: the Spirit of God had departed from him. From a simple human perspective, the man was not equal to the enormity of the task before him. Overcome by its complexity, and lagging in the faith of the one who appointed him to such awesome responsibility, Saul ended his days in tragedy.</p>

  <title>Savior</title>

<p class="h1">SAVIOR</p>
<p class="fl">One who delivers or rescues. The term “savior” is most frequently applied to God and Jesus Christ in the Bible. The understanding of Jesus as Savior is a key truth in appropriating the biblical message. Versions of the English Bible use “savior” in the OT to translate various forms of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">yasha‘</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to save,” “to deliver,” or “to rescue.” Most frequently it is used to translate the participle of the verb, <span class="hebrew">moshia‘</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “the one who saves.” Used in this way, “savior” is found 13 or 14 times in the OT, depending upon the version.</p>
<p>The basic understanding of the term “savior” as one who delivers or rescues is illustrated in <a href="?bref=Deut.22.27">Deuteronomy 22:27</a>, where the law anticipated a situation when no deliverer was near in time of need. <span class="hebrew">Moshia‘</span> is also used for individuals, as both Othniel and Ehud are called “deliverers” (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.9,15">Jgs 3:9, 15</a>) and <a href="?bref=Neh.9.27">Nehemiah 9:27</a> speaks of the judges collectively as deliverers sent by God. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.5">Second Kings 13:5</a> reports that the Lord gave Israel a savior in reference to their deliverance from the Arameans. Some have identified this deliverer with King Jeroboam II of Judah; others with a foreign king, quite often Zakir of Hamath. But the text does not clearly indicate who this savior might have been. The point of the text is that God sent this deliverer for his people. The majority of references in the OT refer to God himself as Israel’s savior, and even when other individuals are so termed, it is clearly stated that God sent them or raised them up. Israel understood that God was their savior and declared this in songs of praise (<a href="?bref=Ps.17.7">Pss 17:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1-12">106:1-12</a>) and cries for help (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.8">Jer 14:8</a>). David said this of God: “He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.3">2 Sm 22:3</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Quite often the psalmists refer to the Lord as their “help” or “salvation” (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.9">Pss 27:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.38.22">38:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.42.5,11">42:5, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.65.5">65:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.19">68:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.79.9">79:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.85.4">85:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.26">89:26</a>; all rendered “Savior” by the <span class="sc">niv</span>). The exodus was undoubtedly the greatest example of deliverance for Israel and undergirded their knowledge of God as the savior. The psalmist, in remembrance of Israel’s sin of making a golden calf, proclaims, “They forgot God, their savior, who had done such great things in Egypt” (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.21">Ps 106:21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.63.11">Is 63:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.4-6">Hos 13:4-6</a>). In Isaiah, where “savior” is a frequent title for God, the term is used to emphasize his uniqueness. God alone is seen as savior, in contrast to foreign gods and idols: “I, even I, am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and apart from me there is no savior. I have revealed and saved and proclaimed—I, and not some foreign god among you” (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.11-12">Is 43:11-12</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Isaiah further states that God would show himself as savior by the future blessing and restoration of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.26">49:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.16">60:16</a>). The designation “savior” is not directly applied to the Messiah in the OT, but a passage like <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zechariah 9:9</a> indicates that God’s Anointed One would be a deliverer. Several apocryphal books use the term “savior” for God, some in lofty titles like “everlasting Savior” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.4.22">Bar 4:22</a>) or “the eternal Savior of Israel” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=3Macc.7.16">3 Macc 7:16</a>). This later usage also illustrates the idea of God as the one who is able to save Israel.</p>

<p>The Greek literature uses <span class="greek">soter</span> (“savior,” “deliverer” from the verb <span class="greek">sozo</span> “to save,” “to rescue”) for both gods and humans. For example, at one point Herodotus refers to the Athenians as the “saviors” of Greece (<span class="ital">Persian Wars</span> 7.139.5). In the Septuagint <span class="greek">soter</span> (“savior”) is used to render various forms of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">yasha‘</span> (“to save”). <span class="greek">Soter</span> occurs 24 times in the NT and is exclusively applied to God and Jesus Christ (to God 8 times and to Christ 16 times). Out of the 24 NT occurrences of <span class="greek">soter</span><span class="ital">,</span> ten are in the Letters and five in 2 Peter. Dependence upon the OT can be seen in <a href="?bref=Luke.1.47">Luke 1:47</a>, where Mary praises God as Savior in her hymn of praise. Jesus’ name (Greek for Joshua) means “the Lord is salvation” and was given in anticipation of his function as the Savior (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>). As the Savior, Jesus completes God’s plan for a promised deliverer (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.23">Acts 13:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.4">Ti 3:4</a>), provides redemption for humanity (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.13-14">Ti 2:13-14</a>), and is the hope of the believer (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.20-21">Phil 3:20-21</a>). Inherent in the term “savior” is the concept of one who saves or delivers from danger to a position of safety. Jesus has delivered the believer from sin and death into immortality and life (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.10">2 Tm 1:10</a>). While Jesus never refers to himself as Savior (<span class="greek">soter</span>), he is announced as such by the angels at his birth (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.11">Lk 2:11</a>), confessed as such by those who heard his words (<a href="?bref=John.4.42">Jn 4:42</a>), and proclaimed as Savior by the early church (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.31">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.23">13:23</a>). Salvation is central to the mission of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.10">Lk 19:10</a>). Paul teaches that Christ is the Savior of the church in the present (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.23">Eph 5:23</a>) and future (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.20">Phil 3:20</a>).</p>
<p>Savior, as a title, is applied to God in the Pastoral Epistles and clearly represents God as Savior of all persons (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.3">1 Tm 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.10">4:10</a>). The Pastorals also clearly designate Jesus as Savior (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.10">2 Tm 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.6">Ti 3:6</a>), in some instances also declaring that he is God the Savior (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.13">Ti 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.4-6">3:4-6</a>). Savior is used as a title for Jesus Christ throughout 2 Peter (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.20">2 Pt 2:20</a>). John, in his first letter, uses it to describe Jesus as the Savior sent by the Father to save the world (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.14">1 Jn 4:14</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Reference in early OT times to those employed for their ability to transcribe information. After the exile, scribes were a class of scholars who taught, copied, and interpreted the Jewish law for the people. They appear in the Gospels primarily as opponents of Jesus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ScribesinPreexilicTimes">Scribes in Preexilic Times</p>
<p class="fl">The ability to read and write was not widespread in ancient Israel, and professional secretaries were needed in the various aspects of public life. This appears to be the earliest biblical notion of the term “scribe” and has no particular religious connotation. Scribes were employed to keep accounts or transcribe legal information (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.12">Jer 32:12</a>), military data (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.11">2 Chr 26:11</a>), other public documents (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.14">Jgs 8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.1">Is 50:1</a>), or personal correspondence (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.18">Jer 36:18</a>). These secretaries were essential to royal administrations, and there is frequent mention of a chief scribe who functioned as a court recorder (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.3">1 Kgs 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.11">2 Chr 24:11</a>), adviser (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.16-17">2 Sm 8:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.18">2 Kgs 18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.12">22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.32">1 Chr 27:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.3">Is 36:3</a>), and financial overseer (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.3-4">2 Kgs 22:3-4</a>). Secretaries or scribes were associated with the priesthood as well, serving as recorders for temple affairs (<a href="?bref=1Chr.24.6">1 Chr 24:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.13-15">2 Chr 34:13-15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ScribesinPostexilicTimes">Scribes in Postexilic Times</p>
<p class="fl">With the restoration of Judaism under Ezra and Nehemiah, the term “scribe” begins to be associated more narrowly with those who gathered together, studied, and interpreted the Torah (Jewish law). They became, in essence, a separate profession of teachers (although unpaid), able to preserve accurately the law of Moses and interpret it to meet conditions in postexilic times. In this initial period, Ezra himself appears as the ideal “scribe who studied and taught the commands and laws of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> to Israel” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.11">Ezr 7:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In Ecclesiasticus, the scribe is portrayed as one who, because of his diligent study of the Law, the Prophets, and Writings (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.38.24-34">Ecclus 38:24ff</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.39.1">39:1</a>), is able to penetrate the hidden meanings of texts (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.39.2-3">39:2-3</a>) and thus is able to serve as judge and counsel for the affairs of the people and state (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.38.33">38:33</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.39.4-8">39:4-8</a>). Because of his invaluable place in a society governed by the Torah, the scribe is worthy of praise and veneration throughout succeeding generations (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.39.9">39:9</a>). By the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the scribes were a fairly distinct class in Jewish society. They appear as such during the Maccabean wars, acting as a negotiating body with the rival Syrians (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.12">1 Macc 7:12</a>). It is also significant that, from this time forward, the history of the scribe in Jewish life is closely linked with the rise of the Pharisees. Although there were apparently some scribes affiliated with the rival Sadducean party, the party of the Pharisees, with its absolute devotion to the law (including the oral law), became the primary religiopolitical affiliation for the scribes (see the close connection in the NT: <a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">Mt 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.38">12:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.1">15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.5">Mk 7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.7">Lk 6:7</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TrainingandStatus">Training and Status</p>
<p class="fl">The training of scribes initially occurred within priestly family-based guilds that guaranteed the regulation and perpetuation of this position (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.55">1 Chr 2:55</a>). Later, scribal training in the law became open to members of all classes, with the eventual result, by Jesus’ time, of scribes from nonpriestly families being far more numerous and influential. Training in the law began at an early age under the personal supervision of a teacher (rabbi), who gave instructions in all matters pertaining to the law and its interpretation for present needs. Because the written law of Moses could not possibly speak directly to conditions in postexilic times, the oral interpretation and application of the written law to meet such current needs was a significant contribution by the scribes. Such oral law promulgated by them was regarded as equal to the written law and equally binding for those desiring to please God (see <a href="?bref=Mark.7.6-13">Mk 7:6-13</a>). This important function, lying at the heart of Jewish life, accounts for the participation of the scribes in the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin, in order to make legal decisions in keeping with the law, obviously needed the presence of those most knowledgeable about the minutest details of the Torah and the principles governing its application to new circumstances. The scribes, consequently, were the only members outside the aristocratic high priests and elders to be represented in this Jewish supreme court (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.57">Mt 26:57</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.43,53">Mk 14:43, 53</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.66">Lk 22:66</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.9">Acts 23:9</a>). Being the authoritative instructors of the law both within the temple (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.46">Lk 2:46</a>) and within the various synagogues of Judea and Galilee (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.17">5:17</a>), as well as prominent members of the Sanhedrin, the scribes were greatly respected within the Jewish community. They wore special robes (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.38">Mk 12:38</a>) with memorial fringes at the bottom and phylacteries, or “prayer boxes,” hanging from the arms (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Mt 23:5</a>). Such attire made their presence obvious and occasioned the rising or bowing of the common people when they passed (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.38">Mk 12:38</a>). They were addressed with respect as “rabbi” or “master” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.7">Mt 23:7</a>) and were given the place of honor at worship as well as at social affairs (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.2">Mt 23:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.39">Mk 12:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.46">Lk 20:46</a>). Indeed, the high regard the Jews held for their scribes is testified by the fact that such teachers of the law were buried alongside the tombs of the patriarchs and prophets.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheScribesinJesusDay">The Scribes in Jesus’ Day</p>
<p class="fl">The scribes appear predominantly in the ministry of Jesus as those concerned with the circumspectness of legal observance. Luke refers to the scribes as “lawyers,” thereby describing their chief function as interpreters of the Jewish law in a way that communicated to his gentile audience. It is often found, therefore, that the scribes were critical members of Jesus’ audience, accusing him of violating the law on numerous occasions: in forgiving sins (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.1-3">Mt 9:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.17-26">Lk 5:17-26</a>), in breaking their notion of Sabbath observance through work (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.1-2">Lk 6:1-2</a>) and healing (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.6.6-11">6-11</a>), in not following their accepted ceremonial washings (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.2-5">Mk 7:2-5</a>), and in ignoring their practice of fasting (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.33-39">Lk 5:33-39</a>). Not surprisingly, they especially disapproved of Jesus’ practice of mingling with the unclean and outcasts of Jewish society (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.16-17">Mk 2:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.1-2">Lk 15:1-2</a>). In a similar light, they are not unfrequently found presenting questions concerning the law for the purpose of tricking Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.5">Mk 7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.28,35">12:28, 35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.53">Lk 11:53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.3-4">Jn 8:3-4</a>). In a similar fashion, they demanded that Jesus make his identity clear (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.38">Mt 12:38</a>) and reveal the source of his authority to perform miracles (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.22">Mk 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.1-4">Lk 20:1-4</a>). Although there is evidence that a minority of the scribes accepted Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.19">Mt 8:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.52">13:52</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.32">Mk 12:32</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.1-2">Jn 3:1-2</a>), their primary attitude toward Jesus was one of hostility. As previously suggested, this was partly due to Jesus’ differing expression of fidelity to the Mosaic law and his openness toward the outcasts. It was also partly due to the rising popularity of Jesus among the people, which posed a threat to their own authority (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.29">Mt 7:29</a>) and to the safety of the city (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.15">Mt 21:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.18">Mk 11:18</a>). Certainly, another major contributing factor of their opposition to Jesus was his exposure of their hypocrisy and corruption. In his rebukes of the scribes and the Pharisees, Jesus openly accused them of catering to public approval (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5-7">Mt 23:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.38-39">Mk 12:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.43">Lk 11:43</a>). While appearing to be outwardly correct and holy, they were inwardly corrupt (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.25-28">Mt 23:25-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.39-41">Lk 11:39-41</a>). Jesus also attacked the principle of oral law taught by the scribes, which they demanded that the people follow. Jesus charged that the oral law was a “heavy burden” that the scribes themselves did not even bother to follow (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.2-4,13-22">Mt 23:2-4, 13-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.46">Lk 11:46</a>). While emphasizing the minor points of the law, the scribes were also guilty of ignoring the weightier concerns of justice, mercy, and faith (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.23-24">Mt 23:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.40">Mk 12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.42">Lk 11:42</a>). Contrary to being the descendants of the prophets, as the scribes held themselves to be, the scribes (Jesus claimed) would have killed the prophets if they had lived in their day (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.29-36">Mt 23:29-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.9-19">Lk 20:9-19</a>).</p>
<p>It is not surprising to find, therefore, the scribes anxious to get rid of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.1">Mk 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.53">Lk 11:53</a>). His more flexible interpretation of the law posed a clear threat to their position and authority within the community. The scribes joined forces with their normal opponents (the high priesthood) to engineer Jesus’ arrest (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.43">Mk 14:43</a>). When Jesus appeared before them and the rest of the Sanhedrin, they worked with the other leaders to construct a case against him worthy of death (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.57-66">Mt 26:57-66</a>). When taking Jesus before Herod, they stood by and shouted their accusations with the others (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.10">Lk 23:10</a>). Finally, they participated with other members of the Sanhedrin in mocking Jesus on the cross, demanding that Jesus save himself by coming down from the cross (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.41-43">Mt 27:41-43</a>). Prior to the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the scribes continued with the other elements of the Sanhedrin to oppose the early Christian church, and they brought about Stephen’s martyrdom (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.12-14">Acts 6:12-14</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SEA</p>
<p class="fl">A great body of salty water covering much of the earth.</p>
<p>The seas are mentioned in the very beginning of the Bible. In <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-2">Genesis 1:1-2</a> we read that in the beginning all was shapeless, empty, and dark, “and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters.” Then God spoke and out of the chaos came order. Thus the voice of the Lord is powerful over all the waters of chaos. <a href="?bref=Ps.29.1-11">Psalm 29</a> celebrates this. From the account of the Creation in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a>, two things stand out: (1) that the sea, like everything else in earth and heaven, was created by God; and (2) that by the word of God division was made between sea and land. These two facts are amplified in the Bible in a number of ways. <a href="?bref=Ps.33.7">Psalm 33:7</a> speaks of how “He made the oceans, pouring them into his vast reservoirs.” Eloquently, God’s ordaining of the limits of sea and land is expressed in the words of the Lord to Job: “Who shut in the sea with doors, when it burst forth from the womb; . . . and prescribed bounds for it, and set bars and doors, and said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed’?” (<a href="?bref=Job.38.8-11">Jb 38:8-11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>God’s control over the waters of the sea is described when the Bible says that God “trampled the waves of the sea” (<a href="?bref=Job.9.8">Job 9:8</a>). So in his life on earth, Jesus, the God-man, walked on the sea (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.48">Mk 6:48</a>). He also stilled the storm, so that the disciples in awe and wonder asked, “Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?” (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.41">Mk 4:41</a>).</p>
<p>The Hebrew people had a healthy respect for the sea and its power. Perhaps because of the lack of good natural harbors, and because they did not control the coastline for much of their history, they were not a seafaring people like the Phoenicians. It is only in the time of Solomon that we read of their having a fleet of their own (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26">1 Kgs 9:26</a>). The restless sea was to them a picture of the wicked (<a href="?bref=Isa.57.20">Is 57:20</a>). “Breakers rolling upon a beach” (<a href="?bref=Isa.17.13">Is 17:13</a>) or “the roaring of the sea” (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.30">5:30</a>) made them think of forces able to do incalculable harm to men. In <a href="?bref=Dan.7.3">Daniel 7:3</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1">Revelation 13:1</a>, powers hostile to God are pictured as beasts coming up out of the sea.</p>
<p>Yet, as we have seen, God controls the seas. He is able to rescue those who trust in him “out of many waters” (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.16">Ps 18:16</a>). He is able to protect those who go out into the seas (<a href="?bref=Ps.107.23-31">107:23-31</a>). It was always remembered that God had made a way in the sea for his people to pass when they came out of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.19">Ex 15:19</a>). Psalmists (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.13">Pss 74:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.77.16">77:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.13">78:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.9">106:9</a>) and prophets alike (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.43.16-17">Is 43:16-17</a>) recalled this. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=DeadSea_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Dead Sea</a>; <a href="?item=MediterraneanSea_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Mediterranean Sea</a>; <a href="?item=RedSea_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Red Sea</a>; <a href="?item=SeaofGalilee_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Sea of Galilee</a>.</p>

  <title>Sea of Galilee</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SEA OF GALILEE</p>
<p class="fl">A large body of water in Palestine. It has had many names in its history. In the OT the Sea of Galilee was known as the Sea of Chinnereth or Kinnereth (<a href="?bref=Num.34.11">Nm 34:11</a>), named for the town (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.35">Jos 19:35</a>), or as Chinneroth (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">12:3</a>). Later, the name was changed to Lake of Gennesaret because the city of Gennesaret was located on the site of Chinnereth or Tell Ureime (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1">Lk 5:1</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.67">1 Macc 11:67</a>). The most familiar name—the Sea of Galilee—was due to its connection with the province of Galilee to the west (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18">Mt 4:18</a>). It derived the name Sea of Tiberias (<a href="?bref=John.6.1,23">Jn 6:1, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.1">21:1</a>) from the town of Tiberias on its southwestern shore. About <span class="era">AD</span> 26 Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, built the town near the warm springs of Hamath by the sea and named it for the emperor. In the Gospels “the sea” usually identifies the Sea of Galilee. Its modern Hebrew name is <span class="hebrew">Yam Kinneret</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p class="h2" id="Location">Location</p>
<p class="fl">The sea lies in the lower section of the Jordan Valley about 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) north of Jerusalem, located in a range of mountains. The mountains of Upper Galilee are northwest of the lake and rise to a height of 4,000 feet (1,219.2 meters) above sea level, while the mountains on the east and west ascend about 2,000 feet (609.6 meters). On the west, south, and east is the Decapolis.</p>
<p>At the northwest corner of the lake the mountain wall flattens into the rich plain of Gennesaret, and on the east at 2,000 feet (609.6 meters) above sea level it gives way to the fertile El Batila in the northeast, where the Jordan enters the sea. At the time of the NT the Sea of Galilee was surrounded by the towns of Capernaum, Bethsaida, Korazin, Magdala, Tiberias, and others.</p>
<p>The sea is an integral part of the Jordan River, which feeds it with water from the snowcapped Mt Hermon (towering over 9,000 feet, or 2,743.2 meters, above sea level) and the Lebanon mountains. In its 65-mile (104.6-kilometer) course from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea, the Jordan River drops 590 feet (179.8 meters), an average of about nine feet per mile.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Description">Description</p>
<p class="fl">The lake is approximately 13 miles or 20.9 kilometers long and 6 miles or 9.7 kilometers wide (7½ miles or 12.1 kilometers at its broadest point opposite Magdala). It lies almost 700 feet (213.4 meters) below the Mediterranean Sea, and its greatest depth is 200 feet (60.9 meters). Its shape resembles a harp, and some scholars think the name Chinnereth comes from a Hebrew word meaning “harp.” The climate is semitropical. Because of this climate, combined with the sulphur springs at Tiberias, it became a resort to which sick people traveled. The lake abounds in fish, so fishing became an important industry (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-22">Mt 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">Mk 1:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.9-11">Lk 5:9-11</a>). Sudden and violent storms (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.23-27">Mt 8:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-41">Mk 4:35-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.22-25">Lk 8:22-25</a>), caused by the collision of warm and cold air, occur regularly.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Importance">Importance</p>
<p class="fl">Most of the events of Jesus’ life took place in Galilee, especially around Gennesaret, the most densely populated area of Palestine. He is said to have lived at Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13">Mt 4:13</a>), and he did many miracles there (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.23">11:23</a>). Because the area on the west of the lake was a health resort, Jesus found many infirm people there and healed them (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.32-34">Mk 1:32-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.53-56">6:53-56</a>). Other important occurrences in relation to the sea were the Sermon on the Mount, traditionally near Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-48">Mt 5:1ff</a>.; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.8.1,5">8:1, 5</a>); the drowning of the swine in the region of the Gadarenes (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.28-34">8:28-34</a>); the curse on Korazin (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.21">11:21</a>); the calming of the sea (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.23-27">8:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-41">Mk 4:35-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.22-24">Lk 8:22-24</a>); and Jesus’ walking on the water (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.22-23">Mt 14:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.45-51">Mk 6:45-51</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.16-21">Jn 6:16-21</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">The exact origin of seals cannot be determined. The first seal probably developed from the amulet, whose purpose was to give protection to its wearer or to ward off evil. At one time a seal was believed to have some kind of magical protective power that would bring a curse or harm to the unauthorized person who dared to break it to obtain the contents it protected. Primitive seals were little more than tiny clay spools scratched with twigs to produce simple designs or figures. Glyptic art (the technical name for engraving or carving of seals on gems) flourished in the ancient Near East from the fourth millennium <span class="era">BC</span> to the end of the Persian period in the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TypesofSeals">Types of Seals</p>
<p class="h3">Stamp Seals</p>
<p class="fl">Seals were produced in many shapes and sizes, the earliest being the stamp seal, a flat engraved gem or bead that produced a copy of itself when pressed against soft clay. It was superseded about 3000 <span class="era">BC</span> in Mesopotamia by the cylinder seal and began to be used again only at the end of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>; by Hellenistic times it had replaced the cylinder seal altogether.</p>
<p class="h3">Cylinder Seals</p>
<p class="fl">The cylinder seal first appeared in Mesopotamia before 3000 <span class="era">BC</span> and became the most widely used kind of seal until the middle of the first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Its use in Egypt is evidence of early Mesopotamian cultural influence upon Egypt; however, it was soon replaced there by the scarab (beetle-shaped) seal, which was better adapted for sealing papyrus documents. Symbols or designs were carved on the outside of the cylinder, which left their imprint when the seal was rolled over the wet clay. Some of the earliest symbols used were geometric designs or representations of some magical symbol. Later seals depicted everything from mythology (deities seated conversing with each other, receiving worshipers in audience, riding in a boat or chariot, or fighting an enemy) to scenes from everyday life (hunting, marrying, banqueting, feeding animals, fighting wild beasts, offering sacrifices to the deity, warring, leading prisoners away) and representations of animals, flowers, and birds. Writing (e.g., the owner’s name or a declaration of loyalty to a god or king) began to appear on seals in the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Because of the great number and variety of seals that have been found, they are invaluable for what they reveal about ancient peoples—how they dressed, their hairstyles, furniture, utensils, and religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Seals were so widely used and have been unearthed in such quantity in the ancient Near East that they can be dated within a century or two of their origin, though sometimes it is difficult to determine the exact period or country of origin. Herodotus observed that every Babylonian gentleman “carries a seal and a walking stick” (Book I, 195). The seal was suspended by a cord about the neck or the wrist or attached to some part of the owner’s clothing (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.38.18">Gn 38:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">41:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.8.6">Sg 8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.24">Jer 22:24</a>). Graves have been found with cylinders tied to the wrists of the skeletons.</p>
<p>Another type of seal was the jar handle seal. Cloth was placed over the neck of a bottle, soft clay was smeared on top of the binding cord, and then the seal was pressed into the wet clay. The unbroken seal showed that the merchandise had not been opened before delivery. In Judea the seal was impressed on jar handles as evidence of ownership. Some jar handle stamps were probably trademarks of pottery factories; some bear private names (perhaps the owner of the factory). The so-called royal jar handle stamps contain either a four-winged or two-winged symbol and a short inscription consisting of two lines. The line above reads “belonging to the king,” and the lower line contains the name of a city, probably where the jar was made.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Uses">Uses</p>
<p class="h3">Functional Uses</p>
<p class="fl">Since their first creation as amulets, seals continued to serve as signals of protection. An unbroken seal proved that the contents had not been tampered with, whether on a document, a granary door, or a wine jar. The lions’ den into which Daniel was cast was sealed with the king’s signet and those of his nobles (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.17">Dn 6:17</a>). Jesus’ tomb was secured by sealing the stone (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.66">Mt 27:66</a>). The seal also served as a mark of ownership or as a trademark (e.g., placed on pottery before firing). It was also used to validate documents (letters, bills of sale, government documents, etc.). Jezebel wrote letters in her husband’s name and sealed them with his seal, thus bringing about the death of Naboth (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.8-13">1 Kgs 21:8-13</a>). Jeremiah sealed a deed of purchase when he bought a kinsman’s land (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.10-14">Jer 32:10-14</a>). An edict with the Persian king’s seal could not be revoked (<a href="?bref=Esth.8.8">Est 8:8</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Symbolic Use</p>
<p class="fl">Symbolic use of the seal is found both in nonbiblical and biblical literature. A Babylonian prayer says, “Like a seal may my sins be torn away.” The OT says, “Seal the teaching among my disciples” (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.16">Is 8:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Zerubbabel was told he would become God’s signet ring (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.23">Hg 2:23</a>). The earth took shape like clay pressed by a signet ring (<a href="?bref=Job.38.14">Jb 38:14</a>).</p>
<p>The word is used symbolically in the NT to designate God’s personal ownership. For example, the Scriptures say that God’s seal is on Jesus, his Son (<a href="?bref=John.3.33">Jn 3:33</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.27">6:27</a>). This means that Jesus bears God’s personal name; Jesus is God’s personal expression. The Scriptures also say that the Holy Spirit seals the believers (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.30">4:30</a>). This means that the Spirit is God’s mark of ownership on the believers, and it means that the Spirit protects and preserves the believers throughout their lives.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TermsUsed">Terms Used</p>
<p class="fl">The doctrine is expressed by verbs such as “come,” “descend,” “appear,” and “is revealed” with Christ as the subject (e.g., “I will come again,” <a href="?bref=John.14.3">Jn 14:3</a>; “the Lord himself will descend,” <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.16">1 Thes 4:16</a>; “when he appears,” <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.28">1 Jn 2:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.2">3:2</a>; “the day when the Son of man is revealed,” <a href="?bref=Luke.17.30">Lk 17:30</a>; “when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven,” <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7">2 Thes 1:7</a>). It is expressed also by a variety of nouns, principally by “coming” (which is the regular translation of the Greek word <span class="greek">parousia</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “presence,” “visit,” “arrival,” “advent,” especially of a royal or distinguished person) but also by “appearing” (as in <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.8">2 Tm 4:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.13">Ti 2:13</a>), “revealing,” or “revelation” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.7">1 Cor 1:7</a>). These different verbs and nouns point to the same event but highlight different aspects of it, especially the manifestation of God’s glory in Christ when he comes. The time of this event is repeatedly referred to as “the Day,” sometimes absolutely (as in <a href="?bref=Rom.13.12">Rom 13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.13">1 Cor 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.25">Heb 10:25</a>), more often with a qualification, such as “the day of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.10">Phil 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.16">2:16</a>), “the day of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.2">1 Thes 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.2">2 Thes 2:2</a>), “the day of the Lord Jesus” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.14">2 Cor 1:14</a>), “the day of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.6">Phil 1:6</a>), and “the day of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.8">1 Cor 1:8</a>). When such expressions are used, there is often some reference to the judgment to be passed at the coming of Christ: his day is “the day of judgment” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.17">1 Jn 4:17</a>) or “the day of wrath” (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.5">Rom 2:5</a>). For the people of God, however, it is “the day of redemption” (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.30">Eph 4:30</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheProclamationoftheNewTestament">The Proclamation of the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">That the second coming of Christ was an essential element in the gospel as preached in the apostolic age is clear from many NT writings (quoted below from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The origin of the Second Coming is found in the teachings of Jesus before his death. Speaking of himself as the Son of Man, Jesus said, “The day when the Son of man is revealed” (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.30">Lk 17:30</a>) he will come “in clouds with great power and glory” (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mk 13:26</a>). This language is derived from the OT, especially from Daniel’s vision in which “one like a son of man” is brought “with the clouds of heaven” to receive everlasting dominion from the Ancient of Days (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">Dn 7:13-14</a>). A cloud or clouds regularly enveloped the divine glory in the OT (as in <a href="?bref=Exod.40.34">Ex 40:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>); their mention in connection with the coming of the Son of Man indicates that, when he comes, the glory of God will be manifested in him. Jesus’ last reference to his second coming came at his trial before the Jewish authorities when, asked by the high priest to say whether or not he was “the Christ, the Son of the Blessed,” he replied, “I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.61-62">Mk 14:61-62</a>).</p>
<p>After the Gospels, the rest of the NT affirms the eventuality of Christ’s second coming. The record of Acts begins with the angels’ assurance at the ascension of Christ that “this Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.11">Acts 1:11</a>). The summaries of apostolic addresses that the book contains make repeated references to Jesus as “the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead” (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.42">10:42</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">17:31</a>).</p>
<p>Writing to his converts in Thessalonica (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 51) a few weeks after they first heard and believed the gospel, Paul reminds them how they had “turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.9-10">1 Thes 1:9-10</a>). Here Jesus’ expected deliverance of his people from end-time judgment is put on the same plane as his historical resurrection; the Christian way of life embraces both serving God and waiting for Christ. This note of waiting for Christ is repeated and amplified several times in this short letter. A few years later Paul uses similar language when writing to his converts in Corinth (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-18">Acts 18:1-18</a>): “You are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.7">1 Cor 1:7</a>). And in what may have been his last letter he speaks of “the crown of righteousness” that the Lord will award him “on that Day, and not only to me,” he adds, “but also to all who have loved his appearing” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.8">2 Tm 4:8</a>). To love his appearing and to wait for him are two different ways of expressing the same attitude.</p>
<p>The writer to the Hebrews encourages his readers with the assurance that in a little while “the coming one shall come and shall not tarry” (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.37">Heb 10:37</a>). James says that “the coming of the Lord is at hand” (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.8">Jas 5:8</a>). Peter speaks of the time “when the chief Shepherd is manifested” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.4">1 Pt 5:4</a>). The Revelation to John ends with the risen Lord’s promise, “Surely I am coming soon,” and the church’s response, “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.20">Rv 22:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSecondComingandtheResurrection">The Second Coming and the Resurrection</p>
<p class="fl">In 1 Thessalonians, written not more than 20 years after the death and resurrection of Christ, his coming again is presented by way of comfort and encouragement to those whose Christian friends had died. Paul had been compelled to leave Thessalonica before he had time to give his converts there as much teaching as they required, and when some of their number died shortly after his departure, their friends wondered if they would suffer some serious disadvantage at the Second Coming, in contrast to those who would still be alive to greet the returning Lord. No, says Paul, “those who have fallen asleep” will suffer no disadvantage. On the contrary, the first thing to happen when “the Lord himself will descend from heaven” is that “the dead in Christ will rise.” Only after that will those who survive until then be caught away to join them and be forever “with the Lord” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15-17">1 Thes 4:15-17</a>). Fuller information on the same subject is given in 1 Corinthians, written about five years later. There the resurrection of believers is the full harvest that was inaugurated by the resurrection of Christ: “Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">1 Cor 15:23</a>). An additional revelation is imparted: not only will each believer who has died be raised in a “spiritual body” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">44</a>) but also those who are still alive will be “changed” so as to have bodies suitable for life in resurrection. For dead and living believers alike, Paul proclaimed that “as we have borne the image of the man of dust [i.e., Adam; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>], we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven [i.e., the risen Christ]” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.49">1 Cor 15:49</a>). To the same effect, Paul writes (a few years later still) in <a href="?bref=Phil.3.20-21">Philippians 3:20-21</a> that from heaven “we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body.” A deeper unveiling of what this will involve is made in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.18-23">Romans 8:18-23</a>, where the resurrection of the people of Christ is the catalyst for the liberation and glorious renewal of all creation.</p>
<p class="h3">The Second Coming and Judgment</p>
<p class="fl">The association of judgment with the Second Coming arises in Jesus’ teaching in the Gospels. The association is equally plain in the epistles of the NT. Paul, in particular, put the subject on a personal level. He forbade premature judgment of fellow Christians: “Do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.5">1 Cor 4:5</a>). The Lord will conduct an investigation that will bring to light the hidden motives of the heart. Paul knew that his own apostolic work would be assessed on “the day of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.16">Phil 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.19">1 Thes 2:19</a>). Elsewhere, Paul urges his converts to bear in mind that they, with himself, must appear before the divine tribunal, variously called “the judgment seat of God” (where “each of us shall give account of himself,” <a href="?bref=Rom.14.10-12">Rom 14:10-12</a>) or “the judgment seat of Christ” (where each will “receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the body,” <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.10">2 Cor 5:10</a>). It seems clear that this judgment is to take place at the second coming of Christ, who will then “judge the living and the dead” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1">2 Tm 4:1</a>). Because Paul was writing to Christians, he tended to concentrate on the judgment or assessment that the believers would experience at the Lord’s return. But he also made it plain that the same coming would bring judgment to those who opposed the Christian faith (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.6-10">2 Thes 1:6-10</a>). This is made explicit in <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">Acts 17:31</a>, where Paul told the Athenians that God “has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed.”</p>

<p class="fl">Father of seven sons and a descendant of Abraham through Esau’s line. Originally a Horite tribe dwelling in the land of Edom, the nation descended from Seir was first dispossessed by, but later intermarried with, Esau’s descendants. Perhaps for this reason Seir and his offspring were included in the genealogies of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.20-21">Gn 36:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.38">1 Chr 1:38</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SEIR (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Mountain range of Edom extending from the Dead Sea southward to the Gulf of Aqaba. Mt Seir was bordered by the great valley of Arabah on the west and by desert on the east. Seir is the modern Jebel esh-Shera.</p>
<p class="list-text">Seir was formerly inhabited by the Horites, whose defeat to King Kedorlaomer is recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.4-6">Genesis 14:4-6</a>. The Horites were later dispossessed from this region by Esau (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.12">Dt 2:12</a>); however, a remnant of Horite chiefs was listed among the descendants of Esau living in Seir (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.20-30">Gn 36:20-30</a>). As this area was given by the Lord as an inheritance to Esau (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.4">Jos 24:4</a>), the Israelites were warned not to provoke the sons of Esau to war as they passed through Seir on their wilderness travels (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.1-8">Dt 2:1-8</a>). During Israel’s occupation of Palestine, they were drawn into a number of battles against the people of Seir. A band of Simeonites destroyed the Amalekites dwelling in Seir and resettled it with their own people (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.42">1 Chr 4:42</a>). Jehoshaphat, king of Judah (872–848 <span class="era">BC</span>), gained an incredible victory over the allied armies of Ammon, Moab, and Seir (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.10-23">2 Chr 20:10-23</a>). King Amaziah of Judah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>) routed an army from Seir in the valley of Salt (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.11-14">25:11-14</a>). And finally, the prophet Ezekiel pronounced a curse of destruction on the inhabitants of Seir for their antagonism against Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.35.1-15">Ez 35:1-15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SELEUCIA</p>
<p class="fl">Name of several ancient Near Eastern cities, all founded by Seleucus I Nicator (312–281 <span class="era">BC</span>). The most important is Seleucia in Syria on the northeast corner of the Mediterranean, five miles (8 kilometers) north of the mouth of the Orontes River and 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) from Antioch, for which it was the port. Built by Seleucus I in 301 <span class="era">BC</span> and strongly fortified to guard his capital from the west, it changed hands several times in the disputes between the Seleucid rulers in Syria and the Ptolemies of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Dan.11.7-9">Dn 11:7-9</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.8-19">1 Macc 11:8-19</a>). In 109 <span class="era">BC</span> the Seleucid ruler, having shaken free of the Ptolemies, granted freedom to the city, along with the privilege of coining money. When the Romans appeared in the east, Pompey conferred the status of “free city” on Seleucia. However, he broke the power of the Seleucids and formed the Roman province of Syria with the free city of Seleucia as a port of entry to the east. Its fine natural harbor and artificial defenses were improved.</p>
<p>In NT times Seleucia remained a free city and harbored Rome’s Syrian fleet. Barnabas, Saul, and John Mark sailed from here on their first missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.4-5">Acts 13:4-5</a>) and returned to Antioch via Seleucia (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.26">14:26</a>). Later, on Paul’s second missionary journey, Paul and company again set out from Seleucia (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39-41">15:39-41</a>). The city was undoubtedly an attractive place with many public buildings, a temple, and an amphitheater cut out of a cliff.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SENNACHERIB</p>
<p class="fl">King of the Assyrian Empire from 705 to 681 <span class="era">BC</span>. His name, meaning “son has replaced brothers,” may refer to a specific family situation by means of which he, a younger son of Sargon II, came to succeed his father. Before the death of his father, Sennacherib acted as military governor of the northern provinces of the Assyrian Empire. He was successful in quelling unrest in those areas. When Sargon II was assassinated in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>, Sennacherib lost no time in claiming the throne.</p>
<p>As king of Assyria, he was a bold administrator. He was soon known to be a just and tolerant man, for thus the biblical account speaks of him. Extrabiblical sources indicate that, while he was conducting military campaigns, he also developed a strong rule at home and, employing slave labor acquired through his military victories, he did much building in Nineveh, his capital city. Many of the decorations of his palace, as well as inscriptions he prepared, are housed in museums today.</p>
<p>Shortly after Sennacherib became king, he was confronted by rebellion in the eastern and western provinces. It is at this point that the biblical record refers to Sennacherib. Judah was a vassal state of Assyria. It is likely that Merodach-baladan in Babylon and Hezekiah, king of Judah, joined in this insurrection (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.7-8">2 Kgs 18:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>Sennacherib was ready for the challenge from Babylon and Palestine. In 703 <span class="era">BC</span> he first led his forces to Kish near Babylon, where he defeated Merodach-baladan’s army and then captured the city of Babylon itself. Turning west in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, Sennacherib led his armies against the Palestinian alliance headed by Hezekiah. He captured the cities of Tyre and Sidon and then continued his campaign southward. Several of the Philistine cities submitted before the Assyrian onslaught, but Ashkelon, Beth-dagon, and Joppa resisted and were captured and plundered. The leaders of the city of Ekron were put to death by being skinned alive because they had delivered up their pro-Assyrian king to Hezekiah. Sennacherib then turned to Judah. He besieged the Judean city of Lachish and captured 46 other towns, taking 200,150 Jewish captives. Hezekiah began to realize his desperate situation as Sennacherib’s military victories came one after the other, so he sent tribute to Sennacherib at Lachish. The tribute amounted to 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-16">2 Kgs 18:13-16</a>). From his camp at Lachish, Sennacherib sent envoys to Jerusalem to demoralize the city inhabitants. In their effort to convince Jerusalem that it should surrender, the Assyrians referred to Hezekiah’s removal of altars and places of worship. This act was considered an affront to the God the Judeans worshiped and on whom they relied for victory; he would not aid a people led by an idol-breaking king such as Hezekiah.</p>
<p>While Sennacherib was threatening Jerusalem, Tirhakah, the Ethiopian king of Egypt, led his army to Libnah. Sennacherib was able to defeat this Egyptian force. He then turned his full attention to Jerusalem again (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.15-19">2 Kgs 19:15-19</a>). Isaiah was sent by God to inform Hezekiah that the mocking Sennacherib would be humbled and Jerusalem would be spared for David’s sake. The Lord’s word was fulfilled. Sennacherib’s plans to take Jerusalem by siege had to be abandoned when 185,000 of his troops died of a miraculous plague.</p>
<p>Sennacherib returned to Nineveh, the capital city of Assyria. He was murdered in the temple of Nisroch by Adrammelech and Sharezer, two of his sons. A third son, Esarhaddon, succeeded him upon the throne of Assyria.</p>

<p>Isaiah described each seraph as having six wings: two shielded the face, two covered the feet, and the remaining pair enabled the seraph to fly. The most that can be said from the available evidence is that they were exalted spiritual entities who were occupied constantly in the praise and worship of God. Most probably the seraphim were an order of celestial beings comparable in nature to the cherubim and engaged in a somewhat similar form of service around the divine throne.</p>

<p class="h1">SERGIUS PAULUS</p>
<p class="fl">Proconsul of Cyprus, described as a “man of intelligence” (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.7">Acts 13:7</a>). Paul and Barnabas, on their first missionary journey, evangelized the Cyprian city of Paphos, Sergius Paulus’s residence. Here they met the Jewish false prophet and sorcerer named Bar-Jesus (or Elymas), who strongly opposed their gospel message before the proconsul. Paul, however, rebuked Elymas and cursed him with blindness. When Sergius Paulus witnessed what had happened, he believed. Thus, he became the first recorded convert on Paul’s first missionary journey.</p>
<p>It is here that we find the transition from the name Saul to that of Paul. Origen and many since his time have believed that Paul made the change at this point in honor of his famous convert.</p>

  <title>Serpent</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SERPENT</p>
<p class="fl">A snake or sea monster. Various words are used in the Bible for serpents or snakes. In general, the serpent belongs to a class of reptiles often characterized by their ability to wound by striking or biting and then poisoning with venom. There are particular kinds of snakes mentioned in the Bible, such as the adder (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.8">Is 11:8</a>) and the viper (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.3">Acts 28:3</a>). “Serpent” also denotes the monstrous sea serpent mentioned in <a href="?bref=Job.26.13">Job 26:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.27.1">Isaiah 27:1</a>, and <a href="?bref=Amos.9.3">Amos 9:3</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1">Genesis 3:1</a> the temptation that came to Adam and Eve is described as coming through the serpent, that “shrewdest of all the creatures the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> God had made” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). And in consequence of this, he was told, “You will grovel in the dust as long as you live, crawling along on your belly” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.14">Gn 3:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Reference is made in <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.3">2 Corinthians 11:3</a> to the fact that the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, and <a href="?bref=Rev.12.9">Revelation 12:9</a> speaks of the “ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>; see also <a href="?bref=Rev.12.14-15">Rv 12:14-15</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.20.2">20:2</a>).</p>
<p>Most of the biblical references to serpents or snakes allude (in figurative application) to the ability of the snake to bite and to poison with venom (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.49.17">Gn 49:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.10.8,11">Eccl 10:8, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.29">Is 14:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.19">Am 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.19">Rv 9:19</a>). In <a href="?bref=Ps.58.4-5">Psalm 58:4-5</a> the wicked are likened to snakes. In <a href="?bref=Ps.140.3">Psalm 140:3</a>, people’s tongues are also spoken of as being as sharp as a serpent’s, and their lips as poisonous as vipers. In <a href="?bref=Pr.23.32">Proverbs 23:32</a> it is said that strong drink “bites like a poisonous serpent; it stings like a viper” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Then in <a href="?bref=Jer.8.17">Jeremiah 8:17</a> the enemies of Israel are spoken of as coming, in God’s judgment against his people, as “poisonous snakes you cannot charm. No matter what you do, they will bite you, and you will die” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Positively, the serpent is seen to have great wisdom as the “craftiest” of creatures. And so we have the words of Jesus to his disciples, “Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves” (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.16">Mt 10:16</a>). But the primary image is negative. The serpent is a symbol of deceit. Thus, Jesus addressed the scribes and Pharisees as “Snakes! Sons of vipers!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.33">23:33</a>). John the Baptist also addressed the Pharisees and Sadducees with the words “You sons of snakes!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.7">3:7</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Animals_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Animals</a>.</p>

The serpent’s stone was located near En-rogel, a spring in the Kidron Valley located just south of Jerusalem.

  <title>Servant</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SERVANT</p>
<p class="fl">A person under obligation to serve a master, who in turn would provide a measure of protection. Some servants were slaves under legal bondage; others were servants voluntarily. It is not always possible to distinguish among “servant,” “slave,” “bondman,” and “bondwoman.” Several words in both Hebrew and Greek have been translated “servant,” although newer translations sometimes prefer other words.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for “lad,” “youth,” or “boy” often means servant (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.11">Ex 33:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.22.22">Nm 22:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.12">2 Kgs 4:12</a>). A word meaning “free-born servant” referred to the servants of the Lord, like the Levites (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.17">Ezr 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.6">Is 61:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.11">Ez 44:11</a>) or priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.35">Ex 28:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.9">Jl 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.17">2:17</a>). Sometimes ministers of the king are called servants (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.1">1 Chr 27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.29.12">Prv 29:12</a>), as are angels who minister before the Lord (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.21">Pss 103:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.4">104:4</a>). The hired servant or hireling was also considered a free person (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.45">Ex 12:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.7.1">Jb 7:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">Mal 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>The most common Hebrew term, occurring nearly 800 times in the OT, denotes a slave held in bondage (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.25">Gn 9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.12.16">12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.15">Dt 5:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.17">15:17</a>). Yet the same word is used for people of noble rank, such as ministers and advisers to the king (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.12">2 Kgs 22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.20">2 Chr 34:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.10">Neh 2:10</a>) or a servant of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.14">Gn 24:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.7">Nm 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.1.7">Jos 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.8">2 Kgs 21:8</a>), in such expressions as “Moses [or also David, Isaiah, Israel, Job, etc.] my servant.” One of the noblest expressions is “the servant of Yahweh [the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>]” (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.5">Dt 34:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.1.13">Jos 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.31-33">8:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-6">Is 49:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.4-9">50:4-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>). The proper name Obadiah means “servant of Yahweh.”</p>
<p>The NT variously defines servant as a hired servant or hireling (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.20">Mk 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.17-19">Lk 15:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.12-14">Jn 10:12-14</a>), more widely as a slave (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.9">Mt 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.24-25">10:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.27-28">13:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.44">Mk 10:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.2-4">12:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.2-3,8-10">Lk 7:2-3, 8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.51">Jn 4:51</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.34">8:34</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.16">13:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.5">Eph 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.7">Col 1:7</a>), and also as a domestic servant (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.13">Lk 16:13</a>).</p>

  <title>Servant of the Lord</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SERVANT OF THE LORD</p>
<p class="fl">Title applied to a variety of persons in the Bible. The basic term, “servant,” covers a range of meanings. Used some 800 times in the OT alone, “servant” refers to a slave, to an officer close to the king, or to the chosen leader of God’s people.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Isa.41.8-9">Isaiah 41:8-9</a> defines this highest servanthood as something granted by God’s grace: “But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen . . . ; you whom I took from the ends of the earth, and called from its farthest corners, saying to you, ‘You are my servant. . . . ’ ” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). This title is thus applicable to heroes of faith and action—to the patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.24">Gn 26:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.25">Ez 28:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.25">37:25</a>), to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.31">Ex 14:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.53,56">1 Kgs 8:53, 56</a>), to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.26-29">2 Sm 7:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.21-26">Jer 33:21-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.24">Ez 37:24</a>) and his descendants (as Hezekiah, Eliakim, Zerubbabel—<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.23">Hg 2:23</a>), to the prophets (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.10">2 Kgs 10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">14:25</a>), and to other faithful Israelites, such as Joshua and Caleb (<a href="?bref=Num.14.24">Nm 14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.29">Jos 24:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.8">Jgs 2:8</a>).</p>
<p>Prophets other than Isaiah employ this term, but only Zechariah joins him in giving an apparently messianic prediction to this name. <a href="?bref=Zech.3.8">Zechariah 3:8</a> says, “Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men of good omen: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Some would see Zerubbabel as the individual in view here (cf. <a href="?bref=Zech.6.12">Zec 6:12</a>); however, the use of “Branch” is decidedly messianic in Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Is 11:1</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.33.15">Jer 33:15</a>).</p>
<p>“<span class="ital">The</span> servant of the Lord,” in specialized biblical usage, points to the Messiah while also alluding to Isaiah’s central message. Though Isaiah, with others, employs “servant” with a range of significations, he composed some passages known as the Servant Songs. These distinctive sections of his book are distinguishable in content, but they cannot be extracted from the surrounding context without disrupting the flow of prophecy. Isaiah’s focus is on the future Messiah-servant. None can question the NT’s unanimous messianic interpretation of Isaiah’s servant, nor its application of this understanding to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>A “servant Christology” pervades Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.13,26">Acts 3:13, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.27,30">4:27, 30</a>), and 1 Peter, with numerous allusions in the Gospels. Jesus himself quotes <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> explicitly only in <a href="?bref=Luke.22.37">Luke 22:37</a>, but he seems to allude to it in <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45,14">Mark 10:45, 14:24</a>, and possibly <a href="?bref=Mark.9.12">9:12</a>. Peter not only emphasizes vicarious, redemptive suffering (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21-25">1 Pt 2:21-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a>) but seems to highlight the theme of <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> in summing up OT prophecy (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11">1:11</a>) as predicting “the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.” Paul includes these elements (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Phil 2:6-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.19">5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>), and John’s “Lamb of God” title derives from <a href="?bref=Isa.53.7">Isaiah 53:7</a> no less than from the entire sacrificial system.</p>

  <title>Seven Last Sayings of Jesus*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SEVEN LAST SAYINGS OF JESUS*</p>
<p class="fl">Recorded words of Jesus between the time he was crucified and the time he died. These seven sentences (quoted below from the <span class="sc">kjv</span>) are not found in any one Gospel. Instead, the first two and the seventh occur only in Luke; the third, fifth, and sixth, only in John; and the fourth, in both Matthew and Mark. The order is traditional; because no Gospel records them all, it is uncertain in which order they really came. Also unknown is whether Jesus said other things from the cross or whether the seven sayings are summaries of longer statements. But considering the trauma of crucifixion, it would not be surprising if this were all he said.</p>
<p>1. “Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.34">Lk 23:34</a>).</p>
<p>This is the only one of the seven last words whose genuineness is questioned, for several of the best Greek manuscripts do not contain it. Even if an element of doubt exists (the evidence is fairly evenly balanced), it certainly fits what is known of Jesus and his love, whether or not Luke originally recorded it. Just a few verses before, Jesus showed more concern for others than for himself (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.41">Lk 19:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.50-51">22:50-51</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.28">23:28</a>). Jesus lived his own teaching and prayed for those who were torturing him (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.27-28">Lk 6:27-28</a>)—no greater impulse for mankind to go and do likewise could be given. Certainly the soldiers and Jewish leaders were not totally unaware of what they were doing (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.3.17">Acts 3:17</a>), but in that they did not know the real import of their action, they were ignorant. For Christians, the request “Father, forgive” is more important than the reason, as Stephen recognized when he paraphrased it at his own martyrdom (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.60">Acts 7:60</a>). In the end, forgiveness demands no reason; it is grace.</p>
<p>2. “Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.43">Lk 23:43</a>).</p>
<p>Luke does not record this statement to teach about the abode of the dead but to express the response of the Lord to faith. One criminal quite understandably joins with the jeering crowd and gets only silence (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.40">Lk 23:40</a>), but the other quite remarkably recognizes not only the innocence of Jesus but also that the cross was only a prelude to the kingdom (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.23.40-42">40-42</a>). Jesus promised the man that he would be with him in paradise. Here again is grace, asked for and received.</p>
<p>3. “Woman, behold thy son! . . . Behold thy mother!” (<a href="?bref=John.19.26-27">Jn 19:26-27</a>).</p>
<p>John pictures Jesus as fully in control of the situation. At this point that control is apparent, as he calmly cares for his mother instead of focusing on his own suffering. Mary was also suffering as the “sword” pierced her heart (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.35">Lk 2:35</a>). Jesus, now much more her Lord than her son, remembers his natural as well as his spiritual relationships. It is not known why Jesus’ brothers were not around to care for Mary, or why they missed the Passover festival. It also is unknown why the beloved disciple was chosen, but perhaps the choice fell on him because he was there at Calvary and he was trustworthy. </p>
<p>4. “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Mt 27:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.34">Mk 15:34</a>).</p>
<p>It is now hours later than the first three words, deep in the darkness that covered Calvary for the last three hours. Suddenly Jesus cried out the first words of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a>. Mark recorded them in Jesus’ native language, Aramaic, while Matthew changed them to Hebrew. The meaning of the cry (called the cry of dereliction) has been variously explained as an expression of human feeling, a statement of disappointment that God did not deliver him, an expression of separation from God because he was bearing sin, or a citation of the whole psalm with its triumphal ending being intended. Although the full depth of this cry is a mystery known only to Jesus and his Father, it is probable that, because the psalm is a cry to God for vindication, Jesus is here asking for that. He cries to God to show that he is truly God’s chosen one. The petititon is answered in that God raised his Son from the dead three days later.</p>
<p>5. “I thirst” (<a href="?bref=John.19.28">Jn 19:28</a>).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the crucifixion, Jesus was offered a drugged wine as a soporific to deaden the pain of crucifixion. He refused it (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.34">Mt 27:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.23">Mk 15:23</a>). Now, severely dehydrated, Jesus accepts the soldiers’ sour wine (<a href="?bref=John.19.29">Jn 19:29</a>), which would sharpen his senses for his final cry. He needed it, for he had been hanging there six hours. Perhaps at no place in the life of Jesus do we see his full humanity quite so clearly as here. John saw this action as a fulfillment of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.15">Psalm 22:15</a> (and perhaps <a href="?bref=Ps.69.21">Ps 69:21</a>).</p>
<p>6. “It is finished” (<a href="?bref=John.19.30">Jn 19:30</a>).</p>
<p>John completes the crucifixion account with this simple statement (a single word in Greek). The sentence naturally reveals relief and satisfaction that the pain and agony are over, that death will soon release him, but John’s context gives the word a deeper meaning. According to John, Jesus was in control of the whole crucifixion. He said that no one could take his life from him—he would lay it down of his own accord (<a href="?bref=John.10.18">Jn 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.10-11">19:10-11</a>). So here, knowing that he had totally completed the will of the Father, he voluntarily laid his life down. What is finished, then, is not simply his dying, nor his life per se, nor the work of redemption, but the total reason for his being in the world. The last act of obedience has been accomplished; the last scripture has been fulfilled. Jesus proclaims his life “finished” and exits from the stage until the resurrection begins a new act.</p>
<p>7. “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.46">Lk 23:46</a>).</p>
<p>Luke has a different picture of the end than John and the other Evangelists. Matthew and Mark report only “a great cry” after the cry of dereliction, ending on a dark note. John ends with the completed work. Luke, who reports no feeling of forsakenness, ends by telling us the great cry was a quotation of <a href="?bref=Ps.31.5">Psalm 31:5</a> (cf. Stephen in <a href="?bref=Acts.7.59">Acts 7:59</a>). The quotation is prefaced by “Father,” the familiar <span class="ital">Abba,</span> a form of address to God characteristic of Jesus. His relationship to God is unbroken to the end. Jesus is not leaping into the dark or fighting against the unknown but placing himself in death into the hands of the same Father he had served in life.</p>

  <title>Sex, Sexuality*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SEX, SEXUALITY*</p>
<p class="fl">Unlike some religious and philosophical systems, the Bible takes a positive view of human sexuality. According to the OT’s account of Creation, it was God himself who made people sexual beings. Being male or female is part of what it means to be created in the image of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-28">Gn 1:26-28</a>). Above everything else, therefore, sexuality is a precious aspect of what a person <span class="ital">is,</span> not merely a description of what he or she <span class="ital">does.</span></p>
<p>In line with this positive approach, the OT sees nothing embarrassing in the bodily differences between the sexes (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.25">Gn 2:25</a>) and nothing shameful in physical expressions of lovemaking (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.18-19">Prv 5:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.9">Eccl 9:9</a>). The Song of Songs, in particular, is a most beautiful love poem. Its powerful language should not be so spiritualized that the physical passion it describes is stripped of its delight and candor.</p>
<p>Paul strikes the same positive note in his letters to Corinth and to Timothy at Ephesus. Sexual vice was rampant in both these cities. Partly as a reaction to this, a negative, ascetic attitude was threatening to take control in the life of Christians. Marriage was being forbidden (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.3">1 Tm 4:3</a>) and married couples were abstaining from sexual intercourse in the belief that this would help them to become more spiritually mature (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.5">1 Cor 7:5</a>).</p>
<p>Paul had no hesitation in branding such attitudes as heretical. Recalling his readers to the message of Genesis, he encouraged them to receive God’s gifts thankfully (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.3-5">1 Tm 4:3-5</a>). Husbands and wives, he writes, are mutually obliged to satisfy each other’s sexual needs (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.3-4">1 Cor 7:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>Most obviously, God made sex for procreation (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Gn 1:28</a>). But sex is for relationship as well as procreation. <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">Genesis 2</a> describes how God made woman to fill man’s relationship vacuum (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.18-24">2:18-24</a>). The relational purpose of human sexuality embraces far more than physical intercourse. In this broad sense, being male or being female is a God-given aid to making all sorts of relationships, including some not normally thought of as sexual at all.</p>
<p>The Bible does not, of course, ignore the darker side of human nature. Having described the goodness of sex in the Creator’s perfect plan, Genesis goes on to explain how man’s disobedience to God spoiled sex, just as it spoiled every other aspect of human life.</p>
<p>Nudity became a matter of embarrassment and fear, as men and women eyed each other as sex objects instead of as people with physical differences (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.7-10">Gn 3:7-10</a>). On the relational side, trust and tenderness gave way to betrayal and harshness. Here lies the root cause of all the discrimination and abuse that fuel modern feminist protests. And procreation was spoiled, too, as the marvelous experience of childbirth was marred by unnecessary pain and distress.</p>
<p>This is the context in which the Bible’s ban on extramarital intercourse should be read; it prohibits adultery (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.14">Ex 20:14</a>) and any kind of extramarital or premarital sex (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.18">1 Cor 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.3">1 Thes 4:3</a>). The Bible does not usually pause to back up its prohibitions with arguments, but on the rare occasions when it does expand its veto on extramarital intercourse, the reasons given are highly instructive. There is no appeal to consequences (these things are wrong because they result in disease and unwanted babies) or even to motives (these things are wrong if they are done in an unloving spirit). All extramarital sex is wrong <span class="ital">in itself,</span> simply because the body is not meant for sexual immorality and those who commit sexual sins sin against their own bodies (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.13,18">1 Cor 6:13, 18</a>). Sexual intercourse is a unique kind of body language that the Creator has designed to express and seal that special, exclusive, life-long relationship between a man and a woman which the Bible labels “marriage.”</p>
<p>The Bible also prohibits homosexuality (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.22">Lv 18:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.26-27">Rom 1:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-10">1 Cor 6:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.9-10">1 Tm 1:9-10</a>). The only verses that provide an explanation for this prohibition are <a href="?bref=Rom.1.24-27">Romans 1:24-27</a>. Essentially, these verses indicate that God gave up on those who gave up on him when they turned from worshiping the Creator to worshiping things God made—that is, when they became idolaters. As such, God abandoned them, as they abandoned themselves to their own sinful and sexual desires, especially practicing homosexuality. Thus, homosexuality is seen as a violation of the natural created order and thereby an offense to God the Creator who created men and women, male and female, for procreation.</p>
<p>The Bible’s advice to anyone caught up in sexual temptation is practical: flee from temptation. When Joseph was invited by another man’s wife to go to bed with her, he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house (<a href="?bref=Gen.39.12">Gn 39:12</a>). And Paul tells his Christian readers to follow Joseph’s good example (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.18">1 Cor 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.22">2 Tm 2:22</a>). This is an acknowledgment of the power of the normal person’s sex drive, not a counsel of despair. The power of the Holy Spirit, Paul taught, gives any believer the strength to win the war against sexual temptation. He knew Christians who had found the Spirit’s power to gain self-control and conquer the most deeply ingrained habits (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Gal 5:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.7">2 Tm 1:7</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, there is a strong hint in the NT that God is going to end human sexuality just as he began it. There will be no marriage, Jesus taught, in heaven (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.30">Mt 22:30</a>). That is an unlikely but fitting climax to the Bible’s teaching on sex and sexuality. When there is no more death, the need to procreate will be over. And when relationships are perfectly loving, there will no longer be any need for a sexual prop to support them. So both of God’s main purposes for human sexuality will be perfectly fulfilled in eternity.</p>

  <title>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO</p>
<p class="fl">Babylonian names of three Hebrew youths, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who along with Daniel and others were taken to Babylon as hostages by Nebuchadnezzar in 605 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1">2 Kgs 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-4">Dn 1:1-4</a>). They may have been of royal descent (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.18">2 Kgs 20:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.39.7">Is 39:7</a>), and thus their presence in Babylon would be thought to guarantee the good behavior of the Judean king Jehoiakim. Nebuchadnezzar, desiring to grace his court with intelligent and handsome men and provide able administrators for his kingdom, directed that certain of the Judean hostages be selected for special training. Among those chosen were Daniel and his three friends. Their Hebrew names, each of which exalted Yahweh, were changed to Babylonian names whose meanings are not clear but may have been intended to honor a Babylonian god. Thus, Hananiah (“The Lord is gracious”) was changed to Shadrach (“Command of Aku”—the Sumerian moon god), Mishael (“Who is what God is”) was changed to Meshach (“Who is what Aku is”), and Azariah (“The Lord has helped”) was changed to Abednego (“Servant of Nabu”—the Babylonian god of wisdom). Also Daniel (“My judge is God”) was changed to Belteshazzar (“Bel protects”—the chief Babylonian god). These young men underwent a three-year course of instruction in the languages and literature of the Chaldeans, the learned men of Babylon. This instruction no doubt included the Aramaic, Akkadian, and Sumerian languages; cuneiform writing; and perhaps also astronomy, mathematics, history, and agriculture.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar provided food for this academy. The four Hebrew youths refused to defile themselves with it because it likely had been sacrificed to one or more of the pagan gods. It had not been properly prepared, therefore, and was unfit for Jewish consumption (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.34.15">Ex 34:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.17.10-14">Lv 17:10-14</a>). Fearing the king’s displeasure should the young scholars appear undernourished, the chief eunuch expressed his concern to Daniel. Daniel proposed a substitute diet of vegetables to be tested for ten days. At the end of that period, the four Hebrew youths appeared healthier than their colleagues and were allowed to continue their diet. When the course of their instruction was completed, the four stood out from the rest because of their academic excellence and superior competence in every area of knowledge. Their intellectual superiority had been bestowed upon them by God.</p>
<p>Apparently, these four young men joined the ranks of the “wise men of Babylon” (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.12-49">Dn 2:12-49</a>). When the others (the enchanters, sorcerers, and wise men) were unable to tell Nebuchadnezzar the nature and interpretation of a dream, he lashed out at them in a fitful rage and ordered them all put to death. Daniel appealed to the king, and their lives were spared when the dream and its interpretation were made known to him in a vision. Later, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to comply with the king’s command to prostrate themselves before an enormous golden image that Nebuchadnezzar had erected (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">3</a>). Confronted by Nebuchadnezzar and threatened with terrible punishment for their intransigence, they replied that their trust was fully in the Lord. A blazing furnace was stoked for the immediate execution of the faithful Hebrews. The Lord was with his faithful servants and preserved their lives by sending his angel to protect them in the furnace. In the end it was Nebuchadnezzar who had to acknowledge that his own kingdom and power could not compare to that of the true God.</p>

<p class="h1">SHALMANESER</p>
<p class="fl">Name of several Assyrian rulers, two of whom had direct contact with the people of Israel. However, only Shalmaneser V is known by name in the Bible.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Shalmaneser I (1274–1245 <span class="era">BC</span>), the first king of this name, was active in the days when Israel was emerging as a significant group in Palestine. He had no direct contact with Israel.</p>
<p class="list">2. Shalmaneser II (1030–1019 <span class="era">BC</span>) was roughly contemporary with King Saul, but he had no contact with Israel.</p>
<p class="list">3. Shalmaneser III (859–824 <span class="era">BC</span>) had the first significant contact with Israel. This ruler made frequent raids into the lands west of Assyria during his reign. In his annals he left accounts of his exploits and gave lists of small kingdoms he overwhelmed. Another significant entry in the annals of Shalmaneser III is his reference to a campaign against Syria in 841 <span class="era">BC</span> in which he claimed to have defeated Hazael of Damascus (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.15-18">1 Kgs 19:15-18</a>). He did not capture Damascus but moved farther west to the region of Lebanon, where he received tribute from “Jehu, son of Omri.” The black obelisk on which he recorded these events portrays Jehu, the king of Israel (842–814 <span class="era">BC</span>), on his knees submitting to Shalmaneser while Israelites carry booty to the king. This event is not mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p class="list">4. Shalmaneser IV (782–772 <span class="era">BC</span>) had no contact with Israel. He ruled Assyria during a period of decline. His successor Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) was an exceedingly vigorous and able ruler who conducted campaigns in Syria and farther west from 743 <span class="era">BC</span> onward and made several contacts with Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.17-29">2 Kgs 15:17-29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Shalmaneser V (727–722 <span class="era">BC</span>) was able to bring Hoshea, the last king of Israel (732–723 <span class="era">BC</span>), under his control (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.3">2 Kgs 17:3</a>). Hoshea failed to pay his annual tribute in his seventh regnal year and was visited by Shalmaneser V, who placed Samaria, the capital of Israel, under siege. The king of Egypt was implicated in this treachery in some way, for he gave encouragement to Hoshea in his rebellious intentions. The siege of Samaria lasted for three years, and in Hoshea’s ninth year the city fell. The biblical record seems to attribute the fall of the city to Shalmaneser. Unfortunately, there are no extant records for the reign of Shalmaneser V, and the capture of Samaria was claimed by Shalmaneser’s son Sargon II (721–705 <span class="era">BC</span>) in his own annals as an important event in his accession year.</p>

<p class="list">4. Prominent rabbi whose life spanned the period 50 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 30. His name is most frequently coupled with that of his equally famous contemporary, Hillel, who was president of the Sanhedrin while Shammai was vice-president. Shammai had the reputation for being strict and rigid in his application of the law and severely literal in his interpretation of the Scriptures, while Hillel was more liberal and humane in applying the law and more imaginative in the use of the Scriptures. Shammai was renowned for his hatred of Roman domination and tried to forbid Jewish people from buying food or drink from Gentiles.</p>
<p class="list-text">Two schools of interpretation followed these two contemporaries—“the house of Shammai” and “the house of Hillel”—continuing to the time of the compilation of the Mishnah, though the house of Hillel seems to have gradually gained ascendancy over the house of Shammai. The debates and conversations between the two rabbis or the two schools are recorded in the Mishnah and the Talmud, pertaining to such matters as offerings, priestly dues, tithes, Levitical cleanness and uncleanness, the observance of the Sabbath, marriage and divorce.</p>

<p class="h1">SHARON</p>
<p class="list">1. Section of the plain on the Mediterranean coast of Israel. It extends from Joppa in the south to the Crocodile River, which serves as the northern border and separates it from the plain of Dor. The largest of the northern coastal plains, it is 50 miles (80 kilometers) from north to south and 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) wide. Its shore is straight and consists of beach and cliffs. There are no natural harbors along the coast, so the plain had no large trading ports. The Via Maris, a major north-south trading route, skirted the eastern edge of the plain.</p>
<p class="list-text">Five streams or wadis cross the Sharon Plain: Nahal Tanninim (Crocodile River), Nahal Hadera, Nahal Alexander, Nahal Poleg, and Nahal Yarqon. These streams drain water from the Samaritan hills and empty into the Mediterranean. Until recent times, the streams formed extensive swamps that were infested with malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Sharon also has sand dune hills that rise to an elevation of 180 feet (54.9 meters) above sea level in the central part of the plain. In biblical times the elevated areas of Sharon were covered with oak trees. The combination of swamps, sand dunes, and forests made the area almost impenetrable. The plain was granted to Manasseh’s tribe by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.1-18">Jos 17</a>), but it was not effectively controlled by Israel until the time of David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.29">1 Chr 27:29</a>), and even then it was only used for pasturage.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the book of Isaiah, Sharon is ranked with the regions of Carmel and Lebanon for its fertility and luxuriance (<a href="?bref=Isa.33.9">Is 33:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.2">35:2</a>). When Isaiah speaks of the final restoration, he refers to the Sharon pastures as the place for flocks (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.10">65:10</a>). The “rose of Sharon” (<a href="?bref=Song.2.1">Sg 2:1</a>) may have been one of several varieties of red flowering plants that grow in the plain.

In <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.17-19">1 Chronicles 3:17-19</a>, Shealtiel appears to be the grandfather or perhaps the uncle of Zerubbabel.

  <title>Shebna</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SHEBNA</p>
<p class="fl">Eighth-century official of the kingdom of Judah. The name Shebna is Aramaic in form and has been interpreted to mean “return, please [O Lord],” relating it to either a fuller spelling (Shebaniah) or to a Semitic root meaning “youthful.” Because of the Aramaic spelling, some have argued that Shebna was of foreign birth. The appearance of the name, however, on several contemporary Palestinian inscriptions (e.g., from Lachish) may make such a view unnecessary.</p>
<p>Two major passages mention Shebna by name: <a href="?bref=Isa.22.15-25">Isaiah 22:15-25</a> and <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17-19.7">2 Kings 18:17–19:7</a>. The unlikelihood of two men with the same name, both holding high-ranking positions in the Judahite government in the same general time period, has caused most scholars to argue that the two passages in Isaiah and 2 Kings refer to a single individual.</p>
<p>Because of his arrogance in building an ostentatious tomb for himself, and because of excessive pride in his position and importance, Shebna was denounced by the prophet Isaiah. In fact, the prophet even predicted that Shebna would go into exile and die in a foreign country (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.18">Is 22:18</a>). The events described in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17-19.7">2 Kings 18:17–19:7</a> (cf. the parallel account in <a href="?bref=Isa.37.1-38">Is 37</a>) are clearly traceable to the year 701 <span class="era">BC</span> and the invasion of Sennacherib. If the Shebna described in this story is the same person denounced by Isaiah in the passage just discussed, as seems likely, the date of the prophetic denouncement must be placed sometime earlier than 701.</p>
<p>In 701 the Assyrian ruler Sennacherib captured virtually all of the cities of Judah and clearly had his heart set on the capture of Jerusalem. King Hezekiah of Judah sent three official representatives to negotiate with the invading Assyrians. At this time, Eliakim was titled “the one who is in charge of the [king’s] household” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.18">2 Kgs 18:18</a>) and Shebna held the rank of <span class="hebrew">sopher</span><span class="ital">,</span> an important position, probably equal to that of a secretary of state.</p>

<p class="fl">Town in the center of western Palestine, near the watershed that separates the waters that flow to the Jordan from those that descend to the Mediterranean. The site is 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) north of Jerusalem at the eastern entrance to the pass between Mt Ebal and Mt Gerizim. The ancient town stood on the lower southeastern slope or shoulder of Mt Ebal, hence the meaning of the name (Shechem = shoulder). Samaria, later capital of Israel, was about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) northwest. Although strategically located—the town controlled all roads through the central hill country of Palestine—it was without natural defenses and required extensive fortifications.</p>

<p class="h2" id="BiblicalReferences">Biblical References</p>
<p class="fl">Shechem first appears in the Bible as the initial campsite of Abram after he entered Canaan from Mesopotamia. There God promised him the land of Canaan, and there Abram built his first altar in the land (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.6-7">Gn 12:6-7</a>). After Jacob’s 20-year sojourn in northern Mesopotamia at Paddan-aram, he returned to Shechem and bought a piece of land. By this time, the place was already a walled city with a gate (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.20,24">34:20, 24</a>). After the defilement of their sister Dinah, Simeon and Levi massacred Shechem’s male population in revenge. Years later, when the patriarchal family was living in the Hebron area, Joseph went to Shechem to look for his brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.12-14">37:12-14</a>).</p>
<p>After the Conquest, the ceremony of antiphonal blessing and cursing on Mt Gerizim and Mt Ebal, respectively, was fulfilled in the vicinity of Shechem (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-35">Jos 8:30-35</a>). In the division and settlement of the land, Shechem became one of the cities of refuge (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.7">20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.21">21:21</a>) and one of the 48 Levitical cities (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.21">21:21</a>). There Joshua delivered his farewell address (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.1,25">24:1, 25</a>), and the bones of Joseph were buried on the land Jacob had bought there (v <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">32</a>).</p>
<p>During the unsettled days of the judges, Gideon’s son Abimelech set himself up as king of Israel there, at first with the support of the inhabitants. But a later revolt against him resulted in destruction of the city (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.1-7,23-57">Jgs 9:1-7, 23-57</a>). Rehoboam was crowned there just before the split of the kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1">1 Kgs 12:1</a>), and Jeroboam, first king of the northern kingdom, rebuilt the city and made it the first capital of the kingdom.</p>

<p class="fl">Excavations reveal that the earliest settlement at the site dates back to the fourth millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, but the first significant settlement occurred during the first half of the second millennium and was the work of Amorites or Hyksos. The Hyksos surrounded the city with an immense sloping embankment about 80 feet (24.4 meters) wide and 20 feet (6.1 meters) high, upon which they built a brick wall. There was a two-entry gate on the east side and a three-entry gate on the northwest side. On the acropolis they built what has been interpreted as a fortress temple, which was rebuilt several times and finally destroyed by the Egyptians in about 1550 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>About a century later, the Canaanites rebuilt Shechem on a smaller scale. A new fortress temple was built on the ruins of the old one and measured 53 feet (16.2 meters) wide and 41 feet (12.5 meters) deep, with an entrance on the long side. It had three sacred standing stones next to an altar in the open court. This temple is believed to be the house of Baal-berith destroyed by Abimelech about 1150 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.3-4,46">Jgs 9:3-4, 46</a>), and its sacred area was never rebuilt. Before that, however, there is no archaeological evidence of destruction for some 300 years, confirming the biblical indication that the Hebrews did not take the city at the time of the Conquest and that the inhabitants lived peaceably among the Hebrews.</p>
<p>Evidently, Solomon rebuilt Shechem as a provincial capital, but it suffered great destruction late in the 10th century, probably at the hands of Shishak of Egypt when he invaded Palestine in 926 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">1 Kgs 14:25</a>). Shortly thereafter, Jeroboam I refortified the city and made it the capital of the kingdom of Israel. Either he or a successor built a government warehouse on the ruins of the temple. Israelite Shechem met its end at the hands of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser V in 724 <span class="era">BC</span>, just before the destruction of Samaria, and the town was virtually uninhabited for about 400 years.</p>
<p>In the fourth century, Alexander the Great established a camp on the site for his soldiers, and subsequently the Samaritans moved from Samaria and settled there. They built their temple on Mt Gerizim. John Hyrcanus probably destroyed Shechem for the last time in 128 <span class="era">BC</span>. His violent opposition to the Samaritans involved destruction of their temple on Mt Gerizim and of Samaria at the same time.</p>

<p>The tower of Shechem served as the citadel to which the leaders of Shechem fled from the onslaught of Abimelech. They sought refuge in the inner chamber of the temple of Baal-berith. Abimelech, however, set the upper parts of the inner chamber on fire, killing all the men and women housed within (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.46-49">Jgs 9:46-49</a>).</p>
<p>The remnants of the tower of Shechem have been found within the ancient town of Shechem at Tell Bala’ta, a short distance northeast of modern Nablus in central Palestine. Modern excavations show that the tower of Shechem was used as a temple and a fortress.</p>

<p class="h1">SHEKINAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning “the one who dwells” or “that which dwells.” The term enters Christian theology from its use in the Targums and rabbinic literature to describe the immanent presence in the world of the transcendent Deity. Although the word is not itself used in either Testament, it clearly originates in OT passages that describe God as dwelling among a people or in a particular place (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.27">Gn 9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.25.8">Ex 25:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.29.45-46">29:45-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.5.3">Nm 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.13">1 Kgs 6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.16-18">Pss 68:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.74.2">74:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.18">Is 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.7-9">Ez 43:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.17,21">Jl 3:17, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.10-11">Zec 2:10-11</a>); God, whose dwelling is in heaven, also dwells on earth. The term is also applied to the “shekinah glory,” the visible pillar of fire and smoke that dwelled in the midst of Israel at Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.16-18">Ex 19:16-18</a>), in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">40:34-38</a>), and in the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.13">1 Kgs 6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-13">8:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.1-2">2 Chr 6:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>The NT frequently alludes to the concept of the shekinah, even though the term itself is not used. God’s presence in the NT is frequently associated with light and glory (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.9">Lk 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.29">9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.3-6">Acts 9:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-11">22:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.12-16">26:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-18">2 Pt 1:16-18</a>). John’s Gospel emphasizes both the concept of glory and the concept of dwelling. When the Word became flesh, he dwelt among men who beheld his glory (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>). The Spirit of God remained on him (v <a href="?bref=John.1.32">32</a>) and would be with his followers forever (<a href="?bref=John.14.16">14:16</a>). He would abide in those who abide in Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.15.4-10">15:4-10</a>). The same themes of dwelling in Christ and of his dwelling in his people occur repeatedly also in John’s letters (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.6,14,24,27-28">1 Jn 2:6, 14, 24, 27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.6,14-15,24">3:6, 14-15, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.9">2 Jn 1:9</a>).</p>
<p>Paul also identifies Christ as the shekinah of God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him bodily (<a href="?bref=Col.1.19">Col 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">2:9</a>). The dwelling of Christ in the church constitutes the saints as the people of God (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15-23">1:15-23</a>). Paul’s message was the “gospel of the glory of Christ,” for God had caused light to shine to give “knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4-6">2 Cor 4:4-6</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Finally, the writer of Hebrews sees Christ as “the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of his being” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Glory_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Glory</a>; <a href="?item=PillarofFireandCloud_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Pillar of Fire and Cloud</a>; <a href="?item=Theophany_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Theophany</a>.</p>

Shem lived 600 years (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.10-11">11:10-11</a>). In Hebrew, Shem means “name,” perhaps implying that Noah expected this son’s name to become great.</p>
<p>After their deliverance from the great Flood, Shem and Japheth acted with respect and dignity toward their drunken father Noah on an occasion when their brother Ham dishonored him (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.20-29">Gn 9:20-29</a>). Because of this act, Noah later pronounced a curse on Canaan, the son of Ham, and a blessing on both Shem and Japheth.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Gen.11.10-27">Genesis 11:10-27</a>, the line of descent for the promised seed, which was to crush Satan (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-32">5:1-32</a>), is traced through Shem to Abraham, and ultimately through Judah and David to Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.3.36">Lk 3:36</a>). The blessing of Noah on Shem is thus to be taken as an indication that the line of Shem will be the line through which the seed of <a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</a> will come. This is the first time in the Bible that God is called the God of some particular individual or group of people. The statement that Canaan would be a servant to Shem was fulfilled centuries later when the Israelites, who descended from Shem, entered the land of Canaan and subdued the inhabitants of the land (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-21">1 Kgs 9:20-21</a>).</p>
<p>Noah also said that Japheth would be enlarged and dwell in the tents of Shem (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.27">Gn 9:27</a>), the latter of which would seem to imply sustenance and protection. After Japheth would be greatly increased in numbers, the Japhethites would be brought into contact with Shem and would share in the blessings and promises of the Semitic faith. Many scholars see fulfillment of this prophecy in the opening of the gospel to the Gentiles during the NT era of the establishment of the church.</p>
<p>In the “table of nations” recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Genesis 10</a>, five descendants of Shem are mentioned (Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram). Receiving particular emphasis among these descendants is Eber from the line of Arphaxad, whose line is traced to Abraham in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.16-27">Genesis 11:16-27</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">SHEMA*, The</p>
<p class="fl">The declaration “Hear, O Israel, Yahweh our God is one Yahweh” (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">Dt 6:4</a>). <span class="hebrew">Shema</span> comes from the first Hebrew word of the verse, <span class="hebrew">shema</span><span class="ital">,</span> “hear.” Verses <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">4-9</a> make up the whole of this foundational biblical truth. While several translations of verse <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">4</a> are grammatically correct, Jesus’ words in <a href="?bref=Mark.12.29">Mark 12:29</a> correspond most closely to the one given above. Religious Jews recite the Shema three times daily as part of their devotional life; no Sabbath worship is conducted in the synagogue without its proclamation.</p>
<p>Within the Shema is found both a fundamental doctrinal truth and a resultant obligation. There is an urgency connected to the teaching: the word <span class="hebrew">shema</span> demands that the hearer respond with his total being to the fact and demands of this essential revelation.</p>
<p>With regard to the teaching pertaining to the nature of God, the word “one” (<span class="hebrew">echad</span>) designates a compound unity rather than an absolute singular. While the eminent medieval Jewish theologian Maimonides insisted that God was <span class="hebrew">yachid</span> (an absolute singular), the OT does not use this word to define God’s nature. The compound singular word for “one” first occurs in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Genesis 2:24</a> where a man and woman, though separate entities, are seen to be one (<span class="hebrew">echad</span>) in marriage. Understandably, Jesus could freely quote <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a> without infringing upon the truth of his own deity.</p>

  <title>Sheol*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SHEOL*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew term for the place of the dead. In ordinary usage it means “ravine,” “chasm,” “underworld,” or “world of the dead.” In the OT it is the place where the dead have their abode, a hollow space underneath the earth where the dead are gathered in. Synonyms for Sheol are “pit,” “death,” and “destruction” (Abaddon). Sheol is a place of shadows and utter silence. Here all existence is in suspense, yet it is not a nonplace, but rather a place where life is no more. It is described as the Land of Forgetfulness. Those who dwell there cannot praise God (<a href="?bref=Ps.88.10-12">Ps 88:10-12</a>). In Revelation it is called the “bottomless pit” presided over by Abaddon, the prince of the pit (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">Rv 9:11</a>).</p>
<p>It is not, however, a place where God is entirely absent; there can be no escape from God even in Sheol (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.8">Ps 139:8</a>). This omnipresence of God is graphically described in Job: “Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering” (<a href="?bref=Job.26.6">Jb 26:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). A similar thought is expressed in Proverbs: “Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, how much more the hearts of men!” (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.11">Prv 15:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In both texts Sheol and Abaddon are used interchangeably. Abaddon means literally “destruction,” but in Revelation it is used as a personal name.</p>
<p>In the Bible, death is not a natural occurrence. It violates the principle of life, which is a gift from God. Sheol is therefore not only a place of rest but also of punishment. Korah and his associates who instigated rebellion against Moses were swallowed up by the open pit and perished in Sheol (<a href="?bref=Num.16.30-33">Nm 16:30-33</a>). Fear of death is natural to man; Sheol therefore serves as a symbol of the journey without return (<a href="?bref=Ps.39.12-13">Ps 39:12-13</a>). King Hezekiah of Judah laments on his sickbed: “In the noontide of my days I must depart; I am consigned to the gates of Sheol for the rest of my years” (<a href="?bref=Isa.38.10">Is 38:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Sheol, as conceived in the OT, differs from the later doctrine of hell or Hades in that it is the place where all the dead are gathered indiscriminately, both the good and the bad, the saints and the sinners. To die means to be joined to those who have gone before. When a Jew dies, he is “gathered unto his people” (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.8,17">Gn 25:8, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.29">35:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.29">49:29</a>). Beyond Sheol there seemed to be no hope (cf. <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.10">Eccl 9:10</a>). The utter despondency of death is expressed pathetically in the book of Job: “I go whence I shall not return, to the land of gloom and deep darkness, the land of gloom and chaos, where light is as darkness” (<a href="?bref=Job.10.21-22">Jb 10:21-22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Yet this is not Job’s last word. He also knows of the power of God, which reaches beyond the grave: “For I know that my Redeemer lives . . . ; and after my skin has been thus destroyed, then from my flesh I shall see God” (<a href="?bref=Job.19.25-26">19:25-26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The idea that the dead abide in the underworld persists in the OT. The incident in the case of Saul with the medium of Endor (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.11">1 Sm 28:11</a>) is a good illustration. Samuel is brought “up out of the earth” to be consulted by the king at a time of crisis. Such necromancy was strictly prohibited both by the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.9-11">Dt 18:9-11</a>) and by the king himself (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.3,9">1 Sm 28:3, 9</a>). Apparently, those in the underworld, though separated from the living, were thought to be familiar with the affairs of men.</p>
<p>Sheol is roughly equivalent to the Greek word often found in the NT, <span class="greek">hades</span><span class="ital">,</span> as that which also describes the place of the dead.</p>

  <title>Shepherd</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SHEPHERD</p>
<p class="fl">One who took complete care of a flock of sheep. His task was to find grass and water for the sheep, to protect them from wild animals (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.12">Am 3:12</a>), to look for and restore those that strayed (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.8">Ez 34:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.12">Mt 18:12</a>), to lead the flock out of the fold each day, and to return the flock to the fold at the close of the day (<a href="?bref=John.10.2-4">Jn 10:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>The figure of the shepherd and his sheep is important in the NT. Jesus is the Good Shepherd who gives his life for the sheep (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.10-14">Mt 18:10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.34">Mk 6:34</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.1-42">Jn 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20">Heb 13:20</a>). The analogy of the shepherd and the flock finds rich expression in <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1-6">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.1-31">Ezekiel 34</a>, and <a href="?bref=John.10.1-42">John 10</a>. God was the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.24">Gn 49:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1">Pss 23:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1">80:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.11">Is 40:11</a>). When unfaithful shepherds failed Israel, God intervened and appointed his servant David as a faithful shepherd over them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.11-16,23-24">Ez 34:11-16, 23-24</a>).</p>
<p>The NT imagery comes from an OT and Palestinian background. In the Jewish economy, the shepherd who tended a flock of sheep or goats held a responsible position. Great flocks had to be moved from place to place, and it was necessary that they be guarded from wild animals and robbers. Because of the fundamental role of shepherding in the ancient world, the word “shepherd” became a common term for a ruler. The kings of Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt were often referred to as shepherds who protected their people. This imagery formed the background for the OT, where the same usage is found. God is pictured as the shepherd of Israel, concerned for every aspect of his people’s welfare. Rulers and leaders of the people are often referred to as shepherds (<a href="?bref=Num.27.17">Nm 27:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.17">1 Kgs 22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.21">Jer 10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.10">12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.22">22:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.1-2">23:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>By the time of Jeremiah, “shepherd” began to be used as a title for the coming Messiah. God himself would provide for his flock (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.3">Jer 23:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.10">31:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.11-22">Ez 34:11-22</a>) and promised to provide faithful shepherds who showed concern for his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.15">Jer 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.4">23:4</a>). He explicitly promised that he would be their God and would set the messianic Son of David as shepherd over them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.23-24">Ez 34:23-24</a>). In the NT Jesus referred to himself as the promised messianic Shepherd (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.16">Mt 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.32">25:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.27">Mk 14:27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.1-30">Jn 10:1-30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20">Heb 13:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">1 Pt 2:25</a>). <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Ephesians 4:11</a> speaks of leaders of the church as shepherds or pastors, and this usage continued in the early church and down until the present day. Paul said they are special people given to the church by God to care for God’s people as a shepherd does his sheep, leading and teaching them in the ways of God. Peter also spoke of the leaders as shepherds; he encouraged them to remain faithful shepherds until the time that the Chief Shepherd, Jesus Christ, appeared (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-4">1 Pt 5:1-4</a>).</p>

  <title>Shepherd of Hermas*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SHEPHERD OF HERMAS*</p>
<p class="fl">Volume composed by Hermas. Not much is known of Hermas other than the details he includes of himself in his work The Shepherd. In this story, Hermas states that he was originally a slave. He eventually gained his freedom, married, started a business, lost nearly everything, watched his children stray, and finally reunited his family. Hermas indicates that he knew Clement, the first-century bishop of Rome. From internal evidences, it is impossible to tell whether this biography is fictional or not. As to external facts, references to Hermas are contradictory. In the third century, Origen thought Hermas was the individual Paul mentioned in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.14">Romans 16:14</a>. Other authorities, including the second-century Muratorian Canon, identified Hermas as a brother of Pius, bishop of Rome around 150. Most scholars today favor this second position. Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, provided the first recorded reference to The Shepherd in 185.</p>
<p>In The Shepherd Hermas describes a series of visions about Christian life and morality. Throughout the story, Hermas is both the hero and the narrator. The story is set in Rome and is divided into three parts: 5 visions, 12 mandates, and 10 similitudes, or parables.</p>
<p>Five visions in the book allegorize Christian ethical truths with such symbolism as a tower under construction and an older woman who becomes youthful. The visions begin with Hermas as he is smitten by the beautiful Rhoda, to whom he is sold as a slave. In the second vision Rhoda reappears as an old woman, representing the church. This old woman becomes more youthful each time she appears. The visions portray the church growing and spreading, purified by suffering and, in the fourth vision, by the terrors of judgment.</p>
<p>It is in the fifth vision, while Hermas is in his own house, that he no longer sees the church, but a bright, glowing man appears dressed like a shepherd. The man has been sent to live with Hermas to teach him until his death. The man is “the Shepherd, the angel of repentance” who gives Hermas 12 mandates and 10 similitudes, which form the remaining sections of the work.</p>
<p>In brief, the 12 mandates depict Christian virtues—humility, chastity, truthfulness, long-suffering, simplicity, respectfulness, and good cheer. The mandates also exhort believers to purity and repentance. Prominent here is the “Two Ways” pattern of moral instruction (the way of life and the way of death). This mirrors the Didache and other early Christian ethical writings.</p>
<p>Finally, the 10 similitudes describe principles by which the Christian virtues may be attained. The similitudes consider such topics as Christians as strangers, the rich and the poor, the sinners and the righteous, blossoming and withered trees, the purpose of the commandments, fasting, and punishment. They also include long parables about branches, a tower, maidens, and mountains. The 10th similitude is not a parable but a concluding chapter to sum up the work of the Shepherd. Here Hermas sums up the focus of the book: “I, too, sir, declare to every person the mighty works of the Lord; for I hope that all who have sinned in the past, if they hear these things, will gladly repent and recover life.”</p>
<p>Throughout the early church, leaders gave Hermas’s book high respect. Eusebius of Caesarea noted that The Shepherd was read widely in the early church. Some important leaders, such as Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria, even considered it canonical Scripture. For Athanasius, the work was not Scripture, but it did offer, like the Didache, help for Christian learners. Because of its simplicity and candor, some have compared Hermas’s work with Bunyan’s <span class="ital">The Pilgrim’s Progress.</span> The Shepherd serves as a valuable index to Christian ethics and moral instruction in Christianity’s earliest decades.</p>
<p>Hermas’s work exists in some Greek manuscripts and in many medieval Latin translations. Printed editions of the book began to appear in the early 1500s.</p>

  <title>Sheshbazzar</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SHESHBAZZAR</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish leader who found favor with Cyrus the Great, king of Persia. In the first year of his reign, Cyrus issued a decree that the temple in Jerusalem should be rebuilt (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezr 1:1-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.1-5">6:1-5</a>). He appointed Sheshbazzar governor of Judah (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.14">Ezr 5:14</a>) and handed over to him the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had carried off when he took Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.7-9">1:7-9</a>). Sheshbazzar fulfilled this commission by taking the vessels to Jerusalem with the returning exiles (v <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.9">9</a>) and beginning the restoration of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.16">5:16</a>).</p>
<p>Sheshbazzar is mentioned in the Bible only four times, all in the book of Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.8-9">1:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.14-16">5:14-16</a>). For many years it was commonly held that Sheshbazzar was another name for Zerubbabel. Both were of the royal line; Sheshbazzar is called “the prince of Judah,” which may mean that he was heir apparent to the throne. Since his genealogy is not given, he may be represented in that listing by some other name, either Zerubbabel or Shenazzar (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.18-19">1 Chr 3:18-19</a>). In the record of people who returned to Jerusalem, Sheshbazzar’s name does not appear. The name of Zerubbabel is at the head of this list, where one would expect Sheshbazzar’s to be; both were governors of the province of Judah. Zerubbabel is associated with the laying of the foundation of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.8-11">Ezr 3:8-11</a>), but that work is attributed to Sheshbazzar in <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.16">5:16</a>, in accordance with chapter <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">1</a>. It is evident that the name Sheshbazzar is found only in connection with the Persians, for chapter <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">1</a> relates his dealings with Cyrus, and in chapter <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-17">5</a> the two occurrences of his name are in a letter written by the Persian official, Tattenai. One may conclude that the Persians knew him as Sheshbazzar, but the Jews called him Zerubbabel. Both names are Akkadian, so there is no parallel here to the renaming of Jewish captives in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.7">Dn 1:7</a>).</p>

<p>The exact problem in pronunciation is not known. Two possibilities exist. First, the Ephraimites had no sound comparable to “sh.” Thus, they pronounced “sh” as “s” (“shibboleth” becoming “sibboleth”). Second, the Gileadites pronounced “sh” as “th,” a sound which was unknown to the Ephraimites, who pronounced it as “s.” Thus, “shibboleth” was pronounced “thibboleth” by the Gileadites and “sibboleth” by the Ephraimites.</p>

Jeremiah describes Shihor as “the waters of the Nile” (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.18">Jer 2:18</a>). Some believe that the Shihor was the easternmost branch of the Nile Delta. Others identify the Shihor with the Wadi el-Arish, 90 miles (144.8 kilometers) east of the Suez Canal. Still others identify it with the Brook (or River) of Egypt, a body of water whose precise location cannot be determined with certainty.</p>

<p class="h1">SHILOH</p>
<p class="fl">Town identified with Tell Seilun, located 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) northeast of Bethel, 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) southeast of Shechem, and 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) east of the road between Shechem and Jerusalem, precisely fitting the description of its location in <a href="?bref=Judg.21.19">Judges 21:19</a>. In addition to the continuity of the name of the site and its fitting the biblical requirements for location, excavation results agree with the history of Shiloh as far as it is known from the Bible and confirm the identification.</p>
<p>The town is not mentioned in any prebiblical sources. Excavations show that Shiloh flourished as a fortified town in the early second millennium.</p>
<p>The site was abandoned and resettled in the early Israelite period. The Bible provides no information as to how the site passed into Israelite hands. Joshua established the tabernacle there (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.1">Jos 18:1</a>), and Shiloh became the center of religious life during the period of the judges. There Joshua cast lots to apportion the inheritance of land to seven of the tribes (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.1-19.51">18:1–19:51</a>) and to designate the Levitical cities (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-42">21:1-42</a>). A dispute regarding an altar erected by the two and a half tribes that settled in Transjordan was settled at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.9-34">22:9-34</a>). Some Benjaminites abducted women from there during a religious festival (<a href="?bref=Judg.21.1-25">Jgs 21</a>). Elkanah and Hannah often traveled to the tabernacle at Shiloh, where Hannah vowed to give her child to the service of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3,9,24">1 Sm 1:3, 9, 24</a>). The sons of Eli who ministered there had dishonored their office and were rejected, so the Lord appeared to Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.14">1 Sm 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.3.21">3:21</a>). When the ark was taken from Shiloh to a battle with the Philistines, news of its loss to the Philistines reached Eli and brought about his death (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-18">1 Sm 4:1-18</a>). The ark was never returned to Shiloh; the psalmist records that God had “abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.60">Ps 78:60</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>The town of Shiloh would presumably have suffered some destruction at the time of the fall of the northern kingdom in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. The sudden scarcity of ceramic remains in the Iron III period suggests that the site was largely abandoned around 600 <span class="era">BC</span>. After the destruction of the temple in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, people came from Shiloh to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.5">Jer 41:5</a>). Shilonites were possibly also among the first returnees from the Babylonian captivity (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.5">1 Chr 9:5</a>). The site was resettled around 300 <span class="era">BC</span> and flourished through the Roman period. It is mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome and in Talmudic sources. It lost much of its importance after the Islamic conquests.</p>

This king was perhaps one of the northern kings summoned by Jabin, king of Hazor, to combine forces in an attempt to defeat Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.1">11:1</a>). In all probability, Shimron-meron was one of the 12 cities included in the territory allotted to Zebulun for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.15">19:15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SHINAR*</p>
<p class="fl">Name for a district of Babylonia mentioned exclusively in the Bible. The plain of Shinar comprised the region approximately from modern Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. In the ancient world this was the region of Sumer (south) and Akkad (north), which later became generally known as Babylonia (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.2">Dn 1:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The renowned cities of Erech, Akkad, and Babel (Babylon) all were in Shinar as a part of the kingdom of Nimrod, son of Cush (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.10">Gn 10:10</a>). <a href="?bref=Gen.11.2">Genesis 11:2</a> also mentions Shinar in connection with the Tower of Babel. In <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1">Genesis 14:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.9.1-29">9</a>, we read about Amraphel, “king of Shinar,” who was part of an eastern league in war with Abraham and the residents of Transjordan. Shinar’s identification with a district of Babylon becomes clear in Israel’s exile. Shinar is the destination of Nebuchadnezzar’s new subjects (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.2">Dn 1:2</a>) and the place of Israel’s later rescue (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Zech.5.11">Zec 5:11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SHISHAK</p>
<p class="fl">Egyptian pharaoh, descendant of a powerful family of Libyan chieftains, and founder of Egypt’s 22d dynasty. His Egyptian name was Sheshonk. He was a contemporary of Solomon, Jeroboam, and Rehoboam. His years as ruler are variously given as 940–915 <span class="era">BC</span> or 935–914 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>During Solomon’s reign, he afforded asylum to Jeroboam, Solomon’s servant and subsequent adversary, who escaped to Egypt to avoid being killed by his lord, against whom he had rebelled (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.40">1 Kgs 11:40</a>). Since Jeroboam was to set up the northern kingdom after Solomon’s death—an event used by God to punish his people for Solomon’s sin—Shishak’s readiness to harbor the fugitive rebel played a part in God’s design to bring about his purposes.</p>
<p>God used Shishak a second time to further his plans. When Judah under Rehoboam became sinful and engaged in idolatrous practices, allowing male shrine prostitutes to operate in the land (a practice not to be equated with the phenomenon of homosexuality as presently known), God used Shishak’s invasion of Palestine to punish his people. This invasion took place in the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">1 Kgs 14:25</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.2-9">2 Chr 12:2-9</a>). A great number of Judean towns were taken, but God spared Jerusalem from being captured, when the princes and the king showed repentance and humbled themselves (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.7">2 Chr 12:7</a>). However, Shishak showed his mastery by plundering both the temple and royal palace in Jerusalem and by carrying off the gold shields that Solomon had made. Although the biblical account focuses on Shishak’s invasion of the Judean area only, extrabiblical data indicate that he also invaded the territory of Jeroboam, to whom he had previously given refuge.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SHITTIM* (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Site on the plains of Moab where the Israelites made their final Transjordan encampment after defeating Sihon and Og (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-35">Nm 21:21-35</a>) and prior to their crossing of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1">25:1</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Num.33.49">Numbers 33:49</a>, this camp was near the Jordan, spreading from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim. Here Abel-shittim appears to be the full name of the place, while Shittim is the more common abbreviated toponym.</p>
<p>At Shittim, Balak of Moab attempted to thwart the Israelite penetration of Canaan by hiring Balaam to curse the people of God (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Nm 22–24</a>), and later, apparently incited by Balaam’s counsel, Israel “played the harlot” with women from Midian and Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-5">25:1-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.31.15-16">31:15-16</a>). Israel’s apostasy, participating in idolatrous rites and engaging in ritual prostitution, was punished by Yahweh with the plague at Peor (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">Nm 25:1-18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.6-8">1 Cor 10:6-8</a>). Moses and Eleazar organized a census of the tribes while encamped at Shittim, and here Joshua was publicly proclaimed as Moses’ successor (<a href="?bref=Num.27.18-22">Nm 27:18-22</a>). Joshua dispatched two spies from Shittim to reconnoiter Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.1">Jos 2:1</a>); later the Israelites prepared for the river crossing by breaking camp at Shittim and traveling to the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.1">3:1</a>).</p>
<p>Outside the Hexateuch the place-name Shittim occurs only in <a href="?bref=Joel.3.18">Joel 3:18</a> and <a href="?bref=Mic.6.5">Micah 6:5</a>. The reference in Joel to the “valley of Shittim” or “wadi of the acacias” seems to be a symbol of barren aridity transformed into well-watered land when Yahweh restores his people in the eschaton, not a literal geographical location. Micah charges the people to remember “what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,” no doubt a reference to the crossing of the Jordan and the covenant promise of a land ultimately realized, as he recites the “saving acts” of Yahweh on Israel’s behalf.</p>

Some suggest that Shulammite refers to a woman from the city of Shunem. Her designation as Shunammite was perhaps changed to Shulammite for its similarity in sound to Solomon’s Hebrew name. Shunem was situated in the land of Issachar near Mt Gilboa (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.4">1 Sm 28:4</a>). It was from this city that Abishag the beautiful Shunammite woman was called to nurse King David in his later years (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-4,15">1 Kgs 1:1-4, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.17-22">2:17-22</a>).

<p class="h1">SHUNEM</p>
<p class="fl">Village of Issachar’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.18">Jos 19:18</a>) strategically located in the Jezreel Valley. Shunem (modern Sulem) is about three and a half miles (5.6 kilometers) north of Jezreel, situated on the outer hills of Mt Moreh. Both Shunem and Jezreel guard the eastern approach to the Jezreel Valley from Beth-shan through the valley of Harod. This strategic location explains the appearance of Shunem on city lists of various foreign invaders: the lists of Thutmose III (15th century <span class="era">BC</span>); the Amarna Letters (15th century <span class="era">BC</span>), which mention it in conjunction with Megiddo; and the tenth-century <span class="era">BC</span> record at Karnak of the Egyptian Shishak, who listed Shunem’s importance.</p>
<p>The Philistines used Shunem to launch their siege of the Israelite forces at Jezreel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.1-31.13">1 Sm 28–31</a>). Because Shunem was on a well-used route, Elijah frequented the town and even resided there (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.8">2 Kgs 4:8</a>). Later, Elijah raised a woman’s son from death (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.32-37">32-37</a>). During the latter years of the reign of David, a beautiful woman from Shunem named Abishag was summoned to care for the ailing king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.3,15">1 Kgs 1:3, 15</a>). After David’s death, Abishag appears in the story of the rivalry between Adonijah (David’s eldest son) and Solomon. Adonijah requests Abishag for his own, once Solomon gains the throne, but the king views his brother’s interest as presumption—and a possible attempt at his throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.13-25">2:13-25</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Location of the battle between four kings from Mesopotamia and five allied kings living near the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.3,8-10">Gn 14:3, 8-10</a>). The precise location of the battle in the vicinity of the Dead Sea has proved impossible to determine; one is left with conjectures. The valley is described as being full of tar pits (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.10">Gn 14:10</a>). This description suits the areas adjacent to the Salt or Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The account in Genesis describes an important military campaign believed to have occurred in the middle Bronze Age (c. 1900 <span class="era">BC</span>), which would place it at the time of Abraham. The kings mentioned in the coalition from the East are unknown, since the alleged link of Amraphel with Hammurabi is now considered untenable. These four allies came south from Damascus and conquered a series of cities, including Karnaim, Ham, and the Horites in Mt Seir, as far south as the Gulf of Elat. They then turned northwest to Kadesh-barnea and from there northeast toward the Dead Sea. This seems to be the locality where they met resistance from the coalition of the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.2-9">Gn 14:2-9</a>) south of the Dead Sea.</p>

<p class="fl">City on the Phoenician coast, between Beirut and Tyre; frequently called Zidon in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. The present town, Saida, is not regarded as a direct continuation of the ancient city but rather a development of post-Crusader times. The names Sidon and Sidonian appear 38 times in the OT, and Sidon occurs 12 times in the NT.</p>
<p>The relative antiquity of Byblos (Gebal, Jebeil), Tyre, and Sidon may be determined by the “table of nations” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Gn 10</a>), which names Sidon as the firstborn son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham. The territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon to Gaza and east to the Cities of the Plain.</p>
<p>Sidon is situated 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) north of Tyre, with which it is often associated (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.23.1-2">Is 23:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.47.4">Jer 47:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.21-22">Mt 11:21-22</a>); both were much concerned with commerce and industry. Sidon was built on a headland that jutted into the sea toward the southwest. It had two harbors, the northern one having inner and outer ports. Sidon was also a center for the manufacture of the purple dye made from the Murex shellfish.</p>
<p>The Bible mentions Sidon several times in connection with the conquest of Palestine. Joshua defeated the northern confederation under Jabin, king of Hazor, and pursued the enemy as far as “Great Sidon” (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.8">Jos 11:8</a>). Joshua also stated that the land of Israel included all of Lebanon, “even all the Sidonians” (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.4-6">13:4-6</a>). The tribal allotment of Asher extended as far north as “Sidon the Great” (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.28">19:28</a>), but Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Sidon (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Jgs 1:31</a>).</p>
<p>The gods of Sidon are listed among the foreign deities that Israel served (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.6">Jgs 10:6</a>); David’s census included Sidon and Tyre (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.6-7">2 Sm 24:6-7</a>); and during a famine in the time of Ahab, the prophet Elijah was sent to live at the home of a widow in Zarephath (Sarepta) in Sidon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.9">1 Kgs 17:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.25-26">Lk 4:25-26</a>). Sidon is referred to often by the Hebrew prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.2,4,12">Is 23:2, 4, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.22">Jer 25:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.3">27:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.47.4">47:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.8">Ez 27:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.4">Jl 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.2">Zec 9:2</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, Jesus healed the daughter of a woman of that area (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.21-28">Mt 15:21-28</a>). People came from as far away as Tyre and Sidon to hear Jesus and to be healed by him (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.17">Lk 6:17</a>). On Paul’s voyage to Rome to appear before Caesar, the ship made its first stop at Sidon, where the centurion, Julius, allowed Paul to go ashore to visit friends (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.3">Acts 27:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SIGN</p>
<p class="fl">Word connoting a visible event intended to convey meaning beyond that which is normally perceived in the outward appearance of the event.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In a few instances in the OT, “sign” refers to the observances of heavenly bodies in an astrological sense (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.14">Gn 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.2">Jer 10:2</a>), or to the “signs and wonders” as marks of the miraculous actions of God within the history of the world (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.34">Dt 4:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.22">6:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.10">Neh 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.27">Ps 105:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.20">Jer 32:20</a>). On other occasions, it is used as an insignia of the Mosaic covenant. Thus, the wearing of the law on the wrist and forehead and the keeping of the Sabbath are considered signs of the relationship between Israel and God (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.8">Dt 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.18">11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.12,20">Ez 20:12, 20</a>).</p>
<p>The most numerous and significant usages of “sign” appear in relation to the OT prophetic ministry. Beginning with Moses, signs are used to confirm that God has spoken to the prophet. Thus, when Moses received the message of deliverance that he was to bring to the children of Israel in Egypt and the pharaoh, he was given two signs: his staff was changed into a serpent and his hand was afflicted with leprosy (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.1-8">Ex 4:1-8</a>).</p>
<p>Signs and wonders were also used by false prophets. After a sign had been given and had come to pass, the leaders of Israel were to examine the message of the prophet to see if it led the people away from the true worship of God. If it did, the prophet who had given the sign was to be put to death (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-5">Dt 13:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>The character of the sign varies and often is miraculous. Some of the great miracles of the OT are prophetic signs—for example, the moving of the shadow back up the steps of Hezekiah’s palace to confirm Isaiah’s prediction that the king would recover from what was a mortal illness (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.8-9">2 Kgs 20:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.21-22">Is 38:21-22</a>). Often the sign is predictive only, and the people can know whether the prophet has spoken the truth by whether or not the event comes to pass—for example, the prophet’s foretelling the death of both of Eli’s sons on the same day (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.34">1 Sm 2:34</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.10">14:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.29">2 Kgs 19:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.30">Is 37:30</a>). Sometimes the sign was carefully timed, and the recipient was told that the appearance of the sign would show when to act to fulfill the prophetic message (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.7-9">1 Sm 10:7-9</a>). At other times, the events predicted were acted out in the life of the prophet. These symbolic actions demonstrated the truth of the prophet’s message—for example, Isaiah’s nakedness for three years to demonstrate the fate of those who preached trust in Egypt’s power (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.3">Is 20:3</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.3">Ez 4:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT occurrences are much like those in the OT. There are references to heavenly signs that will occur as indications of the end of time, and those with special knowledge will understand that the end is drawing near (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.3,30">Mt 24:3, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.4,22">Mk 13:4, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.11,25-26">Lk 21:11, 25-26</a>). These apocalyptic signs have no astrological connotations as in the OT. There is also mention of the sign as the seal of the covenant between God and Israel in reference to circumcision in <a href="?bref=Rom.4.11">Romans 4:11</a>.</p>
<p>As in the OT, the NT uses of signs are confirmations of the message given by God, and this message comes through the apostolic community to the church. Thus, there is great emphasis on the way God confirms the message of the apostles through their ability to perform signs and wonders (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.43">Acts 2:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.30">4:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.12">5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.13">8:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.3">14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.19">Rom 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.4">Heb 2:4</a>).</p>
<p>In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Jesus’ miracles are not called signs. Only in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.22">Acts 2:22</a> does Peter proclaim that Jesus’ message was attested by signs he performed. Rather, Jesus’ miracles are seen as acts of divine power and mercy. When the Jews ask for a sign, they are consistently refused, with the promise that the only sign they will receive is the sign of Jonah (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.38-39">Mt 12:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.1">16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.11-12">Mk 8:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.19,30">Lk 11:19, 30</a>), a sign that refers to the death and resurrection of the Christ. As Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">Mt 12:40</a>).</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, however, the miracles of Jesus are seen in a strikingly different light and are considered signs. Beginning with the changing of water into wine (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-11">Jn 2:1-11</a>), the miracles are called signs and are intended to lead those who see them to faith (v <a href="?bref=John.2.23">23</a>). Jesus even laments that the people will not believe unless they see signs (<a href="?bref=John.4.48">4:48</a>). John’s purpose in writing his Gospel is to present the signs of Jesus so that those who come to faith may do so through seeing these signs (<a href="?bref=John.20.30">20:30</a>). The signs in the Gospel are expressly chosen because they lend themselves to the development of true faith.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, the miracles of Jesus confirm the teaching of Jesus. In the synoptic Gospels, the miracles are seen as acts of mercy and divine power. In John they are carefully selected to demonstrate what Jesus has to tell the world about himself. In this respect, they are a bit like the symbolic actions of Isaiah and Ezekiel in that the action of the speaker dramatizes the message. After Jesus feeds the 5,000 with the five loaves of bread and the two fishes, he announces in the synagogue at Capernaum, “I am the bread of life which came down from heaven” (<a href="?bref=John.6.51">Jn 6:51</a>). He tells them not to labor for the bread of this world that perishes. In much the same way, the healing of the man born blind is bound up with Jesus’ teaching that he is the light of the world (<a href="?bref=John.9.5">9:5</a>). The resurrection of Lazarus prepares the way for Jesus to proclaim that he is the resurrection and the life (<a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>). In John’s Gospel the signs are not only a demonstration of divine power but also a revelation of Jesus’ divine character. In addition to confirming his divine message, they also proclaim his personhood and mission.</p>

<p class="h1">SIHON</p>
<p class="fl">King of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon, about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) east of the north end of the Dead Sea. His defeat by Israel under Moses, together with that of Og, king of Bashan, is frequently mentioned in OT prose and poetry, in narrative and song (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.4">Dt 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.26-37">2:26-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.46">4:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.29.7">29:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31.4">31:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.2.10">Jos 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.10">9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.2-6">12:2-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.10-12">13:10-12</a>). In the eyes of the sacred writers, this dual defeat is so significant that it can be ranked with the exodus as one of the singular manifestations of God’s saving intervention on behalf of his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.135.11">Pss 135:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.19-20">136:19-20</a>), and as evidence of his everlasting love for them. In the postexilic period this event is recalled in prayer as a pleading ground for God’s continuing mercy to the returned exiles (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.22">Neh 9:22</a>).</p>
<p>Before Israel’s arrival in Transjordan, Sihon had conquered Moab’s territory as far south as the Arnon River (<a href="?bref=Num.21.26">Nm 21:26</a>). This conquest gives rise to a piece of ancient poetry that is incorporated into sacred Scripture (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.27-30">27-30</a>). Sihon’s realm extends from the Arnon on the south to the Jabbok on the north, with the Jordan as its western boundary. It also includes the Jordan Valley as far as the Sea of Kinnereth (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.2-3">Jos 12:2-3</a>), comprising part of the region known as Gilead. On the east it extends toward the desert and touches on Ammonite land.</p>
<p>Sihon’s refusal to grant Israel passage through his domain is similar to that of Edom (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.21.23">Nm 21:23</a> with <a href="?bref=Num.20.20">20:20</a>). However, Sihon exhibits overt hostility toward Israel. Sihon was defeated and killed at Jahaz; his country was occupied by Israel. Subsequently, it was distributed to the tribes of Gad and Reuben (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.32.33-38">Nm 32:33-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.10">Jos 13:10</a>).</p>

  <title>Silas</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SILAS</p>
<p class="fl">Respected leader in the Jerusalem church, also called Silvanus (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.19">2 Cor 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1 Thes 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.1">2 Thes 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.12">1 Pt 5:12</a>). “Silas” is most likely the Aramaic form of the Hebrew name “Saul,” which when given a Latin form became <span class="ital">Silouanos</span> (Silvanus). Silas thus carried two names—a Latin and a shorter, Semitic name. The name was known in the Hellenistic era and appears in various inscriptions. Luke used the name Silas when he narrated the history of the Jerusalem church in Acts. Paul and Peter used the Roman name in their epistles.</p>
<p>Silas is introduced in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.22">Acts 15:22</a> as a distinguished delegate who conveyed to Antioch the decree of the Jerusalem Council. Several manuscripts (of lesser quality than the best-attested ones) include <a href="?bref=Acts.15.34">15:34</a>; this added verse indicates that Silas remained in Antioch because shortly thereafter he joined Paul on his second missionary tour (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.40">Acts 15:40</a>). His service as a prophet may be evident in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a>, when the Spirit redirected the company through Asia. Silas’s name appears eight times within the second tour (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.19,25,29">Acts 16:19, 25, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.4,10,14-15">17:4, 10, 14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.5">18:5</a>), as he accompanied Paul through the hardships suffered at Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. When Paul was safely ushered out of Macedonia by the Berean Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.14">17:14</a>), Silas remained behind with Timothy to oversee the work already begun in the region. Later in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.5">18:5</a>), Silas and Timothy rejoined Paul. Their report prompted Paul to correspond with the church at Thessalonica. This explains Silas’s name in the prescript of both 1 and 2 Thessalonians.</p>
<p>It seems clear that Silas was well known to the Corinthians. Not only does he stay in the city with Paul for a year and a half (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.11">Acts 18:11</a>), but it may be conjectured that he stayed behind in Corinth after the dispute before Gallio. Paul, on his final tour, wrote to Corinth from Ephesus and mentioned Silas again (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.19">2 Cor 1:19</a>), reminding the Corinthians of the earlier ministry among them.</p>
<p>The subsequent history of Silas is obscure. Some believe Silas was a respected Christian scribe. Silas’s involvement in 1 and 2 Thessalonians is often mentioned, pointing to Paul’s sustained use of the first person plural. Some scholars find resemblances among 1 and 2 Thessalonians, the decree of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>, and 1 Peter, where Silas is mentioned as a scribe (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.12">1 Pt 5:12</a>). This latter association with Peter is intriguing and has led to the speculation that Silas ultimately joined Peter and ministered in north Asia.</p>

<p class="h1">SILOAM, Pool of</p>
<p class="fl">Pool mentioned in <a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">John 9</a>. Jesus, after anointing with clay the eyes of a blind man, directed him to go and wash in the pool. The man obeyed. He washed and came back with his sight fully restored.</p>
<p>The pool of Siloam of NT days marked the emergence of Hezekiah’s tunnel, dug during the threat of the Assyrian invasion about 700 <span class="era">BC</span>. This tunnel is S-shaped and is described both in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kings 20:20</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.2-4">2 Chronicles 32:2-4</a>. Archaeologists found an inscription in the tunnel consisting of Hebrew letters chiseled into the side of the tunnel indicating the progress and the meeting place of the two groups of workmen (each of which had started on one side and worked their way to the middle). This inscription has since been removed and is now in the museum in Istanbul. The ancient Hebrew reads:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">When the tunnel was driven through . . . each man toward his fellow, and while there were still three cubits to be cut through—the voice of a man calling to his fellow. . . . And when the tunnel was driven through, the quarrymen hewed, each toward his fellow, axe against axe; and the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1200 cubits, and the height of the rock above the heads of the quarrymen was 100 cubits.</p>
<p class="sp">The purpose of the pool originally was to bring water inside the city walls and deny it to invaders of Jerusalem. It flowed through the temple mount to the inner part of the city, where it was accessible to the residents. Water from Gihon Spring flows through the tunnel, emerges at the pool (also called the King’s Pool in <a href="?bref=Neh.2.14">Neh 2:14</a> and the pool of Shelah in <a href="?bref=Neh.3.15">3:15</a>), continues down the valley through the ancient area of the king’s gardens, reenters the Kidron Valley, and makes its way toward the Dead Sea south of the Essene site at Qumran. The Gihon Spring, the only natural source of water in Jerusalem, is a copious perennial stream. This, together with a rugged terrain, explains the strength of Jerusalem and the reason why it had been chosen for a place of habitation since the early Bronze Age.</p>
<p>Siloam now lies outside the old city of Jerusalem. The pool today measures 50 feet (15.2 meters) long and 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide and lies 16 steps below street level. A Byzantine church stood over the pool until it was destroyed by the Persians in <span class="era">AD</span> 614.</p>

  <title>Simeon, Tribe of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SIMEON, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 12 tribes of Israel descended from Jacob’s second son. Because of Simeon’s evil deed at Shechem, Jacob foretold that Simeon’s descendants would be dispersed among the other tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.7">Gn 49:7</a>).</p>
<p>According to the book of Joshua, Simeon’s inheritance was included in Judah’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.1,9">Jos 19:1, 9</a>). <a href="?bref=Judg.1.3">Judges 1:3</a> points to a close bond between the tribes of Simeon and Judah—they march and fight together as brothers to establish themselves in Canaan. In addition, the list of Levitical towns included Simeon’s with Judah’s (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.9-16">Jos 21:9-16</a>). Inevitably, then, the Simeonites were linked to the kingdom of Judah throughout the period of the monarchy, and its tribal destiny was tied to that of the southern division of the divided monarchy. However, in spite of their minor inheritance within Judah’s tribe, the Simeonites were able to preserve to some extent their own tribal identity, unity, and traditions, as indicated by the keeping of genealogical records, even to the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.24-42">1 Chr 4:24-42</a>).</p>
<p>During Hezekiah’s reign, Simeonites took possession of and settled the Arab areas of Seir (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.24-43">1 Chr 4:24-43</a>) and perhaps the hill country of Ephraim (<a href="?bref=2Chr.15.9">2 Chr 15:9</a>). Although Simeon was Jacob’s second-oldest son, his progeny never achieved a position of prominence in Israel, either before or after the conquest and occupation of Canaan. For example, the tribe apparently provided no judges, and the Song of Deborah contains no references to this group (see <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Jgs 5</a>). According to <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.28-33">1 Chronicles 4:28-33</a>, Simeon’s tribe settled in the southern extremes of Canaan (called the Negev in Hebrew)—an extensive region, consisting largely of dry, parched land, but with an annual rainfall and perennial springs that ensured fertility in the early summer. This explains why Simeon’s territory is also called “the Negev of Judah,” a phrase that serves to differentiate them from other racial groups occupying parts of southern Canaan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.10">1 Sm 27:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.14">30:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.7">2 Sm 24:7</a>).</p>
<p>The genealogies of the Simeonites reveal a certain amount of intermarriage with other Israelite tribes and, indeed, with non-Israelites as well.

<p class="fl">Greek form of a Hebrew/Aramaic name meaning “God has heard.” Nine men in the NT had this name:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Son of Jona (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Mt 16:17</a>) or John (<a href="?bref=John.1.42">Jn 1:42</a>), Andrew’s brother (v <a href="?bref=John.1.40">40</a>), and surnamed Cephas and Peter (respectively Aramaic and Greek, for “rock,” v <a href="?bref=John.1.42">42</a>) by Jesus. A fisherman of Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.16">Mk 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.44">Jn 1:44</a>), he became an apostle of Jesus and author of two NT letters bearing his name. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=PetertheApostle_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Peter, The Apostle</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Brother of Jesus, named with other brothers, James, Joses or Joseph, and Judas (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Leper, perhaps cured by Jesus, in whose house at Bethany Jesus and his disciples were eating when a woman poured an alabaster flask of costly ointment on the Lord’s head. Over the disciples’ objections against the waste of what could have been sold to support the poor, Jesus commended the act as a wonderful thing (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">Mt 26:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9">Mk 14:3-9</a>). From <a href="?bref=John.12.1-8">John 12:1-8</a> it appears that Simon’s house was also the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, but their relationship to Simon is uncertain.</p>
<p class="list">4. Man of Cyrene, a district of North Africa, whom the Romans forced to carry Jesus’ cross (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.32">Mt 27:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.21">Mk 15:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.26">Lk 23:26</a>). He was the father of Alexander and Rufus (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.21">Mk 15:21</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.16.13">Rom 16:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Apostle of Jesus called a Zealot (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Lk 6:15</a>), presumably because of prior association either with the party of political extremists by that name, who adopted terrorism to oppose the Roman occupation of Palestine, or with one of a number of Jewish groups noted for their zeal for the law. In <a href="?bref=Matt.10.4">Matthew 10:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mark 3:18</a> he is designated the “Cananaean” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>)—from the Aramaic word for “zealot.” He is mentioned again in <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a> as one of the 11 apostles in Jerusalem after Jesus’ ascension. Otherwise, the NT is silent about him.</p>
<p class="list">6. Pharisee whose treatment of Jesus evoked the parable of the two debtors (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">Lk 7:36-50</a>). He invited Jesus to eat at his house but withheld courtesies customary for guests and disapproved of Jesus’ acceptance of a “sinner” woman who wet the Lord’s feet with her tears, dried them with her hair, and anointed them with ointment from an alabaster flask. Jesus’ parable contrasted the woman’s act of loving and repentant faith with Simon’s unloving and self-righteous skepticism.</p>
<p class="list">7. Father of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus in Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=John.6.71">Jn 6:71</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.2,26">13:2, 26</a>).</p>
<p class="list">8. Magician (often called Simon Magus) of great repute in Samaria. Impressed by the signs and miracles performed by Philip the deacon-become-evangelist, he joined the crowd of baptized believers. He offered Peter and John money in exchange for the gift of the Holy Spirit, provoking Peter’s emphatic rebuke (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.9-24">Acts 8:9-24</a>). From the association of this incident with his name, the English word “simony” is derived; it denotes the sale or purchase of church positions, or any profiteering from sacred things.</p>
<p class="list">9. Tanner of Joppa. Peter lodged at his house for many days (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.43">Acts 9:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.6,17,32">10:6, 17, 32</a>). On Simon’s housetop, Peter experienced the vision of a great sheet let down from heaven, containing animals and birds prohibited as food in Jewish law (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.15">10:15</a>). Peter later recognized this vision as his preparation for consenting to preach the gospel to the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.10.28-29">28-29</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SIMON MACCABEUS</p>
<p class="fl">The second son of Mattathias was successor to his brother Jonathan. In 142 <span class="era">BC</span> Simon (d. 135 <span class="era">BC</span>) negotiated a treaty with Syria by supporting Demetrius II against the plunderer Trypho. Under this treaty, Judea was recognized as politically independent. The Syrians were finally driven from the citadel at Jerusalem and “the yoke of the Gentiles was removed from Israel” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.13.41">1 Macc 13:41</a>). In 141 <span class="era">BC</span> “the Jews and their priests decided that Simon should be their leader and high priest forever until a trustworthy prophet should arise” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.41">14:41</a>). These two offices were made hereditary in the Hasmonean family. Simon Maccabeus is considered perhaps the best leader of Israel in the postexilic period. Antiochus VII invaded Israel in 133 <span class="era">BC</span> and was defeated by Simon’s sons, Judas and John, at Modin. This was the single interruption in six years of prosperous rule. Simon and his sons were assassinated by his son-in-law and chief rival for power, Ptolemy son of Abub. John Hyrcanus (d. 104 <span class="era">BC</span>), Simon’s youngest son, escaped and succeeded to his father’s position before Ptolemy could reach Jerusalem. John ruled from 134 to 104 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="h1">SIN</p>
<p class="fl">Evildoing that is not only against humanity, society, others, or oneself, but against God. The concept of God, therefore, gives to the idea of sin its many-sided meaning. Other gods, conceived of as capricious and characterless, exercised unlimited power in unbridled behavior; they engendered no such sense of sin as did Israel’s one God, holy, righteous, and utterly good. This religious conception of wrongdoing with the terminology it created persists into the NT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Terminology">Terminology</p>
<p class="fl">Israel’s God sets the ideal, the standard for human behavior. The most frequent biblical words for sin speak of violating that standard in some fashion. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">hata’</span> and Greek <span class="greek">hamartia</span> meant originally “to miss the mark, fail in duty” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">Rom 3:23</a>). As Lawgiver, God sets limits to man’s freedom; another frequent term (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">‘abar</span><span class="ital">;</span> Greek, <span class="greek">parabasis</span>) describes sin as “transgression,” “overstepping set limits.” Similar terms are <span class="hebrew">pesha‘</span> (Hebrew), meaning “rebellion,” “transgression”; <span class="hebrew">’asham</span> (Hebrew) denotes “trespassing God’s kingly prerogative,” “incurring guilt”; <span class="greek">paraptoma</span> (Greek) denotes “a false step out of the appointed way,” “trespass on forbidden ground.” “Iniquity” often translates <span class="hebrew">‘aon</span> (Hebrew, meaning “perverseness,” “wrongness”), for which the nearest NT equivalent is <span class="greek">anomia</span> (Greek, “lawlessness”) or <span class="greek">paranomia</span> (Greek, “lawbreaking”).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Genesis traces sin to deliberate misuse of God-given freedom in disobedience of a single limiting prohibition. Ezekiel insists eloquently upon individual responsibility against traditional theories of corporate guilt (<a href="?bref=Ezek.18.1-32">Ez 18</a>). Following Jeremiah, he urges the need for a cleansed, renewed inner life if outward behavior is to be reformed; the divine law must become a motivating force within a person if sin is to be overcome (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.29-34">Jer 31:29-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.24-29">Ez 36:24-29</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a> offers a keen analysis of the inner meaning of sin. By affirming “in sin did my mother conceive me,” the psalmist confessed that his life had been sinful from the first. His whole personality needed “purging”; he was defiled. Ritual sacrifices offer no solution. Only a broken, contrite heart can prepare a sinner for God’s cleansing. The only hope, the sole ground of appeal, lies in God’s steadfast love and abundant mercy. In spite of its rigorous view of sin, the OT also contains gracious assurance of forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.8-14">Ps 103:8-14</a> <a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.6-7">55:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="InJesusTeachings">In Jesus’ Teachings</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus’ teachings on the subject of sin took up the gracious offer of divine forgiveness and renewal, not only proclaiming with authority, “Your sins are forgiven,” but showing many acts of compassion and social recognition that he came to be the friend of sinners, calling them to repentance, restoring their hope and dignity (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.1-13">Mt 9:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.19">11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.1-32">Lk 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.1-10">19:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus said little about the origin of sin, except to trace it to the human heart and will (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.22-23">Mt 6:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.7.17-19">7:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.7">18:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.20-23">Mk 7:20-23</a>), but he significantly redefined sin’s scope. Where the law could assess only people’s actions, Jesus showed that anger, contempt, lust, hardness of heart, and deceitfulness are also sinful. He also spoke of sins of neglect, good left undone, the barren tree, the unused talent, the priest ignoring the injured, and the love never shown (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41-46">Mt 25:41-46</a>). He especially condemns sins against love—unbrotherliness, implacable hostility, selfishness, insensitivity (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.16-21">Lk 12:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">16:19-31</a>). And he condemned self-righteousness and spiritual blindness (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.16-26">Mt 23:16-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.22-30">Mk 3:22-30</a>). Jesus spoke of sin as sickness (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.17">Mk 2:17</a>) and sometimes as folly (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.20">Lk 12:20</a>). Nevertheless, Jesus declared that fallen humans can be cured with God’s help (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">7:36-50</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="InJohnsWritings">In John’s Writings</p>
<p class="fl">John’s Gospel assumes sinful humanity’s need, the sacrifice of Christ the Lamb to bear away the sin of the world, and the offer of light and life in Christ. The new note is an emphasis on sin that refuses to accept the salvation provided in Christ, by the love of God for the world—the refusal to believe. It is for loving darkness, rejecting light, and refusing to accept Christ the Savior that humans are judged already (<a href="?bref=John.3.16-21">Jn 3:16-21</a>).</p>
<p>Against Gnosticism’s claim that for advanced Christians sin does not matter, 1 John affirms 15 reasons why sin cannot be tolerated in the Christian life and emphasizes again that sin is both ignorance of the truth and lack of love (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.3-10">1 Jn 3:3-10</a>). Yet God forgives those who confess their sins, while Christ atones for their sins and intercedes for them (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7-2.2">1:7–2:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="InPaulsWritings">In Paul’s Writings</p>
<p class="fl">Paul argued strongly, from observation and from Scripture, that all have sinned (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-3.31">Rom 1–3</a>). To him, sin is a force, a power, a “law” ruling within people (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.21">Rom 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.7.23">7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.2">8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.56">1 Cor 15:56</a>), producing all kinds of evil behavior—the hardening of the conscience (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.21-24">Rom 7:21-24</a>), alienation from God, and subjection to death (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.10">Rom 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.23">6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.1-5,12">Eph 2:1-5, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.21">Col 1:21</a>). Humans are helpless to reform themselves (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.24">Rom 7:24</a>). Paul’s explanation of this desperate, universal condition is variously interpreted. Some readers think that <a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Romans 5:12-21</a> says that Adam’s sin is the source of all sin; others, that it is the “similitude” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) of all sin. In any event, Paul essentially said that “every man is his own Adam,” which means that each person is fully responsible for his or her sinful condition, even if the sinful nature was inherited from Adam.</p>
<p>The solution to sin, for Paul, lies in the believer’s death with Christ—death to sin, self, the world. Concurrently, the new life of the invasive, effusive Spirit transforms one’s life from within, making each person a new creation by sanctifying the personality into the likeness of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-26">Rom 3:21-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.6-9">5:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-4,28-29">8:1-4, 28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14-21">2 Cor 5:14-21</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Name of the mountain where God met Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments and the rest of the law.

<p>The name is probably related to Sin (wilderness of) and may even be an alternate spelling (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.16.1">Ex 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.11-12">Nm 33:11-12</a>).

<p>The traditional location of Mt Sinai is among the mountains at the southern end of the Sinai Peninsula. Since at least the fourth century, Christians have venerated Jebel Musa (Mt Moses in Arabic) as the site where God molded the families of Jacob into the nation of Israel. A Greek Orthodox monastery of St Catherine at the base of the 7,500-foot (2,286-meters) peak has been there for over 1,500 years. Other candidates for the holy mountain have been the nearby Jebel Katerina (8,670 feet, or 2,642.6 meters) and Jebel Serbal (6,800 feet, or 2,072.6 meters). Some scholars prefer a northern location near Kadesh-barnea, while others argue for a volcanic mountain across the gulf to the east in ancient Midian or Arabia (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">Ex 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.25">Gal 4:25</a>).</p>
<p>Most references to Sinai are in Exodus (13 times), Leviticus (5 times), and Numbers (12 times) because these are the books that report the giving of the law and the two-year encampment of the Israelites on the plains adjacent to the mountain. <a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-25">Exodus 19</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.34.1-35">34</a> especially are replete with references because these are the chapters that describe the encounters between Moses and Yahweh on the two occasions when the law was actually given.</p>
<p>In both the OT and NT, Sinai came to represent the place where God came down to his people. In the blessing of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.2">Dt 33:2</a>), the song of Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.5">Jgs 5:5</a>), <a href="?bref=Ps.68.1-35">Psalm 68</a> (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.68.8,17">8, 17</a>), the confession of the Levites in the time of Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.13">Neh 9:13</a>), and the speech of Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.30,38">Acts 7:30, 38</a>), Sinai was remembered as the scene of that momentous encounter. Paul, in <a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-26">Galatians 4:21-26</a>, spells out an allegory in which Mt Sinai represents the old covenant, slavery, and the present city of Jerusalem. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Paran_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Paran</a>; <a href="?item=Shur_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Shur</a>; <a href="?item=SinWildernessof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Sin, Wilderness of</a>; <a href="?item=CommandmentstheTen_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Commandments, The Ten</a>; <a href="?item=WildernessWanderings_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Wilderness Wanderings</a>; <a href="?item=ZinWildernessof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Zin, Wilderness of</a>.</p>

  <title>Sinlessness of Christ*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SINLESSNESS OF CHRIST*</p>
<p class="fl">The Scripture (quoted here from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>) leaves no question that Christ is regarded as sinless. He is declared to be the perfect Son of God in every respect. His human nature is holy, without any sin. This is repeatedly and explicitly affirmed in unmistakable terms. Paul states that Christ “knew no sin” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>). Peter says “he committed no sin; no guile was found on his lips” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.22">1 Pt 2:22</a>); he calls him “righteous” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a>). The writer to the Hebrews says that Christ is “holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">Heb 7:26</a>). James speaks of him as “the righteous man” (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.6">Jas 5:6</a>), and John affirms that “in him there is no sin” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.5">1 Jn 3:5</a>). In the Gospels and in the apostolic preaching, Jesus is repeatedly witnessed to as the Holy Son of God, the Holy One of God, the Holy and Righteous One (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">Lk 1:35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.69">Jn 6:69</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.14">Acts 3:14</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus was able to ask his enemies with penetrating conviction, “Which of you convicts me of sin?” (<a href="?bref=John.8.46">Jn 8:46</a>). He gives ample evidence of a holy self-consciousness throughout his entire lifetime. Numerous references and inferences are made to his exemption from the unrighteousness of sin and disobedience. He kept the entire law in every detail and in each respect (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.4">Rom 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">Heb 4:15</a>). Pilate’s wife regarded Jesus as a righteous man, and Pilate himself spoke of him as an innocent man (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.19,24">Mt 27:19, 24</a>). Even Judas realized that he himself had sinned by “betraying innocent blood” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.4">Mt 27:4</a>).</p>
<p>The issue of Christ’s sinlessness is not confined merely to the fact that he did not commit any sin. There is a deeper theological significance to the question, which has to do with the issue of whether Christ was at all able to sin. Was it even possible for him to sin? This concern has been spoken of in theology as his impeccability (Christ was unable to sin), or on the contrary position, his peccability (Christ was able to sin, even though he did not exercise his will in this direction). The problems on both of these views appear immediately: If Christ was unable to sin, how could he really have been tempted (and we have ample data in Scripture concerning Jesus’ temptations)? If Christ could have sinned, even though he did not do so, does this mean that God can sin (for Christ was in every respect fully the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity)? It is useless to say that Jesus could have sinned with respect to his human nature but not so with respect to his divine nature, because this ignores the indissoluble unity of the person of the God-man. We may not separate the human nature from the divine nature, as though in his humanity he could have acted independently of his divinity. This was, in part, the error of the ancient Nestorian heretics. Whatever the Son of God does, he does with and in his entire divine-human nature.</p>
<p>Essentially, there is no contradiction between being tempted and being unable to sin. Of course, it is difficult for us to imagine how this can be possible. This is because we are sinners and stand within the experiential knowledge of evil. Christ’s person is absolutely unique; we can little imagine how real were his temptations by the devil in the wilderness and throughout his life (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.28,39-46">Lk 22:28, 39-46</a>), even though it was impossible for him to actually sin.</p>
<p>Perhaps an illustration may be helpful. Let us imagine there is an absolutely impregnable fortress that cannot be taken by the enemy as long as the defenses are maintained. (If we may, for the purpose of illustration, let us rule out the terrible destructive forces of modern warfare.) Because the fortress is incapable of being taken by assault and is in reality unconquerable, as long as the defenses are kept up, it does not mean that it cannot be besieged and furiously attacked. So it may be with respect to the reality of Christ’s temptations and his inability to sin as the Holy Son of God.</p>
<p>His temptations were real. Therefore, “we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need” (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.15-16">Heb 4:15-16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SLAVE, SLAVERY</p>
<p class="fl">Person owned as property by another, and the relationship that bound the owner and the slave. Slavery was widespread in the ancient Near East, although the economy was not dependent upon it. By Roman times, slavery was so extensive that in the early Christian period one out of every two people was a slave. From at least 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>, captives in war were the primary source of slaves (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.21">Gn 14:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.9">Nm 31:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.14">Dt 20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.30">Jgs 5:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.9">1 Sm 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.2">2 Kgs 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.8">2 Chr 28:8</a>).</p>
<p>Slaves could be purchased locally from other owners or from foreign traveling merchants who sold slaves along with cloth, bronzeware, and other goods (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.4-8">Jl 3:4-8</a>). Joseph was sold by Midianites and Ishmaelites to an Egyptian (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.36">Gn 37:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.39.1">39:1</a>) in this manner. Debt was the basic cause for many families being reduced to slavery; an entire family could be subject to slavery (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1">2 Kgs 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.5.5-8">Neh 5:5-8</a>). The law code of Hammurabi stipulated a maximum of three years of slavery for the family (Section 117), as opposed to a maximum of six years under Hebrew law (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.18">Dt 15:18</a>). Voluntary slavery was widespread as a means of escape from abject poverty and starvation (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-48">Lv 25:47-48</a>). Selling a kidnapped person into slavery, the crime of Joseph’s brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.27-28">Gn 37:27-28</a>), was a capital offense under the law code of Hammurabi (Section 14) and the Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.11">Ex 21:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.7">Dt 24:7</a>).</p>
<p>In Sumerian society, slaves had legal rights, could borrow money, and could engage in business. As the normal price for a slave was probably less than that for a strong donkey, the slave always had the hope that he could save sufficient money to purchase his freedom. Slaves performed tedious labor on farms and in households, though some gifted individuals occupied executive positions in households. Despite provisions in ancient law, the release of slaves was not always honored on schedule. A Hebrew who voluntarily entered slavery was normally released the next jubilee year, and theoretically no Hebrew could be enslaved for life (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.2">Ex 21:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.10-13">Lv 25:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.12-14">Dt 15:12-14</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelites made a deliberate attempt to safeguard the slave from brutality by a master or overseer. By law, a maimed slave had to be released (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.26-27">Ex 21:26-27</a>). The few Hebrew slaves in a household frequently toiled alongside their masters in the fields, and they and household slaves often had a reasonable and secure existence, compared with the threat of starvation and destitution of the poorest free men.</p>
<p>In Greek and especially in Roman times, when the number of slaves increased dramatically, household slaves remained the best treated. Many became servants and confidants; some even established good businesses to their own and their masters’ benefit.</p>
<p>Information from Ur, Nuzi, and the book of Genesis shows that where a wife was childless, the female slave could bear the master’s child (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.2-4">Gn 16:2-4</a>). Legally a Hebrew master could agree to marry a young female slave, have his own son marry her, or establish her as a concubine. If subsequently she was discarded, or if the agreement was not fulfilled, she would be released from her slavery (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.7-11">Ex 21:7-11</a>). Conquered people were required to perform forced labor for the state (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.31">2 Sm 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15,21-23">1 Kgs 9:15, 21-23</a>), including the Israelites themselves in Lebanon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.13-18">1 Kgs 5:13-18</a>). Captured in war, the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Num.31.28-30,47">Nm 31:28-30, 47</a>) and Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.23-25">Jos 9:23-25</a>) were made slaves to serve the temple. The practice continued through the reigns of David and Solomon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.58">Ezr 2:58</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.20">8:20</a>). Nehemiah records that foreign slaves helped make repairs on the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.26,31">Neh 3:26, 31</a>).</p>
<p>The NT attitude toward slavery indicates that the status of a slave was more like that of a servant and that the institution of slavery generally was declining. There was no strong opposition to slavery from Jesus or the apostles, but an admonition that slaves and servants should serve their masters faithfully and that masters should treat their slaves humanely and fairly (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.9">Eph 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.1">Col 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.2">1 Tm 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.16">Phlm 1:16</a>). Paul never preached against slavery, but he personally tried to attain freedom for the slave Onesimus from his Christian master, Philemon (see the discussion on this in Philemon, Letter to).</p>

<p class="fl">The sleep that the human body needs is seen as a precious gift of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.4.8">Pss 4:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.127.2">127:2</a>). Sleep may be withheld, as God chooses and to serve his purposes (<a href="?bref=Esth.6.1">Est 6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.6.18">Dn 6:18</a>). God may also, to fulfill his purposes, give people deep sleep (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.21">Gn 2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.12">15:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.12">1 Sm 26:12</a>), and during a person’s sleep, God may make his will known by a dream or vision (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.28.11-16">Gn 28:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.4.13-17">Jb 4:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.20-24">Mt 1:20-24</a>).</p>
<p>Several statements in the book of Proverbs rebuke the lack of discipline of life shown in the undue love of sleep. For example, one proverb says, “If you love sleep, you will end in poverty. Keep your eyes open, and there will be plenty to eat!” (<a href="?bref=Pr.20.13">Prv 20:13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; see also <a href="?bref=Pr.6.9-11">6:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.5">10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.24.32-34">24:32-34</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="MoralorSpiritualInactivity">Moral or Spiritual Inactivity</p>
<p class="fl">In a figurative way, sleep is used as a symbol of laziness, carelessness, or inactivity. <a href="?bref=Isa.56.10">Isaiah 56:10</a> speaks of those who failed in their responsibility as leaders of God’s people: “They love to lie there, love to sleep, to dream” (<span class="sc">tlb</span>). In the NT those who are the Lord’s servants are called to watch and to be sure that when their Master comes he will not find them sleeping (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.35-37">Mk 13:35-37</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Matt.25.1-13">Mt 25:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.40-46">26:40-46</a>). Likewise, the challenge to maintain spiritual alertness and to refrain from sleep comes in a number of places in the epistles: “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light” (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.14">Eph 5:14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>); “So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Watch for his return and stay sober” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.6">1 Thes 5:6</a>, <span class="sc">tlb</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Death">Death</p>
<p class="fl">Very frequently, the Bible speaks of death as sleep. Commonly in the OT, when a person dies, he is said to go to sleep with his fathers (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.31.16">Dt 31:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.12">2 Sm 7:12</a>). Jesus spoke of death as sleep (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.24">Mt 9:24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.11">Jn 11:11</a>). So did the apostle Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.30">1 Cor 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20,51">15:20, 51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-14">1 Thes 4:13-14</a>). In some of these references, it would seem that it is the temporary nature of death that is the reason why it is spoken of as sleep. Even in <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Daniel 12:2</a> it is said that death is a sleep, until the dead “rise up, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt” (<span class="sc">tlb</span>). This is made more specific in many passages in the NT. When, however, we consider the full teaching of the Bible on the meaning of death for the Christian, we need to give full weight to such passages as <a href="?bref=Luke.23.43">Luke 23:43</a>, <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.8">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>, and <a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Philippians 1:23</a>, and especially <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.13-14">1 Thessalonians 5:13-14</a>. In the first of these Jesus says to the dying thief on the cross, “Today you will be with me in paradise,” and in the second Paul speaks of death for him as going to “be with Christ.”</p>

<p class="h1">SMITH</p>
<p class="fl">Worker in metals; a blacksmith. The earliest metalworker mentioned in the Bible is Tubal-cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.22">Gn 4:22</a>). The term covers metalworkers of all kinds: copper, bronze, iron, silver, and gold. Silversmiths are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Judg.17.4">Judges 17:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.19.24">Acts 19:24</a>. Ironsmiths were rare or even nonexistent in Israel up to the time of Samuel, and the Israelites had to go to the Philistine smiths to have their iron tools sharpened (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19">1 Sm 13:19</a>). In the days of the kings, Israelite smiths were active and were subsequently taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.14-16">2 Kgs 24:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.24.1">Jer 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.2">29:2</a>).

The smiths mentioned in <a href="?bref=Zech.1.20">Zechariah 1:20</a> are probably ironsmiths or blacksmiths.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Smyrna">
  <title>Smyrna</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SMYRNA</p>
<p class="fl">Location of one of the seven churches mentioned in the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.11">Rv 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.8-11">2:8-11</a>). It is the modern Izmir, located in Turkey.</p>
<p>Smyrna was inhabited at least 3,000 years before Christ. The Aeolian Greeks were replaced by the Ionians. The city, along with Miletus and Ephesus to the south, flourished under Ionian dominance. The city was conquered by the Lydians, whose capital was Sardis. The site was left in ruins for nearly three centuries until its refounding by Alexander the Great in 334 <span class="era">BC</span> at a site farther south along the gulf. Although built by the energy of the Seleucids, the city recognized the coming dominance of Pergamum and entered into an alliance with its king. Later, with remarkable foresight, she transferred her allegiance to Rome, and in 195 <span class="era">BC</span> built a temple in which Rome was worshiped as a deity. As a reward for Smyrna’s early commitment to the rising Roman influence, the city prospered under Roman rule, partly as a rival to Pergamum and partly as a rival to the prosperous island of Rhodes. Because they had been an ally of the Romans, the people of Smyrna thought it would be to their credit to build (in <span class="era">AD</span> 26) a temple in which the Roman emperor would be honored. This city became the seat of the Caesar cult that afflicted the church so seriously during the latter half of the first century.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rev.2.8">Revelation 2:8</a> speaks of the city as being “dead and then alive,” a possible allusion to the period of 300 years when it lay devastated until revived by Alexander and the Macedonians. Ancient writers, including Appollonius and Aristides, spoke of Smyrna as having the “crown of life.” This was a way of describing the hilltop behind the city as if it crowned Smyrna on top, with its feet at the seashore. The promise of “the crown of life” to the Smyrnean believers probably plays off this image. This promise was given to those believers in Smyrna who would remain faithful through persecution. The reference to the “synagogue of Satan” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.9">Rv 2:9</a>) and to the devil putting them in prison (v <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">10</a>) reflects the tribulation probably experienced under the Roman emperor Domitian (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 95). It became a crime punishable by death to refuse to worship the image of the Roman emperor as “lord.” Many Christians were compelled to choose between “Caesar as Lord” or “Jesus as Lord.” To choose Jesus was to choose martyrdom.</p>

<p class="list">1. One of 14 cities located in the Shephelah, in the territory allotted to Judah’s tribe; it is listed between Adullam and Azekah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.35">Jos 15:35</a>). Jerome, in his Latin translation of Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Onomasticon</span> (157:18–20), states that there were two settlements, one on the mountain and another on the plain. The description fits exactly the situation at Khirbet esh-Shuweikeh, a Roman-Byzantine site on the southern edge of the vale of Elah; just beside it to the east is a lofty mound with heavy fortifications from the Israelite period, called Khirbet ‘Abbad. Socoh guarded the junction between two wadis that join to form the vale of Elah, a passageway to the central hill country, to Bethlehem or Hebron, respectively. This situation provides the background for <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1">1 Samuel 17:1</a>, when David killed Goliath during Saul’s reign over Israel; the Philistines lined up their troops beside Socoh and extended toward Azekah. The Israelites were on the opposite ridge with the creekbed of the vale of Elah in between.</p>
<p class="list-text">Rehoboam included Socoh in his network of fortifications designed to place forces on the main lines of communication throughout his kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.7">2 Chr 11:7</a>). The town apparently remained in Judah’s hands from the tenth to the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, at which time the Philistines, moving against King Ahaz, took it and several other key towns on the approach routes (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.18">2 Chr 28:18</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in the southernmost district of the Judean hill region (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.48">Jos 15:48</a>). The reference to Soco in <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.18">1 Chronicles 4:18</a> in the genealogy of the sons of Caleb may refer to this same place. It is identifiable with another Khirbet Shuweikeh located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of Hebron.</p>
<p class="list">3. Town in the Sharon Plain listed only once in the Bible (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.10">1 Kgs 4:10</a>) but well known from nonbiblical sources. It appears three times in Egyptian records. First, in the topographical list of Thutmose III (no. 67), it comes after Aphek and before Yaham. The former is at Ras el ‘Ain (Rosh Ha’Ayin) by the springs of the Yarkon River; the latter must be located at Khirbet Yamma on the eastern edge of the Sharon Plain. Next, Socoh is mentioned in similar geographical context in the Annals of Amenhotep II. Thus, it was a key town on the highway passing along the western edge of the mountains of Samaria in the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Third, it comes in an identical position in the topographical list of Pharaoh Shishak (no. 38) from the late 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list-text">The town conquered by Shishak was that mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.10">1 Kings 4:10</a> as being in Solomon’s third administrative district, which was governed by Ben-hesed and comprised “the land of Hepher” and other subdistricts in the Sharon Plain.</p>
<p class="list-text">All of these texts point to this Socoh as the ancient name of present-day Khirbet Shuweikeh er-Ras, just to the north of Tul-Karem. Between Aphek and Socoh there were no good water sources along the road, so these two towns mark the principal way stations in the southern Sharon Plain.</p>

<p class="h1">SODOM AND GOMORRAH</p>
<p class="fl">Two of the “cities of the plain [valley]” referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.13.12">Genesis 13:12</a>. There were five cities—Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela or Zoar (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.2">Gn 14:2</a>)—all situated in the valley of Siddim (i.e., the Salt Sea). Of these, Sodom is mentioned most frequently in Genesis—36 times in all, of which 16 references are to Sodom alone. Sodom became known in biblical literature as the supreme example of a wicked city, and its destruction (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.24">19:24</a>) was used as a warning of God’s judgment in other biblical writings (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.23">Dt 29:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.9-10">Is 1:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.14">Jer 23:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.18">49:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.6">Lam 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.11">Am 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.9">Zep 2:9</a>). The story of Sodom’s destruction found its place also in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.15">Mt 10:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.12">Lk 10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.29">17:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.29">Rom 9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.6">2 Pt 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.7">Jude 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.8">Rv 11:8</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="PossibleLocationofSodomandGomorrah"/>
<p>The primary story of Sodom and Gomorrah occurs in <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">Genesis 18</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">19</a>, although the biblical interest in the city begins in chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.13.1-18">13</a> with the decision of Lot, Abraham’s nephew, to settle in the Jordan Valley, in the vicinity of Sodom, among people who were notorious sinners. It becomes clear that one of Sodom’s most grievous sins was sexual perversion, especially homosexuality. Lot’s offer of his virgin daughters to the men of Sodom to turn their attention away from his heavenly visitors is an indication of the demoralizing influence of the city.</p>
<p>Four rulers from the East descended on the region of Sodom and Gomorrah sometime after Lot settled there and subdued the area. They returned 14 years later to quell a rebellion (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-5">Gn 14:1-5</a>). Among their captives was Lot, who was (subsequently) rescued by Abraham. The evil of Sodom and Gomorrah was so great that the Lord determined to destroy them. Abraham pleaded for mercy for them if ten righteous men could be found (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.20-33">18:20-33</a>). The two heavenly visitors who went from Abraham to Sodom found Lot sitting in the gate of Sodom (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.1">19:1</a>), revealed God’s intentions to him, and persuaded Lot and his wife and two daughters to flee the city. Then the Lord rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah. The next morning Abraham saw the smoke from the destroyed cities rising like the smoke of a furnace.</p>

<p class="fl">Third king over Israel, the second son of David and Bathsheba, who reigned 40 years (970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>). His alternative name was Jedidiah, “beloved of the Lord.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="AppointedtotheThrone">Appointed to the Throne</p>
<p class="fl">Once Amnon and Absalom were no longer in competition for the throne, the two most likely remaining candidates were Solomon and Adonijah, although the kingship had been assured to the former (<a href="?bref=1Chr.22.9-10">1 Chr 22:9-10</a>). Near the end of David’s life, Adonijah contested the choice of Solomon and took steps to become king. With the help of Joab, general of the army, and Abiathar the priest, he was proclaimed the monarch. Solomon was not invited and neither were Nathan the prophet or Benaiah. Nathan brought word of this plot to Bathsheba, who in turn quizzed David as to his intentions. David then ordered Solomon to be proclaimed king over Israel; he was anointed by Zadok amidst the blowing of the trumpets and the shout of the people: “Long live King Solomon” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.34">1 Kgs 1:34</a>). Adonijah realized his claim had collapsed and asked for mercy, promising to be faithful to the new king.</p>
<p>Solomon moved swiftly to establish his hold on the government (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-2.46">1 Kgs 1–2</a>). When Adonijah asked to marry Abishag, David’s companion in his old age (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-4">1:1-4</a>), Solomon refused and ordered his death because of possible claims to the throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.22-25">2:22-25</a>). In addition, because Abiathar had joined with Adonijah, he was removed from his service as priest and sent back to Anathoth. Joab fled to the altar and there took hold of its horns and refused to let go. The king ordered his death at the hand of Benaiah, who then became commander-in-chief of the armies. Another contender, Shimei, of the house of Saul, was also executed.</p>
<p>One of Solomon’s earliest recorded acts as king was to go to the high place at Gibeon and sacrifice 1,000 burnt offerings. On the following night, the Lord appeared to the king in a dream, asking as to his fondest wish. Solomon asked for wisdom to judge Israel, and God was pleased with the request (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1-28">1 Kgs 3</a>). Israel’s king was given his wish, along with the gifts of long life, riches, and fame.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SolomonsAccomplishments">Solomon’s Accomplishments</p>
<p class="h3">His Government</p>
<p class="fl">David’s efforts had brought about a union of the 12 tribes, but Solomon established an organized state with many officials to help him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.1-34">1 Kgs 4</a>). The entire country was divided into 12 major districts; each district was to ensure the provisions of the king’s court for one month each year. The system was equitable and designed to distribute the tax burden over the entire country.</p>
<p class="h3">His Buildings</p>
<p class="fl">One of Solomon’s earliest building attempts was to construct the temple. David had wanted to build the temple, but this task was left to Solomon, the man of peace. Hiram, king of Tyre, provided cedar trees from Mt Lebanon for the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-12">1 Kgs 5:1-12</a>), and in return he was given an appropriate amount of food. In order to provide the necessary labor for these building projects, the Canaanites became slaves (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-21">9:20-21</a>). Israelites likewise were compelled to work in groups of 10,000, every third month (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.13-18">5:13-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.17-18">2 Chr 2:17-18</a>). The workers for the temple alone comprised 80,000 stonecutters, 70,000 common laborers, and 3,600 foremen.</p>
<p>It took seven years to finish the temple, which by modern standards was a rather small building: 90 feet (27.4 meters) long, 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide, and 45 feet (13.7 meters) high. Nevertheless, the gold covering for both walls and furniture made it quite expensive.</p>
<p>In the 11th year of Solomon’s reign, the dedication of the temple was celebrated in a great convocation (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.38">1 Kgs 6:38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1-5">8:1-5</a>). The presence of the Lord filled the temple, and Solomon then offered his great dedicatory prayer (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.23-53">8:23-53</a>), marking it as one of the great peaks of his devotion to the Lord. Afterward, he offered up 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep as well as other offerings. The people were full of joy because David had so great a successor.</p>
<p>Solomon built other buildings: the House of the Forest of Lebanon, the Hall of Pillars, a hall for his throne, and a house for the daughter of Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.2-8">1 Kgs 7:2-8</a>). Thirteen years were involved in the building of his own house, large enough to take care of his wives and concubines as well as the servants. A great fortress was also built, Millo, which was used to protect the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.24">9:24</a>), as well as other store and fortified cities.</p>
<p class="h3">His Trade with Other Nations</p>
<p class="fl">The king had an agreement with Hiram, king of Tyre, to pay yearly for cedar trees, stonecutters, and other buildings; for 125,000 bushels (4.4 million liters) of wheat; and for 115,000 gallons (435,275 liters) of olive oil (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.11">1 Kgs 5:11</a>). In addition, Hiram received 20 cities in Galilee to cover all indebtedness. Contrary to the instruction not to trade in horses (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.16">Dt 17:16</a>), Solomon bought horses and chariots from the Egyptians, and some of these in turn were sold to the Hittites and Arameans at a profit (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.28-29">1 Kgs 10:28-29</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Solomon engaged in sea trade. Ships built at shipyards at Ezion-geber sailed to ports on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. The mariners collected gold, ivory, and peacocks. From Ophir, the traders brought back 420 talents of gold, a considerable fortune.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HisWisdom">His Wisdom</p>
<p class="fl">Solomon wrote 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.32">1 Kgs 4:32</a>). Most of the book of Proverbs is attributed to him (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.1">Prv 25:1</a>), as well as Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and <a href="?bref=Ps.72.1-20">Psalms 72</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.127.1-5">127</a>. His obituary notice mentions his literary accomplishments in the book of the acts of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.41">1 Kgs 11:41</a>).</p>
<p>The queen of Sheba came to see and hear if the reports of Solomon’s fame and wisdom were correct. After viewing all he had in Jerusalem and hearing his wisdom, her final response was to bless the Lord God of Israel, who raised up such a wise person to sit upon such a magnificent throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-29">1 Kgs 10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="HisFall">His Fall</p>
<p class="fl">Solomon made many misjudgments during his reign, and one of them was his excessive taxation of the people. His worst blunder was adding more and more wives to his harem, accommodating their religious preferences with pagan shrines (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-8">1 Kgs 11:1-8</a>). The Lord plagued Solomon, permitting Israel to be attacked on all sides. Although the kingdom was not damaged during Solomon’s day, his son experienced its division. There is no record that Solomon repented, but it is quite possible that the book of Ecclesiastes does reveal his realization of his wrong decisions.</p>

<p class="fl">Water-storage pools, whose construction has been attributed to Solomon. Solomon made pools for watering his vineyards, gardens, parks, and orchards (<a href="?bref=Eccl.2.4-6">Eccl 2:4-6</a>), but their location is uncertain.</p>
<p>The so-called pools of Solomon are situated in the valley of Etham, about ten miles (16.1 kilometers) south of Jerusalem and a little south of Bethlehem. The three reservoirs, which are somewhat rectangular in shape, are placed at different levels. They vary in size, with the highest the smallest and the lowest the largest. The lower pool is 582 feet (177.4 meters) long, 148 to 207 feet (45.1 to 63.1 meters) wide, and 50 feet (15.2 meters) deep. The small pool is also the most shallow, having a depth of only 15 feet (4.6 meters).</p>
<p>The pools are partly rock-cut and in part built of masonry; they are connected by conduits, and the lower end of the biggest pool serves as a dam. The water is supplied by springs and run-off rainwater. The estimated capacity of all three pools is about 40 million gallons (151.4 million liters).</p>

<p class="fl">Short OT book (eight chapters) containing only poetry. Its beautiful poetic passages describe the many dimensions of human love; there is little in this book that is explicitly religious. In addition to the popular title, the book is sometimes referred to as the “Song of Songs.” This is the most literal translation of the short title of the book in the original language and means “the best of all possible songs.” Some writers also entitle the book “Canticles”; this title is based on the name of the Latin version of the book, <span class="ital">Canticum Canticorum.</span></p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">There was an old tradition among the Jews that King Solomon (c. 970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>) wrote the Song of Songs. This view is based on one of several possible translations of the first verse of the Song: “Solomon’s song of songs” (<a href="?bref=Song.1.1">1:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This view could be correct, though there cannot be absolute certainty, for the last words of the verse in the original language could be translated in various ways. An English translation that preserves the ambiguity of the original would be “The song of songs, which is Solomon’s” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>); the last words could mean that Solomon was author, but equally they could indicate that the song was “dedicated to Solomon” or “written for Solomon.” As is often the case with the OT writings, authorship cannot be known with absolute certainty.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">It follows that if the authorship is uncertain, there must also be uncertainty concerning the date at which the song was written. If Solomon was the author, it was written during the latter half of the tenth century <span class="era">BC</span>. If he was not the author, then the song was probably written at a later date. But the contents indicate that the song must have been written and completed at some point during the Hebrew monarchy (before 586 <span class="era">BC</span>). For those who do not accept Solomon as author, the precise date will depend to some extent upon the theory that is adopted concerning the interpretation of the song. If the song is an anthology of Israelite love poetry, then the many poems making up the song would have been written at different dates and gathered together into a single volume toward the end of the Hebrew monarchy.</p>
<p class="h2" id="VariousInterpretations">Various Interpretations</p>
<p class="fl">There are two major difficulties in interpreting this book. First, the song appears to be secular in its present form and God’s name does not appear; the only exception to this statement is in <a href="?bref=Song.8.6">8:6</a>, where some English versions translate the text to show God’s name, though the original text uses the name in an unusual (adjectival) sense. The second problem is that, taken at face value, the song contains only secular poetry of human love. What is the theological significance of love poetry? These and other difficulties have led to a multitude of different interpretations of the song. A brief survey of some of the most significant interpretations will clarify not only the problem of understanding the book but also its content and meaning.</p>
<p class="h3">The Song as an Allegory</p>
<p class="fl">One of the oldest interpretations of the song sees it as an allegory. This view was held by both Jewish and Christian scholars from an early date. The description of human love in the song is seen as an allegory of the love between Christ and the church. Augustine of Hippo (<span class="era">AD</span> 354–430) believed that the marriage referred to in the song was an allegory of the marriage between Christ and the church.</p>
<p>This theory was valued for a long time. It influenced the translators of the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. They added chapter headings to their translations as an aid to readers in understanding the Bible. For example, at the beginning of the first chapter of the Song of Solomon, they wrote, “1. The Church’s love unto Christ, 5. She confesseth her deformity, 7. and prayeth to be directed to his flock.” It is important to stress, however, that the Hebrew text does not mention Christ or the church. The headings represent the understanding of the translators, not the content of the original Hebrew.</p>
<p class="h3">The Song as a Drama</p>
<p class="fl">The view that the song is a drama is also an old one. Those who hold this theory begin by noting that there are several speakers or actors. Perhaps, then, the song is the script of an ancient dramatic play.</p>
<p>This theory has some strong points. In the manuscript of an ancient Greek translation of the OT, headings have been added to the Song of Solomon that identify the speakers. The cast includes bride, bridegroom, and companions. However, the headings were probably not a part of the original Hebrew text. They reflect the interpretation of the early Greek translators.</p>
<p>There is one major difficulty with this theory: there is no clear evidence that drama was a form of art used by the Hebrews. Although drama was common among the Greeks, it does not appear to have been employed in the Near East. It is possible, however, to suggest a slight variation to the drama theory. Perhaps the Song of Solomon is not a drama but simply dramatic poetry, similar to the book of Job. This possibility is more plausible, but it too has difficulties. A story or plot would be expected for either drama or dramatic poetry, but it is not clear that there is a story.</p>
<p>According to one interpretation, the story might go as follows. The song tells the story of true love. A maiden was in love with a shepherd lad. King Solomon, however, fell in love with the maiden and took her to his palace. There he tried to win her love with beautiful words but failed. She remained faithful to the shepherd lad whom she loved. Failing to win her, Solomon released her and allowed her to return to her true lover. The story is beautiful and simple, but it is not easy to see in the text without added headings and explanations. Other interpreters have discerned a quite different story in the Song of Solomon. In conclusion, it is not absolutely clear that there is a single story being told.</p>
<p class="h3">The Song as Reflecting a Fertility Cult</p>
<p class="fl">Some modern scholars claim that the origin of the Song of Solomon is to be found in the fertility cults of the ancient Near East. In ancient fertility cults there was great emphasis on the fertility of the land, which would be seen in bountiful harvests. The cults were designed to ensure that the land remained fertile. They were accompanied by a mythology describing the gods responsible for fertility. This mythology included love poetry about the gods, and the poetry has some similarity to the Song of Solomon.</p>
<p>The theory might go like this: Originally the Hebrews also had a fertility cult. The Song of Solomon contains the love poetry associated with that cult. Later, the mythological references were omitted, so that the present song looks like secular love poetry.</p>
<p>The main difficulty with this theory is the lack of any firm evidence. There is no reference to God or any other gods in the Song of Solomon. There is no reference to a fertility cult or any other kind of cult. If the theory has some validity to it, the evidence no longer exists.</p>
<p class="h3">The Song as a Collection of Poems</p>
<p class="fl">This last, most probable theory of interpretation involves two basic principles. First, the song is to be interpreted literally; it is what it seems to be—poetry celebrating human love. Second, the Song of Solomon is a collection, not a single piece of poetry. Just as the book of Psalms contains songs, hymns, and prayers from many different periods of Israel’s history, so too the Song of Solomon contains poetry from different periods and different authors. The common theme joining all the passages together is human love. Opinions differ concerning where one song ends and the next begins. There may be as many as 29 songs in the book, some consisting of only one verse and others much longer.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">If the Song of Solomon is primarily an anthology of the poetry of human love, what is its significance as a biblical book? What are its theological implications? First, the presence of the song in the Bible provides a valuable insight concerning human love. The love between a man and a woman is a noble and beautiful thing; it is a gift of God. It is characterized by a certain mystery and cannot be bought. But because human love is a beautiful and noble thing, it can easily be debased. In the modern world, the Song of Solomon provides a proper perspective and a balanced view of human love. Further, a high value of human love is essential. Since human love and marriage are employed in the Bible as an analogy of God’s love for humanity, love in itself must be good and pure.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The Woman Sings Her Love Song (<a href="?bref=Song.1.2-7">1:2-7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In each of the songs, the reader is like an eavesdropper listening to the words of love spoken, sometimes privately and sometimes to the beloved one. The opening song is a song of praise, rejoicing in love and delighting in a particular loved one: “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—for your love is more delightful than wine” (v <a href="?bref=Song.1.2">2</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). This song, as many others, is characterized by a country setting, here highlighted by a contrast with the city. The young woman is from the country and tanned from working in the open air; it makes her self-conscious among the city women of Jerusalem. But love overpowers self-consciousness, and it is in the country that she will meet her lover.</p>
<p class="h3">The King Converses with the Woman (<a href="?bref=Song.1.8-2.7">1:8–2:7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this passage, both the man and the woman are talking, though it is not a conversation in the normal sense. They are talking about each other, rather than to each other, and the beauty of both the man and the woman emerges, not in an abstract sense, but through the eyes of the beholder. Though beauty may perhaps be defined in an abstract sense, the beauty perceived by lovers is of a different kind; it is rooted in the lover’s perception of the loved one and in the relationship of love that acts like a lens to focus that perception.</p>
<p class="h3">A Song of Springtime (<a href="?bref=Song.2.8-13">2:8-13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This beautiful song describes the young maiden watching her beloved come to her. He calls her to join him in the countryside, where the winter has passed and the new life of spring can be seen in the land. The beauty of young love is here likened to the blossoming forth of fresh life and fragrance that characterizes Palestine in spring.</p>
<p class="h3">The Woman Searches for Her Loved One (<a href="?bref=Song.2.14-3.5">2:14–3:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Now the woman sings and a new dimension of her love emerges from the words of her song. Love is full when the partners are together, but separation creates sorrow and loneliness. The words of the maiden evoke the desperation of separated lovers, a desperation that could only be dissipated when she held her lover again and would not let him go (<a href="?bref=Song.3.4">3:4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The King’s Wedding Procession (<a href="?bref=Song.3.6-11">3:6-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The song begins with a description of the approach of the royal wedding procession, a palanquin surrounded by men of war. The king approaches the city for his wedding, and the young girls of the city go out to greet him. The song can be compared with <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalm 45</a>, another wedding song.</p>
<p class="h3">The Woman’s Beauty, Like a Garden (<a href="?bref=Song.4.1-5.1">4:1–5:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In sumptuous language, the man describes his maiden’s beauty. To the modern reader, the language is sometimes strange: “your neck is like the tower of David” (<a href="?bref=Song.4.4">4:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). But the strangeness lies principally in our unfamiliarity with the ancient metaphors. Nonetheless, much of the language here draws upon the imagery of nature and wildlife, which can be appreciated by all. Again, beauty is not described merely as something aesthetic, for it is intimately tied to the relationship of love: “How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine” (v <a href="?bref=Song.4.10">10</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). And again, the maiden’s beauty is not simply to be admired; it is to be given to the beloved. So when the man stops his words of adoration, the woman offers herself to him (v <a href="?bref=Song.4.16">16</a>) and he accepts (<a href="?bref=Song.5.1">5:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Woman Speaks of Her Beloved (<a href="?bref=Song.5.2-6.3">5:2–6:3</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this song, the woman is talking with other women, and the man is not present. As she speaks about her lover, there is a change from words expressing a sense of loneliness and separation (<a href="?bref=Song.5.4-8">5:4-8</a>) to a resurgence of delight as she contemplates her loved one. The sorrow of separation from her beloved is dispelled as she recounts to them the handsomeness of her man (vv <a href="?bref=Song.5.10-16">10-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Man Speaks of His Loved One’s Beauty (<a href="?bref=Song.6.4-7.9">6:4–7:9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This long passage may contain more than a single song; there are words from the man, the maiden, and the female companions. The principal theme is further description by the man of his beloved’s beauty (<a href="?bref=Song.6.4-10">6:4-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.7.1-9">7:1-9</a>), a theme already known from an earlier passage (<a href="?bref=Song.4.1-5.1">4:1–5:1</a>). Each part of the maiden’s body is exquisitely beautiful in the eyes of the one who loves her.</p>
<p class="h3">The Woman and the Man Reflect upon Love (<a href="?bref=Song.7.10-8.14">7:10–8:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Both partners speak in this complex passage, which may contain a number of short love songs. While some parts are difficult to interpret (especially <a href="?bref=Song.8.8-14">8:8-14</a>), other verses reveal in the most profound language the meaning of love. Love, that most powerful of all human relationships, creates a sense of mutual belonging and mutual possession: “I belong to my lover, and his desire is for me” (<a href="?bref=Song.7.10">7:10</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). And later, the girl speaks of love with words that convey one of the most powerful understandings of love in the entire Bible: “For love is as strong as death. . . . Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned” (<a href="?bref=Song.8.6-7">8:6-7</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>

<p class="fl">In the OT, certain men who lived before the time of Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Gn 6:1-4</a>), “the angels” (including Satan, <a href="?bref=Job.1.6">Jb 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.1">2:1</a>), and other heavenly beings (<a href="?bref=Ps.29.1">Pss 29:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.82.6">82:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.6">89:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span> mg) are called “sons of God.” Israel as a people was the chosen son of God. This corporate sonship became the basis of Israel’s redemption from Egypt: “Israel is my first-born son” (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.22">Ex 4:22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.31.9">Jer 31:9</a>). Corporate sonship was the context for focus on personal sonship in the divine sanction of David as king: “I will be his father, and he will be my son” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.14">2 Sm 7:14</a>). David’s “adoptive” sonship was by divine decree: “I will proclaim the decree: . . . ‘You are my son; today I have become your Father’ ” (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Ps 2:7</a>); and it was the prophetic prototype of the “essential” sonship of Jesus, David’s royal son (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">Mt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.22">Lk 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.33">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.5">Heb 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5">5:5</a>). Other messianic prophecies ascribe divine names to the Davidic Messiah: “Immanuel” (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.13-14">Is 7:13-14</a>) and “Mighty God, Everlasting Father” (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6-7">Is 9:6-7</a>). These are fulfilled in Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">Mt 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.4-10">21:4-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.41-45">22:41-45</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheGospels">In the Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus’ identity as the Son of God is revealed in the Gospels in three distinct ways.</p>
<p>The first is his <span class="ital">eternal, personal sonship.</span> Jesus’ personal sonship is revealed in Peter’s confession, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>) and in Jesus’ identification of himself at his trial: “ ‘Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?’ . . . ‘I am,’ said Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.61-62">Mk 14:61-62</a>). In both instances, the issue is his personal being or essence, his eternal identity.</p>
<p>Long before Creation, even from eternity, the Father and the Son enjoyed fellowship with each other. We know this because the Bible tells us so—but not in any great detail. For the most part, the Scriptures are silent about the premundane scene. And yet there are a few verses that lift the veil slightly and give us a glimpse into that sublime, divine relationship that always existed between the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>Of all the books in the Bible, the Gospel of John has the most to say about the relationship between the Father and the Son. It is from John’s inspired pen that we read from the outset, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” This is a rather flat rendering. The Greek conveys something more picturesque: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was face to face with God, and the Word was himself God.” Imagine, the Word, who was the preincarnate Son of God, was face to face with God. The expression “face to face” translates the Greek preposition <span class="greek">pros</span> (short for <span class="greek">prosopon pros prosopon</span><span class="ital">,</span> “face to face,” a common expression in koine Greek.) The expression signifies intimate fellowship. The Father and Son enjoyed such an intimate fellowship from eternity. How they must have delighted in each other!</p>
<p>After the Son of God became a man and began his ministry on earth, he referred to the relationship he enjoyed with the Father before the foundation of the world. Jesus spoke of what he had seen and heard together with the Father before coming to earth (see <a href="?bref=John.3.13">John 3:13</a> and <a href="?bref=John.8.38">8:38</a>). Jesus longed to return to that glorious sphere. In his prayer before going to the cross (in ch <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">17</a>), he asked the Father to glorify him with the glory he had with the Father before the world was (v <a href="?bref=John.17.5">5</a>). Jesus wanted to recapture his primordial equality with the Father—something he had willingly relinquished for the sake of his Father’s plan (see <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-7">Phil 2:6-7</a>). As he prayed to the Father, a wonderful utterance escaped from his lips: “Father, . . . you loved me before the foundation of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.17.24">Jn 17:24</a>). God’s Son, the unique Son, was the single object of the Father’s love.</p>
<p>The second aspect of Jesus’ sonship is his <span class="ital">nativity sonship.</span> The nativity of Jesus is traced to the direct, spiritual paternity of God. Jesus is the Son of God because his incarnation and birth into the human race was created by the Holy Spirit. In Matthew, Jesus’ conception “is of the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.20">Mt 1:20</a>). He is to be named “Jesus” (meaning Yahweh is salvation) “because he will save his people from their sins” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">21</a>), and “Immanuel” (God with us) because he is himself the Son of God in human flesh (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">23</a>). In Luke, Jesus’ conception was by the Holy Spirit and the power of the Most High (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.31,35">Lk 1:31, 35</a>), so Jesus was called “the Son of God” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">35</a>). If the father of Jesus had been the man Joseph, he would have been called “Jesus, the son of Joseph.” Luke’s teaching clearly means that since the Spirit of God was the father of Jesus, this son of the virgin Mary is properly called “Jesus, the Son of God.”</p>
<p>The third aspect is his <span class="ital">messianic sonship.</span> Jesus is the Father’s Son and representative, whose earthly mission is to establish the kingdom of God. At his baptism, he began his mission with the Father’s coronation: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">Mt 3:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Ps 2:7</a>). Jesus received a similar pronouncement from heaven at his Transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.35">Lk 9:35</a>). As the messianic Son, Jesus perfectly completed the redeeming work given him to do by his Father.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestamentEpistles">In the New Testament Epistles</p>
<p class="fl">Paul spoke of the essential, ontological sonship of Jesus—not as an isolated fact, but in the context of his redemptive work. It was as God’s Son that Jesus took human nature (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.3">Rom 1:3</a>) and as “the Son of God” that he was resurrected and enthroned in power (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.18">Mt 28:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.28">1 Cor 15:28</a>). The Incarnation is spoken of as “God sending his own Son” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.3">Rom 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.4">Gal 4:4</a>) for humanity’s redemption, a redemption that was accomplished “through the death of his Son” (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.10">Rom 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.29,32">8:29, 32</a>). As a consequence, believers can have “fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.9">1 Cor 1:9</a>), and they can live by faith in “the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>). Paul’s first preaching was “that Jesus is the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.20">Acts 9:20</a>); this was later expounded by Paul in the light of <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Psalm 2:7</a> (see <a href="?bref=Acts.13.33">Acts 13:33</a>).</p>
<p>In Hebrews, Jesus is “the Son,” who is God’s “firstborn” and personal “heir,” who is creator and sustainer of the universe, and who is the “radiance of God’s glory” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2-12">Heb 1:2-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5">5:5</a>). As the Son, he is the final and eternal High Priest who ascended to heaven and whose mediatorial work remains perfect forever (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.6">6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.3,28">7:3, 28</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1-21">1 John 4</a> and <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.1-21">5</a>, belief in Jesus as the incarnate Son of God is essential for salvation; disbelief comes from the spirit of the Antichrist.</p>

<p class="h1">SON OF MAN</p>
<p class="fl">Messianic title used by Jesus to express his heavenly origin, earthly mission, and glorious future coming. It does not refer merely to his human nature or humanity, as some church fathers or contemporary scholars believe. Rather, it reflects on the heavenly origin and divine dignity of Jesus, on the mystery of his manifestation in human form, and on his earthly mission that took him to the cross and then into glory.</p>
<p>The background of the term “Son of Man” is to be found in the OT. The book of Ezekiel is the general source, since this prophet was referred to as “son of man” 90 times. For example, God addressed him, “Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.1">Ez 2:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus’ use of the term “Son of Man” and numerous themes from Ezekiel suggest his desire to identify himself as the eschatological prophet who, like Ezekiel (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-17">4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.1-27">7</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">10</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.1-31">22</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">40–48</a>), had the last word about the destruction of Jerusalem and the restoration of the kingdom of God to Israel (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-24.51">Mt 23–24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-8">Acts 1:6-8</a>).</p>
<p>The specific source of the term is <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, with its vision of one “like a son of man” who “comes with the clouds” into the presence of “the Ancient of Days,” who gives him the universal and eternal kingdom of God. Jesus repeatedly quoted parts of this text in teaching about his second coming (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Mt 16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31">25:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.64">26:64</a>). Clearly, Jesus understood this passage as a prophetic portrayal of his own person: his incarnation, ascension, and inheritance of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In the Gospels, the term “Son of Man” is used by Jesus about 80 times as a mysterious, indirect way of speaking about himself (Mt, 32 times; Mk, 14 times; Lk, 26 times; Jn, 10 times). In all these texts, Jesus was always the speaker, and no one ever addressed him as “Son of Man.” In some texts the reference is cryptic enough for some interpreters to insist that Jesus was speaking about another person. Such uncertainty is recorded in only one text in John, where the crowd asks Jesus, “Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” (<a href="?bref=John.12.34">Jn 12:34</a>). In most texts, the identification is clear. In some it is explicit: “Who do men say that the Son of Man is?”—followed by, “Who do you say that I am?” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13,15">Mt 16:13, 15</a>). The conclusion generally drawn is that Jesus used the term as a messianic title for himself, so that he could speak modestly about his person and mission yet convey the exalted content he wished to reveal about himself. He could do this with considerable originality because the term was not fraught with popular misconceptions concerning the Messiah.</p>
<p>The term occurs only four other times in the NT. In <a href="?bref=Acts.7.56">Acts 7:56</a>, Stephen says, “Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing in the place of honor at God’s right hand!” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). <a href="?bref=Heb.2.6">Hebrews 2:6</a> quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.8.4">Psalm 8:4</a> as applying to Jesus. Finally, <a href="?bref=Rev.1.13">Revelation 1:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.14.14">14:14</a> record visions of someone “like a son of man,” who is undoubtedly the glorified Jesus.</p>
<p>In the synoptic Gospels, the first theme in Jesus’ self-revelation connected with his use of the title “Son of Man” concerns his coming to earth to accomplish his messianic mission. A general comparison of Jesus’ present earthly condition with that of his previous heavenly glory is expressed in the saying “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.20">Mt 8:20</a>; see <a href="?bref=Luke.9.58">Lk 9:58</a>). This saying indicates that the Son of Man gave up his heavenly home to suffer all the humiliations of his earthly ministry (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-11">Phil 2:5-11</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus used the title to claim divine prerogatives, saying, “The Son of Man is Lord of the sabbath” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.8">Mt 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.28">Mk 2:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.5">Lk 6:5</a>). The Sabbath, a divine institution, may not be revised by ordinary men. But since Jesus is the Son of Man from heaven, he is free to rule as Lord even of the Sabbath, because he is the same Lord who instituted the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.2">Gn 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>). After healing the paralytic at Capernaum, Jesus claimed that “the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.6">Mt 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.10">Mk 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.24">Lk 5:24</a>). Previously, forgiveness of sins came from heaven and from God, but now forgiveness comes from Capernaum and is given by Jesus.</p>
<p>The second aspect of Jesus’ use of the “Son of Man” title concerns his suffering, death, and glorious resurrection as the mysterious method he would use to fulfill his earthly mission as the Son of Man. Jesus began expounding this passion theme after Peter confessed him to be Messiah and Son of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>). Jesus’ prediction of his passion as the Son of Man begins in <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31-32">Mark 8:31-32</a> and is repeated in several other texts. The Gospels expand the theme to include his suffering of mockery and scourging (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.12">Mt 17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.18">20:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.22">Lk 9:22</a>), betrayal by Judas (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.22">Mt 17:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.24-25">26:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.21,41">Mk 14:21, 41</a>), rejection by the Jewish leaders (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.18">Mt 20:18</a>), death by crucifixion (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.19">Mt 20:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.12,31">Mk 9:12, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.33">10:33</a>), burial for three days (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">Mt 12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.30">Lk 11:30</a>), and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.22-23">Mt 17:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>).</p>
<p>In the famous text “The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>), Jesus teaches that his death was a vicarious sacrifice for the salvation of his people. This idea of substitutionary atonement is a new element in the Son of Man material and derives from Jesus’ understanding of himself as the suffering Servant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Is 53</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus also used the “Son of Man” title to teach about his second coming. As the Son of Man, Jesus will return to earth from heaven in the glory of his Father with the angels (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Mt 16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mk 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.26">Lk 9:26</a>). First, he will be seated at the right hand of God, and then he will come again (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.64">Mt 26:64</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mk 14:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.69">Lk 22:69</a>) with the clouds (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Mt 24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mk 13:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.27">Lk 21:27</a>). This coming will be unexpected (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.27">Mt 24:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.40">Lk 12:40</a>), like a flash of lightning or the flood of Noah (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.37">Mt 24:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.24">Lk 17:24</a>). His coming will be for the gathering of the elect, the judgment of all the nations of the earth (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">Mt 19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.32">25:32</a>), and the restoration of final righteousness in the world (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">19:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.46">25:46</a>).</p>
<p>In these passages, Jesus’ focus shifts from the provisional victory in his passion and resurrection to the final victory of the Son of Man at his second coming. Here again, the dramatic emphasis is on the heavenly origin and divine prerogatives of the Son of Man. This man Jesus, the Son of Man, will be the final judge (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">Acts 17:31</a>).</p>
<p>The Gospel of John has its own distinctive material concerning the Son of Man. The angels are said to ascend and descend on the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=John.1.51">Jn 1:51</a>), thereby signifying that he is a preexistent person who has come from heaven to earth (<a href="?bref=John.3.13">3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.62">6:62</a>). His being lifted up (by crucifixion) will bring about eternal life for all who believe in him (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">3:14</a>). The Son of Man (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">3:14</a>) is also the Son of God (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">3:16</a>), God’s one and only Son (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.18">3:18</a>). Quite simply, in John’s Gospel, the “Son of Man” title is equivalent to the title “Son of God.” It reveals his divinity, preexistence, heavenly origin, and divine prerogatives. It affirms his present earthly condition for revelation and passion, and his future eschatological glory. The Father has given the Son of Man authority to raise the dead and to judge the world (<a href="?bref=John.5.25-27">5:25-27</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD*</p>
<p class="fl">Expression designating human beings who have been born of God and have become part of his family. When the Bible speaks of God’s sons, it does not intend to exclude females. The term “sons” is inclusive of all believers. But the Scriptures nearly always have the word “sons”—with one exception in the NT, <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.18">2 Corinthians 6:18</a>, in which God’s people are called “sons and daughters.”</p>
<p>From the beginning, God the Father desired to have many sons and daughters sharing the image and likeness of his beloved Son. It could be said that his one Son brought him so much satisfaction that he yearned to have many more. This may have been the impetus for the creation of the universe and, most specifically, of human beings (see <a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-27">Gn 1:26-27</a>). <a href="?bref=Pr.8.1-36">Proverbs 8</a> indicates that God was delighted with the sons of men. This is again expressed in the NT, especially in the book of Ephesians. The opening verses in Ephesians resound with this note: the heart’s desire of God was to obtain many sons in and through his Son. The many sons, in union with the unique Son, would bring great glory and satisfaction to the Father.</p>
<p>Paul used a Greek word in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.5,9">Ephesians 1:5, 9</a>, and <a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">11</a> that conveys the idea of desire, even heart’s desire. The word is usually translated as “will”—“the will of God.” But the English word “will” conceals the primary meaning. The Greek word (<span class="greek">thelema</span>) is primarily an emotional word and secondarily volitional. God’s will is not so much God’s intention as it is God’s heart’s desire. God does have an intention, a purpose, a plan. It is called <span class="greek">prothesis</span> in Greek (see <a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>), and it literally means “a laying out beforehand” (like a blueprint). This plan was created by God’s counsel (called <span class="greek">boule</span> in Greek, <a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>). But behind the plan and the counsel was not just a mastermind but a heart of love and of good pleasure. Therefore, Paul talks about “the good pleasure of God’s heart’s desire” (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.5">5</a>). Paul also says, “He made known to us the mystery of his heart’s desire, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him” (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>The impetus of God’s eternal purpose came from a heart’s desire, and that heart’s desire was to have many sons made like his only Son (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.26-28">Rom 8:26-28</a>). In love, he predestined many people to participate in this “sonship”—not by their own merits but by virtue of their being united to the Son (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.4-5">Eph 1:4-5</a>). Notice how often in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.1-23">Ephesians 1</a> Paul speaks of the believers’ position “in him.” Outside of him (the Son), no one could be a son of God and no one could be pleasing to the Father. The many sons and daughters owe all their divine privileges to the Beloved, as ones given grace through him (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.6">6</a>). If it were not for God’s satisfaction in his beloved Son, there would not have been the inspiration for the creation of man in the first place. Humans exist because God wanted to obtain many sons and daughters, each bearing the image of God’s unique Son. People are well pleasing to God and bring him satisfaction by being united to the one who has always satisfied him. Apart from the Son, no one has access to the Father. But because of the Son’s redemption, all believers have the right to become children of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">Jn 1:12</a>) and now have access to the Father through the Son (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SOUL</p>
<p class="fl">Term translating the Greek word <span class="greek">psuche</span> and the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">nephesh</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>The Greek philosopher Plato (fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>) perceived the soul as the eternal element in humans; whereas the body perishes at death, the soul is indestructible. At death the soul enters another body; if it has been wicked in this life, it may be sent into an inferior human being or even an animal or bird. By means of transmigration from one body to another, the soul is eventually purged of evil. In the early centuries of the Christian era, Gnosticism also taught that the body was the prison house of the soul. Redemption comes to those initiated into the Gnostic secrets, leading to the release of the soul from the body.</p>
<p>Biblical thought about the soul is different. In the OT the soul signifies that which is vital to humans in the broadest sense. The Hebrew and Greek words for soul often can be translated as “life”; occasionally, they can be used for the life of creatures (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.20">Gn 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.11.10">Lv 11:10</a>). “Soul for soul” means “life for life” (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.23">Ex 21:23</a>). In legal writings, a soul refers to a person in relation to a particular law (e.g., “If a soul shall sin . . . ,” <a href="?bref=Lev.4.2">Lv 4:2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). When people were counted, they were counted as souls, that is, persons (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.5">Ex 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.22">Dt 10:22</a>).</p>
<p>In a narrower sense, the soul denotes human emotions and inner powers. People are called to love God with all their heart and soul (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.3">Dt 13:3</a>). Knowledge and understanding (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.14">Ps 139:14</a>), thought (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.3">1 Sm 20:3</a>), love (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.1">1 Sm 18:1</a>), and memory (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.20">Lam 3:20</a>) all originate in the soul. Here the soul comes close to what today would be called the self, one’s person, personality, or ego.</p>
<p>There is no suggestion in the OT of the transmigration of the soul as an immaterial, immortal entity. Man is a unity of body and soul—terms that describe not so much two separate entities in a person as much as one person from different standpoints. Hence, in the description of man’s creation in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a>, the phrase “a living soul” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is better translated as “a living being.” The thought is not that men and women became <span class="ital">souls,</span> for clearly they had bodies. The use of the word in the original draws attention to the vital aspect of humans as “living beings.” The Hebrew view of the unity of the person may help to explain why people in the OT had only a shadowy view of life after death, for it would be difficult to conceive how people could exist without a body (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Pss 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.49.15">49:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.3-12">88:3-12</a>). Where hope of an afterlife exists, it is not because of the intrinsic character of the soul itself (as in Plato). It is grounded in confidence in the God who has power over death and the belief that communion with him cannot be broken even by death (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6">Ex 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.6">1 Sm 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-26">Jb 19:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10-11">Pss 16:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.24-25">73:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.25.8">Is 25:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.19">26:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Dn 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.1-3">Hos 6:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">13:14</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the word for soul (<span class="greek">psuche</span>) has a range of meanings similar to that in the OT. Often it is synonymous with life itself. Followers of Jesus are said to have risked their lives (souls) for his sake (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.26">Acts 15:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.13.37">Jn 13:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.4">Rom 16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.30">Phil 2:30</a>). As the Son of Man, Jesus came not to be served but to serve and to give his life (soul) as a ransom for many (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>). As the Good Shepherd, he lays down his life (soul) for the sheep (<a href="?bref=John.10.14,17-18">Jn 10:14, 17-18</a>). In <a href="?bref=Luke.14.26">Luke 14:26</a> the condition of discipleship is to hate one’s soul, that is, to be willing to deny oneself to the point of losing one’s life for Christ’s sake (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.9.23">Lk 9:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.11">Rv 12:11</a>).</p>
<p>Frequently “soul” can mean “person” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.43">Acts 2:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.23">3:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.14">7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.9">Rom 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.1">13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.20">1 Pt 3:20</a>). The expression “every living soul” (<a href="?bref=Rev.16.3">Rv 16:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) reflects the vital aspect of living beings. As in the OT, the soul can denote not only the vital aspect of the person on the physical level, but it can also connote one’s emotional energies. It denotes the person himself, the seat of his or her emotions, one’s inmost being. For example, when Jesus was agonizing about his death, he spoke of his soul being crushed (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.38">Mt 26:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.34">Mk 14:34</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.42.6">Ps 42:6</a>). In an entirely different setting, Jesus promised rest to the souls of those who come to him (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29">Mt 11:29</a>). Here, as elsewhere, “soul” denotes the essential person (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.2.35">Lk 2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.23">2 Cor 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.8">2 Thes 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=3Jn.1.2">3 Jn 1:2</a>).</p>
<p>Several passages place the soul alongside the spirit. <a href="?bref=Luke.1.46">Luke 1:46</a> is probably a case of Hebrew poetic parallelism, which expresses the same idea in two different ways. Both terms denote Mary as a person in the depths of her being. Similarly, in <a href="?bref=Heb.4.12">Hebrews 4:12</a>, dividing the soul and the spirit is a graphic way of saying how the Word of God probes the inmost recesses of our being. The prayer in <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>—that the readers may be kept blameless in spirit, soul, and body—is a way of speaking of the whole being. Here soul probably suggests physical existence, as in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, whereas spirit may imply the higher or “spiritual” side of life.</p>
<p>In other passages, the emotions, the will, and even the mind come to the fore, though in each case there is the accompanying idea of a person’s inmost being. People are to love God with all the soul (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Mt 22:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.30">Mk 12:30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Dt 6:5</a>). The expression “from the soul” (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.6">Eph 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.23">Col 3:23</a>) means “from the heart,” with all one’s being. In <a href="?bref=Phil.1.27">Philippians 1:27</a> believers are called to be of one mind (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.4.32">Acts 4:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.2">14:2</a>). Passages that speak of the soul in relation to salvation include <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">Luke 12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.19">Hebrews 6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.39">10:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.7">13:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.21">James 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.20">5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.9,22-23">1 Peter 1:9, 22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.19">4:19</a>; and <a href="?bref=Rev.6.9">Revelation 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.4">20:4</a>. Such passages speak of the soul either to stress the essential human being, as distinct from the physical body, or to express man’s continued existence with God prior to the resurrection.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SPAIN</p>
<p class="fl">Name of the most westerly peninsula in southwestern Europe. Biblical references to the peninsula note the role of the Phoenicians, whose far-flung Carthaginian Empire reached into Spain. The Romans expelled the Carthaginians from Spain as early as 206 <span class="era">BC</span>, but they did not conquer the local tribes until 25 <span class="era">BC</span>. Only by then had the Romans gained control of the whole region (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.8.3">1 Macc 8:3</a>).</p>
<p>The Phoenician traders of Tyre extended their commercial empire to Spain or historic Iberia as early as 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>. From Carthage on the North African coast, which was a center of the Phoenician Empire, a series of colonial thrusts followed the trading contacts. The Carthaginians established many settlements on the Spanish coast during the flourishing of their republic. These included Carthago Nova (now Cartagena) and Malacca (now Malaga). Later, they took Tartessus and absorbed much of the peninsula into their empire. From this base in Spain, the Carthaginians sought to expand their empire into Europe. The Romans met the Carthaginian challenge. After beating Hannibal back in his attack on Italy in the Second Punic War (218–201 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Romans extended their territory by overcoming the Carthaginians on the Spanish peninsula. Finally, under Augustus, the Romans made Spain part of the empire. At that time the Romans built a magnificent road system circling and crossing the whole Spanish peninsula.</p>
<p>Roman civilization had a deep and lasting influence on Spain. Three emperors—Trajan, Hadrian, and the first Theodosius—were born in Spain. Several scholars and writers of note in Roman culture came from Spain. These included the two Senecas, Martial, Prudentius, Lucan, Quintialian, Pomponius, and Mela.</p>
<p>In the apostle Paul’s scheme for reaching the uttermost regions of the civilized world with the good news of Jesus Christ, he probably realized the potential of converts in Spain. The chief evidence that Paul included Spain in his strategic planning is in <a href="?bref=Rom.15.24,28">Romans 15:24, 28</a>. In that letter Paul clearly sets forth his message to Romans and Gentiles throughout the empire. To follow up on this letter, he planned to visit Rome and then make his way to Spain. Testimony of Paul actually visiting Spain comes only from a vague reference after his death. Clement of Rome, an early Christian writer at the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, stated that Paul went to “the limits of the West” (1 Clement 1:5). Although most Romans considered Spain as the western limit of their empire, this vague phrase does not give sufficient evidence for a Pauline visit. Yet clearly Paul saw Spain as a strategic place for mission work; thus, it stands to reason that he himself, or others whom he designated, planted the Christian church in Spain during the first century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>

<p class="fl">Designation of that aspect of existence that is noncorporeal and immaterial. Its Latin derivation (as with the Hebrew and Greek words in the Bible—<span class="hebrew">ruach</span> and <span class="greek">pneuma</span>) denotes blowing or breathing (<a href="?bref=Job.41.16">Jb 41:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.25.4">Is 25:4</a>). So the noun <span class="ital">spiritus</span> signifies breath and life. God, the source of all life, is himself Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.4.24">Jn 4:24</a>). He put a spirit within all human beings so that they could commune with him in his realm and in his nature.

<p class="h1">SPIRIT OF GOD</p>
<p class="fl">Description of God in action, God in motion. The word “spirit” (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">ruach</span><span class="ital">;</span> Greek, <span class="greek">pneuma</span>) is the word used from ancient times to describe and explain the experience of divine power working in, upon, and around people.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">There are three basic meanings evident in the use of “spirit” from the earliest Hebrew writings: It was a wind from God, it was the breath of life, and it was a spirit of ecstasy.</p>
<p>First, it was a wind from God (the same Hebrew word translated “Spirit” in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Gn 1:2</a>) that caused the waters of the Flood to subside (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.1">8:1</a>). A wind from God blew locusts over Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.13">Ex 10:13</a>) and quail over the camp of Israel. The blast of his nostrils separated the waters of the Red Sea at the exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.21">14:21</a>).</p>
<p>Second, it was the breath of God that made man a living being (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>). It is one of the earliest perceptions of Hebrew faith that humans live only because of the stirring of the divine breath or spirit within them (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.33.4">Jb 33:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.34.14-15">34:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.29-30">Ps 104:29-30</a>). Later, a clearer distinction was drawn between divine Spirit and human spirit, and between spirit and soul, but at the earliest stage these were all more or less perceived to be synonymous manifestations of the same divine power, the source of all life—animal as well as human (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.15,22">Gn 7:15, 22</a>; see <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.19-21">Eccl 3:19-21</a>).</p>
<p>Third, there were occasions when this divine power seemed to overtake and possess an individual fully, so that his or her words or actions far transcended those of normal behavior. Such a person was clearly marked as an agent of God’s purpose and given respect. This was apparently how leaders were recognized in the premonarchy period—Othniel (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.10">Jgs 3:10</a>), Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.34">6:34</a>), Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.29">11:29</a>), and the first king, Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.6">1 Sm 11:6</a>), as well. So, too, the earliest prophets were those whose inspiration came in ecstasy (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.20-24">1 Sm 19:20-24</a>).</p>
<p>In the earlier stages of Hebrew thought, ecstatic experience was seen as the direct effect of divine power. This was true even when the ecstasy was recognized as evil in character, as in the case of Saul’s seizure by the Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14-16">1 Sm 16:14-16</a>). A spirit from God could be for evil as well as for good (see <a href="?bref=Judg.9.23">Jgs 9:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19-23">1 Kgs 22:19-23</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In the Writings of the Prophets</p>
<p class="fl">For Isaiah, the spirit was that which characterized God and distinguished him and his actions from human affairs (<a href="?bref=Isa.31.3">Is 31:3</a>). Later, the adjective “holy” appeared as that which distinguished the Spirit of God from any other spirit, human or divine (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.11">Ps 51:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.10-11">Is 63:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>The problem of false prophecy emphasized the danger of assuming that every message delivered in ecstasy was the word of the Lord. Thus, tests of prophecy evaluated the content of the message delivered or the character of the prophet’s life, not the degree or quality of inspiration (see <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-5">Dt 13:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.18.22">18:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.14">Jer 23:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.5">Mi 3:5</a>). This sense of a need to discriminate between true and false inspiration and to distinguish the word of God from the merely ecstatic oracle may help to explain the otherwise puzzling reluctance of the major eighth- and seventh-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophets to attribute their inspiration to the Spirit.</p>
<p class="h3">In the Exilic and Postexilic Writings</p>
<p class="fl">In exilic and postexilic literature, the role of the Spirit is narrowed to two major functions: that of the prophetic Spirit and that of the Spirit of the age to come.</p>
<p>The later prophets again spoke of the Spirit in explicit terms as the inspirer of prophecy (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.3.1-4,22-24">Ez 3:1-4, 22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.5">Hg 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6">Zec 4:6</a>). As they looked back to the preexilic period, these prophets freely attributed the inspiration of “the former prophets” to the Spirit as well (<a href="?bref=Zech.7.12">Zec 7:12</a>).</p>
<p>This tendency to exalt the Spirit’s role as the inspirer of prophecy became steadily stronger in the period between the OT and NT, until in rabbinic Judaism the Spirit was almost exclusively the inspirer of the prophetic writings now regarded as Scripture.</p>
<p>The other understanding of the Spirit’s role during exilic and postexilic times was that the Spirit would be the manifestation of the power of God in the age to come. That eschatological hope of divine power effecting a final cleansing and a renewed creation is rooted principally in Isaiah’s prophecies (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">Is 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.3-4">44:3-4</a>). Isaiah speaks of one anointed by the Spirit to accomplish complete and final salvation (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.2">11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1">42:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">61:1</a>). Elsewhere, the same longing is expressed in terms of the Spirit being freely dispensed to all Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.39.29">Ez 39:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">Jl 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.10">Zec 12:10</a>) in the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.26-27">Ez 36:26-27</a>).</p>
<p>In the period prior to Jesus, the understanding of the Spirit as the Spirit of prophecy and as the Spirit of the age to come had developed into the widespread dogma that the Spirit was no longer to be experienced in the present. The Spirit had been known in the past as the inspirer of prophetic writings, but after Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, the Spirit had withdrawn (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.44-46">1 Macc 4:44-46</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.27">9:27</a>; 2 Bar 85:1-3; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.74.9">Ps 74:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.2-6">Zec 13:2-6</a>). The Spirit would be known again in the age of the Messiah, but in the interim the Spirit was absent from Israel. Even the great Hillel (learned Jewish leader and teacher, 60? <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 20?), a near contemporary of Jesus, had not received the Spirit—though if anyone was worthy of the Spirit, it was he. There is a tradition that at a meeting of Hillel and other wise men, a voice from heaven said, “Among those here present is one who would have deserved the Holy Spirit to rest upon him, if his time had been worthy of it.” The wise men all looked at Hillel.</p>
<p>The consequence of this accepted dearth of the Spirit was that the Spirit in effect became subordinated to the law. The Spirit was the inspirer of the law, but since the Spirit could no longer be experienced directly, the law became the sole voice of the Spirit. It was this increasing dominance of the law and its authoritative interpreters that provided the background for the mission of Jesus and the initial spread of Christianity.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">If we are to understand the NT’s teaching on the Spirit, we must recognize both its continuity and discontinuity with the OT. At many points NT usage cannot be fully understood except against the background of OT concepts or passages. For example, the ambiguity of <a href="?bref=John.3.8">John 3:8</a> (“wind,” “Spirit”), <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.8">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a> (“breath”), and <a href="?bref=Rev.11.11">Revelation 11:11</a> (“breath of life”) takes us back to the basic Hebrew meanings of “spirit.” <a href="?bref=Acts.8.39">Acts 8:39</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.17.3">Revelation 17:3</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.21.10">21:10</a> reflect the same conception of the Spirit that we find in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.12">1 Kings 18:12</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.16">2 Kings 2:16</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.3.14">Ezekiel 3:14</a>. The NT writers generally share the rabbinic view that Scripture has the authority of the Spirit behind it (see <a href="?bref=Mark.12.36">Mk 12:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.25">Acts 28:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.7">Heb 3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.21">2 Pt 1:21</a>). The principal continuity is that the NT brings the fulfillment of what the OT writers looked forward to. At the same time, Christianity is not simply fulfilled Judaism. Jesus’ coming and his giving of his Spirit to live within his believers marks off the new faith as something new and distinct.</p>
<p class="h3">The Spirit of the New Age</p>
<p class="fl">The most striking feature of Jesus’ ministry and of the message of the earliest Christians was their conviction and proclamation that the blessings of the new age were already present, that the eschatological Spirit had already been poured out. With the exception of the Essenes at Qumran, no other group or individual within the Jewish religion of that time had dared to make such a bold claim. The prophets and the rabbis looked for a messianic age yet to come, and the apocalyptic writers warned of its imminent arrival, but none thought of it as already present. Even John the Baptist spoke only of one about to come and of the Spirit’s operation in the imminent future (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.8">Mk 1:8</a>). But for Jesus and first-century Christians, the longed for hope was a living reality, and the claim carried with it the exciting sense of being in “the last days.” Without some recognition of that eschatological dimension of the Christians’ faith and life, we cannot understand this teaching on, and experience of, the Spirit.</p>
<p>Jesus clearly thought of his teachings and healings as fulfillment of the prophetic hope (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.41-42">Mt 12:41-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.16-17">13:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.20-21">Lk 17:20-21</a>). In particular, he saw himself as the one anointed by the Spirit to provide salvation (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-6">Mt 5:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.17-19">Lk 4:17-19</a>). So, too, Jesus understood his exorcisms as the effect of the power of God and as manifestations of the end-time rule of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.27-28">Mt 12:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.22-26">Mk 3:22-26</a>). The Gospel writers, especially Luke, emphasize the eschatological character of Jesus’ life and ministry by stressing the role of the Spirit in his birth (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18">Mt 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.35,41,67">Lk 1:35, 41, 67</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.25-27">2:25-27</a>), his baptism (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.9-10">Mk 1:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.38">Acts 10:38</a>), and his ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1">Mt 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.18">12:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.12">Mk 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1,14">Lk 4:1, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.21">10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.34">Jn 3:34</a>).</p>
<p>The Christian church began with the in-breathing of the Holy Spirit on the day of Christ’s resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.20.22">Jn 20:22</a>), followed by the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost “in the last days.” The overwhelming experience of vision and inspired utterance was taken as proof positive that the new age prophesied by Joel had now arrived (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.2-5,17-18">Acts 2:2-5, 17-18</a>). Similarly, in Hebrews the gift of the Spirit is spoken of as “the powers of the age to come” (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-5">Heb 6:4-5</a>). More striking still is Paul’s understanding of the Spirit as the guarantee of God’s complete salvation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13-14">Eph 1:13-14</a>), and as the first installment of the believer’s inheritance of God’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.15-17">Rom 8:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.42-50">15:42-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6-7">Gal 4:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16-18,21-23">5:16-18, 21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13-14">Eph 1:13-14</a>). The Spirit is here again thought of as the power of the age to come, as that power (which will characterize God’s rule at the end of time) already shaping and transforming the lives of believers.</p>
<p>For Paul, this means also that the gift of the Spirit is but the beginning of a lifelong process that will not end until the believer’s whole person is brought under the Spirit’s power (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.11,23">Rom 8:11, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44-49">1 Cor 15:44-49</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-5">5:1-5</a>). It also means that the present experience of faith is one of lifelong tension between what God has already begun to bring about in the believer’s life and what has not yet been brought under God’s grace (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.6">Phil 1:6</a>). It is this tension between life “in the Spirit” and life “in the flesh” (see <a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>) that comes to poignant expression in <a href="?bref=Rom.7.24">Romans 7:24</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.2-4">2 Corinthians 5:2-4</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">The Spirit of New Life</p>
<p class="fl">Since the Spirit is the mark of the new age, it is not surprising that the NT writers understood the gift of the Spirit to be that which brings an individual into the new age. John the Baptist described the way the coming one would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Acts.1.5">Acts 1:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.11.16">11:16</a>, this imagery was taken up by Jesus, and the promise is seen as fulfilled at Pentecost—the outpouring of the Spirit here being understood as the risen Christ’s action in drawing his disciples into the new age (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.17,33">Acts 2:17, 33</a>).</p>
<p>It seems to be one of Luke’s aims in the book of Acts to highlight the central importance of the gift of the Spirit in conversion-initiation—it is that decisive “gift of the Holy Spirit” that makes one a Christian (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38-39">Acts 2:38-39</a>). People could have been followers of Jesus on earth, but it was only when they received the gift of the Spirit that they could be said to have “believed in the Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.16-17">11:16-17</a>). When the Spirit’s presence was manifested in and upon a person’s life, that was recognized by Peter as proof enough that God had accepted that person, even though he or she had not yet made any formal profession of faith or been baptized (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.44-48">10:44-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.15-18">11:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.7-9">15:7-9</a>). So too Apollos, already aglow with the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.25">18:25</a>), even though his knowledge of “the way of God” was slightly defective (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-26">24-26</a>), apparently was not required to supplement his “baptism of John” with Christian baptism. However, the 12 so-called disciples at Ephesus proved by their very ignorance of the Spirit that they were not yet disciples of the Lord Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-6">19:1-6</a>). Paul asked these 12 men, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.2">19:2</a>).</p>
<p>This accords with Paul’s emphasis in his letters. Belief and reception of the Spirit go together: to receive the Spirit is to begin the Christian life (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.2-3">Gal 3:2-3</a>); to be baptized in the Spirit is to become a member of the body of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Cor 12:13</a>); to “have the Spirit of Christ” is to belong to Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9-11">Rom 8:9-11</a>); to receive the Spirit is tantamount to becoming a child of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.14-17">Rom 8:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6-7">Gal 4:6-7</a>). The Spirit so characterizes the new age and the life of the new age that only the gift of the Spirit can bring a person into the new age to experience the life of the new age. For the Spirit is distinctively and peculiarly the life-giver; the Spirit indeed <span class="ital">is</span> the life of the new age (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2,6,10">Rom 8:2, 6, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Cor 15:45</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">2 Cor 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.25">Gal 5:25</a>).</p>
<p>In just the same way in John’s writings, the Spirit is characteristically the life-giving Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.6.63">Jn 6:63</a>), the power from above, the seed of divine life that brings about the new birth (<a href="?bref=John.3.3-8">Jn 3:3-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.9">1 Jn 3:9</a>), and a river of living water that brings life when one believes in Christ (<a href="?bref=John.7.37-39">Jn 7:37-39</a>; so also <a href="?bref=John.4.10,14">4:10, 14</a>). Or again, reception of the Spirit in <a href="?bref=John.20.22">John 20:22</a> is depicted as a new creation analogous to <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a>. Consequently, in <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.24">1 John 3:24</a> and <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.13">4:13</a>, possession and experience of the Spirit count as one of the “tests of life” listed in that letter.</p>
<p class="h3">Manifestations of the Spirit</p>
<p class="fl">It will be clear from what has already been said that when the first Christians, like the ancient Hebrews, spoke of the Spirit, they were thinking of experiences of divine power. In the NT, as in the OT, “Spirit” is the word used to explain the experience of new life and vitality (see above), of liberation from legalism (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.8.2">Rom 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17">2 Cor 3:17</a>), of spiritual refreshing and renewal (cf. e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">Is 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.29">Ez 39:29</a> with <a href="?bref=John.7.37-39">Jn 7:37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.5">Rom 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Cor 12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.5-6">1 Tm 3:5-6</a>). It is important to realize how wide a range of experiences were attributed to the Spirit: ecstatic experiences (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.24">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.43-47">10:43-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.6">19:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.10.10">10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.17">22:17</a>—“in ecstasy”; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.1-4">2 Cor 12:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.10">Rv 1:10</a>), emotional experiences (e.g., love—<a href="?bref=Rom.5.5">Rom 5:5</a>; joy—<a href="?bref=Acts.13.52">Acts 13:52</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.6">1 Thes 1:6</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-2">Phil 2:1-2</a>), experiences of illumination (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.14-17">2 Cor 3:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.17-18">Eph 1:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-5">Heb 6:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.20-21">1 Jn 2:20-21</a>), and experiences issuing in moral transformation (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>). Likewise, when Paul speaks of spiritual gifts, called <span class="greek">charismata</span> (acts or words that bring divine grace to concrete expression), he evidently has a wide range of actual events in mind: inspired speech (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.8-10">1 Cor 12:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.5">1 Thes 1:5</a>), miracles and healings (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.9">1 Cor 12:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.5">Gal 3:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.2.4">Heb 2:4</a>), and various acts of service and help, of counsel and administration, and of aid and mercy (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.7-8">Rom 12:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28">1 Cor 12:28</a>).</p>
<p>In talking thus of the Spirit in terms of experience, we should not overemphasize particular experiences or manifestations, as though earliest Christianity consisted of a sequence of mountaintop experiences or spiritual highs. There clearly were such experiences, indeed a wide range of experiences, but no one experience is singled out to be sought by all (except prophecy). There is no distinctively second (or third) experience of the Spirit in the NT, and Paul warned against overvaluing particular manifestations of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.6-19">1 Cor 14:6-19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.1-10">2 Cor 12:1-10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.8.11-13">Mk 8:11-13</a>). Where particular experiences are valued, it is as manifestations of a more sustained experience, particular expressions of an underlying relationship (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.6.3-5">Acts 6:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.24">11:24</a>—“full of the Spirit”; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.18">Eph 5:18</a>). What we are in touch with here is the vigor of the experiential dimension of earliest Christianity. If the Spirit is the breath of the new life in Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.9-10,14">Ez 37:9-10, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.22">Jn 20:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Cor 15:45</a>), then presumably the analogy extends further, and the experience of the Spirit is like the experience of breathing: one is not conscious of it all the time, but if one is not conscious of it, at least sometimes, something is wrong.</p>
<p class="h3">The Fellowship of the Spirit</p>
<p class="fl">It was out of this shared experience of the Spirit that the earliest Christian community grew and developed, for this is what “the fellowship [<span class="greek">koinonia</span>] of the Spirit” properly means: common participation in the same Spirit (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.1">Phil 2:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.42">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.4-9">1 Cor 1:4-9</a>). It was the gift of the Spirit that brought those in Samaria, Caesarea, and elsewhere effectively into the community of the Spirit (Act 8, 10). So also, it was the experience of the one Spirit that provided the unifying bond in the churches of Paul’s mission (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Cor 12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.3-4">Eph 4:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-2">Phil 2:1-2</a>). Here we see the real importance of the divine manifestations of the Spirit for Paul: it is out of the diversity of these particular manifestations that the body of Christ grows in unity (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.4-8">Rom 12:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-17">1 Cor 12:12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.4-16">Eph 4:4-16</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</p>
<p class="fl">The Spirit as identified with Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The most important development and element in earliest Christian understanding of the Spirit is that the Spirit is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.7">Acts 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.9">Rom 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6">Gal 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.19">Phil 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11">1 Pt 1:11</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.7.38">Jn 7:38</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.7">16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.30">19:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.1">Rv 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.6">5:6</a>). The Spirit is to be identified as the Spirit that bears witness to Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.15.26">Jn 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.13-15">16:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.32">Acts 5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.3">1 Cor 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2">1 Jn 4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.7-8">5:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.10">Rv 19:10</a>), but also, and more profoundly, as the Spirit that inspired and empowered Jesus himself. This Spirit became available to the believers after Christ’s resurrection.</p>
<p> The apostles John and Paul were quite clear in their writings about Christ becoming spirit through resurrection. The keynote verses penned by John are <a href="?bref=John.6.63">John 6:63</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.37-39">7:37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.16-18">14:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.22">20:22</a>; and <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.24">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.13">4:13</a>. The critical passages written by Paul are <a href="?bref=Rom.8.9-10">Romans 8:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17-18">2 Corinthians 3:17-18</a>; and <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>.</p>
<p>Revelation concerning the Spirit of Jesus is progressive in the Gospel of John. John does not tell us from the beginning that people could not actually receive eternal life until the hour of Christ’s glorification. Throughout the Gospel, Jesus declares to various people that he can give them eternal life if they would believe in him. He promises them the water of life, the bread of life, and the light of life. But no one could really partake of these until after the Lord had risen. As a foretaste, as a sample, they could receive life via the Lord’s words because his words were themselves spirit and life (<a href="?bref=John.6.63">Jn 6:63</a>); however, it was not until the Spirit would become available that believers could actually become the recipients of the divine, eternal life. After the Lord’s discourse in <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">John 6</a>, Jesus said, “It is the Spirit that gives life, the flesh profits nothing” (v <a href="?bref=John.6.63">63</a>). In the flesh Jesus could not give them the bread of life, but when the Spirit became available, they could have life. Again, Jesus offered the water of life—even life flowing like rivers of living water—to the Jews assembled at the Feast of Tabernacles. He told them to come and drink of him. But no one could, then and there, come and drink of him. So John added a note: “But this he spoke concerning the Spirit, for the Spirit was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified” (<a href="?bref=John.7.39">7:39</a>). Once Jesus would be glorified through resurrection, the Spirit of the glorified Jesus would be available for people to drink. In <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">John 6</a>, Jesus offered himself as the bread of life to be eaten by people; and in <a href="?bref=John.7.1-53">John 7</a>, he offered himself as the water of life to refresh men. But no one could eat him or drink him until he became spirit, as was intimated in <a href="?bref=John.6.63">John 6:63</a> and then stated plainly in <a href="?bref=John.7.39">John 7:39</a>.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="CommunityOfTheSpirit"/>
<p>In <a href="?bref=John.14.16-18">John 14:16-18</a>, Jesus went one step further in identifying himself with the Spirit. He told the disciples that he would give them another Comforter. Then he told them that they should know who this Comforter was because he was, then and there, abiding with them and would, in the near future, be in them. Who else but Jesus was abiding with them at that time? Then after telling the disciples that the Comforter would come to them, he said, “I am coming to you.” First he said that the Comforter would come to them and abide in them, and then in the same breath he said that he would come to them and abide in them (see <a href="?bref=John.14.20">14:20</a>). In short, the coming of the Comforter to the disciples was one and the same as the coming of Jesus to the disciples. The Comforter who was dwelling with the disciples that night was the Spirit in Christ; the Comforter who would be in the disciples (after the resurrection) would be Christ in the Spirit.</p>
<p>On the evening of the resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples and then breathed into them the Holy Spirit. This inbreathing, reminiscent of God’s breathing into Adam the breath of life (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>), became the fulfillment of all that had been promised and anticipated earlier in John’s Gospel. Through this impartation, the disciples became regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This historical event marked the genesis of the new creation. Jesus could now be realized as the bread of life, the water of life, and the light of life. The believers now possessed his divine, eternal, risen life. From that time forward, Christ as spirit indwelt his believers. Thus, in his first epistle John could say, “And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he gave to us” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.24">1 Jn 3:24</a>), and again, “Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.13">4:13</a>).</p>
<p>The apostles had quite an adjustment to make after Christ’s resurrection. They had become so accustomed to his physical presence that it was difficult for them to learn how to live by his spiritual, indwelling presence. All through the 40 days after his resurrection, from the time the apostles received the inbreathing of the Spirit, Christ was teaching the disciples to make the transfer. He would physically appear and then disappear intermittently. His appearances were very frequent in the beginning and then they steadily diminished. His aim was to guide the apostles into knowing him in his invisible presence. However, this was so new to them that he had to keep appearing to them in order to strengthen and reassure them. But his real desire was to help them live by faith and not by sight. When he appeared to the disciples as they were all together the second time, with Thomas present, he chided Thomas for his unbelief. Then he prounounced this blessing, “Blessed are those who do not see me and yet believe” (<a href="?bref=John.20.29">Jn 20:29</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul was such a “blessed” one. He did not know Christ in the flesh. He knew only the risen Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.15-16">2 Cor 5:15-16</a>). In this regard, he had an advantage over the early apostles. They had a great adjustment to make, but from the very beginning, Paul knew the risen Christ as Spirit. Paul became the forerunner of all those Christians who have never seen Jesus in the flesh and who have come to experience him in the Spirit. Yes, Paul had seen the risen Lord; he was the last one to do so (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8">1 Cor 15:8</a>). And from that time onward he realized that Jesus was a glorified man, exalted far above all. Paul wrote much concerning this, but his writings did not leave the far-above-all Jesus far away because this was not what Paul experienced. Any experienced Christian should be able to testify that the Christ in the heavens is also the Christ in the heart.</p>
<p>In his writings, Paul often speaks of the Spirit and Christ synonymously. This is evident in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.9-10">Romans 8:9-10</a>. The terms “Spirit of God,” “Spirit of Christ,” and “Christ” are all used interchangeably. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ. In these verses, it is evident that Paul identified the Spirit with Christ because in Christian experience they are absolutely identical. There is no such thing as an experience of Christ apart from the Spirit. The separation and/or distinction does exist in Trinitarian theology—and for very good reasons—but the separation is nearly nonexistent in actual experience. Several of Paul’s statements are written from the vantage point of experience.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>, Paul says that the risen Jesus became life-giving spirit. Notice the verse does not say Jesus became the Spirit, as if the second person of the Trinity became the third, but that Jesus became spirit in the sense that his mortal existence and form were metamorphosed into a spiritual existence and form. Jesus’ person was not changed through the resurrection, only his form. With this changed spiritual form, Jesus regained the essential state of being he had emptied himself of in becoming a man. Before he became a man, he subsisted in the form of God (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.6">Phil 2:6</a>), which form is Spirit and thereby was united to the Spirit (the third of the Trinity), while still remaining distinct. Thus, when the scripture says that the Lord “became life-giving spirit,” it does not mean that the Son became the Holy Spirit. But it does indicate that Christ, via resurrection, appropriated a new, spiritual form (while still retaining a body—a glorified one) that enabled him to commence a new spiritual existence (see <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">1 Pt 3:18</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.1-18">2 Corinthians 3</a>, Paul explains that the NT ministry is a ministry carried out by the Spirit of the living God (v <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.3">3</a>), who is the Spirit that gives life (v <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">6</a>). In fact, the whole NT economy is characterized as “the ministry of the Spirit” (v <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.8">8</a>). At the same time, Paul emphasizes that the function of the NT ministry is to bring God’s people to see and experience the glorious Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.3,14,16-18">3:3, 14, 16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4-6">4:4-6</a>). It is in this context that Paul boldly declares, “The Lord is the Spirit” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17">3:17</a>). He who turns his heart to the Lord is, in effect, turning his heart to the Spirit. lf the Lord were not the Spirit abiding in the believers, how could they turn their hearts to him? And how could they be transformed into the same image? <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">Second Corinthians 3:18</a> says, “But we all, with unveiled face mirroring the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord-Spirit.” According to the Greek, the last phrase of this verse could be rendered “the Lord, the Spirit” (see <span class="sc">asv</span>) or “the Lord, who is the Spirit” (see <span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>) because the expression “the Spirit” is in direct apposition to “the Lord” (i.e., it is a further description of the Lord). Thus, the Lord is the Spirit.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when the Scriptures identify the Spirit with Christ and vice versa, the identification is not equivocation. Christ is not the Holy Spirit. Christ and the Spirit are distinct persons of the Trinity, as is affirmed by the overall teaching of the Word. But the Scriptures do identify Christ and the Spirit in the context of Christian experience. It would be accurate to say that Christians experience Christ through his Spirit, the Spirit of Christ. One cannot know Jesus apart from the Spirit or other than through the Spirit.</p>

  <title>Spirit of Man*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SPIRIT OF MAN*</p>
<p class="fl">The innermost being of the human person, corresponding with the nature of God, which is Spirit. Some scholars think the spirit is the same as the soul; others see a distinction. As such, some believe in the tripartite (threefold) nature of a human (cf. <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">1 Thes 5:23</a>), spirit, soul, and body, as against a bipartite (twofold) nature, material and immaterial.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">First Thessalonians 5:23</a> clearly speaks of a tripartite design for mankind. Other Scriptures see soul and spirit as the same. A clear case of the parallel (synonymous) use of soul and spirit (as in <a href="?bref=Job.7.11">Jb 7:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.9">Is 26:9</a>, etc.) is in Mary’s “Magnificat.” She says, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.47">Lk 1:47</a>, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>). Rather than divide the two as “parts,” some have suggested that a human <span class="ital">has</span> a spirit and <span class="ital">is</span> a soul. Usually spirit indicates the vitalizing, energizing, empowering agent; it is that essence of the human being that corresponds with God’s nature and can commune with God, who is Spirit.</p>
<p>Those who are united to Christ experience spiritual union with him—his Spirit with their spirit. This is what Paul meant when he said, “He who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.17">1 Cor 6:17</a>). Note that Paul does not say, “he who joins himself to the Spirit is one spirit”; he uses the word “Lord” as synonymous with “the Spirit.” Union with the Lord is a union of the human spirit with his Spirit. Since the day of regeneration, a believer’s human spirit is united to Christ’s Spirit. Look at <a href="?bref=John.3.6">John 3:6</a> (“that which is born of the Spirit is spirit”) and <a href="?bref=Rom.8.16">Romans 8:16</a> (“his Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God”). These scriptures show that one’s union with Christ is based upon the regeneration of one’s spirit by the divine Spirit.</p>

  <title>Spirits in Prison</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SPIRITS IN PRISON</p>
<p class="fl">Term used in <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-20">1 Peter 3:18-20a</a>. There is little agreement among scholars as to what “spirits in prison” really refers to or why Jesus would have gone to preach to them. Martin Luther confessed that verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19">19</a> “is an amazing text and as dark as any in the New Testament and I am not sure I know what St. Peter means.” Because there is so much disagreement and uncertainty, several possible interpretations are presented here.</p>
<p>First, many commentators take “spirits in prison” to refer to the disembodied spirits of the people who disobeyed the preaching of Noah and are now in Sheol or hades—the place of the departed unbelievers. Some think Christ preached the gospel to them so that they could believe and be saved (though there is little, if any, support in the NT that a person who dies as an unbeliever can get a second chance). Others think that Christ simply proclaimed his victory over Satan and made known the blessings that these spirits once for all rejected.</p>
<p>Second, other commentators argue that the “spirits in prison” are not human spirits but rather are the same supernatural beings referred to in <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.22">1 Peter 3:22</a>—the evil angels, authorities, and powers. They are related to the “sons of God” in <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Genesis 6:1-4</a>. In support of this, they argue that the proclamation to these spirits is not before but after Jesus’ resurrection, and so is probably not a <span class="ital">descent</span> to the dead but an <span class="ital">ascent</span> to the “heavenly places,” where the rebellious spiritual powers live (see <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Eph 6:12</a>). Furthermore, in the pre-Christian Jewish book of 1 Enoch, Enoch is pictured as proclaiming doom to the apostate angels. So Christ is seen as the new Enoch declaring to the “spirits in prison” his victory on the cross and their final defeat.</p>
<p>Finally, still others have suggested that the preaching of Christ was neither to supernatural spiritual beings nor to the departed spirits in Hades. Rather, the preaching took place in the days of Noah and was addressed to Noah’s contemporaries, who, because they disobeyed, are now in prison. In other words, the Spirit of Christ, referred to in <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11">1 Peter 1:11</a>, and which existed before the Incarnation, inspired Noah to preach to the people. In this interpretation there is no “descent into hell” and no declaration to the fallen angels. The text simply says that Christ in his spiritual dimension preached in the days of Noah.</p>

<p class="h1">SPIRITUAL GIFTS</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase regularly used to translate two Greek words, <span class="greek">charismata</span> and <span class="greek">pneumatika</span> (the plural forms of <span class="greek">charisma</span> and <span class="greek">pneumatikon</span>). Both words are almost exclusively Pauline within the biblical writings; elsewhere in the NT, they appear only in <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Peter 2:5</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.10">4:10</a>. Other writers, of course, mention phenomena that fall within Paul’s definition of “spiritual gifts,” but for specific teaching on the subject, one must depend on Paul first and foremost.</p>
<p>Both words are derived from more familiar words, <span class="greek">charis</span> (grace) and <span class="greek">pneuma</span> (spirit). Both have similar senses—<span class="greek">charisma</span> meaning “expression of grace,” <span class="greek">pneumatikon</span> meaning “expression of Spirit.” Their range of application, however, is somewhat different.</p>
<p><span class="greek">Charisma</span> denotes God’s saving action in Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.15-16">Rom 5:15-16</a>) and the gift of eternal life (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.23">6:23</a>). More generally, in <a href="?bref=Rom.11.29">Romans 11:29</a> it probably refers to the series of gracious acts on behalf of Israel whereby God made Israel’s calling and election sure. In <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.11">2 Corinthians 1:11</a> it probably refers to a particular action of God that brought Paul deliverance from deadly peril. Otherwise, the reference seems to be to divine grace as mediated through individuals, with Paul presumably thinking of the sort of utterances and deeds that he illustrates in <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6-8">Romans 12:6-8</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.8-10">1 Corinthians 12:8-10</a> (so in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.11">Rom 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.7">1 Cor 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.7">7:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.4-11,28-30">12:4-11, 28-30</a>; similarly <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.10">1 Pt 4:10</a>).</p>
<p><span class="greek">Pneumatikon</span> has a wider range of usage. It is more properly an adjective and so describes various things (and people) as “spiritual,” as manifesting the Spirit, or as serving as the instrument of the Spirit. These include some particular word or act (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.11">Rom 1:11</a>), the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.14">7:14</a>), the manna, water from the rock, and the rock itself in the wilderness wanderings of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.3-4">1 Cor 10:3-4</a>), the resurrection body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44-46">15:44-46</a>), unspecified blessings “in the heavenly places” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">Eph 1:3</a>), particular insights into the divine will (<a href="?bref=Col.1.9">Col 1:9</a>), and songs in worship (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.19">Eph 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.16">Col 3:16</a>). As a plural noun, it can be used of individuals (“the spiritual ones,” <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.13,15">1 Cor 2:13, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.37">14:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.1">Gal 6:1</a>) or of things (“the spirituals,” “spiritual gifts,” <a href="?bref=Rom.15.27">Rom 15:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.13">1 Cor 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.11">9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1">12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.1">14:1</a>), even “spiritual powers in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Eph 6:12</a>).</p>
<p>From this brief survey, a more precise definition of “spiritual gifts” can be made. Whatever thing or individual serves as an instrument of the Spirit or manifests the Spirit or embodies the Spirit is a spiritual gift (<span class="greek">pneumatikon</span>). Whatever event, word, or action is a concrete expression of grace or serves as a means of grace is a spiritual gift (<span class="greek">charisma</span>). <span class="greek">Pneumatikon</span> is the more general word; <span class="greek">charisma</span> is more specific. Moreover, <span class="greek">charisma</span> is probably Paul’s own word (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.11">Rom 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6">12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.7">1 Cor 7:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.4">12:4</a>) in preference to the more ambiguous <span class="greek">pneumatikon</span><span class="ital">,</span> which seems to have been popular with those causing difficulty for Paul in Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.13-3.4">1 Cor 2:13–3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.37">14:37</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44-46">15:44-46</a>). Consequently, attention will focus in what follows on <span class="greek">charisma</span><span class="ital">.</span> Not forgetting those passages where Paul uses this word in broader terms for the direct act of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.15,16">Rom 5:15, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.23">6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.29">11:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.11">1 Cor 1:11</a>), concentration will be on the passages where Paul speaks in more precise terms of particular manifestations of grace mediated through one individual to others—“spiritual gifts” in this the narrower sense of <span class="greek">charisma</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>The lists of <span class="greek">charismata</span> (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-21">Rom 12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-31">1 Cor 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-32">Eph 4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.1-19">1 Pt 4</a>) are the obvious starting point because they provide the clearest indications of what Paul would include within the range of spiritual gifts. For Paul (the one who gave Christianity the concept of <span class="greek">charisma</span>), a spiritual gift is essentially an act of God’s Spirit, a concrete manifestation in word or deed of God’s grace through an individual for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>In its basic sense, a spiritual gift is a specific act of God, and this remains true even when it is mediated through any individual. This means that no one can hope to manifest such a gift except in conscious openness to and dependence on God. By extension Paul can speak of individuals “having” or “possessing” certain spiritual gifts (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.6">Rom 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.7">1 Cor 7:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.3">12:3</a>), but this is presumably just shorthand for their being so open to God’s grace that that grace regularly or constantly manifests itself through them in particular ways. Such language no more means that the <span class="greek">charisma</span> is an ability at the individual’s command than does the similar talk of “having the Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9,23">Rom 8:9, 23</a>). It is true, however, that in <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">1 Timothy 4:14</a> and <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6">2 Timothy 1:6</a> this basic sense is beginning to be left behind.</p>
<p>A spiritual gift is any event, word, or action that embodies and expresses God’s grace. In this sense sacraments can be “means of grace” (though they are never called this in the NT), as are many other utterances and actions as well. In recognizing this, one can recognize too that the lists of gifts (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.12.6-8">Rom 12:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.8-10">1 Cor 12:8-10</a>) are neither definitive nor exhaustive, simply typical manifestations of the Spirit (or those with which they needed some advice). The degree of overlap between these various lists shows that Paul was not concerned to specify a precisely defined catalog; he simply selected a number of activities and utterances through which he saw the grace of God manifesting itself in his churches.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheChurchSViewOfSpiritualGifts"/>
<p>It is important to grasp that Paul saw all Christians as charismatics. Whoever “has” the Spirit—that is, is open to and being led by the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9-14">Rom 8:9-14</a>)—will inevitably manifest the grace of God in some way and should also be open to the Spirit’s power coming to expression in particular words and deeds within the community of the Spirit. For Paul, the church is the body of Christ. The functions of that body’s members are exemplified by the spiritual gifts (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.4-6">Rom 12:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.14-30">1 Cor 12:14-30</a>). Unless the individual is functioning charismatically, he is not functioning as a member of the body. The Spirit’s gifts are the living movements of Christ’s body. As the body is many different members functioning as one body, so the unity of the church grows out of the diverse functions (gifts) of its members. It follows that a spiritual gift is given primarily with the community in view. It is given “for the common good” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.7">1 Cor 12:7</a>). That is why a selfish, loveless clutching after <span class="greek">charismata</span> is wrong and futile (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>). A spiritual gift is never one’s to use as one wants for one’s own benefit (except perhaps glossolalia, but that is why Paul gives it lower value). It is given to one only in the sense that God chooses to act through one for others. More precisely, it is given only through one to the community, and one benefits only as the community benefits. The spiritual health and edification of the individual is inextricably bound up with the health and well-being of the whole body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.14-26">12:14-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.16">Eph 4:16</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=ApostleApostleship_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Apostle, Apostleship</a>; <a href="?item=Miracle_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Miracle</a>; <a href="?item=Prophecy_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Prophecy</a>; <a href="?item=Teacher_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Teacher</a>; <a href="?item=TonguesSpeakingin_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Tongues, Speaking in</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">STAR IN THE EAST*</p>
<p class="fl">Star that guided the magi to the infant Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.2,7-10">Mt 2:2, 7-10</a>). The magi were residents of some Eastern land (possibly Parthia, Babylon, or Arabia) who came to Herod. They explained that they had seen the star of the King of the Jews in their homeland. Herod and the Jewish scribes directed the men to Bethlehem, but the star guided them to the place of Jesus’ birth.</p>
<p>Numerous theories have been advanced to explain this phenomenon. In the 17th century Johannes Kepler suggested that the explosion of a distant star (supernova) would emit extraordinary light. While many such explosions are recorded each year (few visible to the naked eye), none are known from the time of Christ. The ancients were fascinated with comets. Halley’s comet was first sighted and recorded in 240 <span class="era">BC</span> and, if calculated at 77-year intervals, would have appeared in Judea in 12–11 <span class="era">BC</span>. This, however, significantly antedates Jesus’ birth; moreover, comets were usually associated with catastrophes in the ancient world. That the ancients practiced astrology, plotting the constellations and the course of the planets, is well known. Rare planetary conjunctions were studied and interpreted. For instance, in 7 <span class="era">BC</span> Jupiter and Saturn came together in the zodiac constellation of Pisces (this occurs every 257 years). According to this view, Jupiter was associated with the world ruler, Saturn with the region of Syria-Palestine, and Pisces with the last days.</p>
<p>First-century readers—Jewish or Greek—would not have been surprised to read about a new star presaging the birth of Jesus. In <a href="?bref=Matt.2.2">Matthew 2:2</a> “in the east” might mean “at its rising.” In other words, the wise men had witnessed a new star and interpreted it as hallmarking some new event. In Greco-Roman society, the heavens often foretold or explained historical events (e.g., the founding of Rome, the birth of Augustus, etc.). Judaism likewise emphasized stars: Josephus recorded astral phenomena during the fall of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. Moreover, rabbis were enthralled with the imagery of the Balaam story in <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Numbers 24:17</a> (see esp. <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Nm 24:17</a>, LXX) and symbolized their messianic expectations in a star. This was also common at Qumran (CD 7:19 f.; 1QM 11:6; cf. T. Levi 18:3; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.16">Rv 22:16</a>). Similarly, coins struck after the onset of the revolt of Simon Bar-Kochba (“son of a star”) bore a star.</p>

Their mission probably included bringing aid for Paul’s personal needs and seeking his advice for resolving the problems in the Corinthian church. Undoubtedly, Paul wrote and sent his first letter to the Corinthian church with this small delegation when they returned to Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.16">1 Cor 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.15-17">16:15-17</a>).</p>

  <title>Stephen</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">STEPHEN</p>
<p class="fl">One of the first deacons and the first martyr of the apostolic church. For Luke, Stephen represents the growing Hellenistic interest of certain members in the early Jerusalem church. In addition, Stephen’s major speech (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-53">Acts 7:1-53</a>) serves as a critique of traditional Judaism and suggests evangelization beyond Judea.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-15">Acts 6</a>, Luke tells us of the first division in the early church. The community consisted of two Jewish groups described as “Hebrews” and “Hellenists.” These terms no doubt indicate cultural and linguistic divisions: Jews who had emerged from either Aramaic- or Greek-speaking synagogues. Stephen was one of seven deacons nominated to serve the needs of the Hellenists. Yet even in his introduction it is evident that his importance stands out; he alone is described as “full of faith and of the Holy Spirit” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">5</a>). After their commission Stephen is mentioned again as “full of grace and power,” and as doing “great wonders and signs among the people” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.6.8">8</a>).</p>
<p>Stephen’s preaching put him in contention with the Hellenistic synagogues of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>). As his subsequent speech before the Sanhedrin indicates, Stephen propounded a radical abrogation of the ancestral customs of Judaism and the temple cult. Luke’s account of his arrest and interrogation (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.10-7.60">6:10–7:60</a>) is intended to evoke memories of Jesus’ trial. While capital punishment was reserved for the Roman governor once Judea had become a province, offenses against the temple still could be prosecuted by the Sanhedrin. In the end, Stephen’s execution by stoning is pursued with a vengeance (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.54-60">7:54-60</a>). As the first martyr of the church, Stephen models Jesus even in death. He commits his spirit to Jesus (as Christ had done to the Father, <a href="?bref=Luke.23.46">Lk 23:46</a>) and dies asking forgiveness for his prosecutors (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.59-60">Acts 7:59-60</a>).</p>
<p>The speech in <a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-60">Acts 7</a> not only provides us with Stephen’s defense but in addition serves Luke’s broader interests in the spread of the gospel abroad (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>). It is the longest speech in Acts and appears at a pivotal place in apostolic history. Stephen provides a critical recital of biblical history and argues that the major pillars upon which Judaism rested were in jeopardy. The temple, in which the Jews took pride, was not a divine invention—Solomon’s temple was contrary to the earlier tabernacle in the wilderness. The Torah, in which religious security was sought, was used by Stephen to chronicle Israel’s consistent disobedience. These same scriptures announced the coming of “the righteous one,” whom Israel crucified.</p>
<p>The implications of the speech are vital. God is free to move beyond the national/religious boundaries of Judaism. The exclusivistic outlook of Judaism is artificial. God’s work is dynamic. And if Stephen’s conclusions are correct, the Jewish church ought to be free to take the gospel beyond Judea. Stephen’s martyrdom introduced a major persecution in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-3">Acts 8:1-3</a>), which was followed by the proclamation of the gospel to the Samaritans and then the Greeks.</p>

  <title>Stoicism*, Stoics</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">STOICISM*, STOICS</p>
<p class="fl">A widespread Greek philosophy, well represented in the audience at Athens listening to Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.16-34">Acts 17:16-34</a>). The apostle was probably familiar with it, for it had begun in Athens around 300 <span class="era">BC</span>, with Zeno’s teaching in the “stoa” (porches) of public buildings, and had spread throughout the Greco-Roman world. It was known, for example, at Tarsus and on the island of Cyprus, so that Paul would no doubt have encountered Stoics earlier in his journeys and possibly even in his hometown. The scope and power of its influence are indicated by the fact that the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (d. <span class="era">AD</span> 180) was himself a Stoic, some of whose philosophical writings have survived.</p>
<p>The earliest Stoics were primarily concerned with cosmology, that is, the study of nature’s origin and its laws. They were materialists, who held that all things come from the one basic element of fire and will eventually return to that one element in a vast cosmic conflagration. They, therefore, had a cyclical view of cosmic history, in which one universe after another arises and is destroyed. Both the orderliness of things as we know them, and this cyclical pattern of history, were ascribed to the organizing and sustaining power of a pervasive force known as the <span class="greek">Logos</span> that is sometimes regarded as divine. Its laws were the laws of nature to which all creatures must conform. It gives to all things their essential nature and so gives life and reason to men. In fact, the Logos is in man, taking the form of the human soul. Hence, to live according to reason is to live according to the natural order of things, and this is good. Conscious obedience to natural law liberates a man from fear and concern about external circumstances over which he has no control but which are still ruled by nature’s laws. The good life, then, is one in which reason, not passion, rules, and peace of mind and harmony with nature consequently prevail.</p>
<p>Stoic ideas proved attractive to some Christians because of the apparent similarities between the Stoic logos and the Logos of <a href="?bref=John.1.1-18">John 1:1-18</a>, and between the idea of natural law and the law of God. </p>

At first, the Israelites used Phoenician artisans, but they soon learned the art themselves and produced many fine buildings, such as those in Samaria. Herod’s masons left behind beautiful masonry in Jerusalem, Hebron, Samaria, and elsewhere. Some of these artisans produced fine work for the interior of buildings to be used in windows, doors, lintels, and capitals for pillars. One special class of stonecutters, the engravers (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.11">Ex 28:11</a>), worked with precious stones to produce seals, ornamental pieces, and jewelry.</p>

<p class="list">16. Lapis lazuli, a deep blue stone; a compound of sodium, aluminum, calcium, sulphur, and silver containing a mixture of several minerals. It generally has golden flecks of iron pyrites and was widely used for ornamental purposes in the ancient world. It is akin to sapphire.</p>
<p class="list">17. Marble, a limestone crystallized by metamorphism, taking a high polish, durable and suitable for building purposes (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.2">1 Chr 29:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.12">Rv 18:12</a>).</p>

See <a href="#Sardonyx">Sardonyx below</a>.</p>
<p class="list">19. Pearl, a hard smooth substance, white or variously colored, which grows in the shell of various bivalve mollusks. In the NT “pearls” are known as ornaments for women (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.9">1 Tm 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.4">Rv 17:4</a>) or as items for trade (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.12,16">Rv 18:12, 16</a>). The kingdom of heaven is likened to a fine pearl, which people seek at great cost (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.45-46">Mt 13:45-46</a>).</p>
<p class="list">20. Ruby, an uncertain translation of the Hebrew word <span class="greek">peninim</span> in six places (<a href="?bref=Job.28.18">Jb 28:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.15">Prv 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.8.11">8:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.15">20:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.31.10">31:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.7">Lam 4:7</a>).

It still is straight, though it is on an elevation about 15 feet (4.6 meters) higher than the original thoroughfare; it is called by this same name (Rue Droite). It runs east and west on the south boundary of the Christian quarter. The “house of Judas” is no longer there, but in a lane off the eastern end of Straight Street is the “house of Ananias.”</p>

<p class="h1">STRANGLING</p>
<p class="fl">One of four practices from which the early gentile Christians were asked to abstain out of respect for their Jewish Christian brothers and sisters. Jewish law prohibited the eating of any meat from which the animal’s blood was not fully drained at the time of slaughtering. The Jerusalem Council requested the early church to observe this practice in order to keep peace between Jewish and gentile Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.20,29">Acts 15:20, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.25">21:25</a>).</p>
<p>Strangulation was also one of four forms of capital punishment administered by the Jewish law courts. Though it was not mentioned as a method of punishment in the Bible, strangulation was later adopted by rabbinic Judaism as the mode of execution.</p>

Strong drink was used as a libation in the Levitical sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Num.28.7">Nm 28:7</a>) and was permitted in the menu of the feast at the time of tithing (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.26">Dt 14:26</a>).</p>

  <title>Stumbling Block*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">STUMBLING BLOCK*</p>
<p class="fl">Term used both literally and figuratively to refer to anything that might cause one to stumble.</p>
<p>The phrase is used literally in <a href="?bref=Lev.19.14">Leviticus 19:14</a>, where the people of Israel are admonished not to “put a stumbling block before the blind,” but to “fear the Lord your God.” An isolated figurative use occurs in <a href="?bref=Jer.6.21">Jeremiah 6:21</a>, where God promises to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel if they do not heed his warnings.</p>
<p>The most common OT usage, however, is found in Ezekiel, where the phrase is used to refer to idols and idolatry: “Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces; should I let myself be inquired of at all by them?” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.14.3">Ez 14:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; also <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.19">7:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.12">44:12</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the term essentially retains its Hebraic meaning. Even so, the phrase is employed figuratively to speak of the difficulties encountered by many Jews in believing Jesus to be the Son of God: “But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.23">1 Cor 1:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.9.31-32">Rom 9:31-32</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rom.11.11-12">Romans 11:11-12</a>, Paul says that this resistance is actually part of God’s plan to spread his riches to the world. Finally, <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.9">1 Corinthians 8:9</a> uses “stumbling block” to speak of some practices that might in themselves be appropriate but might also have the unintended effect of offending a weaker brother (see also <a href="?bref=Rom.14.13">Rom 14:13</a>).</p>

<p class="list">1. Town in the Jordan Valley listed along with other towns as belonging to the tribe of Gad (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.27">Jos 13:27</a>). It is located in the fertile valley called Ghaur Abu ‘Udeidah, known in the Bible as the valley of Succoth (<a href="?bref=Ps.60.6">Pss 60:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.108.7">108:7</a>); it comprises the central portion of the Jordan Valley on the eastern side, between the Wadi Rejeb and the Jabbok River.</p>
<p class="list-text">The place is mentioned for the first time in the account of Jacob’s meeting with Esau, which occurred just south of Penuel. Jacob went from the meeting to Succoth and built some shelters for his cattle, which is given as the explanation for the name of the settlement (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.17">Gn 33:17</a>)—Succoth means “shelters.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Later, the men of Succoth refused to give food to Gideon and his men when they were pursuing the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.5-9">Jgs 8:5-9</a>). Upon his return, Gideon made a point of punishing the elders of Succoth (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.8.13-17">13-17</a>). The form of social organization reflected in this passage has suggested that the population was not Israelite at the time of Gideon’s visitation.</p>
<p class="list-text">Finally, Succoth is mentioned with regard to Solomon’s building projects. The metal casting for the important fixtures and implements of the temple was performed in the area between Succoth and Zarethan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.46">1 Kgs 7:46</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.17">2 Chr 4:17</a>). It is possible that Succoth of the monarchical period was destroyed by Shishak of Egypt.</p>
<p class="list-text">It has been proposed that the place-name occurs in two other passages: as the staging area for David’s forces in the battle with Ammon, when the ark and the army were “living in shelters (<span class="hebrew">sukkoth</span>)” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.11">2 Sm 11:11</a>), and as the staging area for Ben-hadad’s troops in his war against Samaria (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.12,16">1 Kgs 20:12, 16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in Egypt mentioned as the first station of the Israelites in their exodus from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.37">Ex 12:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.20">13:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.5-6">Nm 33:5-6</a>); it appears between Rameses and Etham. </p>
<p class="list-text">Egyptian sources, texts of the Anastasi collection, refer to a place that is most likely the same as biblical Succoth. An Edomite tribe is recorded as bringing their herds in from the desert to pasture them in the Delta, passing by the strong point at <span class="ital">Tkw</span> [Old Egyptian for Succoth] (Papyrus Anastasi VI, 54). The military garrison there was commanded by a “commander” of (archer) troops, and the fort was named after Pharaoh Mernephta (Papyrus Anastasi, VI, 55).</p>

<p class="h1">SUFFERING</p>
<p class="fl">Anything causing pain or distress; calamity. From the biblical viewpoint, affliction began with the entrance of sin into the world. Both mankind and all creation were afflicted with “thorns and thistles,” sin, death, and decay (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.3.16-19">Gn 3:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.18-21">Rom 8:18-21</a>). Because of sin, misery is a common human experience, and our short life is full of trouble (<a href="?bref=Job.14.1-6">Jb 14:1-6</a>). It is impossible for human beings to avoid natural calamity, physical injury, and interpersonal conflict (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.9">2 Chr 20:9</a>), yet God uses affliction to instruct and discipline his people. This aspect of affliction is graphically portrayed by the oppression during the Israelites’ sojourn in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.31">Ex 4:31</a>), by their troubles during the period of the judges (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.26-27">Neh 9:26-27</a>), and by their exile in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.16">Is 26:16</a>). In Israel’s distress they cried out to God, who delivered them and led them into obedience (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.18">Jer 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.15-6.3">Hos 5:15–6:3</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible acknowledges that it is difficult to understand the many afflictions of the righteous (<a href="?bref=Ps.34.19">Pss 34:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.37.39">37:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.138.7">138:7</a>). Even the prophet and “Servant of the Lord” (Messiah) were not spared (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.2-12">Is 53:2-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.15">Jer 15:15</a>). Jesus Christ bore the griefs and sorrows of humanity as the culmination of the affliction begun by Adam’s sin (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.4-5">Is 53:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">1 Pt 2:24</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus indicated that there would be many trials and sorrows for his followers (<a href="?bref=John.16.33">Jn 16:33</a>). Paul taught that entrance to the kingdom of God comes with many tribulations (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.22">Acts 14:22</a>), which must not shake a Christian’s faith (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.3">1 Thes 3:3</a>). They are to be understood rather as a finishing up of the remainder of Christ’s suffering for his body, the church (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.10-11">2 Cor 4:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.24">Col 1:24</a>). The biblical picture indicates that affliction will grow more intense as “the end” approaches (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.9-14">Mt 24:9-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.13">2 Tm 3:13</a>). The forces of Satan will attack in an effort to deceive and destroy the “elect” (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.24">Mt 24:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.9-12">2 Thes 2:9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-9">Rv 20:7-9</a>). But when Jesus Christ is revealed from heaven in flaming fire, God will afflict those who have afflicted believers and will bring vengeance upon those who have not obeyed the gospel of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.9">Rom 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.5-10">2 Thes 1:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.7-8">2:7-8</a>).</p>

  <title>Suicide</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SUICIDE</p>
<p class="fl">The act of taking one’s own life voluntarily and intentionally. Though the word “suicide” does not appear in most Bible translations (see, however, <a href="?bref=John.8.22">Jn 8:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), the OT records suicides by Saul and his armor bearer (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.3-6">1 Sm 31:3-6</a>), Ahitophel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.23">2 Sm 17:23</a>), and Zimri (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.15-19">1 Kgs 16:15-19</a>). Judas Iscariot is the only suicide victim mentioned in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-5">Mt 27:3-5</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible does not directly condemn suicide but rather treats it as an indication of moral failure, often intensified by guilt or great personal loss. Saul had lost his sanity, his stability, and then his three sons on the battlefield. So he ended his life. Ahitophel, once a trusted counselor, was ruined by his ambition. When his plot against David was refused by Absalom, he felt disgraced. So he went home, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. Judas Iscariot also hung himself, but his suicide was far more tragic. He, one of the twelve disciples, betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Then he deeply regretted what he had done, and brought back the money to the Jewish leaders, saying “I have sinned in that I betrayed an innocent man” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-4">Mt 27:3-4</a>). As an expression of desperate remorse, Judas hanged himself.</p>

<p class="fl">Sumer was a region settled before 3500 <span class="era">BC</span> in the lower part of Mesopotamia, now called Iraq. The Sumerians had a highly civilized society, developing cuneiform (a type of writing), medicine, mathematics, and astronomy. Thousands of clay tablets discovered in this region reveal their cultural, religious, and political endeavors. The Sumerian culture was absorbed by Semitic invaders who moved into Mesopotamia and slowly took over. By 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> they had lost their political powers. Nevertheless, their culture formed the basis for the great Babylonian and Assyrian civilizations that developed there later.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">SUN</p>
<p class="fl">A luminary created by God to be one of the great lights in the heavens, “to rule over the day” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.14-15">Gn 1:14-15</a>). The new day begins with its setting, and the daily sacrifices were offered in accordance with its position: the first burnt offering with its rising (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.39">Ex 29:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.4">Nm 28:4</a>). The hours of the day in rabbinic Judaism vary with the length of the solar day throughout the year.</p>
<p>The months in the Israelite year were determined by the moon, but the fact that the major festivals fell in the fall (Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles) and the spring (Passover) show that account was taken of the solar year. The Gezer calendar has 12 months according to the agricultural activities of the solar year. The Jewish calendar is based on a 19-year cycle in which extra months are added to seven of the years, thus harmonizing the lunar and solar cycles. Silence in the Bible about this system has led scholars to assume the intercalation of a 13th month was a late innovation. However, Aramaic documents from the Jewish colony at Elephantine show that in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> the Jews there were using the 19-year cycle in their reckonings. It is probable that the monarchies of Judah and Israel were using a system of intercalation, even though documentary evidence is lacking.</p>
<p>Rabbinic Judaism recognizes four seasons, while the OT usually mentions only two, “seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter” (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.22">Gn 8:22</a>). The four seasons are marked by phases of the sun. The fall (called <span class="hebrew">setav</span><span class="ital">,</span> a word originally meaning rainy season, rain; <a href="?bref=Song.2.11">Sg 2:11</a>) begins with the fall equinox (September 21); the winter (<span class="hebrew">horeph</span>) begins with the winter solstice (c. December 22); the spring (<span class="hebrew">aviv</span>) begins with the spring equinox (March 21); and the summer (<span class="hebrew">qayits</span>) begins with the summer solstice (June 22). Recently, a temple was discovered at Beersheba, dating to the Hasmonean period (125 <span class="era">BC</span>), that was oriented toward the sunrise of the summer solstice. A temple at Lachish with a similar ground plan and date seems to be oriented toward the winter solstice. The Arad temple from monarchical times faced almost due east, probably toward the equinox sunrise; such was probably the case with the Jerusalem temple.</p>
<p>The sun also plays a role in Hebrew poetic imagery. It was said to have a habitation (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.11">Hb 3:11</a>), a tent set up by the Lord out of which he comes like a bridegroom (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.4-5">Ps 19:4-5</a>). The sun is a symbol of constancy (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.5,17">72:5, 17</a>), of the law (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.7">19:7</a>), of the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.84.11">84:11</a>), and of beauty (<a href="?bref=Song.6.10">Sg 6:10</a>). Life in this temporal world is that which is “under the sun,” according to Qoheleth (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.3,9,14">Eccl 1:3, 9, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.11">2:11</a>).</p>
<p>A time of chaos and wrath upon the earth will be marked by the darkening of the sun (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.10">Is 13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.7">Ez 32:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.10,31">Jl 2:10, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.15">3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.15">Zep 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.29">Mt 24:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.12">Rv 8:12</a>). This is obviously an allusion to an eclipse, something viewed with terror by the ancients. The sun’s turning pale may also be derived from the effect of the sirocco, when sandstorms and hazy clouds often darken the sky. On the other hand, the day of the Lord’s victory will be characterized by the sun’s shining sevenfold brighter than at present (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.26">Is 30:26</a>).</p>

  <title>Susa</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SUSA</p>
<p class="fl">Capital of the non-Semitic people and district of Elam. Susa (modern Shush) is located in southwest Iran, about 150 miles (241.4 kilometers) north of the Persian Gulf and due east of the well-known city of Babylon. French archaeologists began excavating the site in 1884, discovering that it was occupied as long ago as about 4000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Its importance in the OT derives mainly from the fact that it was incorporated into the Persian Empire, founded by Cyrus in 550 <span class="era">BC</span>. It became a royal city along with Ecbatana (the other main city in Elam), Babylon, and Persepolis. This was the great period of importance for Susa, although it had known an earlier golden age in the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span>. (The first copy of the law code of Hammurabi ever found was discovered at Susa, dated in the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span>.)</p>
<p>The center of Persian Susa was an acropolis or citadel that rose above the city as a rectangular platform surrounded by a massive wall. This was the royal quarter within which the palace stood. The palace was the winter residence of the Persian kings.</p>
<p>Nehemiah was a cupbearer at the palace of Susa in the reign of Artaxerxes I (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1,11">Neh 1:1, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">2:1</a>). In <a href="?bref=Esth.1.2">Esther 1:2</a> and <a href="?bref=Esth.2.8">2:8</a> the young Jewess Esther was introduced to the court of King Ahasuerus, who was evidently the Persian king Xerxes (485–465 <span class="era">BC</span>). Most of the action of the book takes place in Susa (cf. <a href="?bref=Esth.3.15">Est 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.8.14-15">8:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.9.6-18">9:6-18</a>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Dan.8.2">Daniel 8:2</a>, the place of Daniel’s vision is Susa. Probably Daniel is not to be regarded as having been there literally, but rather he was spiritually transported there in the vision. Chronologically, Daniel’s vision is set at the end of the Babylonian period, just before the Persian conquest (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.1">Dn 8:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1">7:1</a>). At this time Susa controlled the Medians and was not subject to Babylon.</p>

<p class="fl">Town in Samaria, mentioned in the Bible only in <a href="?bref=John.4.5">John 4:5</a>. The name has been taken as a variant form of the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew name Shechem. Many scholars favor an identification with the present-day village of Askar, which is located at the southeast foot of Mt Ebal, about one-half mile (.8 kilometer) north of Jacob’s well. Excavations appear to favor the Shechem identification, which was proposed by Jerome. The Babylonian Talmud refers to a place called Sichar or Suchar, but its location is not known.</p>
<p>Sychar is said to be near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph (<a href="?bref=John.4.5">Jn 4:5</a>). The record of the giving of this parcel of land is recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.48.22">Genesis 48:22</a>. When Jacob had concluded the blessing of Joseph’s two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, he told Joseph that he had given to him rather than to his brothers “one mountain slope which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow” (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.22">Gn 48:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Hebrew word translated “slope” is the word for shoulder and the name of the city of Shechem. It was on this piece of property that Joseph was buried (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>). This passage also states that Jacob bought the ground from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.33.19">Gn 33:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.16">Acts 7:16</a>).</p>

<p>The account of Jesus’ visit to Sychar in <a href="?bref=John.4.1-54">John 4</a> is important. Jesus came to Sychar because of a spiritual, not geographical, imperative (<a href="?bref=John.4.4">Jn 4:4</a>). One of the objectives of this mission was to break down barriers: the hostility between the racially pure Jew and the mixed-race Samaritan (v <a href="?bref=John.4.9">9</a>); the social restrictions between men and women (v <a href="?bref=John.4.27">27</a>); the societal separation between the ritually clean and the morally impure (this woman was ostracized; she came to the well alone and at an unusual time, v <a href="?bref=John.4.6">6</a>). The conversation between Jesus and the woman is instructive as to personal witness. The spiritual discernment and compassion of Jesus are evident. When the woman received the testimony of his identity as the Messiah, she too became an effective witness (vv <a href="?bref=John.4.28-30">28-30</a>). The new believers among the Samaritans asked Jesus to stay with them, so he remained for two days and many more believed in him (vv <a href="?bref=John.4.39-41">39-41</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Southern Egyptian village (modern Aswan) demarcating Egypt’s border with Ethiopia. The Hebrew form possibly derives from a word for “market” or “trading center,” reflecting the importance of the outpost as a place of commerce. The remote location of Syene made it a useful geographical reference for designating the full span of Egypt’s borders. “From Migdol to Syene” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.10">Ez 29:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.6">30:6</a>) describes Egypt from northern delta to southern border (cf.

Syene was located on the east bank of the Nile just north of the first cataract. While valued by the Egyptians as a source of granite, Syene’s fate was closely tied to Elephantine Island nearby. Elephantine was South Egypt’s administrative center and was well fortified against attack.

<p class="h1">SYNAGOGUE</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration of the Greek word <span class="greek">sunagoge</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “a gathering together.” It is used more than 50 times in the NT, mostly for the religious gathering places of Jewish communities in Palestine and throughout the Dispersion. The word <span class="greek">sunagoge</span> is usually the Greek rendering of Hebrew words in the OT that speak of the assembling or assembly of the people.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginsandEarlyHistory">Origins and Early History</p>
<p class="fl">It is unknown just how or when the synagogue as an institution first began. One can imagine the situation in Jerusalem after the destruction of the temple by the Babylonians in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The people who remained in and around the city who wanted to keep true to their faith would have felt the need to meet for worship, where they would continue to teach the law and the message of the prophets. Some think, therefore, that synagogues may have had their origin in such a situation. Jewish people in the various places of the Dispersion would have been aware of a similar need. Jewish elders met together with Ezekiel in exile in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">Ez 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.1">14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.1">20:1</a>). Yet there is no positive evidence of actual synagogues at this early stage. In <a href="?bref=Neh.8.1-8">Nehemiah 8:1-8</a> the postexilic community gathered in Jerusalem, and Ezra the scribe brought the law, read it from a wooden pulpit, and gave an interpretation so that the people understood the reading. When Ezra blessed the Lord, the people bowed their heads and worshiped. These were the basic elements of what came to be synagogue worship. The first undisputed evidence of a synagogue comes from Egypt in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>. From the first century <span class="era">BC</span> onward, the evidence of synagogues is abundant.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SynagoguesinNTTimes">Synagogues in NT Times</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospels give the impression of many synagogues existing throughout Palestine. Jesus frequently taught in synagogues (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.35">9:35</a>), especially during his Galilean ministry, but probably in Judea as well. In <a href="?bref=John.18.20">John 18:20</a> are the words of Jesus in his trial before the high priest: “I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles refers to synagogues in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>), Damascus (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.2">9:2</a>), Cyprus (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.5">13:5</a>), the Roman province of Galatia (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.14">13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.1">14:1</a>), Macedonia and Greece (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.1,10,17">17:1, 10, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">18:4</a>), and Ephesus in the Roman province of Asia (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.8">19:8</a>). Paul made it his practice to go directly to the synagogue and to preach there as long as he was given freedom to do so.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SynagogueWorship">Synagogue Worship</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles give abundant evidence for the meeting of Jewish people on the Sabbath to worship in the synagogue. People also met for worship on the second and fifth days of the week. Luke provides us with the earliest description of a synagogue service. The Mishnah describes the pattern of the synagogue service: the confession of faith, the Shema (which included reciting <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.13-21">11:13-21</a>; and <a href="?bref=Num.15.37-41">Numbers 15:37-41</a>); prayer (such as the 18 Benedictions); Scripture reading (the reading of the Law was basic, see <a href="?bref=Acts.15.21">Acts 15:21</a>, and was read according to a three-year cycle; the Prophets were also read, but more at random); interpretation (as the knowledge of biblical Hebrew diminished in Palestine, an Aramaic translation of the Scriptures was presented after the reading in Hebrew, and in the Dispersion, a Greek translation); address (following the reading, anyone suitably qualified might address the people, as Jesus and the apostle Paul often did); and blessing.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="RuinsOfAnAncientSynagogueInCapernaum"/>
<p class="h2" id="JudicialFunctions">Judicial Functions</p>
<p class="fl">Administration of justice was also part of the work of the synagogue. Offenders against the law and those whose actions were held to be contrary to Jewish religion were brought before the elders of the synagogue. They might, under extreme circumstances, excommunicate an offender (see <a href="?bref=John.9.22,34-35">Jn 9:22, 34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.42">12:42</a>) or have him scourged. Jesus warned his disciples to be prepared to face either possibility (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.17">Mt 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.2">Jn 16:2</a>). Saul, as persecutor of the Christians, had letters addressed to the synagogues at Damascus, giving authority to arrest Christians and bring them bound to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.2">Acts 9:2</a>). In <a href="?bref=Acts.22.19">Acts 22:19</a> he speaks of causing them to be both beaten and imprisoned. Paul himself received the 39 lashes that were administered in the synagogues (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.24">2 Cor 11:24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingoftheLaw">Teaching of the Law</p>
<p class="fl">The reading of the Law was of central significance in synagogue worship. The teaching of the Law to people generally, and especially to children, was intimately associated with the synagogue. Either the synagogue building or a school was used.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Organization">Organization</p>
<p class="fl">The NT refers in particular (e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.5.22">Mk 5:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.14">Lk 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.8">Acts 18:8</a>,17) to two appointments in the synagogue: the “ruler of the synagogue,” who was responsible for order and for selection of the Scripture reader; and an attendant (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.20">Lk 4:20</a>), who brought out and put away the Scripture scrolls and also administered corporal punishment to unruly students. Later on, there was a person appointed as leader of the prayers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Architecture">Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">In structure the synagogue was modeled after the temple. It was built, when possible, on high ground and often constructed so that the people could sit facing the direction of Jerusalem. There was a portable chest for the scrolls of the Law and the Prophets, and a platform for the reading of the Scriptures and for preaching. Men and women sat apart. The scribes loved the “chief seats” facing the people (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.39">Mk 12:39</a>). Many synagogues had ornamentations of vine leaves, seven-branched candlesticks, the paschal lamb, and the pot of manna. Early synagogues also had a genizah, which was a cellar or attic where worn scrolls were put, because, as they bore the name of God, they were too sacred to be destroyed.</p>

  <title>Synoptic Gospels*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">SYNOPTIC GOSPELS*</p>
<p class="fl">Term (literally meaning “same view”) applied to Matthew, Mark, and Luke because they see the ministry of Jesus from generally the same point of view, which is quite different from John’s Gospel.</p>
<p>The similarities among these three Gospels include their use of a common outline: introduction; ministry of John the Baptist and the baptism and temptation of Jesus; Jesus’ greater Galilean ministry; his journey and ministry through Samaria, Perea, and rural Judea; and the Passion week, death, and resurrection of Jesus in Jerusalem. The books also record the same emphasis in the teaching of Jesus—the presence, nature, and implementation of the kingdom of God. Furthermore, these three Gospels relate much of the same material, usually in the same order, and often with similar or identical words.</p>
<p>In addition to similarities, there are also striking differences among Matthew, Mark, and Luke. These fall into the same general categories as do the similarities—outline, material, organization, and wording. Matthew and Luke also have considerable common material not found in Mark, which, except for the healing of the centurion’s slave, is composed exclusively of the words and teachings of Jesus. Each Gospel also contains accounts and teachings that are unique. The result is a rich diversity within the synoptic unity, each of which provides portrayals of Jesus from a variety of viewpoints. Matthew emphasizes Jesus’ Jewishness and the continuity of his person and work with the message of the OT. Mark’s fast-moving account presents Jesus as a man of action, the Son of Man who was a servant among men. Luke, in exquisite Greek literary style, seems to address cultured Gentiles and shows Jesus as a friend of disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>Attempts to account for both the similarities and differences within these Gospels constitute the “synoptic problem.” Solutions have been sought in many ways. As early as the second century, Tatian combined the four accounts into one; additional “harmonies” of the Gospel accounts have been continually produced. Since the 17th century, scholars have attempted to account for the similarities and differences by examining the stages through which the Gospel material is assumed to have passed before coming into its present form. Form criticism attempts to identify the influences from the period of oral transmission; source or literary criticism considers the alleged written documents from which the Evangelists drew information; redaction (or editorial) criticism seeks to determine the nature or purposes and personalities of the final editor-authors upon the accounts of the activities and teachings of Jesus. Other suggestions have called attention to the adaptation of material for a specific audience, the similarities between the synoptic accounts of Jesus’ teachings and the parallel accounts of the Jewish rabbis in the Talmud, and more. No completely satisfactory solution to the synoptic problem is at hand. The fact remains that the Scriptures present Jesus in various perspectives; the conscientious reader must seek the divine purpose of both the similarities and the differences of these proclamations of “the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mk 1:1</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Gospel_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Gospel</a>; <a href="?item=LukeGospelof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Luke, Gospel of</a>; <a href="?item=MarkGospelof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Mark, Gospel of</a>; <a href="?item=MatthewGospelof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Matthew, Gospel of</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Terms used in the Septuagint and in some English translations to render the names Aram, Arameans.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoryoftheArameans">History of the Arameans</p>
<p class="fl">According to the “table of nations” in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.22-23">Genesis 10:22-23</a>, the Arameans were a Semitic group, descendants of Shem. Another genealogy in <a href="?bref=Gen.22.20-21">Genesis 22:20-21</a> makes Aram a descendant of Nahor. According to <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Amos 9:7</a>, the Arameans (Syrians) came from Kir, which is linked with Elam in <a href="?bref=Isa.22.6">Isaiah 22:6</a>. The exile of the Arameans to Kir (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.9">2 Kgs 16:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.5">Am 1:5</a>) may suggest they were to go back to their original home. The precise origins of this group of people are, however, lost in antiquity. When they emerged clearly into history, they were settled around the central Euphrates from which they were spread out east, west, and north.</p>
<p>The Arameans were traditionally thought to have been established in upper Mesopotamia in the first part of the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Bethuel and Laban were known as Arameans (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.20">Gn 25:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.1-7">28:1-7</a>); the home of Bethuel was in Paddan-aram (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.20">25:20</a>). The prophet Hosea recalls the tradition by noting that Jacob fled to “the field of Aram” (<a href="?bref=Hos.12.12">Hos 12:12</a>) or “Aram-naharaim” (Aram of the two rivers), which was the northern part of Mesopotamia between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. In the creedal confession in <a href="?bref=Deut.26.5">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>, the Israelite who brought his firstfruits confessed, “My father [probably Jacob] was a wandering Aramean.”</p>
<p>Probably the best early evidence of an Aramean presence in this area comes from Tiglath-pileser I. In his annals of his fourth year (1112 <span class="era">BC</span>), he speaks of a campaign among the “Akhlama, Arameans” in the Middle Euphrates area and the sacking of six Aramean villages in the Mt Bishri area.</p>
<p>The Arameans of upper Mesopotamia became important in biblical history. They set up a number of separate Aramean states, two of which were especially important for the people of Israel—Aram-zobah in the days of David, and Aram-damascus from the days of Solomon onward.</p>
<p>By about 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Aramean tribes had spread throughout Syria and had expanded into northern Transjordan, where they came into conflict with the Israelites. At his peak Hadadezer, king of Aram-zobah, embraced several vassals, such as Damascus, Maacah, and Tob. He was eventually defeated by King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3-4">2 Sm 8:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.17-19">10:17-19</a>).</p>
<p>Events in Israel and Judah had some bearing on Damascus. After the death of Solomon, when the formerly united kingdom became divided into Judah and Israel, tension arose between the two small states. War broke out between Baasha of Israel and Asa of Judah in the years 890–880 <span class="era">BC</span>. Asa sought aid from Ben-hadad I of Damascus (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.18">1 Kgs 15:18</a>). Lands in Transjordan changed hands several times. The successors of Omri of Israel—namely Ahab, Ahaziah, Jehoram, Jehu, Jehoahaz, and Jehoash—had many conflicts with Damascus. Ahab fought Ben-hadad and his 32 allies who besieged Samaria (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.1">20:1</a>), but Israel defeated him. A second time Ben-hadad entered Israelite territory and reached Aphek (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.26">20:26</a>), but he was again defeated and captured. As a consequence of his defeat and for the price of his release, he was obliged to make bazaars available in Damascus for Israelite trade. After three years of peace between Israel and Damascus, hostilities broke out again and resulted in a battle in the region of Ramoth-gilead in which Ahab was killed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.29-37">22:29-37</a>). Aram-damascus was eventually defeated by King Jehoash of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.25">2 Kgs 13:25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="SyriaaftertheCollapseoftheArameanKingdoms">Syria after the Collapse of the Aramean Kingdoms</p>
<p class="fl">After the collapse of Aram-damascus in 733–732 <span class="era">BC</span>, the political character of the whole region changed. Over the centuries that followed and on into Christian times, the region passed under the control of several great powers and no independent Aramean state survived. When Assyria collapsed in 612–609 <span class="era">BC</span>, the region came under Babylonian control, but only for a comparatively short period. With the rise of Cyrus the Persian, the Syrian region was quickly overrun by Persian armies. Palestine, Asia Minor, and Egypt were absorbed into the Persian Empire at the same time.</p>
<p>The next significant political change that affected the region came with the appearance of Philip of Macedon in 360 <span class="era">BC</span>. His son Alexander the Great (336–323 <span class="era">BC</span>) consolidated Greek power throughout western Asia and as far as the borders of India. On his death in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, at the age of 33, the control of western Asia passed to Alexander’s generals. General Seleucus I (312–280 <span class="era">BC</span>) controlled the southern half of Asia Minor, the region of Syria, Mesopotamia, and eastward to the borders of India. Syria thus fell under the influence of Hellenist rulers, the Seleucids, who founded a new capital at Antioch.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientSiteOfDuraEuroposInSyria"/>
<p>Further west, Rome was rising to power and cast her eyes eastward. It was General Pompey who overcame Mithridates, the young king of Pontus, and moved to crush the remnants of the kingdom of the Seleucids. The western parts of Syria were formed into a Roman province in 64 <span class="era">BC</span>. Pompey finally moved into Palestine, which came under Roman control in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The Roman province of Syria included Cilicia, a strip of territory in the southeastern corner of Asia Minor. The northern boundary reached to the Euphrates River. The boundary then swung south well to the east of Damascus and then turned west about halfway down the Dead Sea and continued west to the Mediterranean Sea. Syria was bound to the west by the Mediterranean up to the Gulf of Alexandretta, where it turned west. The province of Syria and Cilicia (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.23,41">Acts 15:23, 41</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.21">Gal 1:21</a>) was governed by an imperial legate (<span class="ital">legatis</span>) who commanded a strong force of legionary troops. One such governor, Quirinius, governed Syria at the time of the census of Caesar Augustus; this census brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem for the birth of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.2">Lk 2:2</a>).</p>
<p>In the following centuries the population of Damascus was Christianized, and Christianity spread throughout the Roman province of Syria, giving rise to the Old Syrian Church, which remains to this day. It has left a remarkable legacy of Christian literature written in Syriac (Aramaic). The old Aramaic language remained, though a modified alphabet was used to write it.</p>
<p>It was the rise of Islam in the seventh century <span class="era">AD</span> that brought about a considerable weakening of the Syrian church, although it has never been completely destroyed. Scattered communities of Aramaic-speaking people still survive in parts of Syria, and numerous remains of Christian churches have been brought to light as a result of modern archaeological work.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LanguageandCulture">Language and Culture</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic was the language of the Arameans, of which numerous inscriptions have been discovered. The Aramaic script was adapted for use by the Israelites, and the language became the international language for diplomacy and administration all over the Near East. It was the <span class="ital">lingua franca</span> of the Persian period from Egypt to India and was widely spoken in Palestine in Jesus’ day. The words “<span class="ital">talitha cumi</span>” (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.41">Mk 5:41</a>) and “<span class="ital">marana tha</span>” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.22">1 Cor 16:22</a>) are Aramaic.</p>
<p>Excavations in many sites have provided a good idea of the Aramean architecture, sculpture, pottery, and other arts. The religion of the Arameans was polytheistic. The people adopted many foreign deities as well. The principal Aramean deity was the ancient west Semitic storm god Hadad. In the days of Ahaz of Judah, the Damascus cult was forced on the people of Jerusalem when an altar based on a Damascus model was placed in the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10-13">2 Kgs 16:10-13</a>). Arameans exiled to Samaria by the Assyrian ruler Sargon brought foreign Aramean cults with them (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24-34">17:24-34</a>).</p>
<p>Through the centuries that followed the disappearance of the Aramean states, the Aramaic language has survived. The Christian form of Aramaic, Syriac, has left behind a vast legacy of literature, histories, theologies, commentaries, treatises, and translations, which have been carefully preserved in ancient monastic libraries, particularly in northern Syria, northern Iraq, and southern Turkey.</p>

<p class="fl">Homeland of the Greek woman who approached Jesus in the region of Tyre and Sidon and pleaded with him to cast a demon out of her daughter (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.26">Mk 7:26</a>). The region of Phoenicia was located in the Roman province of Syria. Perhaps the designation of Syrophoenicia was used so as not to confuse this woman’s country with the Phoenicia of North Africa called Libyphoenicia. In a parallel passage, this woman is identified as a Canaanite, a name by which Phoenicians called themselves (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.22">Mt 15:22</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">SYRTIS</p>
<p class="fl">Two bodies of water off the northern coast of Africa dreaded by ancient mariners. The larger was known as Syrtis Major and the smaller as Syrtis Minor. The former was the water to which Paul and his shipmates were dangerously drifting after leaving the island of Crete on their voyage to Rome. A furious northeasterly wind had crossed their course, threatening to push their ship southwestward across the Mediterranean into Syrtis Major (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.17">Acts 27:17</a>).</p>
<p>Syrtis Major, now called the Gulf of Sidra, indents the coast of Libya and stretches 275 miles (442.5 kilometers) from the town of Misratah to the city of Banghazi. Syrtis Minor, now known as the Gulf of Gabes, is an indenture into the eastern coast of Tunisia. These bodies of water were feared for their quick shifting sandbars that produced unpredictable shoals and hazardous tides and currents.</p>
