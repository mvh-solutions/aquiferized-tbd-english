<p class="fl">Area on the west side of the Sea of Galilee near the southern end of the plain of Gennesaret. Its exact location is uncertain. Jesus and his disciples stayed there briefly after the incident of the feeding of the 4,000 (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.10">Mk 8:10</a>). The Pharisees came to him seeking a sign from heaven in order to test him. After his answer that no sign would be given to this generation (v <a href="?bref=Mark.8.12">12</a>), he departed from there.</p>
<p>The word “Dalmanutha” is present in the best manuscripts, although other sources record Magadan or Magdala. The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Matt.15.39">Matthew 15:39</a> cites Magadan. Because of this, the exact name and location have been difficult to pinpoint. Probably the various names are meant to designate the same site or at least two places in the same area.</p>

<p class="h1">DALMATIA</p>
<p class="fl">Mountainous region on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea, across from Italy. The Dalmatians were an Illyrian (Greek) tribe, or group of tribes banded together, coming from the area around the town of Delmion (or Delminium). Their piracy gave the Romans considerable difficulty until Octavian thoroughly subjugated them in 33 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>At the time of Paul, Dalmatia was the name of the Roman province; its southern boundary was Macedonia, and its northern boundary is not clearly known. There is one reference to the province in the NT: Titus is mentioned as going there in <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Timothy 4:10</a>. We are not told why he went. It may be that Paul had organized some churches there, or Titus may have been opening up a new mission field.</p>

<p class="fl">Syrian oasis city protected on three sides by mountains and situated on trade routes about 160 miles (257 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem. The name Damascus can also refer to the surrounding area and to the southern Syrian state. Though close to the desert, the district is rich in almonds, apricots, cotton, flax, grains, hemp, olives, pistachios, pomegranates, tobacco, vineyards, and walnuts. These crops grow well because the land is watered by two rivers: the Nahr Barada, “the Cool” (biblical Abana), which runs from the northwest mountains through a deep ravine to the city; and the Nahr el-A waj, “the Crooked” (biblical Pharpar), which flows west to east. Together the two rivers irrigate 400 square miles (643.6 square kilometers) of land. Their beauty and importance in biblical times is conveyed by the haughty words of Naaman, a resident of the area, who almost refused to wash his leprosy away in the Jordan, as Elisha had prescribed, because it was such a poor river in comparison with the Abana and Pharpar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.1-27">2 Kgs 5</a>).</p>

<p>Of the several trade routes that converged in the area, one led to Tyre and down the Mediterranean coastline, another to Megiddo and eventually to Memphis and Egypt, and a third to the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
<p>The first biblical mention of Damascus (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.15">Gn 14:15</a>) refers to the city in connection with Abraham’s successful attack upon the confederation of kings who kidnapped Lot and his family. The Bible does not refer to the city again until the time of David (c. 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Israel occupied a strategic position along the trade routes between Mesopotamia and Egypt. Although in the time of Joshua and the judges Israel was in conflict with its immediate neighbors, the Amorites, Moabites, Philistines, Ammonites, and Midianites, there was relatively little opposition from Syria.</p>
<p>By the time of Saul, Zobah, an Aramean kingdom to the north of Damascus, was menacing the Israelites. Damascus was possibly in alliance with Zobah at this time, and the Israelites fought a defensive action (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sm 14:47</a>). David subsequently defeated Hadadezer of Zobah and gained control over southern Syria and Damascus, where he garrisoned his troops. David’s forces under Joab continued to be successful, and tribute was sent from Damascus to Israel. One of Hadadezer’s officers, Rezon, deserted and formed a guerilla band in the Damascus area. Subsequently, in Solomon’s reign he eroded even the Israelites’ economic control of the region and set himself up as king in Damascus around 940 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.23-25">1 Kgs 11:23-25</a>).</p>
<p>In the reign of Ben-hadad I, about 883–843 <span class="era">BC</span>, soldiers from Damascus besieged Samaria and sent reasonable terms to Ahab, which were accepted swiftly. Damascus was at the height of its power when Ben-hadad was campaigning successfully against the Assyrians. At this time, when Jehoram, Ahab’s son, was king of Israel, Naaman the leper, a Syrian captain, was healed by the prophet Elisha when he accepted humbly the prescribed cure.</p>
<p>The strategy of overcoming the kingdom by killing the king had been successful for Ben-hadad in his fight with Ahab, and he continued to follow the same policy. Shortly afterward, in a further effort to subdue Samaria, he sent assassination squads to murder either Jehoram or the prophet Elisha. The Lord preserved the lives of the pursued, and the Syrian attacked without success. Several years later, Elisha, who had gained the respect of the Syrians, entered Damascus boldly and announced that Ben-hadad’s illness was not fatal but that his death was imminent. Ben-hadad was thereafter murdered by Hazael, who then succeeded him. Although Damascus was soundly defeated by Assyria about 838 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hazael rebounded quickly, and by 830 <span class="era">BC</span> other predictions of Elisha were fulfilled. Damascene troops then controlled large areas of Palestinian territory, and the temple treasure was used to bribe the Syrians and save Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.17-18">2 Kgs 12:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>Planning to continue the subjection of Israel, Ben-hadad II found himself having to contend instead with resumed attacks from Assyria. In 803 <span class="era">BC</span> Damascus became a tributary of Assyria, but the northern forces were unable to hold the area. After a further campaign in which Assyria again proved dominant, a weakened Damascus was unable to quash an Israelite rebellion in 795 <span class="era">BC</span>. By the time of Jeroboam II, the Damascenes were forced to pay tribute to Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.28">2 Kgs 14:28</a>).</p>
<p>About 738 <span class="era">BC</span> the Syrians, led by their new leader Rezin, joined forces with Pekah, king of Israel, to subjugate Judah. Much land was captured, although their siege of Jerusalem was unsuccessful (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.5-6">2 Kgs 16:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.5">2 Chr 28:5</a>). At this time of seeming success for Damascus, the city’s doom was predicted by Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.4">Is 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.17.1">17:1</a>), Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-5">Am 1:3-5</a>), and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.23-27">Jer 49:23-27</a>). Rejecting God, Ahaz of Judah turned for protection to an alliance with the Assyrians, whom he bribed with the temple treasure. The Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III (“Pul”) agreed and marched against the Syro-Israelite confederation. After defeating Israel, he attacked Damascus, plundered the city, deported the population, and replaced them with foreigners from other captured lands. Damascus was no longer an independent city-state.</p>
<p>Due to its key location, Damascus remained important, and the Assyrians used the city as a provincial capital. Their records mention it in 727, 720, and 694 <span class="era">BC</span>, and also in the days of Ashurbanipal (669–663 <span class="era">BC</span>). Assyrian world dominance succumbed to that of Neo-Babylon, which was later replaced by that of Medo-Persia. During the period of Persian control, Damascus was a noted administrative center. Under the regime of Alexander the Great, the importance of Damascus was diminished by the rise in commercial significance of Antioch.</p>
<p>During intertestamental times, Damascus passed from one ruler to another. Following the death of Alexander, the city was controlled by the Ptolemies of Egypt and the Seleucids of Babylon. Somewhat before 100 <span class="era">BC</span>, Syria was divided, with Damascus becoming the capital of Coele-Syria. Its non-Syrian kings were constantly in trouble at home with the economy and abroad with the Parthians, Hasmoneans, and Nabateans, who under Aretas controlled Damascus from 84 to 72 <span class="era">BC</span>. Subsequently, authority passed to the Hasmoneans, descendants of the Maccabees, and then the Idumeans (the Herods). The area was subjected to Roman dominance after the defeat of Syria by the Romans in 65 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Shortly after the death of Christ, the Nabateans regained control of the area, ruling Damascus from Petra through an ethnarch. It was under the control of an Arab appointee, probably Aretas IV, when Saul of Tarsus sought Jewish authority to purge Damascus of its Christians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.32">2 Cor 11:32</a>). Luke’s report in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-43">Acts 9</a>, corroborated by Paul’s own confession (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.5-21">Acts 22:5-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.11-23">26:11-23</a>), relates Saul’s vision, blinding, and subsequent conversion on the road to Damascus. This may have been close to the place where Syrian soldiers were blinded when planning to assassinate Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.18-23">2 Kgs 6:18-23</a>). After Saul’s sight was restored in a house on the street called “Straight,” he preached Christianity. Apparently the uproar in the Jewish quarter concerning his preaching was so great that the ethnarch was willing to condone Saul’s murder by orthodox Jews. <a href="?bref=Acts.9.23-25">Acts 9:23-25</a> describes his escape to Jerusalem. Damascus is not mentioned thereafter in biblical history.</p>

<p class="h1">DAN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Fifth son of the Jewish patriarch Jacob. Dan’s mother was Bilhah, maid of Jacob’s wife Rachel (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-6">Gn 30:1-6</a>). Dan’s descendants settled in Israel overlooking the Huleh Plain, in territory actually assigned to Naphtali, Dan’s full brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.7-8">Gn 30:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.25">35:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.32-48">Jos 19:32-48</a>). The two brothers are mentioned together in a number of references (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.1.4">Ex 1:4</a>).</p>
<p>Dan’s name was given to him not by Bilhah but by Rachel, who considered the child her own. Rachel had long been childless—a shame to women in ancient cultures—and she was jealous of Jacob’s other wife, Leah, who had already borne him four sons. Rachel viewed the birth of Bilhah’s son as averting her shame and as God’s vindication of her status as wife. The name Dan (“he judged”) meant that God had judged her and had vindicated her through the child’s birth (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.6">Gn 30:6</a>).</p>
<p>Evidently Dan had only one son to continue his line, Hushim (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.23">Gn 46:23</a>; “Shuham,” <a href="?bref=Num.26.42-43">Nm 26:42-43</a>). In Jacob’s patriarchal blessing, Dan was promised the role of “judge” among his people but was also spoken of as one who would be stealthy and dangerous, like a serpent (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.16-17">Gn 49:16-17</a>). How that blessing worked out in the life of his descendants is unknown. The small amount of information given about Dan himself parallels the insignificance of his tribe in later times.</p>

<p class="list">1. Phoenician city, originally named Leshem (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.47">Jos 19:47</a>) or Laish (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.7">Jgs 18:7</a>), which was conquered by Dan’s tribe when it migrated northward. The city lay a day’s journey from Sidon in the valley near Beth-rehob (v <a href="?bref=Judg.18.28">28</a>) at the southern base of Mt Hermon. It was the most northerly point of the ancient Israelite kingdom, and was used as a topographical marker in the phrase “from Dan to Beersheba” (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.20.1">Jgs 20:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.10">2 Sm 3:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The site of Dan guarded a major trading route running between Damascus and Tyre, and was therefore an important commercial center. The Nahr el-Leddan, one of the principal sources of the Jordan, rose in the area, and this made the Huleh Valley below Dan lush and fertile even in the heat of summer. Consequently, the territory around the city produced grain and vegetable crops in abundance, as well as supplying the needs of flocks and herds adequately.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the early Iron Age, Dan was a prosperous city, as indicated in <a href="?bref=Judg.18.7">Judges 18:7</a>, but by the middle of the 11th century <span class="era">BC</span>, it had been destroyed, evidently as a result of occupation by the Danites. When Jeroboam I became king of the separate northern kingdom of Israel, Dan was one of two shrines where the golden calves were worshiped. The high place at Tell el-Qadi (Tell of Dan), a square masonry platform some 61 by 20 feet (18.6 by 6.1 meters), has been excavated, but no trace of the golden image has been found.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfTheTellOfDan"/>
<p class="list-text">The cultic worship of Baal at Dan survived even Jehu’s drastic purge (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.28-31">2 Kgs 10:28-31</a>), but during Ben-hadad’s reign, the city fell under Syrian control (cf. v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32">32</a>). When the Syrians were attempting to ward off Assyrian attacks on their eastern border during the time of Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>), Dan was reconquered by the northern kingdom. It did not remain in Israelite hands for long, however, for its inhabitants were deported to Assyria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.6">2 Kgs 17:6</a>) by Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>). Nevertheless, the site continued to be inhabited (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.4.15">Jer 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.16">8:16</a>), and its high place, or acropolis, at the northern extremity of the mound was used for worship. This particular area was enlarged periodically in both Greek and Roman times, and it is from the latter period that a statue of Aphrodite came. In NT times Dan was eclipsed by Caesarea, which was only a few miles distant. Josephus (<span class="ital">War</span> 4.1) recorded that Titus crushed a revolt at Dan in <span class="era">AD</span> 67.</p>

<p class="h1">DAN, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Israelite tribe named for the patriarch Jacob’s fifth son. The tribe of Dan, descended from Dan’s only known son, Hushim (cf. “Shuham” in <a href="?bref=Num.26.42-43">Nm 26:42-43</a>), had little distinction in its early years. Some Danites are mentioned in the wilderness narratives: Oholiab, a craftsman of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.6">Ex 31:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.34">35:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.23">38:23</a>); another whose mother married an Egyptian and who blasphemed God (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.11">Lv 24:11</a>); and Ahiezer, chief prince of Dan during the exodus (<a href="?bref=Num.1.12">Nm 1:12</a>).</p>
<p>Dan was the second largest tribe at the first census taken in the wilderness (62,700 warriors—<a href="?bref=Num.1.38-39">Nm 1:38-39</a>). They were instructed to encamp on the north side of the Israelites’ camp along with Asher and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Num.2.25-31">Nm 2:25-31</a>), and were to bring up the rear in the line of march (<a href="?bref=Num.2.31">Nm 2:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.25">10:25</a>). At the second census 40 years later, just before entering the Promised Land, they had grown only to 64,400 (<a href="?bref=Num.26.42-43">26:42-43</a>), still second in size. The tribe does not stand out in the Conquest narratives (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.16-3.29">Dt 2:16–3:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-24.33">Jos 1–24</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-36">Jgs 1</a>). Dan is listed among the tribes who reminded Israel of the covenant curses at Mt Ebal (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.13">Dt 27:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-33">Jos 8:30-33</a>). The tribe is called a “lion’s whelp” in Moses’ blessing (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.22">Dt 33:22</a>). Some believe that the reference to “Bashan” in that blessing prefigured the Danites’ migration to the northern territory where they eventually settled.</p>
<p>One of the most significant references to Dan’s tribe is the account of its northward migration (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.40-48">Jos 19:40-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">Jgs 18</a>). The Danites had been allotted a portion of Canaan between Judah and Ephraim bordering the Mediterranean seacoast (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.40-46">Jos 19:40-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.17">Jgs 5:17</a>), but were unable to occupy their territory except for the valley at Zorah and Eshtaol (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.25">Jgs 13:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.18.2">18:2</a>). As a result, a group of Danites, discouraged with their situation, marched north and captured Laish, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of the Sea of Galilee and just below Israel’s northernmost border. Laish was renamed Dan at that time (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.27-29">18:27-29</a>). Their association with that northern territory eventually gave rise to the expression “from Dan to Beersheba” (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.1">Jgs 20:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.10">2 Sm 3:10</a>) as designating Israel’s northern and southern borders.</p>
<p>Southern Dan continued for some time, as illustrated in the exploits of Samson of the tribe of Dan (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.1-16.31">Jgs 13–16</a>). Evidently the southern Danites gradually merged into the tribe of Judah, and no historical reference to the southern Danite tribe is made in the rest of the OT. The Danites were mentioned in King David’s time as mustering a considerable army loyal to David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.35">1 Chr 12:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.22">27:22</a>).</p>
<p>The Danites were among the tribes who did not drive the Canaanites from their territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.4-5">Jos 13:4-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.34-35">Jgs 1:34-35</a>). Joshua had to prod them into the task at the Shiloh assembly (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.1-4">Jos 18:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.40-48">19:40-48</a>). Eventually the Danites gave up the effort and sought other lands in the north, where conquest was easier. Their disobedience was further manifested in their open sin of setting up a “graven image” and establishing a rival priesthood, even though their priest was a Levite (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.30-31">Jgs 18:30-31</a>). The result of that idolatry was that, at the division of the Israelite kingdom at the end of King Solomon’s reign, King Jeroboam of the northern kingdom of Israel chose the city of Dan as one of the idol shrines in which to set up the golden calves (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.28-29">1 Kgs 12:28-29</a>). The Danites’ apostasy, and that of the other northern tribes, continued throughout their history (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.29">2 Kgs 10:29</a>), and because of it they were eventually carried captive to Assyria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-23">2 Kgs 17:1-23</a>).</p>
<p>The tribe name is mentioned in the prophet Ezekiel’s idealized description of the restored land and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezek.48.1-2,32">Ez 48:1-2, 32</a>). In the NT, the apostle John omitted the tribe from a list of Israel’s tribes (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.4-8">Rv 7:4-8</a>).</p>

<p class="list">1. David’s second son, the first by his wife Abigail (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1">1 Chr 3:1</a>); also called Kileab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.3">2 Sm 3:3</a>).</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="?item=Kileab_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Kileab</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. Priest, descendant of Ithamar. He signed Ezra’s covenant of faithfulness to God with Nehemiah and others after the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.2">Ezr 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.10.6">Neh 10:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Jewish statesman and seer in the Babylonian court whose career is recounted in the book of Daniel. Daniel’s early life is cloaked in silence. Nothing is known of his parents or family, though he was probably descended from Jewish nobility (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.3">Dn 1:3</a>). If born during the time of King Josiah’s reforms (c. 621 <span class="era">BC</span>), Daniel would have been about 16 when he and his three friends—Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah—were deported from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. They may have been hostages to assure the cooperation of the royal family in Judah.</p>
<p class="list-text">Daniel, renamed Belteshazzar (meaning “may Bel [god] protect his life”), was trained for court service. He quickly established a reputation for intelligence and for absolute fidelity to his God. After three years of instruction, he began a court career that lasted nearly 70 years (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.21">Dn 1:21</a>). Daniel had hardly finished his training when he was called on to interpret one of Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams, in which a great image collapsed and disintegrated when struck by a stone. God revealed its meaning to Daniel, who explained it to the king. In gratitude Nebuchadnezzar offered him the post of governor of Babylonia, but Daniel requested that the honor be conferred on his three companions in captivity.</p>
<p class="list-text">Near the end of Nebuchadnezzar’s life, Daniel was able to interpret a second dream (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.1-37">Dn 4</a>). That dream intimated the king’s impending insanity. Daniel urged the king to repent (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.27">4:27</a>), but he did not, and subsequently for a period of time he became deranged.</p>
<p class="list-text">After the death of Nebuchadnezzar in 562 <span class="era">BC</span>, Daniel dropped from public view and evidently occupied an inferior position in the royal court. Although he received visions (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-8.27">Dn 7–8</a>) in the first and third years of the Babylonian regent Belshazzar’s reign (555 and 553 <span class="era">BC</span>), it was not until 539 <span class="era">BC</span> that Daniel made another public appearance. During a banquet hosted by Belshazzar, the king profaned the sacred vessels pillaged from the Jerusalem temple. A disembodied hand suddenly appeared and wrote on the palace wall the mysterious words, “Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin.” Summoned to explain the message, Daniel interpreted it as a forecast of the imminent end of the Babylonian kingdom. That same night Belshazzar was killed by the Persians, who attacked and successfully overtook the capital city (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.30">5:30</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Under Darius the Mede, Daniel became one of three “presidents” (administrators) of the realm (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.2">6:2</a>). Daniel’s rank, along with his capable and distinguished management, infuriated his political enemies. They persuaded Darius to pass a decree forbidding petition to any god or man but the king, under penalty of being cast into a lions’ den. Daniel’s religious integrity forced him to violate the law. Thrown to the lions, he remained miraculously unscathed. Vindicated, he was restored to office (vv <a href="?bref=Dan.6.17-28">17-28</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The latter part of the book of Daniel describes several visions he received of future events. The visions dealt with four beasts (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">7</a>), future kingdoms (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.8.1-27">8</a>), the coming of the Messiah (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.9.1-27">9</a>), and Syria and Egypt (chs <a href="?bref=Dan.11.1-12.13">11–12</a>). The prophet Ezekiel alluded to Daniel’s great wisdom (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.3">Ez 28:3</a>) and ranked him in righteousness with Noah and Job (<a href="?bref=Ezek.14.14,20">14:14, 20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">DANIEL, Additions to</p>
<p class="fl">Part of the Deuterocanonical works, consists of three supplementary sections to the book of Daniel. This additional material is in the Greek translation of the OT book of Daniel, but not in the ancient Hebrew-Aramaic texts. One such addition is the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men inserted between <a href="?bref=Dan.3.23">Daniel 3:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Dan.3.24">3:24</a>. These 68 verses describe the actions and words of Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael in the fiery furnace. The second addition was the colorful story of Susanna, a maiden whom Daniel saved from execution, brought about by a false accusation of adultery. Susanna’s location in the text varies. The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate place it after <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1-13">Daniel 12</a>. Other ancient versions, such as the Old Latin, Coptic, and Arabic versions place it before chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-21">1</a> because of Daniel’s apparent youth. The third addition, Bel and the Dragon, tells how Daniel duped pagan priests and killed a dragon “without sword or club.” The Roman Catholic Church accepts this material as canonical.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PrayerofAzariahandtheSongoftheThreeYoungMen">Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men</p>
<p class="fl">Prayer for deliverance and hymn of praise attributed to three young Jews thrown into King Nebuchadnezzar’s fiery furnace. Along with Daniel, the three youths had been taken into the court of the Babylonian king during the exile of the kingdom of Judah (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-6">Dn 1:1-6</a>). Azariah was given the Babylonian name Abednego (v <a href="?bref=Dan.1.7">7</a>). He and his two friends were condemned to death for refusing to worship the king’s gold statue (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-23">3:1-23</a>) but were so miraculously preserved from burning that “they didn’t even smell of smoke” (vv <a href="?bref=Dan.3.24-27">24-27</a>). Acknowledging that the God whom they worshiped had saved them, the king commanded that none of his subjects should ever dishonor the God of the Jews (vv <a href="?bref=Dan.3.28-30">28-30</a>).</p>
<p>The Prayer and Song are among several “Additions to Daniel” found in early Greek and Latin versions but not in the original Hebrew and Aramaic texts. The additions seem to date from the intertestamental period of Jewish history, but the language of their composition is not certain. These two works, possibly composed in Hebrew, appear first in Greek in the Septuagint translation of the OT made in the second or third century <span class="era">BC</span>. They were inserted in a logical place in the biblical narrative, following <a href="?bref=Dan.3.23">Daniel 3:23</a>. Thus, the Septuagint version of Daniel contained 68 additional verses between <a href="?bref=Dan.3.23">3:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Dan.3.24">3:24</a>, the first 22 being the Prayer of Azariah.</p>
<p>In the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>, when Jerome translated the Bible into Latin, he realized that the Prayer, the Song, and several stories added onto the end of the book of Daniel (Susanna and the Elders; Bel and the Dragon) were not in the original texts, but he left them in place. Altogether, Jerome’s Vulgate Bible included 14 or 15 books or portions of books not recognized by Jewish scholars as part of their Scriptures. These writings are now known as the OT Apocrypha, and are usually omitted from Protestant Bibles. When Martin Luther translated the Bible into German in <span class="era">AD</span> 1534, he collected them in a separate section at the end of the OT with a note that the Apocrypha (plural form of a Greek word meaning “hidden”) were “useful and good to read” even if not “equal to the sacred Scriptures.”</p>
<p>Azariah’s prayer is certainly “useful and good” as a model prayer, being very similar to Daniel’s prayer (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.3-19">Dn 9:3-19</a>) and to several of the biblical psalms (compare Pss 31 and 51). It contains confession and repentance as well as a plea for deliverance. Azariah admits that God’s people deserve his righteous judgment “because of our sins,” but he pleads with God to remember his promise to bless the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He offers as sacrifice “a contrite heart and a humble spirit,” dedicating himself and his companions to God.</p>
<p>After Azariah’s prayer comes an account of how “the angel of the Lord” came down and “made the midst of the furnace like a moist whistling wind,” causing the three rescued youths to praise God “as with one mouth.” Their song, like <a href="?bref=Ps.148.1-14">Psalm 148</a>, calls upon all of creation to “bless the Lord.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="SusannaandtheElders">Susanna and the Elders</p>
<p class="fl">In the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, it follows the canonical conclusion of Daniel. It was probably written by a Jew who lived in Palestine in the middle of the first century before Christ. The setting of the story, however, is in Babylon.</p>
<p>Susanna, daughter of Hilkiah, was a very beautiful woman married to Joakim, a rich man of distinction. Joakim’s distinction increased in the community when he opened up his beautiful garden to the Jewish community in exile. It was a proper meeting place for the elders and judges. Trouble arose when two elders recently elected as judges were filled with lust for Susanna. Their office as judge brought them back to Joakim’s garden whenever the court was in session. At opportune times the two judges, who knew nothing of each other’s desires, feasted their eyes on her beauty. One day they found themselves in a situation wherein they were forced to admit their passions to each other. The impropriety of their thoughts resulted in a plot to seduce Susanna quietly.</p>
<p>Susanna, who was used to bathing herself in the garden pool to cool herself off in the heat of the day, came to the pool with her two maids for the purpose of bathing. The three ladies were unaware of the presence of the two judges, who had hidden themselves. When the two maids left to bring Susanna soap and olive oil, the judges took the occasion to present themselves to Susanna. They admitted to her their sexual desire for her and requested her permission to have relations with her. Their legal minds had devised a trap so that, if Susanna were to refuse them, a case would be presented in court according to which they would claim to have witnessed Susanna’s adulterous relation with a young man. Susanna, believing that adultery was a grievous sin against the Lord punishable by death, refused the judges, shouted for help, and hoped to be sustained by the members of her household. During the resulting tumult, the judges falsely accused Susanna to her servants.</p>
<p>The piety of Susanna was tested in a court that favored the case of the judges. Since they were men of social standing in the community and they were united in their witness against Susanna, she had no chance for a fair trial. The court judged her guilty of adultery and condemned her to death. Her execution was delayed by the counsel of a young man named Daniel. He requested that the trial be reopened on the ground that the witnesses had not been cross-examined. In a separate cross-examination, it was discovered that their testimony did not corroborate. The one had seen Susanna with her young man under a clove tree and the other had seen them together under an oak tree. At the contradiction of the testimony, the assembly admitted the false evidence of the judges and the innocence of Susanna. Instead of Susanna, the two judges were put to death on the ground of having given false witness.</p>
<p>The purpose of the story is threefold. It celebrates the piety and virtue of Susanna and the corruption of the judges, who “no longer prayed to God, but let their thoughts stray from him and forgot” the claims of morality. Second, it challenges the traditional legal method by which two witnesses could falsely accuse a man and their testimony was accepted as true. Naboth, Jesus, and others had been accused by false witnesses and found guilty without any cross-examination. Third, the story introduces the reader to Daniel, who is here pictured as a young, wise man whose wisdom challenges that of the elders.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BelandtheDragon">Bel and the Dragon</p>
<p class="fl">The book has always been regarded as apocryphal by the Protestant churches but was confirmed as canonical by the Roman Catholic Church at the Council of Trent (1545–63).</p>
<p>The book contains two tales of Daniel, that is, the story of Bel and the story of the Dragon. The setting is in Babylon during the reign of Cyrus. Daniel was highly honored and was living as companion to the king but continued to worship God and to pray. Among the gods worshiped by Cyrus and the Babylonians, one of the greatest was Bel, or Marduk (OT Merodach).</p>
<p>One day the king ordered Daniel to worship Bel because he was a powerful god, a fact supposedly proven by his voracious appetite. The king explained that Bel consumed 12 bushels (432 liters) of flour, 40 sheep, and 50 gallons (189 liters) of wine left for him daily in the temple. To the local people, Bel was obviously a mighty god. Daniel pointed out to the king that an idol made of clay and bronze could not possibly be consuming the food, and Daniel offered to prove it. In anger the king sent for the priests and demanded to know what happened to the food. They assured him that it was indeed eaten by the god.</p>
<p>The next day the food was taken to the temple and placed on the table as usual. Unknown to the priests, Daniel had his servants sprinkle the floor with fine ashes. The temple was then sealed with the signet rings of the king and several of the priests. The next morning the seal was found intact and the group entered the temple. Seeing the table empty, the king rejoiced in the power of Bel. Daniel, however, pointed to many footprints clearly visible in the ashes, revealing to the king the trickery of the priests. They confessed that they had been entering by a secret door and removing the food. Cyrus ordered the 70 priests and their families killed and permitted Daniel to destroy the pagan temple.</p>
<p>The second tale recounts events surrounding the worship of a dragon (possibly a serpent). The Babylonians venerated a dragon that, as the king pointed out to Daniel, was very much alive. Here there was no possibility of trickery, since all had seen the dragon eat and drink. But Daniel again refused the king’s request to worship an idol. Further, Daniel asked permission to kill the dragon without using either sword or staff, a seemingly impossible task. Receiving the king’s permission to try, Daniel made a concoction of pitch, fat, and hair; boiled it together; formed it into cakes; and fed it to the dragon. After eating the cakes, the dragon burst apart and died immediately. At the death of their dragon-god the king had to face the anger of the Babylonians, who were convinced that he had been converted to Judaism. To turn away their wrath, the king reluctantly delivered Daniel to them to be put to death.</p>
<p>Two persons, usually condemned criminals, were thrown into a den of seven lions every day. This time the lions were not fed, but Daniel was thrown in alive. After six days, however, Daniel was still alive, although both he and the lions were extremely hungry. In a section of the text probably added later, the Lord sent an angel to the prophet Habakkuk, ordering him to take to Daniel a meal he had prepared for his reapers. Habakkuk began to make excuses that he had never been to Babylon and didn’t know where the lions’ den was. The angel then took him by the hair and deposited him in the lions’ den, where Habakkuk told Daniel that the Lord had remembered him. After giving Daniel the food, Habakkuk was returned safely to his own home.</p>
<p>The next day the king arrived on the scene to bewail the death of Daniel, only to find to his amazement that his friend was still alive. Daniel was released from the den and his accusers were thrown in and devoured immediately by the ravenous lions.</p>
<p>Bel and the Dragon exists in two principal Greek and two Syriac texts, almost certainly derived from a lost Hebrew original. The author, place, and date of the original are unknown. It is possible that the story of Bel could have been written as early as the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, with the dragon story composed later, possibly by a different author. The most satisfactory date, judging by the content and purpose of the work, would be 150– 100 <span class="era">BC</span>, a time of great religious and political difficulty for the Jews.</p>
<p>Bel and the Dragon was written to convey the futility of idol worship and to impress on the Jews the need to continue firm in their faith in times of persecution and hardship. Babylonian gods were ridiculed in both tales. The book may also have been a warning not to trust the friendship of the heathen, who in time of trouble might find it expedient to sacrifice the life of a friend. Despite the fact that Daniel was described as the king’s companion, under pressure the king was prepared to hand Daniel over to a mob.</p>
<p>In the contest with Bel (Marduk), Daniel confronted a god who had been the patron of Babylon since 2275 <span class="era">BC</span>. Frequent references to him were made in cuneiform inscriptions. For example, Nebuchadnezzar II had commanded the temple of Bel to be restored to a position of supremacy as one of the finest and most majestic ziggurats (pyramidal towers). The apocryphal writer would have been aware of the destruction of that famous landmark by the Persian king Xerxes I (ruled 486–464 <span class="era">BC</span>), who carried off the seated golden image from the shrine. The temple was described as being in ruins at the time Alexander the Great entered Babylon in 332 <span class="era">BC</span>. The dragon in the second tale had long been venerated in Near Eastern religion and was well known in legends of ancient Sumeria.</p>

<p class="h1">DANIEL, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Fourth book of the Major Prophets in the OT, characterized by vivid symbolism and reflecting heroic historical events during the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people. Because Daniel is not an easy book to understand, its interpretation requires careful study and reflection. Daniel himself wrote, when reflecting on the meaning of one of his visions, “I was greatly troubled by the vision and could not understand it” (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.27">Dn 8:27</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>In the old Jewish division of the OT, Daniel is part of the third section, called the Writings, along with such books as Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. It was not included in the second section of the OT, called the Prophets. Although portions of his book may be interpreted from a prophetic perspective, Daniel is never explicitly identified as a prophet. The book’s two major divisions are narratives about Daniel’s life (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-6.28">1–6</a>) and Daniel’s visions (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">7–12</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">In terms of having a known author, the book of Daniel is anonymous, as are many books coming from the ancient world. The existing text bears only a title, “Daniel,” identifying the key subject matter of the book: the man himself.</p>
<p>The first six chapters of the book contain information about Daniel written in the third person; beginning in <a href="?bref=Dan.7.2">Daniel 7:2</a>, however, the book purports to contain words written by Daniel in the first person. Although the traditional view within Judaism, later adopted by Christianity, was that Daniel wrote the entire book named for him, there is little confirming evidence. Jesus’ words about things “spoken of by the prophet Daniel” (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.15">Mt 24:15</a>) do not clarify who wrote the whole book, since the words in question appear in the second half of the book of Daniel, explicitly identified as his words. Thus the problem of who wrote the first part remains.</p>
<p>Whether or not Daniel wrote the entire book, he is definitely the key character. The only source of information about him is the book itself. Daniel was a Hebrew from Judah, probably of royal lineage, born late in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. As a young boy, he was taken from his homeland to Babylon (in what is now southern Iraq) around 605 <span class="era">BC</span>. There, after three years of formal education in language and literature (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.4-5">Dn 1:4-5</a>), he became an official in the royal household. The first six chapters tell of particular incidents in Daniel’s life but do not provide a comprehensive biography of his life and times.</p>
<p>Daniel’s name means “God is my judge.” As a foreign resident in Babylon, he was given another name, Belteshazzar, which may have meant “may Bel (god) protect his life” in the Babylonian language.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Uncertainty about the authorship of the book of Daniel naturally contributes to uncertainty about the date of its writing. If Daniel was the author of the whole book, a date in the second half of the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> is likely. If he was not the author, a later date is possible. The conservative interpretation has usually been that the book was written in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>. An alternative position is that the book was written about 165 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Evidence exists to support both the early and late dates of Daniel. Those who argue for a late date and an author besides Daniel normally use two lines of argument, one historical and the other linguistic. But those espousing an earlier date have counterarguments, all of which are discussed below.</p>
<p class="h3">Historical Argument</p>
<p class="fl">According to the historical argument, the writer was thoroughly familiar with the history of Near Eastern imperial power from the sixth to the second centuries, but had an incomplete, erroneous view of the historical details in the second half of the sixth century, Daniel’s era. Such an imbalance in knowledge implies a late date of writing.</p>
<p>The first part of the historical argument must be conceded by those holding a more conservative view. The book of Daniel does present a remarkable knowledge of Near Eastern history. The critical question is whether that knowledge was normal human knowledge, gained after the events, or special knowledge revealed to Daniel beforehand. That question is answered in different ways by different people, depending on their view of prophecy and other factors.</p>
<p>The second part of the historical argument is technically more complex. Was the writer’s knowledge of history in the late sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> really erroneous? The most significant problem is that of the identity of Darius the Mede (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.30-31">Dn 5:30-31</a>). The book of Daniel says that Darius the Mede conquered Babylon and was succeeded at a later date by Cyrus. External historical sources contain no reference to a Darius at the time, but show clearly that it was Cyrus who conquered Babylon. Advocates of a late date consider that strong evidence. Those who advocate an early date have no simple solution to the problem. One proposed solution is that Darius and Cyrus are two names for the same person. A basis for that hypothesis is that <a href="?bref=Dan.6.28">Daniel 6:28</a> can be translated: “Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, even [that is] the reign of Cyrus the Persian.” An analogy appears in the use of the names Pul and Tiglath-pileser in <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.26">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>. In summary, the dating of Daniel on the basis of the writer’s historical knowledge is difficult, whether one suggests an early or late date.</p>
<p class="h3">Linguistic Argument</p>
<p class="fl">The linguistic arguments for the date of Daniel are also complex, especially for a person not familiar with the original languages of the book (Hebrew and Aramaic). Advocates of a late date use three related arguments: (1) the Aramaic language of the book is typical of late Aramaic (second century <span class="era">BC</span> and later); (2) the presence of Persian loan words is a further indication of the late date of the book’s Aramaic; and (3) the presence of Greek loan words in the Aramaic shows that the language must be dated after the time of Alexander the Great’s conquest of the Orient (c. 330 <span class="era">BC</span>). For the advocates of a late date for the book’s composition, the last argument is most compelling. It would be impossible, they affirm, to find Greek loan words in Aramaic two centuries before Alexander’s time.</p>
<p>Although the arguments are at first convincing, on closer examination they are less persuasive to those who hold the conservative view. Each of the three parts of the argument has been answered.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Aramaic was in common use in the Near East from about the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>, being recognized as an official language in Assyria from the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Ninety percent of the Aramaic words in Daniel were used in that older language, in both the Old and Imperial Aramaic dialects. The remaining 10 percent, known only in later texts in the light of present evidence, might indicate a late date, but they could equally be early uses of the words in question.</p>
<p class="list">2. The evidence of Persian loan words in Aramaic can function like a boomerang. It is true that later Aramaic has many Persian loan words (about 19 appear in Daniel), but one can give an alternative explanation for Persian loan words in Daniel at an early date. The story of Daniel is set, in part, in the context of life in a Persian-controlled court. The Persians used Aramaic in their administrative control of the empire, and their own language inevitably penetrated Aramaic. If one assumes an early date for the book of Daniel, then it was being written in precisely the period when Persian would be having its greatest influence on Aramaic.</p>
<p class="list">3. The evidence of Greek words in Daniel’s Aramaic (a total of three) is not altogether compelling. Greek (or “Ionian”) traders traveled in various parts of the Near East from the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> onward. Greek mercenaries fought for Near Eastern states in and after the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. In Daniel’s lifetime King Nebuchadnezzar is known to have employed Greek artisans in the city of Babylon. Thus, it is unnecessary to limit the possibilities of Greek penetration of the Aramaic language to the period after Alexander. The conqueror was by no means the first Greek to set foot in the Orient.</p>
<p class="h3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">The historical and linguistic arguments for the date of Daniel are inconclusive for either an early or late date of writing. To a large extent, dating the book depends on other matters, such as authorship, intention, and the extent to which one takes a “prophetic” interpretation of portions of the book. To postulate that Daniel was the author is consistent with the evidence currently available. Further, evidence provided by some of the Daniel material from the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran does not support a late date for the book. All Daniel manuscripts and fragments are second-century <span class="era">BC</span> copies, thus requiring an earlier date for the original. One manuscript, related paleographically to the large Isaiah Scroll, must have come originally from the same period—estimated to be several centuries before the Qumran copy of Isaiah. Other manuscripts from Qumran show that no OT canonical material was composed later than the Persian period. Thus, no manuscript evidence exists for a second-century <span class="era">BC</span> date for Daniel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Language">Language</p>
<p class="fl">One of the most interesting features of the book of Daniel is not immediately evident to a reader of the English Bible. The book is bilingual. <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-2.4">Daniel 1:1–2:4a</a> and <a href="?bref=Dan.8.1-12.13">Daniel 8–12</a> are written in Hebrew, the language of the other OT books. The middle section (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.4b-7.28">Dn 2:4b–7:28</a>), however, is written in Aramaic, a different but related language. Various explanations have been offered for this phenomenon. Some have suggested that an original Aramaic book was expanded by a Hebrew writer, with additions to the original book at the beginning and the end. Others suggest that a portion of the original Hebrew book was lost, so the missing section was replaced from a surviving Aramaic translation. More complex and ingenious suggestions have also been made, but none has been commonly accepted.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is possible. The book of Daniel (whatever date one prefers) may simply reflect the bilingual character of its cultural setting. (As a modern example, consider the many written materials in Canada that appear in both English and French.) Finally, one can regard the bilingual character as another of the mysterious aspects of the book that make its interpretation difficult.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The background of the book of Daniel can be examined from two perspectives. It may be viewed from the perspective of the Babylonian exile, of which Daniel was a part (early sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>), or in the light of future historical events (second century <span class="era">BC</span>), toward which the visions in the book’s second half seem to point.</p>
<p class="h3">The Babylonian Exile</p>
<p class="fl">Although Daniel himself was exiled about 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, the major phase of the Babylonian exile began in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, following the defeat of the kingdom of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem. The account extends through the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar (properly Nebuchadrezzar) and Belshazzar, culminating in the early years of the Persian king Cyrus, who took over the city of Babylon in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>. For the Jews the exile was a time of hardship but also a time of renewed theological understanding. Both aspects are reflected in the book of Daniel.</p>
<p class="h3">The Seleucid Period in Palestine</p>
<p class="fl">Daniel’s visions in the latter half of the book appear to refer to the Seleucid period in Palestine, specifically the time when the Jews were ruled by Antiochus Epiphanes, a member of the Seleucid dynasty (175–163 <span class="era">BC</span>). Whether the visions were prophetic anticipations of future events or reflections of contemporary culture, the Seleucid period is important to a full understanding of the book.</p>
<p>Under Antiochus, Palestinian Jews experienced a time of considerable hardship. The ancient faith was severely undermined, the high priesthood in Jerusalem was sold to the highest bidder, and the temple was desecrated in several ways. Pressure was exerted on the Jews to adapt their lives and faith to Hellenistic (Greek-influenced) culture. Although some capitulated, others refused and steadfastly held firm to the old faith. A rebellion against the oppressive measures of Antiochus began in 168 <span class="era">BC</span>. By 164 the rebels had largely succeeded in getting rid of the objectionable practices. But the Seleucid period was generally a bad time for faithful Jews, when all the forces of history seemed to work against the true faith. Part of the book of Daniel’s greatness lies in its theological understanding of history, which enabled men and women to continue living in faith through a time of terrible crisis.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The scriptural section of the OT called the Writings served a variety of purposes. The psalms, for example, were used primarily in Israel’s worship. The proverbs may have been part of Israel’s school curriculum. The book of Job addressed a specific human and theological problem.</p>
<p>The purpose of the book of Daniel is not so easy to determine, since it is essentially a story, a partial biography of Daniel. It is not strictly a prophetic book, nor is it history in the modern sense. Much of it is concerned with dreams and their interpretations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the word “history” provides a clue to its purpose. Daniel seeks to provide theological understanding of history. The first six chapters tell about Daniel and his companions, not merely to satisfy historical curiosity but to teach the reader. OT theology insisted that the God of Israel participated in human life and history. To read biblical history, therefore, is to discover God’s participation in human affairs and to learn how God and human beings relate to each other. In the opening chapters of Daniel one reads of events in the life of a man of remarkable faith, the kind of history from which one may learn how to live.</p>
<p>The last six chapters focus on Daniel’s dreams. Although neither the dreams nor the interpretations are easy to understand, it is possible to see the theme of history emerging again. The emphasis in chapters <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">7–12</a> is not on history as a record of past events but on the meaning of history and the world’s future. In the biblical perspective, the movements of human societies in the present and future matter as much as past history. Though Daniel’s visions are dominated by nations and superpowers, they have a more basic theme: God’s power over human beings and nations. History often appears to be a conglomeration of chaos and human conflict. Yet God ultimately controls history and moves it toward a goal. In spite of ambiguous details at the end of the book, Daniel provides hope for people living in a time of crisis. Even if what is said about the “time of the end” cannot be understood now (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.9">Dn 12:9</a>), the end of history is full of hope for those with faith in God (v <a href="?bref=Dan.12.13">13</a>). The purpose of the book of Daniel thus has to do with the meaning of history, both what can be learned from the past and what can be hoped for in the present and future.</p>
<p>The book also contains specific theological statements on such matters as human faith, divine salvation, and the nature of revelation. One theological matter in Daniel deserves particular attention: the doctrine of resurrection.</p>
<p>The NT’s clear doctrine of resurrection followed by judgment is not a central theme in the OT. For the most part, the Hebrews’ faith was fixed on the realities of earthly life. Hope for life beyond the grave is hinted at in many texts but remains implicit. Only in the later writings of the OT, especially those of Ezekiel and Daniel, does a more explicit doctrine of resurrection develop.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheKingdomWillCome"/>
<p>The focal point of that doctrine in the book of Daniel is <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">12:2</a>: “Many of those whose bodies lie dead and buried will rise up, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The doctrine of personal resurrection provides a basis for individual hope within an understanding of present and future history. Nations move against nations in apparent turmoil. God is believed to be in ultimate control, but what becomes of all the people who die while history is still in motion? The dead shall rise again, says Daniel, and in their resurrection bodies shall be judged according to their deeds. Some will be rewarded with everlasting life, but others will be condemned to shame.</p>
<p>To the readers of the book of Daniel, the doctrine of resurrection provided hope in an otherwise bleak and hopeless world. It was a reminder that the actions of earthly life are important—they form the basis of future judgment. The world has a larger horizon of life beyond the body’s death. Ultimately, there will be justice, even though justice is rarely seen in the present existence. Evildoers may live without ever being punished. Yet beyond the death of the body lies a final judgment characterized by God’s justice.</p>
<p>So the book of Daniel is about history and hope. Life must be lived now; for that, the book offers in the first six chapters the insight of Daniel’s experience. Life is lived in the context of war and international chaos; for that, chapters <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">7–12</a> depict God’s sovereignty and his purposes in history. Individual life moves toward death; for that, the writer speaks of resurrection and judgment.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ContentStoriesaboutDaniel16">Content: Stories about Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-6.28">1–6</a>)</p>
<p class="h3">Daniel and His Companions (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-21">1:1-21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Daniel and his companions—Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah—were exiled to Babylon some 19 years before the main exile following the destruction of Jerusalem. The four healthy young men, selected from among many Jewish exiles, were at the command of King Nebuchadnezzar assigned to a special three-year training program to make them court aides.</p>
<p>As soon as the four Jewish youths entered Babylon’s high society, they faced a dietary problem. The king provided them with the best food and wine from the royal kitchens, but a Jew’s diet was restricted by the laws of God (see <a href="?bref=Deut.14.1-29">Dt 14</a>). The four asked for a diet of vegetables and water, not to be fussy or ungrateful, but to remain faithful to their God. The story tells how the dietary situation worked out and sees them through their education and Daniel’s appointment as a royal counselor.</p>
<p>The first episode thus focuses on a key issue faced by all Jewish exiles: How could one live in a foreign land, with foreign food and customs, yet remain faithful to God and his laws? Daniel provided a model. He was courageous enough not to compromise, but wise enough to seek a solution acceptable to all. His faithfulness was rewarded by God. By the end of the episode, Daniel is seen as a person with special wisdom and gifts from God. The rest of his life was marked by the exercise of those gifts.</p>
<p class="h3">Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">2:1-49</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The king had a dream and, although he could not remember its substance, it weighed heavily on his mind. When his corps of professional interpreters could do nothing for him, he ordered that they be executed. The king’s order included Daniel and his companions, whose training qualified them as interpreters. Daniel obtained a stay of execution by offering to interpret the dream. After prayer, Daniel received from God both the substance of the dream and its interpretation, which he relayed to the king. The grateful Nebuchadnezzar promoted Daniel and his companions to important positions in Babylon.</p>
<p>Although the writer recorded both the king’s dream and Daniel’s interpretation, the problem for a modern reader is how to interpret the interpretation. The king saw in his dream a statue, with head of gold, chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet of part iron and part clay. The interpretation identified Nebuchadnezzar as the head of gold. His kingdom would be followed by three other kingdoms, each represented by the statue’s parts and substances. At that point modern interpretations begin to diverge.</p>
<p>A common interpretation of the four sequential kingdoms is as follows: Chaldean Empire (gold), MedoPersian Empire (silver), Greece (brass), Rome (iron and clay). Others suggest an alternative interpretation: Chaldean Empire (gold), Media (silver), Persia (brass), Greece (iron and clay). To focus too much attention on identifying the four kingdoms can result in failure to see the chapter’s key feature. From the midst of those human kingdoms, “During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed; no one will ever conquer it. It will shatter all these kingdoms into nothingness, but it will stand forever” (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.44">2:44</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The Babylonian king’s dream anticipated the coming of a greater kingdom, that of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">The Fiery Furnace (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">3:1-30</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The story continues, focusing on Daniel’s three friends and using their Babylonian names—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. King Nebuchadnezzar constructed a massive gold statue, 90 feet (27.4 meters) high. At its dedication ceremony everyone was required to bow down and worship as a band began to play. The three young Hebrews, who refused to worship, were summoned before the king. Their continued firm refusal led to a sentence of execution, and they were thrown into a fiercely burning furnace. Remarkably, they did not burn, and a fourth being appeared with them in the furnace. As they emerged unharmed from the ordeal, the king acknowledged God’s power of salvation and rewarded them.</p>
<p>The story illustrates a second dilemma of the Jews in exile. Faithfulness to God’s first commandment, “You shall have no other gods before me” (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.7">Dt 5:7</a>), could lead to death. The three young men were faithful—not out of confidence that God would rescue them, but whether or not he chose to spare their lives (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.17-18">Dn 3:17-18</a>). As it happened, God delivered them; they were tossed into the furnace bound, but they came out free men. The message was profound: certainly the Jews should believe in a God able to deliver from the flames of persecution, but they should believe and hold fast even if no deliverance could be seen beyond the trial.</p>
<p class="h3">Nebuchadnezzar’s Second Dream and Madness (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.1-37">4:1-37</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">On two occasions Nebuchadnezzar had confessed faith in the living God: when Daniel had interpreted his dream of the statue (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.47">2:47</a>), and on the release of Daniel’s three companions from the furnace (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.28">3:28</a>). Nonetheless, the king’s faith was shallow. The story in chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.4.1-37">4</a> recounts a lapse of faith that brought terrible consequences. After eight years, when those consequences had run their course, the king again acknowledged God (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.37">4:37</a>).</p>
<p>The entire story is presented in the form of a proclamation, written by Nebuchadnezzar and widely circulated after the events in the story had transpired. The king dreamed of a tall tree growing in a field to ever greater heights. A divine messenger ordered the tree cut down, with only a stump and roots left in the ground. The stump and roots then took the form of a man, but the man’s mind was replaced with that of an animal. For seven years that semihuman creature behaved like a beast.</p>
<p>Daniel showed the king how the dream applied to the king himself. Nebuchadnezzar was the great tree that would be cut down; he would behave like a beast in the field for seven years. One year after the king had been told that interpretation, the judgment came. For seven years he behaved like an animal until his sanity returned.</p>
<p>The moral of the king’s story is that his madness was no accident but rather divine judgment. His arrogant belief that he had the power of God led to heavy retribution (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.30">4:30</a>). The king was probably afflicted with a rare and peculiar form of mental illness today called “boanthropy.” The true meaning of the story lies at a deeper level: to think that one is God, having absolute power and control of one’s own life, is madness. That kind of madness can be cured and overcome only with the realization that absolute power and authority belong to God alone.</p>
<p class="h3">Belshazzar’s Feast (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.1-31">5:1-31</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The scene shifts to the reign of a later king in Babylon, Belshazzar. The son of Nabonidus, he was probably co-regent with Nabonidus (555?–539 <span class="era">BC</span>), with special authority in the region of Babylon. The theme of his story is similar to that of chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.4.1-37">4</a>. Belshazzar, in the course of an enormous feast, called for the sacred vessels captured from the temple in Jerusalem. With the sacred vessels the Babylonians toasted the local gods, a sacrilegious act that invited divine judgment. It came in the form of words written on the wall by a hand, which Daniel interpreted for the king as words of judgment (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.26-28">5:26-28</a>). Although he praised Daniel for the interpretation, the king missed both the true meaning of the words and the lesson taught to Nebuchadnezzar, his predecessor (vv <a href="?bref=Dan.5.18-22">18-22</a>). Belshazzar was killed that very night when Darius the Mede entered the city and captured it. The theme continues remorselessly: human pride and arrogance do not pass unnoticed by the God of history, who controls and directs human events toward the fulfillment of his purpose.</p>
<p class="h3">The Den of Lions (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.1-28">6:1-28</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The theme of chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.6.1-28">6</a> is similar to that of chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">3</a>, but with Daniel as the story’s central figure. He is portrayed as one unwilling to compromise, fully obedient to Darius as long as that was possible, but unwilling to disobey the law of God. Hence, Daniel knowingly disobeyed a royal decree that prohibited prayer to anyone other than the king himself. Although he was aware of the consequences, Daniel remained faithful to God. The immediate outcome, when his enemies reported him, was an order of execution—Daniel was thrown to the lions. He was delivered from the hungry cats, and the king, relieved of a terrible predicament, had the plotters punished.</p>
<p>A double message emerges from the story. On the one hand, God’s servant must be faithful in prayer and worship, regardless of the outcome; God delivers, and in that case did deliver Daniel from disaster. On the other hand, the effect of Daniel’s faithfulness was that the king, who had ordered his subjects to worship him, learned about true worship (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.25-27">6:25-27</a>). The effects of faithfulness, like ripples from a pebble tossed in a pool, spread far beyond the one who is faithful.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ContentDanielsVisions712">Content: Daniel’s Visions (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">7–12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">With the beginning of chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">7</a> the chronological sequence of the book of Daniel changes; Daniel’s first vision goes back to the first year of Belshazzar (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1">7:1</a>), but subsequent visions take place as late as the reign of Cyrus, the Persian king (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.1">10:1</a>). Chapters <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">7–12</a> emphasize the meaning of history and God’s sovereignty in history, expressed in the mysterious symbolism of dreams. The whole section can be divided as follows: (1) vision of four beasts (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">7:1-28</a>); (2) vision of the ram and the goat (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.1-27">8:1-27</a>); (3) Daniel’s prayer (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.1-27">9:1-27</a>); (4) vision of the end times (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.1-12.13">10:1–12:13</a>).</p>
<p>The first vision again takes up the theme of four kingdoms, already seen in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">2</a>). In the second vision the focus is narrowed down to two kingdoms, Persia and Greece. Much of the final vision of the end times deals with events occurring during the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>. All the visions play on the same theme. Although human kingdoms may exert their might in a chaotic world, the sovereign God acts through history’s apparent chaos toward an ultimate goal of salvation.</p>
<p>The primary interpretation of the visions can be perceived in past historical events, but a further messianic dimension can be seen in the light of the NT. That dimension is most evident in chapter <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">7</a>. In the context of the four kingdoms, a divine court of judgment is established, presided over by the “Ancient of Days”—the almighty God (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.9">7:9</a>). Then Daniel sees the arrival of “one like a son of man” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">7:13</a>). Though the phrase “son of man” was later perceived to be a messianic title, it did not technically have that meaning in the book of Daniel. <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">Daniel 7:13</a> is a principal source for the title “Son of Man,” which Jesus commonly used to designate himself. His most significant use of that term was at his trial, where he directly associated his title with <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Daniel 7</a> (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.63-64">Mt 26:63-64</a>).</p>

  <title>Darius</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DARIUS</p>
<p class="fl">Name of three emperors in the Persian dynasty of the legendary King Achaemenes. A Darius appears in the biblical books of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah as a Persian king, and in the book of Daniel as a Mede who became king over the Chaldeans (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.1">Dn 9:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DariusI">Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Also known as Darius Hystaspes and Darius the Great, Darius I seized the throne of the Persian Empire after the death of Cambyses II. Although he was an Achaemenid, he was from a different branch of the royal family than Cyrus and Cambyses, and his authority was not accepted in all the provinces. After Darius quelled several revolts, however, his power was firmly established, and he turned his attention to expanding the empire. His military campaigns extended Persian borders to the Danube River in the west and to the Indus River in the east, making him ruler of the largest empire the world had known. Greco-Persian conflict, which continued until Alexander the Great conquered the empire in 330 <span class="era">BC</span>, began when Darius launched two invasions of Greece after conquering Thrace and Macedonia. The first expedition was destroyed by a storm in the Aegean Sea; the second was defeated by the Athenians in the famous battle of Marathon in 490 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>An able administrator, Darius did much to promote trade and commerce. He instituted a uniform system of weights and measures. During his reign, a canal from the Nile River to the Red Sea was completed, and a sea route from the Indus River to Egypt was explored.</p>
<p>During Darius’s reign, Persian architecture developed a style that continued until the end of the Achaemenid dynasty. Darius built at Babylon, Ecbatana, and Susa, his capital. A great royal road was constructed from Susa to the Lydian capital of Sardis. His greatest architectural accomplishment was the founding of Persepolis, a new royal city to replace the emperor’s residence at Pasargadae. Darius also allowed temples to be built in Egypt and in Jerusalem, continuing Cyrus’s policy of respecting the religious customs of his subjects.</p>
<p>Darius I is the Darius, king of Persia, mentioned in the books of Ezra, Haggai, and Zechariah. <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-6.22">Ezra 5–6</a> record that Zerubbabel and Jeshua, with the help of Haggai and Zechariah, finished rebuilding the temple during Darius’s reign while Tattenai was governor of the province “Beyond the River” (Syria-Palestine). Zerubbabel and Jeshua had returned to Jerusalem under Cyrus II about 538 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.2">Ezr 2:2</a>). They completed the temple in the sixth year of Darius (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.15">6:15</a>). That must have been the sixth year of Darius I (516 <span class="era">BC</span>), since the sixth year of Darius II would certainly be too late. That identification was confirmed by discovery of a Babylonian document, dated June 5, 502 <span class="era">BC</span>, which refers to Tattenai as “the governor of Beyond the River.”</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-24">4</a> of Ezra three Persian rulers are mentioned: Darius (vv <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.5,24">5, 24</a>); Ahasuerus (probably Xerxes I, v <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">6</a>); and Artaxerxes (probably Artaxerxes I, vv <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-23">7-23</a>). The chapter is a brief record of resistance to Jewish efforts to rebuild the city of Jerusalem and the temple. Verse <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.24">24</a> states that work on the temple stopped until “the second year of the reign of Darius,” yet the temple was completed in the sixth year of Darius I. Obviously, work on the temple could not have stopped in the second year of Artaxerxes’ son Darius II (421 <span class="era">BC</span>) if it had already been finished in 515 <span class="era">BC</span>. Therefore, <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.24">Ezra 4:24</a> should be understood not as a chronological continuation of the first 23 verses but as an introduction to the next two chapters, which discuss the building of the temple.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DariusII">Darius II (423–404 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Also known as Ochus (his real name) and Darius Nothus (“Darius the bastard”), Darius II was the son of Artaxerxes I by a Babylonian concubine. Before he became emperor, Ochus was a satrap (governor) of Hyrcania, a region on the southeast coast of the Caspian Sea. In 423 <span class="era">BC</span> his half brother, Sogdianus (or Secydianus), killed Xerxes II. Ochus then seized the throne from Sogdianus, whom he executed, and adopted the name Darius II. His reign was plagued with revolution and corruption. His own full brother, Arsites, revolted soon after Darius seized the throne, and Darius had him executed.</p>
<p>After an alliance with Sparta was formed against Athens, Persia joined the Peloponnesian War. Several successful military campaigns succeeded in recovering the Greek coastal cities of Asia Minor and breaking Athenian power in the Aegean area. Darius II died in Babylon in 404 <span class="era">BC</span>, the year the Peloponnesian War ended.</p>
<p>The Darius mentioned only once in the book of Nehemiah probably is Darius II. The passage states that Jewish priests were recorded “until the reign of Darius the Persian” (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.22">Neh 12:22b</a>); descendants of Levi were recorded “until the days of Johanan son of Eliashib” (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.23">Neh 12:23</a>). An Aramaic document found in Elephantine, Egypt, refers to Johanan the high priest in Jerusalem. The document was written in 407 <span class="era">BC</span>, thus placing Johanan in the reign of Darius II.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DariustheMede">Darius the Mede</p>
<p class="fl">Unknown in historical documents of the period of the Babylonian and Persian empires, this biblical Darius has been identified with several known figures. The most important efforts have identified Darius the Mede as another name for Cyrus II (“Cyrus the Persian,” <a href="?bref=Dan.6.28">Dn 6:28</a>); for Cambyses II, Cyrus’s son; or for Gubaru, who was governor of Babylon and the province Beyond the River during the reigns of Cyrus II and Cambyses II.</p>
<p>According to the book of Daniel, “Darius the Mede received the kingdom” when Belshazzar, king of Babylon, was slain (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.30-31">Dn 5:30-31</a>). Darius was about 62 years old (v <a href="?bref=Dan.5.31">31</a>) and was “the son of Ahasuerus, by birth a Mede” (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.1">9:1</a>). Daniel never suggested that Darius was king of Media or of the whole Persian Empire, only of the Chaldean (Babylonian) kingdom. The Babylonian Empire included Mesopotamia (Babylonia and Assyria) and Syro-Palestine (Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine). In the Persian Empire, that huge area became known as the province of Babylon (Mesopotamia) and Beyond the River (Syro-Palestine). Daniel also recorded that Darius appointed governors in the kingdom. By the third year of Cyrus the Persian (536 <span class="era">BC</span>), the first year of Darius the Mede had already passed (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.1-11.1">Dn 10:1–11:1</a>).</p>
<p>According to Nabonidus’s Chronicle and the Persian Verse Account of Nabonidus (two cuneiform documents from Nabonidus’s reign), Nabonidus was in Tema until Cyrus’s invasion of Babylonia. While he was away, he “entrusted the kingship” to his son Belshazzar. On October 12, 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, Babylon fell to Ugbaru, general of Cyrus’s army. Cyrus entered Babylon on October 29, 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, and appointed a person named Gubaru governor of Babylon. Gubaru then appointed other governors under him. General Ugbaru died on November 6, 539 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Clearly there is no place for Darius the Mede between the reigns of Nabonidus/Belshazzar and Cyrus II. Thus Darius the Mede must be Cyrus, a subordinate of Cyrus, or Cambyses, crown prince under Cyrus. But Cyrus II is mentioned as a separate person (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.28">Dn 6:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.1-11.1">10:1–11:1</a>), and it seems unlikely that the author would name the same figure both “Cyrus the Persian” and “Darius the Mede.” Cambyses II could not have been 62 years old; also, since he was not made king of Babylon until he became king of the empire in 529 <span class="era">BC</span>, Cambyses’ first year could not precede Cyrus’s third year (536 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Darius the Mede was thus probably a subordinate of Cyrus who was made ruler of “the realm of the Chaldeans” after Belshazzar and who could have been considered a king by his subjects. Accordingly, the reign of Darius (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.28">Dn 6:28</a>) should be understood as simultaneous with that of Cyrus, not as a preceding reign. Thus, Gubaru was made governor of Babylon immediately following the reign of Belshazzar, and he appointed governors, as did Darius the Mede. There is no record of Gubaru’s age, nationality, or ancestry. He may well have been a 62-year-old Mede whose father was named Ahasuerus. The Ahasuerus of the book of Esther and of <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">Ezra 4:6</a> should be identified with a later king, probably Xerxes I.</p>
<p>Many Babylonian texts record that Gubaru was governor of Babylon and the province Beyond the River for about 14 years (539–525 <span class="era">BC</span>). The documents attribute much power to him. His name is a final warning to officials who might disobey the laws. In documents that mention Cyrus II or Cambyses II, crimes in Babylon are stated to be sins against Gubaru, not against Cyrus or Cambyses. The province of Babylon and Beyond the River was the richest and most populous in the Persian Empire, encompassing many nations and languages. For a powerful governor of such a region to be called “king” by his subjects seems only natural.</p>
<p>The case for Gubaru is admittedly circumstantial, but it remains the best solution to the problem. Until further evidence comes to light, it is safe to assume that Darius the Mede, “king over the realm of the Chaldeans,” was actually Gubaru, the known governor of that realm.</p>

<p class="h1">DARKNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Absence of light or brightness. Although the Bible seldom refers to literal darkness, a number of words translated “darkness” are used in a figurative or metaphorical sense.</p>
<p>When God created the world, there was no light until he commanded that light appear. He then made distinction between light and its opposite, darkness, which he called night (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.2,4-5,18">Gn 1:2, 4-5, 18</a>). Literal darkness is also mentioned in the account of the plagues God inflicted on Egypt; the ninth plague was an intense darkness that could be “felt” (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.21-23">Ex 10:21-23</a>). That darkness lasted three days and was selective; wherever Egyptians were, it was dark, but where the Israelites were, there was light. The Israelites left Egypt accompanied by a cloud that separated them from their enemy, evidently giving light to the Israelites but making darkness for the Egyptians (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.20">Ex 14:20</a>). The Bible notes that thieves or adulterers are likely to do their evil deeds in the dark or at night (<a href="?bref=Job.24.16-17">Jb 24:16-17</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT “darkness” is used twice in its literal sense. At the crucifixion of Jesus, for a three-hour period from noon to three o’clock, there was not light (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.45">Mt 27:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.33">Mk 15:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.44">Lk 23:44</a>). The other reference is to Christ’s second coming, when “the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light” (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.29">Mt 24:29</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Several biblical passages speak of a darkness surrounding God, evidently moving from a literal sense of absence of light to a more profound meaning. God spoke to Moses on Mt Sinai in a dense, black cloud (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.21">Ex 20:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.11">Dt 4:11</a>) or from the darkness (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.23">Dt 5:23</a>). Darkness is pictured as a shelter or cloak around God (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.12">2 Sm 22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.11">Pss 18:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.2">97:2</a>). God sets a boundary for light and darkness (<a href="?bref=Job.26.10">Jb 26:10</a>), brings darkness (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.20">Pss 104:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.28">105:28</a>), and creates light and darkness (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.7">Is 45:7</a>). God dwells in thick darkness (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.12">1 Kgs 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.1">2 Chr 6:1</a>), and thick darkness is under his feet (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.10">2 Sm 22:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.9">Ps 18:9</a>).</p>
<p>Most figurative references to darkness appear in poetic material, such as Job, Psalms, and Isaiah. Generally, such darkness depicts ignorance about God’s will. Knowledge of God is “light”; hence, lack of such knowledge is “darkness” (<a href="?bref=Job.12.24-25">Jb 12:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.4.16">Mt 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.5">Jn 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.35,46">12:35, 46</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5">1 Jn 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.8-9,11">2:8-9, 11</a>).</p>
<p>Job spoke of darkness as equivalent to nothingness (<a href="?bref=Job.3.4-6">Jb 3:4-6</a>). In other references darkness stands for death, a land of shadows and gloom, the dwelling place of the dead far from the light of day (<a href="?bref=Job.10.21-22">Jb 10:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.15.24">15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.17.12-13">17:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.18.18">18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.6.4">Eccl 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.11.8">11:8</a>).</p>
<p>Darkness frequently stands for distress and anxiety, or for the confusion and destruction experienced by the wicked (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.12">Gn 15:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.5.14">Jb 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.12.25">12:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.15.22,30">15:22, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.22.11">22:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.6">Pss 35:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.10,14">107:10, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.5.17">Eccl 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.30">Is 5:30</a>). Moral depravity is sometimes described as darkness (<a href="?bref=Pr.2.13">Prv 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.4.19">4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.20">Is 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.2">60:2</a>). In the NT darkness is generally a metaphor of moral depravity and spiritual ignorance (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.16">Mt 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.23">6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.79">Lk 1:79</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.35">11:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.53">22:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.19">Rom 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.13">Col 1:13</a>).</p>
<p>A major theme of OT prophets was the Day of the Lord, often associated with darkness (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.8">Ez 32:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.2,31">Jl 2:2, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18,20">Am 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.15">Zep 1:15</a>). The NT also links darkness with judgment in connection with Christ’s second coming (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.12">Mt 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.13">22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.30">25:30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.17">2 Pt 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.6,13">Jude 1:6, 13</a>). Those who come to know God are said to come out of darkness (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.2">Is 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.29.18">29:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.7">42:7</a>); darkness cannot be a hiding place from God (<a href="?bref=Job.34.22">Jb 34:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.139.11-12">Ps 139:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.29.15">Is 29:15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">DAVID</p>
<p class="fl">Israel’s most important king. David’s kingdom represented the epitome of Israel’s power and influence during the nation’s OT history.</p>
<p>The two books in the OT devoted to David’s reign are 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles. His earlier years are recorded in 1 Samuel, beginning at chapter <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-23">16</a>. Almost half of the biblical psalms are ascribed to David. His importance extends into the NT, where he is identified as an ancestor of Jesus Christ and forerunner of the messianic king.</p>

<p class="h2-preview">David’s Lasting Influence</p>
<p class="h2" id="EarlyYears">Early Years</p>
<p class="h3">Family</p>
<p class="fl">David was the youngest son in Jesse’s family, part of Judah’s tribe. The family lived in Bethlehem, about six miles (10 kilometers) south of Jerusalem. His great-grandmother was Ruth, from the land of Moab (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ru 4:18-22</a>). Genealogies in both the OT and the NT trace David’s lineage back to Judah, son of the patriarch Jacob (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.3-15">1 Chr 2:3-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.3-6">Mt 1:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.31-33">Lk 3:31-33</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Training and Talents</p>
<p class="fl">Little is known about David’s early life. As a boy, he took care of his father’s sheep, risking his life to kill attacking bears and lions. Later, David publicly acknowledged God’s help and strength in protecting the flocks under his care (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.34-37">1 Sm 17:34-37</a>).</p>
<p>David was an accomplished musician. He had developed his ability as a harpist so well that, when a musician was needed at the royal court of King Saul, someone immediately recommended David.</p>
<p>In Jesse’s family, David was regarded as unimportant. When the nationally known prophet Samuel visited Jesse’s home, all the older sons were on hand to meet him; David was tending the sheep. Samuel had been instructed by God to anoint a king from Jesse’s family, not knowing beforehand which son to anoint. Sensing divine restraint as seven brothers passed before him, he made further inquiry. When he learned that Jesse had one other son, David was immediately summoned. David was anointed by Samuel and endowed with the Spirit of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1-13">1 Sm 16:1-13</a>). Whatever Jesse and his family understood by that anointing, it seems to have made no immediate change in David’s pattern of living. He continued to tend the sheep.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PreparationforKingship">Preparation for Kingship</p>
<p class="fl">During his youth, David was willing to serve others, even though he had been anointed king. It was his willingness to take supplies to three of his older brothers in the army that gave him his opportunity for national fame.</p>
<p>As a young man, David was also sensitive toward God. While greeting his brothers on the battlefield, he was disturbed by the Philistine Goliath’s defiance of God’s armies. Although rebuked by his brothers, David accepted the challenge to take on Goliath. He had a reasonable confidence that God, who had helped him encounter a lion and a bear, would aid him against a champion warrior. So, with faith in God and using his ability to sling stones, David killed Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.12-58">1 Sm 17:12-58</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">National Fame</p>
<p class="fl">Killing Goliath made David a hero to the nation of Israel. It also brought him into close relationship with the royal family of Saul. But success and national acclaim brought on the jealousy of Saul and ultimately resulted in David’s expulsion from the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="h3">In the Royal Court</p>
<p class="fl">Saul promised his oldest daughter, Merab, to David in marriage, but then Saul went back on the promise and offered David another daughter, Michal. The dowry of trophies from dead Philistines demanded by Saul was designed to bring about David’s death at Philistine hands. But again David was victorious. Women sang praises of his exploits, intensifying Saul’s jealousy and further endangering David’s life (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.6-30">1 Sm 18:6-30</a>).</p>
<p>In the meantime, David and Saul’s son Jonathan developed a deep friendship. When they made a covenant, Jonathan gave David his choicest military equipment (sword, bow, and belt). Although Saul tried to turn Jonathan against David, the friendship deepened. Because Saul was trying to kill him, David had to flee from the court and live as a fugitive.</p>
<p>After Jonathan had warned David of Saul’s continuing designs on his life, David went to Ramah to see the prophet Samuel. Together they went to Naioth, near Ramah. After sending several groups of men after David, Saul finally went with them himself. All his attempts to seize David were thwarted by the Spirit of God, who caused Saul and his men to prophesy all night in religious fervor (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.1-24">1 Sm 19</a>).</p>
<p>Conferring again with Jonathan, David realized that Saul’s jealousy had developed into hatred. Jonathan, aware that David would be the future king of Israel, requested assurance that his descendants would receive protection under David’s rule (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.1-42">1 Sm 20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Life as a Fugitive</p>
<p class="fl">Fleeing from Saul, David stopped at Nob. By deceiving Ahimelech, who was officiating as priest there, David obtained food supplies and Goliath’s sword (kept as a trophy). An Edomite named Doeg, chief of Saul’s herdsmen, saw what happened at Nob. David continued his flight, taking refuge temporarily in Gath with King Achish (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-15">1 Sm 21</a>), then finding shelter in the cave of Adullam, located 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) southwest of Bethlehem. There his relatives and about 400 fighting men joined him. He went to Mizpeh in Moab, appealing to the Moabite king for protection, especially for his parents. When the prophet Gad warned him not to stay there, David moved back to Judah to the Hereth woods (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.1-5">1 Sm 22:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>David’s freedom of movement enraged Saul, who charged his own people with conspiracy. When Doeg reported what he had witnessed at Nob, Saul executed Ahimelech and 84 other priests, then massacred all of Nob’s inhabitants. One priest named Abiathar escaped to report Saul’s atrocities to David, who assured him of protection (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.6-23">1 Sm 22:6-23</a>).</p>
<p>The Philistines were always ready to take advantage of any weakness in Israel. David’s reprisal after a Philistine raid on Keilah, 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) southwest of Bethlehem, gave Saul an opportunity to attack David, who escaped to the wilderness of Ziph, a desert area near Hebron. David and Jonathan met for the last time in that wilderness. Pursued by Saul’s army, David fled still farther south. He was almost encircled in uninhabited country near Maon when Saul had to march his army off to respond to a Philistine attack (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-29">1 Sm 23</a>).</p>
<p>At his next place of refuge, En-gedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea, David was attacked by Saul with 3,000 soldiers. David had an opportunity to kill Saul but refused to harm the “Lord’s anointed” king of Israel. Learning of David’s loyalty, Saul confessed his sin in seeking David’s life (<a href="?bref=1Sam.24.1-22">1 Sm 24</a>).</p>
<p>During the years they roamed the wilderness in the Maon/Ziph/En-gedi area, David’s band provided protection for Nabal, a rich man living in Maon with large flocks of sheep at Carmel. In exchange for that protection, David proposed that Nabal share some of his wealth. Nabal’s scorn angered David, but Nabal’s wife, Abigail, appealed to David not to take revenge. When Abigail told Nabal of his narrow escape, he was evidently so shocked that he had a heart seizure. He died ten days later, and Abigail later became David’s wife (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1-44">1 Sm 25</a>).</p>
<p>Once more Saul came with an army of 3,000 men into the Ziph Desert to find David, and David again passed up an opportunity to harm the king. Finally realizing the folly of seeking David’s life, Saul abandoned pursuit (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1-25">1 Sm 26</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Refuge in Philistia</p>
<p class="fl">David continued to feel unsafe in Saul’s kingdom. Returning to Gath in Philistine country, he was welcomed by King Achish. His followers were allotted the city of Ziklag, where they lived for about 16 months, attracting new recruits from Judah and the rest of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.1-12">1 Sm 27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.19-22">1 Chr 12:19-22</a>).</p>
<p>The Philistine army, marching up to the Megiddo Valley to fight Saul’s army, was uneasy with David’s guerrillas in their rear column, so the commanders put pressure on Achish to dismiss David. When he returned to Ziklag, David found that the city had just been raided by the Amalekites. He pursued the enemy, rescued his people and goods, and divided the spoils with those who had remained behind to guard the supplies (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1-30.31">1 Sm 29–30</a>). Meanwhile, the Philistines routed the Israelites at Mt Gilboa, killing Jonathan and two of Saul’s other sons in a fierce battle. Saul, badly wounded, killed himself with his own sword (ch <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-13">31</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="DavidFleesfromSaul"/>
<p class="h2" id="DavidasKing">David as King</p>
<p class="fl">David ruled over Israel for about 40 years, although the accounts of his reign do not contain enough information for an exact chronology. He began his rule at Hebron and reigned over Judah’s territory for seven or eight years. With the death of Saul’s successor, Ishbosheth, David was recognized as king by all the tribes and made Jerusalem his capital. During the next decade, he unified Israel through military and economic expansion. Then came approximately 10 years of disruption in the royal family. The last years of David’s reign seem to have been devoted to plans for the Jerusalem temple, which was built in the reign of his son Solomon.</p>
<p class="h3">The Years in Hebron</p>
<p class="fl">David was subjected to an unusually rugged period of training for his kingship. Serving under Saul, he gained experience in military exploits against the Philistines. Then, during his fugitive wanderings in the desert area of southern Judah, he ingratiated himself with the landholders and sheep raisers by giving them protection. Being recognized as an outlaw of Israel even enabled him to negotiate diplomatic relations with Moab and Philistia.</p>
<p>David was in Philistine country when news came to him that both Saul and Jonathan had been slain. In a beautiful elegy he paid tribute to his friend Jonathan as well as to King Saul (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.1-27">2 Sm 1</a>).</p>
<p>Sure of God’s guidance, David returned to his home, where the leaders of Judah anointed him king at Hebron. He sent a message of commendation to the men of Jabesh for providing a respectable burial for King Saul, probably also bidding for their support.</p>
<p>Confusion probably swept through Israel when Saul was killed, because the Philistines occupied much of the land. Various leaders gathered whatever fighting men they could find, as old tribal loyalties reasserted themselves. David had most of Judah’s tribe firmly behind him.</p>
<p>A kind of civil war broke out between the followers of David and those of Saul, with David gaining the allegiance of more and more people. Saul’s general, Abner, eventually negotiated peace with David, who requested the restoration of Michal as his wife, indicating that he held no animosity toward Saul’s dynasty. With the consent of Saul’s son Ishbosheth, whom Abner had enthroned as king, Abner went to Hebron and pledged Israel’s support for David. But Abner was killed by Joab, one of David’s captains, in a family vendetta, and soon afterward Ishbosheth was assassinated. David publicly mourned Abner’s death and had Ishbosheth’s two murderers executed. Thus, when Saul’s dynasty ended, David was seen by the people not so much as a challenger but as a logical successor. Hence, he was recognized as king by all Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-4.12">2 Sm 2–4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Consolidation in Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">When the Israelites turned to David as king, the Philistines became alarmed and attacked (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.1-25">2 Sm 5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.8-17">1 Chr 14:8-17</a>). David was strong enough to defeat them and thus unify the people of Israel.</p>
<p>In search of a more central location for his capital, David turned toward the city of Jerusalem, a Jebusite stronghold. Joab responded to his challenge to conquer the city and was rewarded by being made general of David’s army. Jerusalem became known as the “city of David” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.4-9">1 Chr 11:4-9</a>).</p>
<p>In the same way that he had organized his earliest followers into an effective guerrilla band (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.1-12.22">1 Chr 11:1–12:22</a>) at Hebron, David began organizing the whole nation (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.23-40">12:23-40</a>). Once established in Jerusalem, he quickly gained recognition from the Phoenicians, contracting for their artisans to build him a magnificent palace in the new capital (<a href="?bref=1Chr.14.1-2">14:1-2</a>). He also made sure that Jerusalem would become Israel’s religious center (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-23">2 Sm 6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.1-16.43">1 Chr 13–16</a>). His abortive attempt to move the ark of the covenant by oxcart (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.4.1-49">Nm 4</a>) reminded the powerful king that he still had to do things God’s way to be successful.</p>
<p>With Jerusalem well established as the nation’s capital, David intended to build God a temple. He shared his plan with the prophet Nathan, whose immediate response was positive. That night, however, God sent a message via Nathan that David should not build the temple. David’s throne would be established eternally, the prophet said, and unlike Saul, King David would have a son to succeed him and perpetuate the kingdom; that son would build the temple (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sm 7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.17.1-27">1 Chr 17</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Prosperity and Supremacy</p>
<p class="fl">Little is recorded about the expansion of David’s rule from the tribal area of Judah to a vast empire stretching from the Nile River of Egypt to regions of the Tigris-Euphrates valley. Nothing in secular history negates the biblical perspective that David had the most powerful kingdom in the heart of that “Fertile Crescent” about 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>It is likely that skirmishes with the Philistines to the west were frequent until they finally became subservient to David and paid him tribute. In Saul’s day the Philistines had enjoyed a monopoly on the use of iron (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-21">1 Sm 13:19-21</a>). The fact that David freely used iron near the end of his reign (<a href="?bref=1Chr.22.3">1 Chr 22:3</a>) hints at profound economic changes in Israel.</p>
<p>David’s kingdom expanded southward as he built military garrisons in Edomite territory. Beyond Edom, he controlled the Moabites and Amalekites, who paid him tribute in silver and gold. To the northeast, Israelite domination was extended over the Ammonites and the Arameans, whose capital was Damascus. David’s treatment of both friends and enemies seemed to contribute to the strength of his kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.1-10.19">2 Sm 8–10</a>). Although he was a brilliant military strategist who used all the means and resources available to bring Israel success, David was humble enough to glorify God (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.1-51">2 Sm 22</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">Ps 18</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Sin in the Royal Family</p>
<p class="fl">A lengthy section of the book of 2 Samuel (chs <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-20.26">11–20</a>) gives a remarkably frank account of sin, crime, and rebellion in David’s family. The king’s own imperfections are clearly portrayed; the king of Israel himself could not escape God’s judgement when he did wrong.</p>
<p>Although polygamy was then a Near Eastern status symbol, it was forbidden for a king of Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.17">Dt 17:17</a>). David practiced polygamy, however; some of his marriages undoubtedly had political implications (such as his marriages to Saul’s daughter Michal and to princess Maacah of Geshur). Flagrant sins of incest, murder, and rebellion in his family brought David much suffering and almost cost him the throne.</p>
<p>David’s sin of adultery with Bathsheba, committed at the height of his military success and territorial expansion, led him further into evil: he planned a strategy to have Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah, killed on the front line of battle. David seems to have excluded God from consideration in that segment of his personal life. Yet when the prophet Nathan confronted the king with his sins, David acknowledged his guilt. He confessed his sin and pleaded with God for forgiveness (as in <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">Pss 32</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">51</a>). God forgave him, but for nearly ten years David endured the consequences of his lack of self-restraint and his failure to exercise discipline in his family. Although unsurpassed in military and diplomatic strategy, David lacked strength of character in his domestic affairs. Evil fermented in his own house; the father’s self-indulgence was soon reflected in Amnon’s crime of incest, followed by Absalom’s murder of his brother.</p>
<p>Having incurred his father’s disfavor, Absalom took refuge in Geshur with his mother’s people for three years. Joab, David’s general, was eventually able to reconcile David with his alienated son. Absalom, however, having taken advantage of his position in the royal family to gain a following, went to Hebron, staged a surprise rebellion, and proclaimed himself king throughout Israel. His strong following posed such a threat that David fled from Jerusalem. David, still a master strategist, gained time through a ruse to organize his forces and put down his son’s rebellion. Absalom was killed while trying to flee; his death plunged David into grief.</p>
<p>On his return to Jerusalem, David had to work at undoing the damage caused by Absalom’s revolt. His own tribe of Judah, for example, had supported Absalom. Another rebellion, fomented by Sheba of Benjamin’s tribe, had to be suppressed by Joab before the nation could settle down.</p>
<p class="h3">David’s Last Years</p>
<p class="fl">Although David was not permitted to build the temple in Jerusalem, he made extensive preparations for that project during the last years of his reign. He stockpiled materials and organized the kingdom for efficient use of domestic and foreign labor. He also outlined details for religious worship in the new structure (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1-29.30">1 Chr 21–29</a>).</p>
<p>The military and civic organization developed by David was probably patterned after Egyptian practice. The army, rigidly controlled by officers of proven loyalty to the king, included mercenaries. The king also appointed trusted supervisors over farms, livestock, and orchards in various parts of his empire (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.25-31">1 Chr 27:25-31</a>).</p>
<p>David took, or at least began, a census of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-25">2 Sm 24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1-30">1 Chr 21</a>). The incompleteness of the accounts leaves unanswered such questions as the reason for God’s punishment. The king overruled Joab’s objection and insisted that the census be taken. Since David later seemed keenly aware that he had sinned in taking the census, it may be that he was motivated by pride to ascertain his exact military strength (approx. 1.5 million men). God may also have been judging the people for their support of the rebellions of Absalom and Sheba.</p>
<p>Through the prophet Gad, David was given a choice of punishments for his sin. He chose a three-day pestilence. As David and the elders repented, they saw an angel on the threshing floor of the Jebusite Ornan (Araunah). David offered sacrifice there and prayed for his people. Later he purchased the threshing floor, located just outside the city of Jerusalem, concluding that it should be the site for the temple to be built by his son Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.28-22.1">1 Chr 21:28–22:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DavidsLastingInfluence">David’s Lasting Influence</p>
<p class="h3">The Writer of Psalms</p>
<p class="fl">The OT book of Psalms became one of the most popular books in ancient Israel, and has remained so among countless millions of people throughout the centuries. These words of praise prepared by David were intended for use in the temple worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.30">2 Chr 29:30</a>). The 73 psalms ascribed to David generally grew out of his own relationship to God and to other persons.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="SomePsalmsFromDavidSExperiences"/>
<p>David probably compiled Book I of the book of Psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-41.13">1–41</a>) and Book IV (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-106.48">90–106</a>), since most of those psalms were written by David himself. Other psalms of his (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-71.24">Pss 51–71</a>) are in Book II (<a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-72.20">42–72</a>), which was probably compiled by Solomon. As those psalms were used for worship in later generations, various people added others until the time of Ezra.</p>
<p>David’s psalms provided much of the poetry that was set to music for Israel’s worship. His organization of the priests and Levites and his provision of instruments for worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.7.6">2 Chr 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.14">8:14</a>) set the pattern for generations to come in the religious life of Israel.</p>
<p class="h3">David in the Writings of the Prophets</p>
<p class="fl">David, recognized as the greatest Israelite king, is often mentioned as a standard of comparison in the writings of the OT prophets. Isaiah (as in <a href="?bref=Isa.7.2,13">Is 7:2, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.22.22">22:22</a>) and Jeremiah often referred to their contemporary kings as belonging to the “house” or “throne” of David. Contrasting David with some of his descendants who did not honor God, both Isaiah and Jeremiah predicted a messianic ruler who would establish justice and righteousness on the throne of David forever (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">Is 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.15">Jer 33:15</a>). When Isaiah described the coming ruler, he identified him as being from the lineage of Jesse, David’s father (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-10">Is 11:1-10</a>). Predicting a period of universal peace, Isaiah saw the capital in “Zion,” identified with the city of David (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>Ezekiel promised the restoration of David as king in an eschatological and messianic sense (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.24-25">Ez 37:24-25</a>), and of “my servant David” as Israel’s shepherd (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.23">34:23</a>). Hosea likewise identified the future ruler as King David (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.5">Hos 3:5</a>). Amos assured the people that God would restore the “tabernacle” of David (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.11">Am 9:11</a>) so that they could again dwell in safety. Zechariah referred five times to the “house of David” (in <a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-13.9">Zec 12–13</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), encouraging the hope of a restoration of David’s glorious dynasty. The concept of the eternal throne promised to David during his reign was delineated in the message of the prophets even while they were announcing judgments to come on the rulers and people of their time.</p>
<p class="h3">David in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">David is frequently mentioned by the Gospel writers, who established Jesus’ identity as the “son of David.” The covenant God made with David was that an eternal king would come from David’s family (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.27">9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.23">12:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.48">Mk 10:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.35">12:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.38-39">Lk 18:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.41">20:41</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Mark.11.10">Mark 11:10</a> and <a href="?bref=John.7.42">John 7:42</a>, the Jews of Jesus’ day expected the Messiah (Christ) to be a descendant of David. While stating that Jesus came from the lineage of David, the Gospels also clearly teach that Jesus was the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.41-45">Mt 22:41-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.35-37">Mk 12:35-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.41-44">Lk 20:41-44</a>).</p>
<p>In the book of Acts, David is recognized as the recipient of God’s promises that were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. David is also seen as a prophet whom the Holy Spirit inspired to write the psalms (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.16">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.22-36">2:22-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.25">4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.26-39">13:26-39</a>).</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation, Jesus is designated as having the “key of David” (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.7">Rv 3:7</a>), and as being “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David” (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">5:5</a>). Jesus is quoted as asserting that “I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.16">22:16</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DAVID, City of</p>
<p class="list">1. In the OT, the city of Jerusalem. “City of David” referred originally to the old Jebusite stronghold captured by King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-9">2 Sm 5:6-9</a>). David, Solomon, and many of their descendants who ruled over Judah were buried in the City of David (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.10">1 Kgs 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.43">11:43</a>). Solomon considered it a holy place because of the presence of the ark of the Lord. Therefore, he moved his pagan wife, Pharaoh’s daughter, away from the City of David and built a house for her in another place (<a href="?bref=2Chr.8.11">2 Chr 8:11</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After Solomon’s time, the term “city of David” was also used in a larger sense to describe the entire city of Jerusalem, including the newly built temple area. The old section of Jerusalem below the temple site was still specifically designated as the “city of David,” however (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.15">Neh 3:15</a>). David’s tomb was close to the pool of Siloam and to the stairway that descended from the City of David (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.15-16">Neh 3:15-16</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Jerusalem_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jerusalem</a>; <a href="?item=Zion_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Zion</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. In the NT, the town of Bethlehem. Bethlehem was David’s birthplace and home until he went to Saul’s palace as a musician (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.16-23">1 Sm 16:16-23</a>). When David became Judah’s king, he chose Hebron to be his capital, as the Lord had instructed him (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-11">2 Sm 2:1-11</a>). Bethlehem was the birthplace of Jesus, who was a descendant of David (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.2-4">Mi 5:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.11">Lk 2:11</a>).</p>

  <title>Day</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DAY</p>
<p class="fl">Most literally, a period of time delimited by the earth’s rotation around its axis, such as the period between two consecutive sunrises; also, the portion of that period in which the sun is visible, the other portion being called “night.” The word “day” occurs over 2,000 times in the OT, over 350 times in the NT. The Hebrew word for “day” is used in a variety of ways, not merely in the literal sense. The Hebrew day began in the evening and continued until the following evening, a reckoning presumably based on the Torah (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.1.14,19">Gn 1:14, 19</a>). That kind of literal solar (24-hour) day is known as a civil day. Among other ancient Near Eastern nations the civil day began at different times. Greek custom agreed with that of the Hebrews; the Babylonians started their day at sunrise; the Egyptian and Roman day stretched from one midnight to the next.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalDaysandWeeks">Biblical Days and Weeks</p>
<p class="fl">Commonly recognized units of the visible (12-hour) day were morning, noonday, and evening (<a href="?bref=Ps.55.17">Ps 55:17</a>). Those divisions were sometimes defined by terms for dawn (<a href="?bref=Job.3.9">Jb 3:9</a>), the heat of the day (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.11">1 Sm 11:11</a>), noon (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.16">Gn 43:16</a>), the cool of the day (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8">3:8</a>), and evening (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.17">Ru 2:17</a>). The Hebrew phrase “between the two evenings” (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.6">Ex 12:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span> mg) probably referred to dusk, the dark part of twilight (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.12">Ex 16:12</a>). Division of days into consecutive hours did not take place until the time of Christ. The closest OT approximation to such a unit was the division of the day into quarters (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.3">Neh 9:3</a>), perhaps a counterpart of the preexilic division of the night into watches.</p>
<p>The ancient Hebrews did not name the days of the week other than the Sabbath. Rather, they referred to them numerically, a practice carried over into NT times (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.1">Lk 24:1</a>). Because of the traditional Hebrew emphasis on the Sabbath, it was important for the Jews to know the exact time when the Sabbath began. The Pharisees therefore decided that the appearance of three stars following sunset would determine the Sabbath day’s beginning.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DaysofCreation">Days of Creation</p>
<p class="fl">Many people believe that the days mentioned in the Genesis Creation narrative were 24-hour periods. The phrase “there was evening, there was morning” is used to support that idea. That expression, however, is actually a Sumerian literary figure that pairs opposites together to describe totality. Thus “evening-morning” means a complete phase of time within the total creative cycle; it emphasizes the completeness or comprehensiveness of the process, not the specific period of time in which that process was accomplished. The totality of Creation, phase by phase, may have been thus depicted without any necessary reference to a defined time period.</p>
<p>Since the Sumerian civil day included only the visible (12-hour) period, a legal day of other nations was actually a “double day” (24 hours). If the early Genesis material reflects Sumerian culture, the use of “evening-morning” would preclude current concepts of a civil day and point instead to a phase or general time period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestament">Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT, “day” frequently has a figurative meaning—for example, the “day of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.15">Jl 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18">Am 5:18</a>), the “day of trouble” (<a href="?bref=Ps.20.1">Ps 20:1</a>), and the “day of God’s wrath” (<a href="?bref=Job.20.28">Jb 20:28</a>). The plural form is sometimes used to describe a king’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.21">1 Kgs 10:21</a>) or the extent of an individual’s life (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.4">Gn 5:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.14">1 Kgs 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.90.12">Ps 90:12</a>). God is described in the book of Daniel as the “Ancient of Days” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.9,13">Dn 7:9, 13</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.3">Gn 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>), which was reserved for rest and worship, “day” was applied to the Passover celebration each spring (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.14">Ex 12:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.5">Lv 23:5</a>) and the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.29-31">Lv 16:29-31</a>) each autumn. As with the Sabbath, no work was performed on those occasions; prescribed religious rituals were observed.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestament">New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT the use of “day” followed Semitic usage to some extent, although the four military night watches were of Greek and Roman origin. The 12-hour day of NT times was a legacy of Babylonian astronomy (cf. <a href="?bref=John.11.9">Jn 11:9</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to the literal usage of “day,” NT authors sometimes employed it figuratively, as in such expressions as the “day of salvation” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.2">2 Cor 6:2</a>) and the “day of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.6">Phil 1:6</a>). Or they described specified periods of time, as in the “days of his Temple duties” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.23">Lk 1:23</a>, <span class="sc">tlb</span>). Special feasts mentioned include the Passover (<a href="?bref=John.12.1">Jn 12:1</a>), the days of Unleavened Bread (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.3">Acts 12:3</a>), and the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1">2:1</a>).</p>
<p>As in the OT, the period of human life is described as days (<a href="?bref=John.9.4">Jn 9:4</a>). Christians are called “children of the light and of the day” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.5">1 Thes 5:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Longer periods or eras are referred to as days (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.2">2 Cor 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.16">Eph 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.13">6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.7">Heb 5:7</a>). The ominous note struck by the Hebrew prophets about a day of judgment is matched by NT stress on a day of final divine judgment when the Son of Man (Jesus) will reveal himself as Lord (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.30">Lk 17:30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.39-44">Jn 6:39-44</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.2">1 Thes 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.9">2 Pt 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.7,12">3:7, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.17">1 Jn 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.14">Rv 16:14</a>). The “day of eternity” marks that point at which time will become eternity (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.18">2 Pt 3:18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The new Jerusalem, dwelling place of God’s people, is described as a place of perpetual day (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.25">Rv 21:25</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">DAY OF THE LORD</p>
<p class="fl">Expression used by OT prophets (as early as the eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophet Amos) to signify a time in which God actively intervenes in history, primarily for judgment. Thus “the day of the Lord” is also called “the day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s anger” (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.2">Zep 2:2</a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes “the day of the Lord” is used in the OT to speak of a past judgment (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.22">Lam 2:22</a>). More often, an impending future judgment is in view (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.1-11">Jl 2:1-11</a>). Ultimately, though, the term refers to climactic future judgment of the world (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.14-21">Jl 3:14-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.5">Mal 4:5</a>). Often, prophecy of a near-future event and an end-time prophecy are merged—the immediate judgment being a preview of the final Day of the Lord. The prophecy of Isaiah against Babylon is an example (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.5-10">Is 13:5-10</a>). Jesus combined events described there with other prophecies to explain his second coming (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.24-37">Mk 13:24-37</a>). Another example is Joel’s prophecy of the Day of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.15-2.11">Jl 1:15–2:11</a>). Though the prophet initially spoke of God’s judgment on Israel by a locust plague, that judgment prompted further pronouncements about a final Day of the Lord far beyond Joel’s time (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.14-17,31">2:14-17, 31</a>). That Day of the Lord extended even beyond the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost predicted by Joel’s prophecy (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Jl 2:28-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.16-21">Acts 2:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.12-13">Rv 6:12-13</a>). The NT uses the term exclusively to mean the end time.</p>
<p>The final Day of the Lord is characterized in the Bible as a day of gloom, darkness, and judgment. Associated with God’s judgment is language depicting changes in nature, especially a darkening of the sun, moon, and stars (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.10">Is 13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.31">Jl 2:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.15">3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.29">Mt 24:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.12">Rv 6:12</a>). Nations will be judged for their rebellion against God’s anointed people and king (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.19">Jl 3:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Ps 2</a>). Israel is counseled not to be eager for that day, because it will also include judgment on the chosen nation (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-20">Am 5:18-20</a>). But the prophets promise that a believing “remnant” will be saved by looking to the Messiah they once rejected (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.32">Jl 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.10">Zec 12:10</a>). Following the judgment, the future Day of the Lord will be a time of prosperity, restoration, and blessing for Israel (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.18-21">Jl 3:18-21</a>).</p>
<p>The more explicit NT expressions—“the day of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.8">1 Cor 1:8</a>), “the day of the Lord Jesus” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.14">2 Cor 1:14</a>), and “the day of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.10">Phil 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.16">2:16</a>)—are more personal and more positive. They point to final events related to Christian believers, who will not experience the wrath of God (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.9">1 Thes 5:9</a>). When the Day of the Lord comes, the earth will be renewed and purified through a judgment of fire (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10-13">2 Pt 3:10-13</a>). In the book of Revelation the final purging seems to come after the Millennium—that is, the 1,000-year reign of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rv 21:1</a>).</p>

  <title>Deacon, Deaconess*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DEACON, DEACONESS*</p>
<p class="fl">Terms designating an officer in a local church, derived from a Greek word meaning “servant” or “minister.” The term “diaconate” is used for the office itself or for the collective body of deacons and deaconesses. As with many other biblical words used today in a technical sense, the words “deacon” and “deaconess” began as popular, nontechnical terms. Both in secular first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Greek culture and in the NT, they described a variety of services.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginsoftheConcept">Origins of the Concept</p>
<p class="h3">Greek Usage</p>
<p class="fl">References have been found in extrabiblical writings where the Greek word “deacon” meant “waiter,” “servant,” “steward,” or “messenger.” In at least two instances it indicated a baker and a cook. In religious usage the word described various attendants in pagan temples. Ancient documents show “deacons” presiding at the dedication of a statue to the Greek god Hermes. Serapis and Isis, Egyptian deities, were served by a college of “deacons” presided over by a priest.</p>
<p class="h3">General New Testament Usage</p>
<p class="fl">The same word was used by biblical writers in a general sense to describe various ministries or services. Not until later in the development of the apostolic church was the term applied to a distinct body of church officers. Among its general usages, “deacon” refers to a waiter at meals (<a href="?bref=John.2.5,9">Jn 2:5, 9</a>), a king’s attendant (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.13">Mt 22:13</a>), a servant of Satan (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.15">2 Cor 11:15</a>), a servant of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.4">6:4</a>), a servant of Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.23">11:23</a>), a servant of the church (<a href="?bref=Col.1.24-25">Col 1:24-25</a>), and a political ruler (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.4">Rom 13:4</a>).</p>
<p>The NT presents servanthood in the sense of ministry or service as a mark of the whole church—that is, as normative for all disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.26-28">Mt 20:26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.26-27">Lk 22:26-27</a>). Jesus’ teaching on the final judgment equates ministry with feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and imprisoned (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Mt 25:31-46</a>). The entire NT emphasizes compassionate care for individuals’ physical and spiritual needs as well as the giving of oneself to meeting those needs. Such service is ultimately a ministry to Christ himself (v <a href="?bref=Matt.25.45">45</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Origin of the Office</p>
<p class="fl">There is little question that before the end of the first century the general term for service or ministry became a kind of title for a position or office in the church. That development evidently went through several stages.</p>
<p>Some biblical scholars emphasize a relationship between the <span class="ital">hazzan</span> of the Jewish synagogue and the Christian office of deacon. The <span class="ital">hazzan</span> opened and closed the synagogue doors, kept it clean, and handed out the books for reading. It was probably to such a person that Jesus handed the scroll of Isaiah after finishing his reading (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.20">Lk 4:20</a>).</p>
<p>Other NT scholars give considerable attention to the choosing of the seven (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">Acts 6:1-6</a>); they see that action as a historical forerunner of a more developed structure (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Phil 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.8-13">1 Tm 3:8-13</a>—the two specific references to an “office” of deacon). Luke devoted considerable attention in Acts to the selection of a new set of church leaders. Overworked with a variety of responsibilities, the 12 apostles proposed a division of labor to ensure care for the Hellenist (Greek-speaking) widows in the church’s daily distribution of food and alms. Seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.3">Acts 6:3</a>), subsequently became prominent in the Jerusalem congregation, doing works of charity and caring for physical needs.</p>
<p>Some scholars caution that the diaconate should not be exclusively linked with charitable works, since the Greek word used in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.2">Acts 6:2</a> is related to the word translated “ministry of the word” in verse <a href="?bref=Acts.6.4">4</a>. Those chosen to oversee the care for physical needs were people of spiritual stature. Stephen, for instance, “full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs” (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.8">6:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Philip, appointed as one of the seven in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-15">Acts 6</a>, “preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.12">8:12</a>). Philip also baptized (v <a href="?bref=Acts.8.38">38</a>) and is referred to as an evangelist (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.8">21:8</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DeaconsintheEarlyChurch">Deacons in the Early Church</p>
<p class="fl">Those who cite <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-15">Acts 6</a> as a preliminary stage of the office of deacon refer to the spread of the practice from the church in Jerusalem to the gentile congregations sprouting elsewhere. Many churches probably took the appointing of “the Jerusalem seven” as a pattern to follow, some even adopting the number seven. In a letter of the third-century pope Cornelius, for example, the church of Rome was said to have maintained seven for the number of deacons.</p>
<p>By the time the church of Philippi received its instructions from the apostle Paul (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 62) and Timothy had Paul’s first letter in hand, “deacon” had become a technical term referring to a specific office in the churches. In <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Philippians 1:1</a> Paul addressed the church in general and then added “with bishops and deacons.” Some interpreters consider that to be a clear establishment of two distinct groups within the larger church body, though no further description is given. Possibly the deacons of that congregation were responsible for collecting and then dispatching the offerings referred to (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.14-18">Phil 4:14-18</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.8-13">1 Timothy 3:8-13</a> instructions are given about qualifications for the office of deacon. Although that is the most detailed treatment of the subject in the NT, it is actually quite sketchy. Most of the qualifications, dealing with personal character and behavior, are similar to those for a bishop. For instance, a deacon is to be truthful, monogamous, “not addicted to much wine,” and a responsible parent. Verse <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.11">11</a>, requiring that “the women likewise must be serious, not slanderers, but temperate, faithful in all things” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), may refer not to deacons’ wives but to deaconesses, as several translations note (<span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">neb</span>). In any event, it is clear that women participated in the work of the diaconate.</p>
<p>In contrast to the office of bishop (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.2">1 Tm 3:2</a>), deacons are not described as providing teaching or hospitality. In fact, no mention is made of any functional qualifications to clarify deacons’ or deaconesses’ roles in the early church. The character qualifications listed are appropriate for those with monetary and administrative responsibilities (as <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">Acts 6:1-6</a> suggests). Timothy is told that good deacons will not go unrewarded; not only will their faith increase, but also their good standing among those whom they serve (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.13">1 Tm 3:13</a>).</p>
<p>The NT writings indicate that to be chosen as a deacon or deaconess is a high compliment and affirmation. Named as “deacons” were Timothy (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.2">1 Thes 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.6">1 Tm 4:6</a>), Tychicus (<a href="?bref=Col.4.7">Col 4:7</a>), Epaphras (<a href="?bref=Col.1.7">1:7</a>), Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.5">1 Cor 3:5</a>)—and even Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.8">Rom 15:8</a>, “servant”). Biblical “deaconing” is not characterized by power and prominence but by service to others. In imitation of Jesus’ life, the deacon or deaconess followed the servant pattern. The Christian diaconate thus contrasted sharply with the prevailing Greek thought of service, which was considered unworthy of the dignity of free men. (The Greek philosopher Plato wrote, “How can man be happy when he has to serve someone?”)</p>
<p>The office of deacon differed from the office of elder, which was adapted from a definite Jewish pattern in the OT (see <a href="?bref=Num.11.16-17">Nm 11:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.29.10">Dt 29:10</a>). The diaconate, on the other hand, developed from the strong, personal, historical example of Jesus, the servant who compassionately met concrete human needs.</p>
<p>As the office of deacon became more firmly established, its duties could be defined as those of pastoral care. The poor and the sick received their service not only physically but also with instruction and consolation. The homes of church members became familiar territory to a deacon or deaconess. A pattern of visitation was established to discover and then meet the needs of the church body at large. Although that included the administration of funds, it went far beyond it. Those who served as deacons and deaconesses undoubtedly became symbols of loving care for the church in general.</p>
<p>Where the office of deacon fits into the larger pattern of church order within the NT is difficult to determine because of the obvious variety present during the formative years. Some church historians conclude that as ecclesiastical structure developed, elders provided congregational leadership. Deacons assisted them, especially in social services and pastoral care. The late first and early second centuries witnessed a distinctive threefold ministry of deacons, elders (presbyters), and bishops. Bishops or “overseers” began to exercise authority over areas or groups of churches.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Deaconess">Deaconess</p>
<p class="fl">Where did women fit into the ministry of the early church? Paul’s inclusion of references to women in ministry is striking when compared with the role of women in general in the first century. He commended Phoebe for her service in the church at Cenchrea, using the word “deacon” to describe her (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.1">Rom 16:1</a>). He praised her as a “helper” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.16.2">2</a>), a word that denotes leadership qualities (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.12.8">Rom 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.4-5">1 Tm 3:4-5</a>). Some scholars have used that reference as an example of early development of the office of deaconess. Others have interpreted it in a nontechnical sense, meaning that Phoebe functioned in a generally serving role and thus was worthy of recognition at Rome. Whether “deacon” was used technically or descriptively, ministry for both women and men in the NT was patterned after the example of Jesus, who “came not to be served but to serve” (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>). Because of the large number of female converts (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.14">Acts 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.4">17:4</a>), women functioned in such areas of ministry as visitation, instruction in discipleship, and assistance in baptism. Deaconesses are mentioned in third-century documents as administering baptism to female converts.</p>
<p>Considering the rigid separation of the sexes in the Near East at that time, female participation in church ministry stands out in bold relief. A governor of Bithynia, Pliny the Younger (early second century), in his <span class="ital">Correspondence with Trajan</span> verified women officeholders in the church. Pliny also mentioned two deaconesses who were martyred for the cause of Christ.</p>

<p class="h1">DEAD, Place of the</p>
<p class="fl">Term covering a number of descriptive biblical images of the whereabouts of those who have died. Those images include Sheol and “the pit” in the OT, plus hades, Gehenna, paradise, and “Abraham’s bosom” in the NT. As their understanding advanced, the Hebrews’ idea of what happens at death changed from rather hazy beginnings to a developed concept found in the NT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The OT contains meager information about the dead. At death, according to some OT passages, one descends to Sheol (often translated as “grave,” “hell,” “pit,” or simply “the dead”), which at times means merely that one is laid in a grave (<a href="?bref=Num.16.30,33">Nm 16:30, 33</a>), but more often indicates an underworld. The abode of the dead is pictured as a place beneath the earth to which one “goes down” (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.38">Gn 42:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.24">Prv 15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.26.20">Ez 26:20</a>) and as a place of gloomy darkness (<a href="?bref=Job.10.21-22">Jb 10:21-22</a>), silence (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.17">Pss 94:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.17">115:17</a>), and forgetfulness (<a href="?bref=Ps.88.12">Ps 88:12</a>). God is not remembered there and his praises are never sung (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.5">Pss 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.30.9">30:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.17">115:17</a>). Even God himself, it was believed, does not remember those who are there (<a href="?bref=Ps.88.5,11">Ps 88:5, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.18">Is 38:18</a>). The dead were seen as permanently cut off from contact with the Lord and from participating in his activity in history. Even though the border between life and death was considered fluid (as shown by a resurrection in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.32-37">2 Kgs 4:32-37</a> and by Samuel’s ghost in <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.7-25">1 Sm 28:7-25</a>), communication with the dead was forbidden to the Jews (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.11">Dt 18:11</a>). (Worshiping the dead was a common practice in the nations surrounding Israel.)</p>
<p>Although one’s fate in the underworld could not properly be called life, it was a kind of existence, perhaps even in the company of one’s countrymen and ancestors (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.8">Gn 25:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.17-30">Ez 32:17-30</a>). The realm of the dead was not beyond the reach of God’s power (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.8">Ps 139:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.2">Am 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.2.2">Jon 2:2</a>). Although Sheol was pictured as a hungry monster wolfing down the living (<a href="?bref=Pr.27.20">Prv 27:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.16">30:16</a>), God’s power could save one from its grasp (<a href="?bref=Ps.49.15">Pss 49:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.13">86:13</a>). By the end of the OT period, there was even hope that one would finally be delivered from Sheol (<a href="?bref=Job.14.13-22">Jb 14:13-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">19:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.49.15">Pss 49:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.23-28">73:23-28</a>), although only Daniel expressed that hope clearly (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.1-2">Dn 12:1-2</a>). So although the ancient Hebrews never looked forward to death in the same way that the apostle Paul could in the NT (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-8">2 Cor 5:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.21-23">Phil 1:21-23</a>), nevertheless they did come to understand that death was not a hopeless state.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheIntertestamentalWritings">In the Intertestamental Writings</p>
<p class="fl">Between the exile and the beginning of the NT period (586 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 30, overlapping with the end of the OT), contact with the religions of Persia and Greece stimulated the Jews to clarify their ideas about life after death. When the OT was translated into Greek, the Greek name for the underworld, “hades,” was used to translate the Hebrew “Sheol.” In the NT, hades was carried over to become the common name for the abode of the dead.</p>
<p>Along with new names came new ideas. Many different notions circulated about the place of the dead. A common one appears in the pseudepigraphal 1 Enoch 22, where the dead are said to be kept in hollow places in a great mountain waiting for the final judgment. One relatively pleasant section was reserved for the righteous and one full of torments for the wicked. Other writers continued the OT concept of hades or Sheol as a place of separation from God and from happiness (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.14.12,16">Ecclus 14:12, 16</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.17.27-28">17:27-28</a>).</p>
<p>During that period, the Jews also began to use a new term, “Gehenna” (Hebrew “Hinnom”), the name of a valley south of Jerusalem. The valley was noted in the OT period for the abomination of child sacrifices (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.3">2 Kgs 16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.6">21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">23:10</a>) and in the NT period for its smoldering garbage. Gehenna became a designation for the final place of the wicked dead, a place of fiery torment (1 Enoch 90:20-27; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.7.70">2 Esd 7:70</a>). Over against that place of punishment stood “paradise” (a Persian name for a pleasure garden), a place where the righteous would enjoy blessedness.</p>
<p>All those concepts—hades, Gehenna, paradise—were molded by NT writers into forms most appropriate to the revelation of Christ.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Although the NT uses a variety of terms for the abode of the dead, it contains surprisingly few references to it—about 35 verses in all. Those passages are concentrated in the Gospels and the book of Revelation. The apostle Paul said a lot about heaven, but only Jesus and John said much about hell.</p>
<p>The word “hades” is attributed to Jesus only once, in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.23">Lk 16:23</a>). In that parable hades is a place of torment where the wicked go at death. The torment is described as a “flame” that afflicts a person physically despite bodily death. All comfort is refused to those in agony.</p>
<p>Although the wicked go to hades as soon as they die, their ultimate destination is Gehenna, a place of fire and worms, both indicating corruption (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22,29-30">Mt 5:22, 29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.9">18:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.48">Mk 9:48</a>, quoting from <a href="?bref=Isa.66.24">Is 66:24</a>). Jesus also referred to Gehenna as “the outer darkness” where there will be “weeping and gnashing of teeth” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.12">Mt 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.13">22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.30">25:30</a>). Evidently, after the final judgment, the wicked are sent there at the command of Christ (<a href="?bref=John.5.22,27">Jn 5:22, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.42">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">17:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1">2 Tm 4:1</a>). That place of torment picks up the negative side of the OT concept of Sheol as a place of separation from God.</p>
<p>As a preacher of repentance, Jesus stressed the danger of Gehenna. He had much less to say about the place of the righteous when they die. Ultimately, though, the righteous would enter into “the kingdom,” instead of Gehenna, after the last judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.34">Mt 25:34</a>). Jesus twice indicated that the righteous enter a blessed state immediately at death. <a href="?bref=Luke.16.22">Luke 16:22</a> refers to the dead Lazarus as being in “Abraham’s bosom,” a place of comfort and peace. <a href="?bref=Luke.23.43">Luke 23:43</a> calls the same place paradise in a promise that the dying thief would join Jesus there at death. Paul’s wording about paradise seems to align it with heaven (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.2-3">2 Cor 12:2-3</a>), and John associates paradise with the new heaven and new earth (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.7">Rv 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-2">21:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-2">22:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>Paul and other writers of the NT epistles had little to say about the abode of the wicked dead. Paul spoke only in passing of “the abyss”—his term for the pit of Sheol (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.7">Rom 10:7</a>). His reference to Christ’s descent to the “lower parts of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.9">Eph 4:9</a>) is probably only his way of saying that Christ, having died, went to the place of the dead. (“The lowest earth” was a term used by Jewish rabbis for Sheol/hades/Gehenna.) Peter spoke of Christ’s going in “spirit” after his death to some “prison” where he “preached to the spirits” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-20">1 Pt 3:18-20</a>). Interpretations of that passage differ. Some think that Christ entered hades and preached to the fallen angels of Noah’s day (“sons of God,” <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Gn 6:1-4</a>), not that he preached to imprisoned human spirits. In <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a> the prison for spirits (usually translated “hell”) comes from “Tartarus,” another Greek name for the underworld.</p>
<p>Paul had much to say about the abode of the righteous dead. In his earliest letters he never mentioned their location, only that they would be resurrected (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">1 Cor 15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-17">1 Thes 4:13-17</a>). After facing almost certain death himself (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8-11">2 Cor 1:8-11</a>), he began to discuss where the dead “went.” To die means to be with Christ, Paul said, and thus is better than life (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>). To be “away from the body” is to be “at home with the Lord” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.8">2 Cor 5:8</a>). Paul probably meant that the righteous dead went directly to paradise to be with Jesus (cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.2-4">2 Cor 12:2-4</a>, where Paul called paradise “the third heaven”). Death has absolutely no power to separate Christians from Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.38-39">Rom 8:38-39</a>). Instead, it brings them into the presence of God.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation contains much about the abode of the dead, especially the wicked dead. It uses two names for that place: “the abyss,” the home or prison of all evil spirits; and “hades,” the name for the place of the human dead. From the abyss (or bottomless pit) come the demonic forms that torment humanity (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1-11">Rv 9:1-11</a>) and the satanic “beast,” who kills the two witnesses and carries the “great prostitute” on its back (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.7">11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.1-18">17</a>). There Satan himself will be imprisoned (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.2-3">20:2-3</a>). Jesus described it as a place prepared for the devil and his angels (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>). The good news for Christians is that the abyss, or hades, is not an autonomous realm. The book of Revelation begins with Jesus’ announcement that he has the keys to hades (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.18">Rv 1:18</a>), and in the end he will force it to give up its dead (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.13">20:13</a>). Until then, the key to the abyss is not in the hand of Satan, but hangs on a heavenly key ring to be distributed only to the messengers of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1">9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1">20:1</a>). In the end, hades, death, and the wicked will be cast into the lake of fire (Gehenna), where they will suffer eternal torment (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.20">19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10,14-15">20:10, 14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">21:8</a>).</p>
<p>John, the writer of the Revelation, agreed with Paul that the righteous will not share the fate of the wicked at death. Instead of going to hades, they go to heaven. The martyrs appear under the altar, calling to God to avenge them (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.9-11">Rv 6:9-11</a>). In another image innumerable Christians appear before the throne of God, praising him (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.9-17">7:9-17</a>). Those believers, shepherded by Christ himself, suffer no hunger, thirst, discomfort, or sorrow.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">In summary, the place of the dead began in the OT as an undifferentiated, hazy idea of a place of separation from life and God. Later writers came to see that instead of one place for all (Sheol), there must be two. According to Christian teaching, the wicked enter the underworld, hades, a place of torment, where they suffer until the time of judgment; ultimately they will be cast into Gehenna, the lake of fire. Christ—not the devil—is in control of hades, as he is of the rest of creation. The righteous do not go to hades, but go directly to paradise (“Abraham’s bosom” or heaven). There they are with Christ; faith has become sight, suffering has become blessedness, and prayer has become praise. Christians believe that death, although fearful as the “last enemy,” has no torment for them. It has no power to separate them from their Lord. Rather, it brings them face-to-face with the One they love.</p>
<p>This meeting may occur as soon as one dies or as soon as one is resurrected—the intervening time is of no consequence, because it is nothing more than just a time of sleep. In other words, the very next experience after death for the believer will be that of meeting Christ.</p>
<p>Both Old and New Testaments speak of death as sleep. Commonly in the OT, when a person dies, he is said to go to sleep with his fathers (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.31.16">Dt 31:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.12">2 Sm 7:12</a>). Jesus himself spoke of death as sleep (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.24">Mt 9:24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.11">Jn 11:11</a>). So did the apostle Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.30">1 Cor 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20,51">15:20, 51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.14">1 Thes 4:14</a>). At least in some of these references it would seem that it is the temporary nature of death that is the reason why it is spoken of as sleep. Even in the OT passage <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Daniel 12:2</a>, it is said that death is a sleep, until the dead rise up—some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p>

<p class="h1">DEAD SEA</p>
<p class="fl">A large saltwater lake into which the river Jordan empties. Since the Greek era, Western civilization has referred to this mysterious body of water as the “Dead Sea.” However, the frequent OT term for this sea is the “Salt Sea” (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.3">Gn 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.34.3,12">Nm 34:3, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.17">Dt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.3.16">Jos 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.15.2,5">15:2, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.19">18:19</a>), the name deriving from that most important and valuable commodity traded in antiquity. It is also designated the Sea of the Arabah (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.17">Dt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.49">4:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.3.16">Jos 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">2 Kgs 14:25</a>) and the Eastern Sea (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.18">Ez 47:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.20">Jl 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.8">Zec 14:8</a>). Apocryphal, classical, and Talmudic authors make reference to the Sea of Sodom, Sea of Asphalt, and Sea of Lot. The NT makes no reference at all to the sea.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfTheDeadSea"/>
<p>The sea lies in the great trough of the Jordan Valley, known also as the Rift Valley. This valley forms part of the longest and deepest crack in the earth’s crust, extending from the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey, through Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, the Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea, and East Africa to Mozambique (there called the Great African Rift Valley). The chasm measures between 2 to 15 miles (3.2 to 24.1 kilometers) wide, and in its deepest spot, along the shoreline of the Dead Sea, it plummets to about 1,300 feet (396 meters) below sea level, marking this as the lowest area on the earth not covered by water. The sea itself is oblong in shape, measuring approximately 53 miles (85 kilometers) from the mouth of the Jordan River in the north to the Sebhka region in the south, and some 10 miles (16 kilometers) in width, enclosed on both sides by steep, rocky cliffs. It is divided into two basins by the eight and a half mile (13.7 kilometer) Lisan Peninsula, which juts out from the eastern shore. The northern basin is larger, and at its deepest point (in the northeast sector), has a water depth of about 1,300 feet (396 meters). The southern basin is flatter, and its water depth ranges between 3 and 30 feet (1 and 9 meters).</p>
<p>The forces of nature seem to have conspired against the Dead Sea. Fed by the Jordan River, four or five perennial streams, and numerous wadis (an average daily inflow totaling some 7 million tons, or 6.4 million metric tons), the sea possesses no outlet for this water except evaporation. This condition, coupled with aridity (with an average annual precipitation of from 2 to 5 inches, or 5 to 13 centimeters) and enormous heat (with the mercury sometimes soaring as high as 125 degrees Fahrenheit, or 52 degrees Celsius, in the summer), quite often creates an extremely high rate of evaporation and dense haze virtually impenetrable to human eyesight. Most of the streams that feed the Dead Sea are unusually saline, flowing through nitrous soil and sulphurous springs. At the same time, springs under the waters of the sea pump chemicals (especially bromine, magnesium, and calcium) into the sea. And along its shores are extensive sulphur deposits and petroleum springs. In the southeast corner there is a 300-foot-thick (91.4-meter-thick) rock-salt ridge, which is only the tip of an estimated 4,500-foot (1,371-meter) salt plug stretching some 5 miles (8 kilometers). Finally, the bed of the sea contains salt crystals. All these factors combine to produce a total salinity of approximately 26 percent, compared to the average ocean salinity of 3.5 percent. This makes the Dead Sea the earth’s most saline water body, completely devoid of marine life, with an ever-increasing solidity.</p>
<p>In ancient times the Dead Sea was valued for its salt and bitumen (a commodity prized for waterproofing properties, consisting of petroleum hardened by evaporation and oxidation). During the NT era, the Dead Sea bitumen trade was apparently controlled by the Nabateans, who also exported the product to Egypt for use in embalming. It has been suggested that Cleopatra’s desire to govern the Dead Sea region was stimulated by her desire to regulate the bitumen trade.</p>
<p>The ominous desolation and barrenness of the Dead Sea apparent to the gaze of the modern onlooker is also reflected in the pages of history. The events of <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">Genesis 19</a>, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, transpired in this vicinity. Mt Sedom, the salt plug located at the southeast corner of the sea, obviously reflects the name Sodom. The archaeologist Nelson Glueck affirms that the region surrounding Sedom was occupied by as many as 70 towns dating back to about 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. The exact nature of the destruction rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah is variously interpreted either as a volcanic eruption or as the spontaneous explosion of subsurface pockets of bituminous soil. Karstic salt pillars, known as “Lot’s wife,” are a frequent phenomenon in this locality.</p>
<p>The howling wilderness that surrounds the sea provided a suitable refuge for the fugitive David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.29-24.29">1 Sm 23:29–24:1ff</a>.), the contemplative company of Qumran Essenes, and the disenfranchised Jewish insurgents of the second Jewish rebellion. On the other hand, Ezekiel envisioned (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1-12">Ez 47:1-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Zech.14.8">Zec 14:8</a>) a time when even the briny waters of the Dead Sea would be recreated afresh and the stark, lifeless character of the sea would issue forth in life.</p>

<p class="h1">DEAF, DEAFNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Inability to hear; term used in Scripture to describe both a literal, physical inability and a figurative, spiritual defect. The spiritually deaf were those who either refused to hear the divine message or were rendered incapable because of their lack of spirituality (<a href="?bref=Ps.38.13">Ps 38:13</a>). The prophet Isaiah forcefully addressed both types of deaf persons (the figurative in <a href="?bref=Isa.42.18">Is 42:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.8">43:8</a>; the literal in <a href="?bref=Isa.29.18">Is 29:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.5">35:5</a>). In the OT, although the condition was considered the result of God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.11">Ex 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.16">Mi 7:16</a>), it was wrong to curse a deaf person (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.14">Lv 19:14</a>). In the NT the deaf were among those Jesus healed (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">Mt 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.32-37">Mk 7:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.22">Lk 7:22</a>). An epileptic boy whom Jesus healed was afflicted with a “dumb and deaf spirit” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.25">Mk 9:25</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Such healings authenticated Jesus’ role as Messiah.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DEATH</p>
<p class="fl">Cessation of life (physical death) or separation from God (spiritual death).</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentView">Old Testament View</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT death was accepted as the natural end of life. The goal of an Israelite was to live a long and full life, produce many descendants, and die in peace with the children and grandchildren gathered about. The OT contains many protests against an early death (e.g., Hezekiah’s, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.1-11">2 Kgs 20:1-11</a>). An early death might appear to be the result of God’s judgment; hence, Job saw the need to vindicate his character prior to death (<a href="?bref=Job.19.25-26">Jb 19:25-26</a>). Only in <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.19-20">Ecclesiastes 3:19-20</a> is outright pessimism expressed in the face of death—and that book probably shows considerable non-Hebraic influence.</p>
<p>Death, although a natural ending to life, was never viewed as pleasant. Death cut one off from human community as well as from the presence and service of God. God may offer comfort in the face of death (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.23-28">Ps 73:23-28</a>), but he is rarely portrayed as present with the dead, and that only in later biblical literature (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.8">Ps 139:8</a>). For that reason, death was never viewed as the threshold to a better life.</p>
<p>The relationship of sin to death is seen in the death penalty in the law of Moses. A serious offender was put to death. The punitive phrase “he shall be cut off” implied that although the nation went on living, the criminal was separated from it by death. The Israelites were warned that to disobey God’s commandments could bring premature death as a consequence of breaking fellowship with God (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.15-20">Dt 30:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.21.8">Jer 21:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.21-32">Ez 18:21-32</a>).</p>
<p>In the intertestamental period, as Jewish ideas of afterlife and resurrection developed more explicitly, so too did Jewish thinking about death. Death itself, not just a premature death, came to be seen as an evil result of sin (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.3.7">2 Esd 3:7</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.25.24">Ecclus 25:24</a>). Sometimes all death is depicted as the result of the “first sin” (Adam and Eve’s disobedience). In other references, everyone dies as a result of his or her own sin. The first clear indication in Scripture of a resurrection of the dead and a final judgment or punishment occurs in the book of Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Dn 12:2</a>), one of the last OT books to be written. That teaching is echoed throughout the intertestamental period (2 Esd 7:31-44). During that time, it was believed that the soul survived death either in some immortal form (Wisd of Sol 3:4; 4:1; 4 Macc 16:13; 17:12) or awaiting the resurrection (1 Enoch 102). Some of those extrabiblical writings incorporated Greek ideas that the body was a burden to be gotten rid of—a notion foreign to Hebrew thought.</p>
<p>The concept of resurrection and a life redeemed from death, however, set the stage for the NT revelation focusing on Christ’s resurrection and his conquest of death.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentView">New Testament View</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT, death is seen more as a theological problem than as a personal event. Death goes beyond the simple ending of physical life, which the authors accept almost without difficulty. Death is seen as affecting every part of a person’s life. God alone is immortal, the source of all life in the world (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.17">Rom 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.16">1 Tm 6:16</a>). Only as human beings are properly related to God’s life can they live. But it has been unnatural for people to be in personal communion with the divine source of life since sin was introduced into the world (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12,17-18">Rom 5:12, 17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.22">1 Cor 15:22</a>). When Adam separated himself from God, that separation brought death. Each human being has followed in Adam’s footsteps (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">Rom 3:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.12">5:12</a>), bringing death for everyone as the absolutely necessary result (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.23">Rom 6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.27">Heb 9:27</a>). Death, then, is not merely something that happens to people at the end of their lives; it is also the living out of their lives apart from fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The extent of death’s domination is vast. It affects every aspect of culture. All of human life is lived under the shadow of the fear of death (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.15">Rom 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.15">Heb 2:15</a>). Death reigns over all that is “of the flesh” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.6">Rom 8:6</a>). Anyone not living in relationship to Christ lives in a state of death (<a href="?bref=John.3.16-18">Jn 3:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.12">1 Jn 5:12</a>). The devil, who rules the world, is the lord of death (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.14">Heb 2:14</a>). Death is sometimes personified as a demonic power at large in the world but finally brought to bay by Christ himself, the only one who could master it (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.26-27">1 Cor 15:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.8">Rv 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.13-14">20:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>Christ died, was buried, and rose again on the third day (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3-4">1 Cor 15:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.14">1 Thes 4:14</a>). Through that historic event, the power of death was broken. The NT in various ways expresses Christ’s subjection to death in payment for sin. He became obedient to death (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.8">Phil 2:8</a>); he died as a sacrifice for the sins of all (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.15">2 Cor 5:15</a>); and he descended into hades, the place of the dead (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-19">1 Pt 3:18-19</a>). The major point of all such passages is that he did not remain dead but defeated the devil, took the power (keys) of death, and ascended in victory (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.14-15">Heb 2:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.17-18">Rv 1:17-18</a>). Jesus Christ worked not for his own benefit but for those who commit themselves to him (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.6-8">Rom 5:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.9-10">1 Thes 5:9-10</a>). By accepting a death he did not deserve, Christ has broken the power of death for his followers.</p>
<p>The Christian is thus delivered from “this body of death” (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.24">Rom 7:24</a>) by the power of Christ. Salvation comes through being baptized into Christ’s death (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.3-4">6:3-4</a>), and “dying with Christ” to the world and the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.6">Rom 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.14">Gal 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.20">Col 2:20</a>). That is, the death of Christ is counted by God as the believer’s death. The rebellious world’s sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.6">Rom 6:6</a>) and self-idolatry (living for oneself, <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14-15">2 Cor 5:14-15</a>) become things of the past. The death of Jesus for his people is the means by which his life is given to them (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.10">4:10</a>). The result is that believers are separated from the world just as they were once separated from God. From the world’s point of view, they are dead; Christ is their only life (<a href="?bref=Col.3.3">Col 3:3</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle John expressed it somewhat differently. Jesus came into the world to give life to the dead (<a href="?bref=John.5.24">Jn 5:24</a>). That life-giving will not happen at the resurrection; it is already happening. All who commit themselves to Jesus pass immediately from death to life. Or, to put it another way, those who keep (obey) his words will never see death (<a href="?bref=John.8.51-52">8:51-52</a>). The point is that all who are outside Christ are already dead, and those trusting in Christ are already enjoying life. The radical difference between the Christian and the non-Christian is a difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Naturally, the NT writers knew that Christians die; their problem was to find words to explain the difference from non-Christian death. Believers who die physically are said to be “dead in Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.16">1 Thes 4:16</a>). Or they are not dead at all, but merely “asleep” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.6,18,20,51">1 Cor 15:6, 18, 20, 51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-15">1 Thes 4:13-15</a>; cf. Jesus’ words, <a href="?bref=John.11.11-14">Jn 11:11-14</a>). Although their bodies are dead, deceased believers are not separated from Christ; that is, they are not really dead. All the powers of death and hell cannot separate believers from Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.38-39">Rom 8:38-39</a>). For them, death is not a loss but a gain; it brings them closer to Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-10">2 Cor 5:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.20-21">Phil 1:20-21</a>). What is more, believers will share in Christ’s victory over physical death as well. Because he is the “firstfruits” of those rising from the dead (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20">1 Cor 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>), those “in Christ” will rise “on the last day” to be with him, whole and complete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for those who do not belong to Christ, there is a final, total separation from God. At the last judgment, all whose names are not “written in the Book of Life” are consigned to a lake of fire, in the company of death itself and hades. That final separation from God is the “second death” (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.14">Rv 20:14</a>). Christians, however, have been saved from death (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.20">Jas 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.14">1 Jn 3:14</a>). The second death has no power over those who are faithful to Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.11">Rv 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.6">20:6</a>). Instead, they will live with God, in whose presence there can be no death, for he is life itself (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.4">21:4</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Term used in the NT only in the book of Revelation, to describe God’s eternal judgment on sin. Originally a rabbinic expression, the second death will be experienced by those whose names are not written in the “Book of Life” (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.15">Rv 20:15</a>). The second death is equated with the “lake of fire” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.20.14">14</a>), or the lake that burns with “fire and brimstone” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">21:8</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), and is described as the lot of “the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, . . . murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).

There are two accounts of the conquest of Debir (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.38-39">10:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.15.13-17">15:13-17</a>). One of these lists Joshua as the conqueror, and the other lists Othniel as the conqueror (by request of Caleb). It is possible that the Othniel account is simply a further elaboration of the Joshua account, or it is possible that Debir was retaken by the Canaanites and the Othniel-Caleb account tells of the subsequent recapture by the Israelites. The latter explanation, however, does not seem to accord well with the apparent finality of the Joshua account. Thus, it would seem that the former explanation is more probable.</p>
<p class="list-text">Debir, with its pasturelands, was finally given to the priestly descendants of the Aaronites (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.15">Jos 21:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.58">1 Chr 6:58</a>). This might seem fitting, since prior to its capture by the Israelites, Debir was known for its pagan temple. Debir was also known as Kiriath-sannah, meaning “city of the scribes” (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.49">Jos 15:49</a>), and Kiriath-sepher, meaning “city of the books” (v <a href="?bref=Josh.15.15">15</a>). Its exact location is disputed among scholars, but most likely it was located near Khirbet Rabud in the southern Judean hill country.</p>

<p class="h1">DEBORAH</p>
<p class="fl">Name of two OT women. The word in Hebrew means “honeybee” (<a href="?bref=Ps.118.12">Ps 118:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.18">Is 7:18</a>).</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Rebekah’s nurse (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.8">Gn 35:8</a>). Deborah died as she was traveling to Bethel with her master Jacob’s household. She was buried in a spot remembered as Allon-bacuth (“the oak of weeping”), indicating that she had been well loved. She was probably Rebekah’s longtime companion (see <a href="?bref=Gen.24.59-61">24:59-61</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Prophetess and judge (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">Jgs 4–5</a>). Deborah’s position as a prophetess, indicating that her message was from God, is not unique in the Bible, but it was unusual. Other prophetesses included Miriam (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>), Huldah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.14">2 Kgs 22:14</a>), and Anna (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.36">Lk 2:36</a>). Deborah was unique in that only she is said to have “judged Israel” <span class="ital">before</span> the major event that marks her narrative (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.4">Jgs 4:4</a>). Her husband, Lappidoth, is otherwise unknown.</p>
<p class="list-text">Deborah, heralded as a “mother in Israel” (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.7">Jgs 5:7</a>), remained in one location and the people came to her for guidance. Evidently over 200 years later, when the book of Judges was compiled, a giant palm tree still marked the spot. Though residing within the boundary of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.5">Jgs 4:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.16.2">Jos 16:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.13">18:13</a>), Deborah was probably from the tribe of Ephraim, the most prominent tribe of northern Israel. Some scholars, however, place her in the tribe of Issachar (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.14-15">Jgs 5:14-15</a>). At that early time, the tribes were loosely organized and did not always occupy the territory they had been allotted.</p>
<p class="list-text">Under Deborah’s inspired leadership, the poorly equipped Israelites defeated the Canaanites in the plain of Esdraelon (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.15">Jgs 4:15</a>); flooding of the Kishon River evidently interfered with the enemy’s impressive chariotry (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.21-22">5:21-22</a>). The Canaanites retreated to the north, perhaps to Taanach near Megiddo (v <a href="?bref=Judg.5.19">19</a>), and never reappeared as an enemy within Israel. The Song of Deborah (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">5</a>) is a poetic version of the prose narrative in <a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-24">Judges 4</a>.</p>

  <title>Deborah, Song of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DEBORAH, Song of</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient poem found in <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Judges 5</a>, celebrating an Israelite victory over the Canaanites. Similar to Moses’ song (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-18">Ex 15:1-18</a>), and paralleling a prose account in <a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-24">Judges 4</a>, the Song of Deborah describes the miraculous defeat of a powerful Canaanite king, Jabin of Hazor, and of Sisera, his general. The song’s poetic style and occasional use of archaic Hebrew forms are reflected in slightly differing translations in modern versions of the Bible. The poem’s vigorous language suggests that it was composed by an eyewitness of the battle, probably Deborah herself.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Judg.5.2">Judges 5:2</a> addresses Israel with an exhortation to praise the Lord. A second exclamation exhorts foreign kings to learn of Israel’s God and his exploits. It is not clear whether verses <a href="?bref=Judg.5.4-5">4-5</a> describe the present battle or refer to God’s previous appearance to Moses at Mt Sinai. Verse <a href="?bref=Judg.5.5">5</a> could be translated, “The mountains quaked at the presence of the One of Sinai.”</p>
<p>Deborah is first introduced in verse <a href="?bref=Judg.5.7">7</a>. Verse <a href="?bref=Judg.5.8">8</a> could mean either that Canaanite oppression prevented open displays of Israelite weaponry or, more likely, that the Canaanites had wiped out all weapon-making industry in Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19">1 Sm 13:19</a>). In an atmosphere of fear, indecision, and isolationism, Deborah, a judge, urged the Israelite tribes to battle. When Deborah appealed to the whole nation for help, some tribes were apathetic, but others gave assistance. The battle took place at Taanach, 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) southwest of Mt Tabor. The Canaanites had mobilized in that vicinity (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.13">Jgs 4:13</a>), so the Israelites lost whatever advantage their mountain position would have afforded. Deborah’s song, however, implies the Lord’s intervention, perhaps through a severe storm. Divine aid is also alluded to in <a href="?bref=Judg.4.14">Judges 4:14</a> (“for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is marching ahead of you,” <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The stars that fought Sisera and the flooding of the river Kishon represent the forces of nature helping Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.20-21">5:20-21</a>). In addition, any advantage of the Canaanites’ chariotry was nullified after Jael, a heroic Hebrew woman, killed Sisera, the chariot leader (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.24-27">24-27</a>). Sisera’s death fulfilled Deborah’s prophecy to the Israelite commander, Barak, that a woman, not he, would receive glory for that feat (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.9">4:9</a>).</p>
<p>Sisera’s mother is seen pathetically awaiting his return. In contrast to the sardonic portrayal of that Canaanite woman, the last words of Deborah’s song are a fervent prayer for future safety. Although Jael was blessed (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.24">Jgs 5:24</a>) and Deborah acclaimed, the God of Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-3">1-3</a>) received the glory.</p>

  <title>Debt</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DEBT</p>
<p class="fl">Something owed to another person, such as goods, property, or money. In the Bible, righteous conduct is something one “owes” to God; hence, in theology, sin is described figuratively as being “in debt.”</p>
<p>In Hebrew culture, debt was usually connected with usury (the business of lending money on interest). The Hebrew verbs describing usury picture a painful situation. One word for usury means “to bite,” a vivid image for the way high interest “ate up” any kind of business transaction so that borrowers never received the full value of the money. People could be ruined financially by heartless exaction of interest (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1-7">2 Kgs 4:1-7</a>). Another verb is usually translated as “increase” or “profit” (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.37">Lv 25:37</a>), since lenders profited from others’ labor. Ancient Near Eastern interest rates on produce and goods might be as much as 30 percent of the loan per year; on money, as much as 20 percent. Clay tablets from Nuzi, an ancient town in northeastern Mesopotamia, indicate interest rates of even 50 percent.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLawofMoses">The Law of Moses</p>
<p class="fl">The Mosaic covenant given to Israel immediately after the exodus sought to eliminate extortionist practices from Hebrew life. Thus God’s revelation had many rules and restrictions relating to debt and credit in Israel.</p>
<p class="h3">Protection for the Poor</p>
<p class="fl">Portions of the legislative sections of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) regulated the practice of lending in a way that protected the poor and secured each person’s right to earn a living and support a family. Many popular Hebrew proverbs dealt with that theme. The positive thrust of the biblical laws was to ensure help for the financially needy, without interest. No personal profit was to be made at the expense of the poor (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.25">Ex 22:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.23.19-20">Dt 23:19-20</a>); God was their special advocate. Thus, by lending without interest, the Israelites could demonstrate their reverence for God (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.35-37">Lv 25:35-37</a>).</p>
<p>That point was reemphasized 40 years later when Moses renewed the covenant with Israel just before their entrance into the Promised Land. God was the landlord, and his tenants were to respect his word. God promised the Israelites that if they would lend so as to alleviate human misery, they would be unusually blessed by the Lord (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.6">Dt 15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.23.19-20">23:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.12">28:12</a>). Interest could be charged to a foreigner not living under the Mosaic law, which was a condition parallel to commercial treaties prevalent in the ancient Near East.</p>
<p>In ancient Israel, financial ruin was frequently brought about by poor harvests. Often they were taken as an indication that the relationship between God and his people was not right (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.14,20">Lv 26:14, 20</a>). The wealthy were expected to help, not to add more burdens to those who suffered from poor harvests.</p>
<p class="h3">Violation of the Law</p>
<p class="fl">The law was so often violated that eventually exorbitant interest became a social plague, making the situation of debtors hopeless. Many of the fighting men who rallied around David early in his military career were “outlaws” unable to repay their loans and interest (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.2">1 Sm 22:2</a>). The prophet Ezekiel called people to task for their failure to observe God’s commands about usury (<a href="?bref=Ezek.18.5-18">Ez 18:5-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.12">22:12</a>). When Nehemiah returned from the exile to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, he brought charges against the government officials whose interest rates had enslaved the people (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.6-13">Neh 5:6-13</a>).</p>
<p>The Wisdom Literature, which included Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes, added that those who acquired riches by usury would not profit in the long run, because God would give their profits to others who looked after the welfare of the poor (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.28.8">Prv 28:8</a>). The prophet Amos gave a similar warning to corrupt merchants in Israel: “Because you trample upon the poor and take from him exactions of wheat, . . . you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink their wine” (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.11">Am 5:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In spite of such warnings, the law was often ignored, and burdensome interest charges were laid on borrowers who were already poor.</p>
<p class="h3">Pledges and Surety</p>
<p class="fl">When it was necessary to borrow, the law provided alternatives to the unfair practice of usury. When taking out a loan, a borrower would surrender some movable property as collateral to ensure repayment. That “pledge” represented a tangible sign of the debtor’s intention to repay the loan. Certain restrictions applied to such pledges. For example, a creditor could not take a widow’s clothes (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.17">Dt 24:17</a>). Tools (such as millstones) or animals (such as oxen) necessary for daily life were forbidden as pledges (v <a href="?bref=Deut.24.6">6</a>). Clothing absolutely essential to the borrower (e.g., to keep warm) could be temporarily offered as a pledge, but the temporary token had to be returned before nightfall (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.26-27">Ex 22:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.10-13">Dt 24:10-13</a>).</p>
<p>In drastic circumstances, where there was no collateral, a debtor could pledge a son, daughter, or slave. The value of the child’s or slave’s labor could then be credited against both interest and principal. An account in the Bible of a widow’s two sons about to go into slavery shows how cruel the custom could be (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1-7">2 Kgs 4:1-7</a>). Pledging labor or their children’s labor was the only way slaves could pay off a debt when they had to borrow.</p>
<p>A borrower could also have a wealthy friend assume responsibility as a cosigner on a loan and thus become the pledge, or surety. The book of Proverbs cautioned against standing surety for others, however, especially for strangers (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.1-3">Prv 6:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.15">11:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.17.18">17:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.26">22:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.13">27:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Sabbatical and Jubilee Years</p>
<p class="fl">Two legal provisions to curb the enslavement of people by long-standing debts were the sabbatical year and the jubilee year. The sabbatical year, or “year of release,” took place every seventh year. At that time debts were canceled and slates wiped clean (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.1-12">Dt 15:1-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.21.2">Ex 21:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.10-11">23:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.2-7">Lv 25:2-7</a>). The law clearly forbade lenders to withhold loans to those in desperate need during a sixth year. Jewish tradition held strict injunctions against a lender trying to collect on a loan that should have been forgiven in the sabbatical year.</p>
<p>Every 50 years Israel had its Year of Jubilee. In that year land reverted to its original owner if it had not already been redeemed by some relative. That provision prevented the buildup of landed estates by the wealthy few while the many poor suffered in slavery (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.13-17">Lv 25:13-17</a>). Although the Mosaic law could not guarantee economic utopia, it sought to curb the greediness in human nature. It also aimed at providing everyone with an equal opportunity and a fresh start every 50 years.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DebtintheNewTestament">Debt in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT shows how various cultures handled the matter of loans and debts. There were Jewish people who adhered strictly to the Mosaic law and refused to charge their fellow Jews high interest. Hellenistic and Roman legal practices, however, penetrated parts of Jewish society.</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus’ Parables</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus alluded to non-Jewish economic practices in his parable of a servant who jailed a fellow slave for not repaying a loan (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">Mt 18:23-35</a>). The parable illustrates the ordinary Hellenistic and Roman custom of jailing or restraining such a person as surety. That practice forced a debtor to sell his property, to ask family and friends to cover the loss, or to sell himself into slavery. The parable of the talents (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.14-28">25:14-28</a>) and the parable of the pounds (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.12-24">Lk 19:12-24</a>), speaking allegorically about the kingdom of God, mention earning interest on money invested with bankers.</p>
<p class="h3">Economic and Theological Instruction</p>
<p class="fl">The apostle Paul instructed Christians to “owe nothing to anyone” (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.8">Rom 13:8</a>), which means at the very least that Christians should make good on loans promptly. On the other hand, a Christian’s economic activity should be characterized by kindness toward those in need, generosity, and willingness to help (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.42">Mt 5:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.35">Lk 6:35</a>).</p>
<p>The NT also presents a number of lessons in doctrine based on a figurative use of “debts” and “debtors.” Jesus once referred to sinners (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.2">Lk 13:2</a>) with a word literally meaning “debtors” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.13.4">4</a>). In the Lord’s Prayer “debts” is paralleled with “sins” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.12">Mt 6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.4">Lk 11:4</a>).</p>
<p>Sin is seen as an enslavement (<a href="?bref=John.8.34">Jn 8:34</a>), and all men and women as debtors to God. Redemption can be made only by God, who “gave his only Son” to set people free (<a href="?bref=John.3.16-18">3:16-18</a>). The writer to the Hebrews showed that Jesus was made the surety of the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.22">Heb 7:22</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul felt indebted to all people because of his own salvation, a debt he could pay by preaching the gospel (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.14-15">Rom 1:14-15</a>). The NT teaches that all who receive the gospel are likewise in debt and therefore should devote themselves to serving others as a way of serving God (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.15.26-27">15:26-27</a>).</p>

<p>With the rise of Jewish nationalism in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Jewish king Alexander Janneus seized control of a few of these cities; they remained in the hands of Israel until they were recaptured by the Roman general Pompey in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>.

<p class="h1">DEDAN (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Region located in the Arabian Peninsula. The Dedanites were listed among those who rejoiced at the downfall of Israel during the time of the Babylonian captivity. Jeremiah and Ezekiel foretold Dedan’s approaching destruction (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.23">Jer 25:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.8">49:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.13">Ez 25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.13">38:13</a>).

Dedan is believed to have been located at or near an oasis called El-’ula in the central portion of the Arabian Peninsula. This oasis was part of the ancient trade routes, and undoubtedly played a role in the Dedanites’ mercantile way of life.</p>

<p class="h1">DEFORMITY</p>
<p class="fl">Any obvious physical abnormality. In the OT sacrificial system both the animal to be sacrificed (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.3">Lv 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.4.3">4:3</a>) and the priest who performed the sacrifice (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1-24">21</a>) had to be perfect physical specimens, without defect or blemish. By being perfect, they are both OT types of Christ.</p>
<p>Of the 11 defects that would exclude a man from becoming a priest (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.17-20">Lv 21:17-20</a>), seven are in the musculoskeletal system, two are in the eye, one is of the skin, and one is in the reproductive system. The deformity of the “flat nose” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “disfigurement” (<span class="sc">niv</span>) in <a href="?bref=Lev.21.18">Leviticus 21:18</a> does not refer to a normal variant, but to a severely diseased nose. There are a large number of genetic syndromes and inherited diseases that feature very deformed noses. Likewise, the acquired infectious diseases of syphilis, tuberculosis, and leprosy can cause destruction of the bone and cartilage support of the nose. With the support gone, the skin of the nose sinks inward. This is referred to today as a “saddle-shaped” deformity of the nose.</p>
<p>Both the OT and the NT describe an instance where a man has a “withered” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “shriveled” (<span class="sc">niv</span>) arm or hand. Such a defect occurs when the nerves supplying an extremity are damaged and the muscles atrophy. An injury from a sword striking an arm can cause this (<a href="?bref=Zech.11.17">Zec 11:17</a>). From the NT we learn that Jesus had the power to instantly heal a man with a chronically paralyzed hand (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.10">Mt 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.1">Mk 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.6">Lk 6:6</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Samson’s mistress, who betrayed him to his Philistine enemies (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.1-31">Jgs 16</a>). Because Philistia held southern Israel in vassalage at the time (c. 1070 <span class="era">BC</span>), Samson was chosen by God to begin the delivery of Israel. His success prompted the five Philistine rulers to offer Delilah a bribe if she would help capture him by discovering the secret of his enormous strength.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="RembrandtSSamsonAndDelilah"/>
<p>Delilah was from the valley of Sorek, in the southeast corner of Dan’s territory, only a few miles from Samson’s home in Zorah. It is clear from <a href="?bref=Judg.14.1">Judges 14:1</a> that she was a Philistine, although the large reward she accepted (5,500 pieces of silver) implies that her motivations were other than Philistine loyalty. Her unhindered contact with men probably indicates that she was a prostitute.</p>
<p>On her fourth attempt Delilah finally tricked Samson into revealing his secret. His strength was from God; his long hair, which signified that he was under a Nazirite vow (see <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-8">Nm 6:1-8</a>) and thus “set apart” by God for special service (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.5">Jgs 13:5</a>), was never to be cut. Delilah lulled him to sleep, shaved his head, and delivered him (still unsuspecting) into the hands of his enemies.</p>

  <title>Deliverance, Deliverer</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DELIVERANCE, DELIVERER</p>
<p class="fl">Rescue or redemption and the agent of such a rescue. Scripture teaches that God’s ultimate goal in history is to rescue people from the curse of sin, death, Satan, and hell. The OT depicts God as delivering his chosen people from Egyptian slavery, from Babylonian captivity, and from oppression at the hands of various Palestinian tribes. To Christians those deliverances foreshadow the coming of Jesus Christ as supreme deliverer.</p>
<p>The noun “deliverer” occurs a number of times in the OT. Three times the word refers to a human being. Othniel delivered Israel from subjugation to Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.8-10">Jgs 3:8-10</a>). Ehud delivered Israel from Eglon, king of Moab (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.3.15,30">15, 30</a>). <a href="?bref=Judg.18.27-29">Judges 18:27-29</a> states that “there was no deliverer” to protect Laish from conquest by Dan’s tribe. Other uses of “deliverer” refer to God himself as personal deliverer of his people (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.2">2 Sm 22:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.2">Pss 18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.17">40:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.70.5">70:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.2">144:2</a>).</p>
<p>The basic OT concept of deliverer is expressed in a Hebrew word for “next of kin.” A close relative was responsible to aid an individual in distress and to redeem him or her from slavery. God sent deliverance when his people were in danger, or God himself acted as deliverer, uniquely and forcefully in the exodus from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.7-8">Ex 3:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, Jesus quoted a messianic passage (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-2">Is 61:1-2</a>) as describing his own mission to proclaim release (or, deliverance) to the captives (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">Lk 4:18</a>). In <a href="?bref=Acts.7.35">Acts 7:35</a> Moses is called a “deliverer” of Israel. In <a href="?bref=Rom.11.26">Romans 11:26</a> the apostle Paul paraphrased <a href="?bref=Isa.59.20">Isaiah 59:20</a>, saying “A Deliverer will come from Jerusalem”—referring to Jesus Christ.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DEMETRIUS</p>
<p class="fl">Name (“Son of Demeter”) of five persons in biblical times: three Syrian kings and two NT figures.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Successor to Antiochus V Eupator. Demetrius I was king (160–151 <span class="era">BC</span>) when the Jewish uprising led by Judas Maccabeus was under way. He attempted several unsuccessful campaigns against the Jews (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.1-10">1 Macc 7:1-10</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.14.1-15,26-28">2 Macc 14:1-15, 26-28</a>). Toward the end of his reign Demetrius was challenged by Alexander Epiphanes and was killed in battle (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.46-50">1 Macc 10:46-50</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Demetrius I. After his father’s defeat and death, Demetrius II sought refuge in Crete, then challenged Alexander Epiphanes by invading Syria with an army of foreign mercenaries. Demetrius eventually concluded a treaty with the Jews and gained the Syrian throne in 145 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.32-37">1 Macc 11:32-37</a>). The Jews also helped Demetrius against another rival, Trypho, until he broke his word to them (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.54-55">54-55</a>). In the subsequent contest between Demetrius and Trypho, the Jews, under Jonathan’s brother Simon Maccabeus, achieved independence (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.13.34-42">13:34-42</a>). Demetrius was captured by Arsaces VI (Mithridates I), king of Parthia, around 138 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.1-3">1 Macc 14:1-3</a>). He returned to the Syrian throne 10 years later and reigned briefly until his assassination (125 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Grandson of Demetrius II. Demetrius III ruled Syria (95–88 <span class="era">BC</span>) in the turbulent years of the Seleucid era. One ruling party in Israel, the Pharisees, unsuccessfully enlisted his aid in their contest with the priest-king Alexander Janneus.</p>
<p class="list">4. Pagan silversmith in the city of Ephesus. He provoked a riot against Christian evangelists whose preaching had detrimental effects on his trade (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-41">Acts 19:23-41</a>). The city of Ephesus was a center of the worship of Diana (Latin counterpart of the Greek goddess Artemis), the goddess of hunting. A huge temple, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, had been erected there for her worship. Among the commercial enterprises connected with the cult of Diana was the making of religious images out of various materials, including silver.</p>
<p class="list-text">Demetrius, speaking for the silversmiths, said that both his business and the worship of Diana were threatened by the preaching of the apostle Paul and his companions. Gathering the other silversmiths together, he denounced Paul. The meeting caused a general uproar, and a mob dragged three of Paul’s companions to the amphitheater. Finally the town clerk, who was responsible to the Roman authorities for maintaining civic order, was able to quiet the mob, persuading them to take any grievances they might have to the courts.</p>
<p class="list">5. Christian believer whom the apostle John commended in his third NT letter (<a href="?bref=3Jn.1.12">3 Jn 1:12</a>). Demetrius may have been the carrier of that letter.</p>

<p class="h1">DEMON</p>
<p class="fl">Fallen angel who, under the leadership of Satan, rebelled against God. Demonism is the activity of demons, while demonology is the study of demons and their activity for the purpose of knowing the tactics of the enemy (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.11">2 Cor 2:11</a>) in order to properly exercise authority over them (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.19">Lk 10:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="WhoDemonsAre">Who Demons Are</p>
<p class="fl">The English word “demon” is derived from the Greek <span class="greek">daimon</span><span class="ital">,</span> which essentially means “a divinity, a deity” (i.e., a false deity, a demon; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.20">1 Cor 10:20</a>). Any deity other than the one true God is a spirit opposed to him; therefore, such a spirit is an evil spirit, or demon. The word “demon” does not appear in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, which mistranslates <span class="greek">daimon</span> as “devil.” There is only one devil (Greek <span class="greek">diabolos</span>), who is known by a variety of names, titles, and epithets in the Bible. He is the prince or ruler of all the other demons, who are subject to him.</p>
<p>Often in the Bible the word “spirit” is used for demon, along with a descriptive or identifying phrase; for example, “evil spirit” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.12-13">Acts 19:12-13</a>), “unclean spirit” (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.1">Mt 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.23,26">Mk 1:23, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.16">Acts 5:16</a>), “spirit of infirmity” (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.11">Lk 13:11</a>), “dumb and deaf spirit” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.25">Mk 9:25</a>) (all quotes from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Spirits may be identified by their specific role or function, such as a spirit of murder, suicide, lust, depression, fear, lying, etc., associating them with various sins or attitudes contrary to God.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew OT there is no word for “demon.” The term “evil spirit” occurs (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.23">Jgs 9:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14-23">1 Sm 16:14-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.10">18:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.9">19:9</a>). In the <span class="sc">kjv</span> there are references to “a lying spirit” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.22-23">1 Kgs 22:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.20-22">2 Chr 18:20-22</a>), “familiar spirit” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.10.13">1 Chr 10:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.6">2 Chr 33:6</a>), “perverse spirit” (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.14">Is 19:14</a>), “spirit of deep sleep” (<a href="?bref=Isa.29.10">29:10</a>), and “spirit of whoredoms” (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.12">Hos 4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.4">5:4</a>).</p>
<p>A specific powerful demon referred to by title in the OT is “the prince of the kingdom of Persia,” who hindered the archangel Gabriel from coming to bring information to Daniel, so that the archangel Michael came to Gabriel’s assistance (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.13">Dn 10:13</a>).</p>
<p>The number of demons is unknown; it appears that it is a vast number, perhaps incalculable. From <a href="?bref=Rev.12.4">Revelation 12:4</a> it is inferred that one-third of the angels were led astray by Satan. This means that the hosts of heaven outnumber Satan’s powers by two to one. <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Ephesians 6:12</a> suggests an order or rank of demons: “principalities,” “powers,” “world rulers of this present darkness,” “spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Demons are created beings—personal, immortal, and incapable of reconciliation with God. They have great power as compared with humans, but little power as compared with God. God has given us authority over them, so that in the name of Jesus they must obey God’s people, even as they must obey the Lord himself.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WhatDemonsDo">What Demons Do</p>
<p class="fl">Angels were created to worship and praise God, to serve him, and to act as his messengers. The Bible states that they are “spirits sent from God to care for those who will receive salvation” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.14">Heb 1:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The fallen angels have a similar function but a different master. Their allegiance is to the devil, whom they serve out of fear and delusion. They desire to work with human beings, but their purpose is to carry out the schemes of Satan and to oppose God. They tempt, deceive, and delude people so as to bring them to eternal damnation. In opposing God they attack, oppress, hinder, and accuse the people of God.</p>
<p>Since Satan is not omnipresent, he uses his demonic hosts to execute his will; for example, in the parable of the sower (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.3-9">Mt 13:3-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.1-20">Mk 4:1-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.4-15">Lk 8:4-15</a>) they snatch away the word before it can take root (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.15">Mk 4:15</a>). By persecution, Satan causes some to fall away before they have made a genuine commitment (v <a href="?bref=Mark.4.17">17</a>). By the cares of the world and the delight in riches and the desire for material things, he chokes the word so that little or no fruit is produced (v <a href="?bref=Mark.4.19">19</a>).</p>
<p>Basically, demons operate according to the pattern set by Satan in his threefold approach with Eve: (1) they deny the truth of the word of God and challenge its statements; (2) they deny the reality of death (typically they substitute something like reincarnation); and (3) they appeal to human vanity and pride by telling men and women that they can become like God or be gods (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-5">Gn 3:1-5</a>). These also are the basic methods and teachings underlying most cults and false religions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheFinalDestinyofDemons">The Final Destiny of Demons</p>
<p class="fl">It is written concerning the angels who sinned that God “cast them into hell and committed them to pits of nether gloom to be kept until the judgment” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Pt 2:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Lord spoke of the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels, into which the cursed among humans are also to go (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>). Eventually Satan and his host will be thrown into the lake of fire (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.10">Rv 20:10</a>), which is also the place of eternal torment for all whose names are not written in the Book of Life (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12-15">12-15</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DEMON-POSSESSION</p>
<p class="fl">Demonic occupation of a human being. The term “possession” is misleading and is not the best translation for the Greek word <span class="greek">daimonizomai</span><span class="ital">,</span> which literally means to be “demonized” and can often best be translated as “to have a demon.” The noun form is “demoniac.”</p>
<p>Demons can enter the body of a person (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.30">Lk 8:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.3">22:3</a>), in order to control the individual’s thoughts and actions. Sometimes a distinction is made between demonic oppression and demonic possession; this supposedly differentiates an attack from without and control from within. Although a non-Christian may be said to be “possessed” by a demon, the Christian cannot be so possessed, for he belongs to Christ and his human spirit has been sealed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>). Demonic spirits somehow know and acknowledge this seal.</p>
<p>Demons can also enter the bodies of animals, as in the case of the swine in <a href="?bref=Mark.5.13">Mark 5:13</a>. Demons are associated with books of magic (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.19">Acts 19:19</a>), idols (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.19-21">1 Cor 10:19-21</a>), and fetishes. Demons often cause illness or physical disability; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.11">Luke 13:11</a> tells of a woman who had “been crippled by an evil spirit” for 18 years but was delivered and healed by Jesus. Since evil spirits often attack the mind and the emotions, many symptoms of mental illness may be attributed to their activity. The boy whom Jesus delivered just after the Transfiguration exhibited symptoms of epilepsy. Paranoia may be the work of a spirit of fear. Some individuals suffering from schizophrenia (split or multiple personality) may in reality be demonized by a number of spirits. It is possible for a person to have many demons. Jesus cast seven of them out of Mary Magdalene (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.2">Lk 8:2</a>). The spirit in the Gerasene demoniac gave his name as Legion, “for we are many” (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.9">Mk 5:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.30">Lk 8:30</a>). In the time of Augustus a Roman legion consisted of 6,000 foot soldiers, usually accompanied by an equal number of auxiliary troops.</p>
<p>Demonization occurs in various ways. Some people are demonized by a hereditary curse, which may continue to the third or fourth generation (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.5">Ex 20:5</a>). The curse against illegitimacy was particularly strong, for the bastard could not enter the congregation of Israel until the tenth generation (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.2">Dt 23:2</a>). Curses may also be placed upon someone by spells, incantations, or similar practices such as voodoo or other forms of witchcraft. <a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</a> speaks of redemption from the curse of the law through Christ’s having “become a curse” for us. Usually believers are immune from curses made against them, unless they have given grounds to the devil (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.27">Eph 4:27</a>). Such grounds may be provided through drugs, illicit sex, the occult, or any other avenue forbidden in the Bible. Involvement with tarot cards, horoscopes, or any other form of fortune-telling may give demons opportunity to enter. Such contacts may seem innocuous, but Satan utilizes the smallest foothold to gain advantage over people.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Manifestation">Manifestation</p>
<p class="fl">Often demons prefer to hide rather than to make their presence known, for then they can exercise control without hindrance. When they do manifest themselves, often when challenged, all sorts of strange and frightening things may occur. They possess supernatural powers (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.16.14">Rv 16:14</a>), which they exhibit outright or through their victims. The Gerasene demoniac had superhuman physical strength, so that he could not be bound with fetters or chains (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.4-5">Mk 5:4-5</a>); he lived in tombs and went about night and day screaming and injuring himself with stones.</p>
<p>The spirit in the demonized boy in <a href="?bref=Mark.9.1-50">Mark 9</a> rendered him dumb and deaf, threw him on the ground, and caused him to roll about and to foam at the mouth (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.18-20">9:18-20</a>). The demon caused him to grind his teeth and become rigid; he had tried to kill the boy by throwing him into the fire and into the water on various occasions (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.9.18-22">18-22</a>). Before leaving at the command of Jesus, the demon cried out (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.1.26">Mk 1:26</a>), convulsed the boy terribly, and left him lying like a corpse. Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.27">9:27</a>). Similar manifestations take place today.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Exorcism">Exorcism</p>
<p class="fl">Casting out demons, or exorcism, was a regular and frequent part of the ministry of Jesus, and he taught and commanded his followers to do the same. This command has never been abrogated, and the ministry of deliverance should be even more important today, when the forces of evil are so rampant. The following principles are derived from the practice of Jesus, the Scriptures, and personal observation and involvement.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Jesus spoke to demons and commanded them to come out (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.25">Mk 1:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.25">9:25</a>). He cast them out “with a word” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.16">Mt 8:16</a>). Jesus gave his followers authority to use his name in casting them out and used this as a sign of the believer (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.17">Mk 16:17</a>). His name is not a magical formula, and its use depends on the relationship between the Lord and the person using his name, as the sons of Sceva found out to their dismay (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.11-18">Acts 19:11-18</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Jesus cast out demons by the Spirit of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.28">Mt 12:28</a>). God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power to heal all who were oppressed by the devil (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-19">Lk 4:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.38">Acts 10:38</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. The Lord gave clear teaching about “the binding of the strong man” in deliverance (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.29">Mt 12:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.27">Mk 3:27</a>) and about binding and loosing (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.18">Mt 18:18</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Prayer is an important weapon in spiritual warfare. When the disciples asked (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.28">Mk 9:28</a>) why they could not cast out a demon, Jesus replied that this kind comes out only with prayer.</p>
<p class="list">5. <a href="?bref=Rev.12.11">Revelation 12:11</a> testifies to the power of “the blood of the Lamb” in overcoming Satan. Demons do not like to hear of the blood of Jesus and often become agitated at the mention of it.</p>
<p class="list">6. God has equipped the believer with armor for defense in spiritual battle (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.10-17">Eph 6:10-17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">7. The Lord answered Satan with correctly applied texts from the Bible. We have been given the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.17">Eph 6:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.12">Heb 4:12</a>), as a means of defense and for attack against the enemy.</p>
<p class="list">8. We must come against the hosts of hell from our position in the heavenly places (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.6">Eph 2:6</a>), not from our limited earthly station.</p>
<p class="list">9. We must recognize that the ultimate victory has already been won by Jesus, who came to destroy the works of the devil (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.8">1 Jn 3:8</a>) and to destroy him who has the power of death (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.14-16">Heb 2:14-16</a>). When Jesus cried out on the cross, “It is finished,” he meant that the redemptive work was done; when he arose from the dead, he demonstrated his power over death. We win only as we enter into his victory.</p>

  <title>Descent into Hell*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DESCENT INTO HELL*</p>
<p class="fl">Reference to a controversial statement about Christ in the Apostles’ Creed. Speaking of Christ, the creed affirms that he “suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into hell; the third day he rose from the dead.” Interpretation of “he descended into hell” has produced much disagreement. Although the expression appears in creedal formulations as early as the fourth century, opinion remains divided about both its meaning and its relationship to Scripture.</p>
<p>The most natural interpretation in the context of the Apostles’ Creed is that descent into hell was one step in the succession of saving deeds accomplished by Jesus Christ in his redemptive career. Since the other steps are presented chronologically in the Apostles’ Creed, that descent would have occurred between Christ’s death and resurrection. On that almost all orthodox commentators agree.</p>
<p>Several questions remain to be debated. Is the phrase to be interpreted literally? Does it refer to an actual place or state of existence? How did Christ “descend”? In what state? For what purpose?</p>
<p>The word “hell” is itself problematic. The Hebrew word for “grave” acquired in OT times the larger meaning of “abode of the dead.” The Greek translation (in the Septuagint and the NT) was <span class="greek">hades</span><span class="ital">.</span> Both words are rendered “hell” in many English translations, as is the Greek word <span class="greek">Gehenna</span><span class="ital">,</span> which closely approximates what most people think of as hell, a place of torment for the wicked referred to by Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22,29-30">Mt 5:22, 29-30</a>). The earliest versions of the Apostles’ Creed are in Greek, but in the phrase “he descended into hell,” none of those words is used. Another expression is used that means “the lowest part.” Later Latin versions translated it <span class="ital">ad inferna</span> (“to the place beneath”), which in the course of centuries became identified with the place of torment (the inferno).</p>
<p class="h2" id="LiteralDescent">Literal Descent</p>
<p class="fl">The traditional view, officially maintained by Roman Catholics and Lutherans, interprets the phrase literally. Christ actually visited the place of the dead <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">hades</span><span class="ital">).</span> Within the framework of that view, two principal opinions have arisen concerning the purpose of Christ’s descent.</p>
<p class="h3">To Liberate the Old Testament Faithful</p>
<p class="fl">In one literal view, believers who had lived and died before Christ’s advent (a partial list of whom appears in <a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-40">Heb 11</a>) existed in a part of hades in a state of abeyance, in neither torment nor bliss, awaiting salvation. After Christ had accomplished salvation on the cross, and in the interval between his death and resurrection, he visited (descended into) hades, liberated those souls, and led them to heaven.</p>
<p>That interpretation claims support from <a href="?bref=Eph.4.8-10">Ephesians 4:8-10</a>, a difficult passage that speaks of Christ as “descended to the lower, earthly regions” and also “ascended” on high, leading “captives in his train” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). The “lower, earthly regions” is identified with hades and the “captives” with the throng of OT believers whom Christ released from their waiting stance and triumphantly conducted into full fellowship with God.</p>
<p class="h3">To Preach the Gospel to the Impenitent Dead</p>
<p class="fl">A related passage is <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-20">1 Peter 3:18-20</a>, in which Christ went and “preached to the spirits in prison—those who disobeyed God long ago” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>) in the time of Noah. That passage seems to conflict with the first view, since those who hear Christ’s preaching in 1 Peter are disobedient rather than believing spirits. Therefore, some have suggested a second view, that Christ descended into hades in order to bring a special message of salvation to the dead who were lost in their sins but who had no opportunity during their lifetime to hear the news of redemption. In that view the “hell” of the Apostles’ Creed is the place of the doomed dead. The purpose of Christ’s descent was to secure the redemption of some or all of them by preaching.</p>
<p>That interpretation also seeks support from <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-32">Ephesians 4</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-4.19">1 Peter 3–4</a>. “Captives” in <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-32">Ephesians 4</a> is seen as referring to those who had died in the “bondage” of sin. In <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-22">1 Peter 3</a> “the spirits in prison” refers to those in hades who would be condemned if it were not for the gospel that they heard and responded to in the afterlife. <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">First Peter 4:6</a> is sometimes quoted in that connection, with the meaning that “the gospel was preached even to the dead” after they had died. On the other hand, <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">1 Peter 4:6</a> may refer instead to preaching presented while they were alive to people dead at the time of writing. Many commentators argue that a preaching of the gospel after death, in order for people who did not accept salvation during their lifetime to do so after their death, seems contrary to Scripture’s emphasis on the necessity of acceptance now in the present life (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-15">Heb 3:7-15</a>), as well as on a judgment based only on what was done on earth.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FigurativeDescent">Figurative Descent</p>
<p class="fl">Because of difficulties in both literal approaches, many scholars (like John Calvin) have interpreted the passage in the creed figuratively. Instead of viewing “the descent” as an actual event, occurring chronologically between Christ’s death and resurrection, they see it as a reference to the intensity of Christ’s suffering. “He was crucified, dead and buried” describes his physical suffering: “he descended into hell,” the depth of his spiritual suffering. He endured the agony of hell as the substitute guilt-bearer for the human race. That was expressed in his cry of dereliction, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Mt 27:46</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Hell’s worst feature is separation from God (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.23">7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">25:41</a>)—the very agony Christ as the Lamb of God endured in order to make the atoning sacrifice and vindicate the justice of the triune God.</p>
<p>That interpretation, endorsed by the Heidelberg Catechism (1562), a Calvinist document, fits well with a substitutionary view of the Atonement and represents the immensity of Christ’s sufferings as portrayed in Scripture. Yet some question whether that interpretation represents the intended meaning of the Apostles’ Creed in its original formulation.</p>
<p>Another figurative interpretation, found in the Westminster Standards, also a Calvinist document, views the descent as a commentary on the preceding passages. The Westminster Larger Catechism paraphrases it like this: “Continuing in the state of the dead and under the power of death till the third day.” A serious problem with that interpretation is that the creed is extremely condensed and seems to avoid such repetition.</p>
<p>Because of difficulties in all four points of view, some Christians omit the statement altogether when they recite the creed. In support of their attitude they argue that the phrase has an unclear biblical foundation, is late in origin, found no general acceptance until the fifth century at the earliest, and was never included in the Nicene Creed. Yet the form of the creed agreed on by the ecumenical councils includes the passage.</p>

<p class="h1">DESERT</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="SinaiDesert"/>
<p class="fl">Empty waste place, often arid, sandy, and incapable of sustaining vegetable life, as for example the Negev of southern Palestine. A desert frequently includes local areas where marginal life is possible. The most common Hebrew term for desert means “wilderness” and is perhaps related to a verb meaning “to drive,” as a shepherd drives sheep to pasturage. The Greek word commonly used in the NT and in the Septuagint (ancient Greek translation of the OT) implies an unenclosed, uncultivated area where wild beasts roam (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.10">Dt 32:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.24.5">Jb 24:5</a>). The wilderness is also sometimes a place of pasturage (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">Ex 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.65.12">Ps 65:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.10">Jer 23:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.22">Jl 2:22</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible often refers to wilderness regions (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.16.7">Gn 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.20">21:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.28">1 Sm 17:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.3.1">Mt 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.13">Mk 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.4">Lk 15:4</a>). “Wilderness” is usually a place with no settled population (<a href="?bref=Num.14.33">Nm 14:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.10">Dt 32:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.38.26">Jb 38:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.21.19">Prv 21:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.2">Jer 9:2</a>) but is the dwelling place of wildlife: the vulture (<a href="?bref=Ps.102.6">Ps 102:6</a>), wild asses (<a href="?bref=Job.24.5">Jb 24:5</a>), jackals (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.3">Mal 1:3</a>), and ostriches (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.3">Lam 4:3</a>). The term is also used figuratively (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.3">Hos 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.31">Jer 2:31</a>).</p>
<p>Another Hebrew term for desert, from a root meaning “to be arid,” refers to an infertile, desolate, bare steppe (<a href="?bref=Job.24.5">Jb 24:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.9">Is 33:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.43">Jer 51:43</a>). The plural form of that word describes topographical features of the desert plains of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1">Nm 22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.3,63">26:3, 63</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.34.1">Dt 34:1</a>) and of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.4.13">Jos 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.10">5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.5">2 Kgs 25:5</a>). With the definite article, that word (the Arabah) is the plain of the Jordan Valley and of the environs of the Dead Sea. The geography of that region contains sharp contrasts; the Jordan Valley, dense with a junglelike forest sheltering wild beasts (including lions in biblical times), gives way to the steppe lands of the Dead Sea area, which have always been desert.</p>
<p>Two other Hebrew terms, meaning “waste” and “ruin,” refer to districts or settlements once inhabited but later devastated (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.7">Is 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.9">5:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.11">6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.42.18">Jer 42:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.35.7">Ez 35:7</a>). They are also used more generally for any desolate or waste place (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.31,33">Lv 26:31, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.3.14">Jb 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.9.6">Pss 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.109.10">109:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.17">Is 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.26">44:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.3">51:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.9">52:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.34">Jer 7:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.5.14">Ez 5:14</a>). One of them is also used once for the wilderness of the exodus (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.21">Is 48:21</a>). Another word meaning “waste” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.40">Ps 78:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.19-20">Is 43:19-20</a>), when prefixed with the definite article, is a proper name for Jeshimon, a tract of land west of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Num.21.20">Nm 21:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.23.24">1 Sm 23:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.1">26:1</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the noun for “wilderness” and the adjective “desert” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.1">Mt 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.26">24:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.16">Lk 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.31">Jn 6:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.26">Acts 8:26</a>) come from the same Greek root.</p>
<p>The whole of biblical history has been interpreted as having a desert or wilderness motif. It can be seen in the realm of disobedient human experience outside the Garden of Eden; in the wandering of Israel during the exodus; in the struggle between pure faith in the desert and soft, idolatrous city life. The desert is viewed as a realm of demons and death (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.17">Dt 32:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.13-14">Is 34:13-14</a>); its demonic wildness resembles the primeval chaos of the Creation (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Gn 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.26.7">Jb 26:7</a>). Several moving passages of Scripture deal with renewal of life in a desert valley (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">Ez 37</a>), or with transformation of arid land into a productive garden (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.18-20">Is 41:18-20</a>).</p>
<p>The desert is also a place where God is close to his people (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.10-12">Dt 32:10-12</a>), both watching over them and testing their obedience (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.2">Jer 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.14-15">Hos 2:14-15</a>). Finally, the desert is a place of refuge, cleansing, and consecration. In the Gospels the desert theme of the exodus recurs in the 40 days and nights in which Jesus was tempted in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.13">Mk 1:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.91.1-16">Ps 91</a>). The desert fathers of the early church and the hermits of the Middle Ages emulated the prophet Elijah and John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.4-8">1 Kgs 19:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.3.1-6">Mt 3:1-6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">DESIRE</p>
<p class="fl">To long for, want, or covet; also the object so desired. The word “desire” occurs many times in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. As a noun it translates 12 Hebrew words and 3 Greek words. As a verb it represents about 12 each of Hebrew and Greek verbs. Some of the original words simply mean “ask” or “seek,” and are translated that way in modern versions.</p>
<p>Desire is a basic part of life, neither good nor bad in itself. The important moral issue is how one responds to his or her desires. It is possible to let desires control one’s conduct, or to control one’s desires and use them to serve their God-appointed purposes.</p>
<p>Christians have differed on the appropriate reaction to desire. Ascetics have claimed, for example, that the desire for food and the enjoyment of eating is sinful. But Jesus’ examples in the Gospels show that he enjoyed good meals—so much so that his critics called him a glutton (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.34">Lk 7:34</a>). His first miracle in John’s Gospel was performed at a wedding in Cana of Galilee, where the feasting probably went on for several days (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-11">Jn 2:1-11</a>).</p>
<p>Many think that sexual desire is bad, but it is of itself no more evil than the desire for food. God created people with both desires, and they both must be kept under control, in obedience to God’s law.</p>
<p>How does one distinguish between good desire and bad desire? Ultimately there is one basic issue: Is a person’s desire self-centered or a desire for God’s will? The Bible teaches that the essence of sin is a determination to have one’s own way. Although King Saul never committed the dual crimes of adultery and murder that King David did, David was honored and Saul was reproached. The reason given by the Bible is that David was “a man after [God’s] heart,” who wanted to do God’s will (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.22">Acts 13:22</a>). But Saul was stubborn and self-willed, and he was rejected for that reason (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.23">1 Sm 15:23</a>).</p>
<p>Evil desire, therefore, is not necessarily a desire for something that one might label as wicked. It is essentially the desire to have one’s own way. As such, it is idolatry, putting self in place of God. Without desire, nothing is accomplished in life. But one’s actions must always be in accord with God’s will as it is revealed in his Word. The Bible even promises that if people take delight in the Lord, then God will give them the desires of their heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.4">Ps 37:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.145.16,19">Ps 145:16, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.24">Prv 10:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">Mt 6:33</a>). When God is one’s greatest desire, all other desires become properly oriented and can thus mirror God’s own desires for his people’s well-being.</p>

<p class="fl">Fifth book of the OT, and last of the Pentateuch (the five books of the Law). In it Moses restated to the people of Israel various laws and precepts of the covenant that God had revealed to them at Mt Sinai. Thus, the book has become known in Greek and Latin tradition as Deuteronomy (“second law”). That name has led some to misinterpret the significance of its contents as secondary. The book makes an important contribution to God’s unfolding revelation of his purpose for the nation of Israel. Moses’ reminders of the wilderness wanderings and the Ten Commandments, plus his instructions for life in the Promised Land, are a vital part of the OT covenant literature.</p>

<p class="h2" id="DateandAuthorship">Date and Authorship</p>
<p class="fl">Two basic views (with variations) on the date and authorship of Deuteronomy are advocated by modern biblical scholars. Those who consider Moses the author date the book in the 14th or 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Others believe that it was composed by an unknown author in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>, when Josiah was king in the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<p class="h3">The Case for a Seventh-Century Date</p>
<p class="fl">As early as 1805, W. M. L. de Wette advocated that Deuteronomy was used by Josiah in his seventh-century reforms, and that it was written shortly before that. Biblical critic Julius Wellhausen adopted that view, which has been advocated by many scholars ever since S. R. Driver publicized it in his <span class="ital">Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament</span> (1891). According to that view, the book was written late but ascribed to Moses.</p>
<p>Many modern scholars, such as Gerhard von Rad and G. E. Wright, regard Moses as the founder of Israel’s faith. They argue that whatever in Deuteronomy is from Moses was transmitted orally until about the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. Denying that Moses actually wrote Deuteronomy, they attribute its present form to numerous writers and editors over an extended period of centuries.</p>
<p class="h3">The Case for Mosaic Authorship</p>
<p class="fl">In recent decades, studies of Hittite suzerainty treaties from the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span> have yielded interesting comparisons between those treaty forms and the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. In 1954 G. Mendenhall suggested that the form of the covenant at Mt Sinai was the same literary form used by Hittites in treaties with Syrian vassal states during the 14th and 13th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. In 1960 M. G. Kline applied that idea to the book of Deuteronomy, seeing it as a renewal of the Sinaitic covenant and outlining its structure as a literary unit reflecting the pattern of Hittite covenant forms.</p>
<p>The book of Deuteronomy does contain certain parallels to Hittite vassal treaties. As a renewal treaty it appeals to the covenant of God with Israel at Mt Sinai, recorded in the book of Exodus.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The “preamble” in ancient Hittite treaties usually identified the suzerain or ruler. In <a href="?bref=Deut.1.1-5">Deuteronomy 1:1-5</a> (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1">Ex 20:1</a>) Moses as the speaker represents God, the King of Israel. As his death approaches, Moses makes an appeal for the renewal of the covenant.</p>
<p class="list">2. In the “historical prologue” the suzerain usually cited the benefits he had bestowed on his vassal. In <a href="?bref=Deut.1.6-4.49">Deuteronomy 1:6–4:49</a> (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2">Ex 20:2</a>) Moses declares what God has done for Israel since his revelation at Mt Sinai. Moses reminds the people of Israel of God’s faithfulness even when they had been unfaithful.</p>
<p class="list">3. The “stipulations” were usually stated by the suzerain in the treaty’s third division. In <a href="?bref=Deut.5.1-26.19">Deuteronomy 5–26</a> Moses outlines the stipulations for Israel in their covenant relationship to God. The basic requirement in <a href="?bref=Deut.5.1-11.32">Deuteronomy 5–11</a> (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.3-17">Ex 20:3-17</a>) is exclusive, wholehearted love for God. In the following chapters, <a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-26.19">Deuteronomy 12–26</a>, the basic principle of exclusive love for God is applied to specific areas of culticceremonial consecration (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-16.17">Dt 12:1–16:17</a>), judicial justice in government (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.18-21.23">16:18–21:23</a>), the sanctity of God’s order (chs <a href="?bref=Deut.22.1-25.19">22–25</a>), and public acknowledgment of God as their Redeemer and King (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.26.1-19">26</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. “Covenant ratification” usually contained a provision for treaty renewal and a formula for curses and blessings. In <a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-26">Deuteronomy 27</a> provision is made for Joshua to conclude the renewal of the covenant after the Israelites occupy the land. In addition, the divine threat and promise are expressed in blessings and curses as Israel swears its oath of allegiance on the plains of Moab.</p>
<p class="list">5. “Succession arrangements” were usually the concluding part of suzerainty-vassal treaties. In chapters <a href="?bref=Deut.31.1-34.12">31–34</a> Joshua is designated as Moses’ successor. The written text is deposited in the sanctuary with the song of witness and a testamentary blessing by Moses. The book of Deuteronomy thus constitutes the documentary witness of God’s covenant as it concludes with the death of Moses.</p>
<p class="sp">The fact that the literary structure of Deuteronomy parallels the legal forms characteristic of ancient Hittite treaties supports the traditional viewpoint that Moses is the author of Deuteronomy. When Moses is recognized as the mediator between God and Israel in the Sinaitic covenant, it is significant that the book of Deuteronomy represents Moses’ renewal of the covenant in the literary form current in the culture of his day.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoricalSetting">Historical Setting</p>
<p class="fl">Moses led the Israelites from Egypt through the wilderness to the plains of Moab east of the Dead Sea. <a href="?bref=Exod.1.1-19.25">Exodus 1–19</a> gives an account of the enslavement of the Israelites in Egypt, the birth and preparation of Moses, his contest with the pharaoh, the miraculous deliverance out of Egypt, and the journey to Mt Sinai (probably also known as Mt Horeb).</p>
<p>In that desert area God’s great revelation came to Israel through Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-40.38">Ex 20–40</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-27.34">Lv 1–27</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.1.1-9.23">Nm 1–9</a>). At Mt Sinai, God identified himself as the one who had delivered the Israelites. There he established an agreement by which they would be exclusively devoted to him as his holy nation. There the tabernacle was built and the priesthood established. Instructions were given for making sacrifices and offerings, and for observing feasts and seasons, so that Israel’s pattern of living would show that they were God’s holy people. The tribes were also organized for encampment around the tabernacle and for the march to Canaan, the Promised Land.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Num.10.1-21.35">Numbers 10–21</a> is an account of the 38 years the Israelites spent in the wilderness. In 11 days they marched from Mt Horeb to Kadesh-barnea, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Beersheba. From there 12 spies were sent into Canaan. Their report produced a crisis in the form of a revolt against God. Subsequently, Israel wandered in the wilderness for 38 years, during which those who had been at least 20 years old when they left Egypt died. The new generation moved to the plains of Moab, located east of the Dead Sea and north of the Arnon River. <a href="?bref=Num.20.1-36.13">Numbers 20–36</a> tells of the conquest and occupation of the land east of the Jordan River.</p>
<p>The book of Deuteronomy presents Moses’ address to the new generation of Israelites. In Exodus and Numbers God frequently speaks to Moses; in Deuteronomy, Moses is speaking at God’s command to the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.1-4">Dt 1:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.29.1">29:1</a>). In contrast to the preceding books, Deuteronomy has a style of exhortation in which Moses admonishes the new generation about their responsibility in view of the preceding generation’s failures. Whatever repetition occurs in Deuteronomy is carefully selected, with the specific purpose of warning the new generation so that they will not fail to conquer and occupy Canaan. Deuteronomy is not primarily retrospective; its outlook is optimistic about the future, offering hope for fulfilling the promises God made to the Israelites in Egypt.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SignificanceofDeuteronomy">Significance of Deuteronomy</p>
<p class="fl">Deuteronomy (with Genesis, Psalms, and Isaiah) is among the most frequently quoted books in the early Christian centuries. More than 80 OT quotations in the NT come from Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>Jesus focused attention on Deuteronomy when he summarized the essence of the entire OT Law and Prophets in the two great commandments of love for God and neighbor (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Mt 22:37</a>; see <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Dt 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.19">10:19</a>). Jesus also quoted Deuteronomy (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.13,16">6:13, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.8.3">8:3</a>) in his temptation experience (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.4-10">Mt 4:4-10</a>). Deuteronomy unfolds the essence of what God revealed to Moses at Mt Sinai. In Deuteronomy, Moses shares with the Israelites the core of God’s revelation without repeating details of sacrifices, observances, or rituals. He expounds the character of Israel’s faith and nationhood. Moses repeatedly emphasizes his concern that they faithfully maintain a good relationship with God. An exclusive devotion to God expressed in everyday life is the key to a lifetime of blessing.</p>
<p>The primary need of love toward God and neighbor eventually became a basic requirement for the followers of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.25-28">Lk 10:25-28</a>). The book of Deuteronomy is thus crucially important to the Christian concern to maintain a vital relationship with God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DeuteronomyandtheLaw">Deuteronomy and the Law</p>
<p class="fl">To designate the book of Deuteronomy as a “second law” or a repetition of the law is misleading. Moses’ emphasis is not legalistic. Details of worship and ritual are not repeated or delineated to any great extent. Although the Ten Commandments are repeated, emphasis is placed on the first commandment, explicitly requiring exclusive devotion to God. Moses is primarily concerned with Israel’s relationship with God and their determination to maintain it in their own and their children’s lives.</p>
<p>The NT reveals that a legalistic interpretation of the Mosaic revelation was held by the Jews of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>. Such legalism developed in Judaism especially during the intertestamental era. The Judaistic legalism of NT times has in modern times been ascribed wrongly to Moses. Moses did warn of the necessity of keeping all of God’s law (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.1,58">Dt 28:1, 58</a>), but in Deuteronomy his message as a whole makes it clear that he was not exclusively concerned about legalistic observance. Rather, the central theme of Deuteronomy is the unique relationship that had been established by a unique God with a unique people, the Israelites.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Brief Historical Review (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.1-4.43">1:1–4:43</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Moses is identified as the speaker, addressing the Israelites on the plains of Moab during the last year of his life. The Israelites were on the verge of entering the Promised Land of Canaan.</p>
<p>Moses began with a reference to Mt Sinai, scene of the greatest revelation in OT times. He focused attention on God’s explicit command for them to move up to Canaan and occupy the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Their rebellion brought divine judgment, so the conquest of Canaan had been delayed 38 years while an entire disobedient generation died in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Instructed by God not to molest the Edomites or Moabites, Moses had led the Israelites to the Moab plains north of the Arnon River. The Israelites defeated Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and Og, king of Bashan. The tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh appropriated the territory east of the Jordan River as their land (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>). On the basis of that conquest, Moses encouraged Joshua to believe that God would aid him and the Israelites in the conquest of the land of Canaan west of the Jordan River.</p>
<p>The Israelites should learn from the mistakes of the generation that died in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.1-40">Dt 4:1-40</a>). They should consider the fact that the word of God had been spoken to them. The revelation that had come to them through Moses was unique, and the most important thing was for them to revere the God who had revealed himself. The uniqueness of Israel’s God among the nations that worship idols should never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Moses reminded the Israelites that they had entered into a contractual agreement with their unique God. That covenant was mentioned 26 more times by Moses. No nation had ever experienced anything like it. If Israel obeyed, they would enjoy God’s blessing and favor.</p>
<p class="h3">Exhortations and Applications (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.44-26.19">4:44–26:19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The circumstances in which Moses addressed the Israelites are reported in a short transitional passage (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.44-49">Dt 4:44-49</a>). From the slopes of Mt Pisgah (or Nebo), with Israel encamped in the valley opposite Beth-peor, Moses made his appeal to the people before they crossed the Jordan River.</p>
<p>Moses’ exposition of the “great commandment” is centered in the agreement made between God and Israel. He repeated the Ten Commandments as the essence of God’s revelation at Sinai. As Moses explained what God expected of Israel, he elaborated the first commandment: “I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage” (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.6">5:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Their relationship with God was of basic importance, since God’s wrath will be against those who worship other gods (v <a href="?bref=Deut.5.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>Love is the key word in the relationship between God and Israel. Moses boldly asserted, “Hear, O Israel! The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is our God, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> alone. And you must love the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength” (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-5">Dt 6:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). All other commandments are significant because they bear on that relationship (as spelled out in chs <a href="?bref=Deut.5.1-11.32">5–11</a>).</p>
<p>Exclusive love and devotion to God are essential. In a relationship of wholehearted love, no idols can be recognized or tolerated. Yet Moses wanted Israel to convey its consciousness of God to future generations by many external things: signs on their hands, frontlets (or “phylacteries”) on their foreheads, Scripture verses on their doorposts, and so on. By precept and example they should convey to their children that they love God (Dt 6).</p>
<p>The Israelites should never forget that God had chosen them to be his people (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-26">Dt 7</a>). They were to execute God’s judgment on the Canaanites, who had been spared judgment since Abraham’s time (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.16">Gn 15:16</a>). Although the Israelites themselves did not merit God’s love, in love and mercy he had redeemed them out of Egypt.</p>
<p>Moses appealed to the people to remember what God had done for them (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.1-20">Dt 8</a>). To God’s sustaining provisions they should respond with thankfulness, recognizing that the power to achieve anything they had done had been God’s gift.</p>
<p>The Israelites had repeatedly failed in their faith and commitment to God (<a href="?bref=Deut.9.1-10.11">9:1–10:11</a>). Through Moses’ intercession they had been spared. It was for no merit of their own that they would enter Canaan; that was God’s gracious provision for them. Moses’ appeal for a wholehearted commitment is summarized in <a href="?bref=Deut.10.12-11.32">Deuteronomy 10:12–11:32</a>. It is necessary to display reverence, respect, love, and obedience to God (see also <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5,13,24">6:5, 13, 24</a>).</p>
<p>The God whom the Israelites must love sincerely and without reservation is the Lord of the cosmos. He is the righteous judge who rules supreme over all nature and history. God loved their forefathers, the patriarchs. He redeemed the Israelites from Egyptian enslavement and gave them his covenant. He manifested himself in helping the orphans, widows, and strangers. He multiplied Israel to be as numerous as the stars of the heavens.</p>
<p>Moses gave two basic instructions to apply in daily life to maintain their relationship with God as a reality: “circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart” (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.16">Dt 10:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). He did not refer to physical circumcision, a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">Gn 17</a>). Circumcision, which was not observed during the years of wilderness wanderings, was reinstituted under Joshua after the Israelites crossed the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.2-9">Jos 5:2-9</a>). Moses referred to “spiritual circumcision” (see <a href="?bref=Lev.26.40-41">Lv 26:40-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.4">Jer 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.25">9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.29">Rom 2:29</a>). All things that might restrict, interfere with, or negate total devotion to God were to be cut away (circumcised) so that the Israelites would continue to love God with all their heart.</p>
<p>“Love the foreigner” (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.19">Dt 10:19</a>) ranks second in importance to wholehearted love for God. Love for the stranger or neighbor is basic to all other human obligations (see <a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-18">Lv 19:9-18</a>). Social obligations issue out of a person’s relationship with God. Being recipients of God’s love, the Israelites were to love others. They were to remember God’s love for them when they were slaves and strangers in Egypt. God loves the stranger, the widow, and the orphan; therefore, if anyone loves God, he or she is under obligation to love other people. God is concerned about justice and righteousness; a person who professes to love God must be concerned about just treatment for other people.</p>
<p>The Israelites were to be known for their concern for people whose social position exposed them to exploitation and oppression. The profound humanitarian spirit of the Mosaic law stands in unique contrast to the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi and the Assyrian and Hittite law codes of that day. In those codes human relationships reflected no vital consciousness of a love relationship with deity.</p>
<p>In the first century <span class="era">AD</span> Jesus Christ came into conflict with Jewish religious leaders who had lost the essence of God’s law in a maze of legalism. For Jesus, the greatest commandment was to love God; the second was to love one’s neighbor. Those two commandments (which constitute the essence of the entire OT revelation) would, if kept perfectly, provide the basis for eternal life (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37-39">Mt 22:37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.29-31">Mk 12:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.27-28">Lk 10:27-28</a>). Christians believe that the climax of God’s revelation of love came in Jesus Christ. For them, responding to God’s love means to accept Jesus Christ in wholehearted devotion and to love one’s neighbor as Jesus exemplified in his life.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-26.19">Deuteronomy 12:1–26:19</a>, Moses gave instruction in practical living for a God-related people when they resided in the land God had promised to them. Having once survived on manna supplied directly by God, in Canaan they would enjoy the fruit and produce of the land. They would also encounter a culture permeated by Canaanite religion.</p>
<p>In worshiping God in their new setting, they were cautioned to maintain due sanctity (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-14.21">Dt 12:1–14:21</a>). They were not to worship at pagan shrines. They should bring their offerings to divinely appointed places for fellowship and rejoicing together in the Lord’s presence. Idolatry was not to be tolerated in any form. Any prophet who deviated from the law of Moses in advising the worship of other gods should be stoned. Exclusive devotion to God was to be daily practice.</p>
<p>Canaan’s abundant blessings should be shared with neighbors (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.22-15.23">14:22–15:23</a>). Tithes should be brought to the central sanctuary where Levites assisted the priests in religious ministration. Joy in sharing life’s blessings and opportunities was to characterize Israel’s pattern of living.</p>
<p>Moses prescribed three annual pilgrimages (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.1-17">16:1-17</a>). The people should remember their deliverance out of Egypt by observing the feasts of Passover and Unleavened Bread. Seven weeks later, when the barley harvest was completed, they should spend time rejoicing before the Lord in a one-day festival called the Feast of Weeks. When the vintage as well as the grain harvest was completed, they were to observe the Feast of Ingathering (or Booths), a time of thanksgiving and sharing with others. Every seven years the law was read at the Feast of Ingathering.</p>
<p>In human relations justice was to prevail among the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.18-21.23">16:18–21:23</a>). The Book of the Law kept at the main sanctuary was their divine authority, providing God’s instructions for them. The king was to have a copy of this law and govern his life in accordance with it. Prophets and priests played an important role as religious leaders in the life of Israel. Judicial authority was vested in the priests. In contrast to the brutality of other nations, humanitarian principles were to prevail in Israel’s warfare. Fathers were responsible for their own family households.</p>
<p>In domestic and social relationships, the law of love was to prevail (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.1-26.19">22:1–26:19</a>). Many regulations governed family life. In matters of sustenance, wages, and business dealings, the Israelites were admonished to be compassionate and just. Promises and warnings raised their consciousness about using the resources of land and animals entrusted to them so that their stewardship would please God.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Deut.26.1-19">Deuteronomy 26</a>, Moses instructed the Israelites in two liturgical confessions and a reaffirmation of the covenant. By acknowledging that God was the giver of all they had, and by confessing before God that they shared his gifts with others, they confirmed their covenant with God.</p>
<p class="h3">Alternatives: Blessings or Curses (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-30.20">27:1–30:20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Moses set before the Israelites the alternatives of blessings or curses. Under Joshua they were to renew the covenant publicly. At Mt Ebal stones were to be erected for inscribing the law and an altar constructed for offering sacrifice. The curses were to be read from Mt Ebal and the blessings from Mt Gerizim. Conditional self-curses were read regarding offenses against God and other human beings (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.15-26">Dt 27:15-26</a>). Thus they acknowledged their accountability to God. Though their sins might be hidden from people, it was God to whom they were primarily and ultimately accountable. Blessings as a way of life and curses as a way of death were clearly set before the Israelites (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">28</a>). Setting them in the perspective of history, Moses appealed to the new generation to take advantage of their present opportunity (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.29.1-29">29</a>). Warning that, should they fail to love God, they would ultimately be subjected to dispersion, Moses admonished them to choose the way of life and good rather than the way of death and evil (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.30.1-20">30</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Transition: from Moses to Joshua (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.1-34.12">31:1–34:12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">When the life and ministry of Moses were nearing completion, and transfer of leadership was near (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.1-34.12">Dt 31:1–34:12</a>), Joshua had already been designated by God as Israel’s new leader. Moses assured the Israelites that God would be the same with Joshua in charge. The revelation given through Moses had been put in writing and now was committed to the priests, the custodians of the Book of the Law. Joshua, who had already distinguished himself in responsible leadership, was publicly confirmed at the door of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.1-29">31:1-29</a>).</p>
<p>The “Song of Moses” is the covenant’s document of witness (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.1-47">32:1-47</a>). In it Moses spoke with prophetic understanding as he recounted Israel’s past experience. Reiterating the consequences of their attitude toward God, he assured the people of restoration if they failed again. He encouraged them to fix their hearts on what God had revealed to them and to impress it on their children. Keeping the covenant by maintaining a wholehearted love for God would be important for all future generations as well as for those then listening to Moses.</p>
<p>After some final, brief instructions (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.48-52">32:48-52</a>), Moses pronounced his blessings on the Israelites, whom he had led for 40 years (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.1-29">33:1-29</a>). In his final blessing, also called the “Testament of Moses,” the greatness of God and his special relationship with Israel are delineated. Israel is unique among all the nations of the world.</p>
<p>The book of Deuteronomy appropriately ends with an account of the death of Moses, the greatest prophet in OT times (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.1-12">34:1-12</a>).</p>

  <title>Dew</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DEW</p>
<p class="fl">Moisture condensed from warm air during a cool night, usually found as small droplets on surfaces the next morning. Dew was an important source of moisture for the people of the ancient Near East, replacing some of the moisture lost during the hot days in that region. It was important to the growth of plants and successful harvests (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.10">Hg 1:10</a>). In the Bible dew and rain are spoken of together as of great value (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>). During the exodus, dew was a source of sustenance (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.13-21">Ex 16:13-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.9">Nm 11:9</a>). Figuratively, “dew” was sometimes used as a symbol of blessing; for example, Isaac blessed Jacob by asking that “the dew of heaven” be given to him (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.28">Gn 27:28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.33.13">Dt 33:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.7">Mi 5:7</a>). Dew was also a symbol of refreshment, renewal, or prosperity (<a href="?bref=Job.29.19">Jb 29:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.5">Hos 14:5</a>). A king’s favor was said to be like dew upon the grass (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.12">Prv 19:12</a>). Dew could represent stealth, coming silently by night (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.12">2 Sm 17:12</a>); it also depicted circumstances that could change rapidly, since it evaporated so quickly in the morning (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.4">Hos 6:4</a>). A passage in one of David’s psalms declares that God will renew his strength like the morning dew (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.3">Ps 110:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">DIANA*</p>
<p class="fl">Roman name for the mythological Greek goddess Artemis, daughter of Jupiter and Latona and the twin sister of Apollo. She renounced all idea of marriage, supposedly because she was appalled at the birth pains her mother had suffered in bearing her, and remained the unattainable virgin goddess. Although goddess of the moon, Diana was more often portrayed as the huntress with two dogs beside her.</p>
<p>The Temple of Diana at Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The impressive building was supported on 100 large columns. The local legend was that her statue fell there from the sky (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.35">Acts 19:35</a>). This may have been a reference to a meteorite. Pliny described a large stone over the doorway, which, according to tradition, had been put in place by Diana. Ceremonies and services of worship in her honor were conducted by eunuch priests.</p>
<p>Among the statues that have been excavated, some show Diana as a multibreasted female; others show a shrine with the goddess attended by lions. Models of the temple were sold as souvenirs by the silversmiths, who were reluctant to see any slackening of this lucrative trade when Paul began his preaching in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-20.1">Acts 19:23–20:1</a>). The discontent and agitation of the silversmiths led to the riot of the crowd, culminating in the roar “Great is Diana of the Ephesians” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.28,34">19:28, 34</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Inscriptions in the British Museum refer to the goddess as “Artemis the Great.” If the silversmiths are to be believed, she was worshiped throughout the known world. The form of worship is not known for certain, but the worship of the goddess Diana may have been associated with a fertility cult.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DIASPORA OF THE JEWS*</p>
<p class="fl">Dispersion of Jewish people from Israel to foreign lands. <span class="greek">Diaspora</span><span class="ital">,</span> a Greek noun meaning a “sowing” or “scattering,” is regularly used in the Septuagint to mean “exile” (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.34">Jer 25:34</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.11.12">Is 11:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.23">Ez 20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.10">Zep 3:10</a>). The word occurs twice in the NT (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">Jas 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pt 1:1</a>), referring to Christian Jews residing outside Palestine as a result of the several dispersions in Israel’s history. Diaspora sometimes refers to the exiled people, sometimes to the place of exile.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MajorDiasporas">Major Diasporas</p>
<p class="fl">From the end of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> onward, Jewish history was marked by several major dispersions.</p>
<p class="h3">Diaspora of the Northern Kingdom</p>
<p class="fl">After Solomon’s death, his kingdom broke in two. The northern kingdom of Israel sunk deeper into idolatry and immorality (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.14-18">2 Kgs 17:14-18</a>). Jeroboam, the first king of the divided Israel, established a pattern of apostasy (“falling away” from faith). Epitaphs for succeeding kings regularly recorded that the deceased ruler “did not turn from the sins of Jeroboam” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.31">10:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.11">13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.24">14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.9,18,24,28">15:9, 18, 24, 28</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Assyria conquered the northern kingdom in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> and took over 27,000 Israelites into exile, as had been predicted (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.23">17:23</a>). They were settled in cities along the tributaries of the Euphrates River and in Media. Assyrians from cities around Babylon, in turn, colonized Israel (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.6,24">6, 24</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Diaspora of the Southern Kingdom</p>
<p class="fl">The southern kingdom of Judah suffered exile to the east in Babylonia and to the south in Egypt. The Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar captured Judeans in several expeditions from 605 <span class="era">BC</span> to the fall of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The first deportation to Babylon took Jerusalem’s treasures from the temple and palace, and “all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the poorest people of the land” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.12-14">2 Kgs 24:12-14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.10">2 Chr 36:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.29-30">Jer 52:29-30</a>).</p>
<p>A year later a second expedition focused on the rebellious Jewish vassal king Zedekiah and his sons (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1,6-7">2 Kgs 25:1, 6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.4-11">Jer 52:4-11</a>). In the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Babylonia struck Judah a third time, destroyed the temple and the king’s palace, and broke down the city’s walls. All but the very poorest people were carried away captive (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.8-21">2 Kgs 25:8-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.12-16">Jer 52:12-16</a>).</p>
<p>Shishak, king of Egypt, deported exiles from Judah as early as the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Judah lost people and also temple gold at that time (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-26">1 Kgs 14:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.9">2 Chr 12:9</a>). About 400 years later, Johanan, a Judean, thought he could escape from Nebuchadnezzar by fleeing to Egypt. Johanan forced Jeremiah and a group of other Jews to go with him; they settled at Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis. Nevertheless, the Babylonians pursued them, took control of Egypt, and executed many of the Jews there (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.5-44.30">Jer 43:5–44:30</a>). Records of property ownership and artifacts of an altar suggest that the few surviving exiles established permanent colonies in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.18-19">Is 19:18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Other Diasporas</p>
<p class="fl">The Egyptian king Ptolemy I (323–285 <span class="era">BC</span>) captured many Jews and carried them off to Egypt about 300 <span class="era">BC</span>. Those exiles populated Alexandria, a city thereafter noted as a center of both Greek and Jewish scholarship. Elsewhere large colonies of Jews were exported from Babylonia to Phrygia and Lydia by Antiochus III (the Great) of Syria (223–187 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Romans transplanted a sizable group of Jews to Rome. The Roman general Pompey took many there as slaves in the first century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>How widely the Jews were scattered is suggested in the NT book of Acts, where Luke listed Jerusalem’s visitors: Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia, Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya toward Cyrene, visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts to Judaism), Cretans, and Arabians (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.9-11">Acts 2:9-11</a>). Those Jews of “the Diaspora” were in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Pentecost.</p>
<p>Other Jewish communities were located in the Macedonian cities visited by the apostle Paul on his missionary journeys: Thessalonica, Berea, and Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.1,10">Acts 17:1, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.2-4">18:2-4</a>). Around the middle of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, the Roman emperor Claudius commanded all Jews to leave Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">18:2</a>). Scholarly estimates of the Jewish population in Palestine at the time of Jesus’ birth range from about four to six million. The dispersion population numbered several times that of Palestine; communities with more than a million each flourished in Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Alexandria. Today, even with a national homeland, far more Jews still live outside Israel than inside.</p>
<p>In spite of their scatterings, Jews of various diasporas retained a basic unity with Palestinian Jews through several practices. (1) The great national feasts—Passover, Harvest, and Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.12-17">Ex 23:12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.1-17">Dt 16:1-17</a>)—continued to be observed abroad. (2) The temple tax used for the temple’s upkeep (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.11-16">Ex 30:11-16</a>) was collected in foreign Jewish communities even after the temple had been destroyed. (3) All Jews everywhere recognized the authority of the Sanhedrin (the Jewish religious council) over them.</p>
<p class="h3">Positive Aspects</p>
<p class="fl">In exile the Jews tended to abandon the idol worship that had in part alienated them from God. Their exile led them to establish synagogues as institutions for prayer and education. Alexandrian Jews translated the OT Scriptures into Greek, at that time the international language. The result, called the Septuagint, was the version often cited by NT writers.</p>
<p>From the Christian point of view, the network of dispersed Jewish communities had a special significance. They provided strategic bases for the spread of Christianity, which quickly broke out of those communities and into the surrounding gentile world. Thus, God used the dispersions to bring the gospel to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.11-15">Rom 1:11-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.11-12">1 Cor 10:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, the arts, sciences, and humanities have been greatly enriched by the Jews scattered throughout Western culture. Few other peoples have endured so much ferocious ethnic bigotry as the Jews and yet rewarded that rejection with cultural gifts and graces of such excellence. Although the church of Jesus Christ has become a “new Israel” and a “chosen race” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>), the testimony of history and of Scripture indicates that God still has a unique interest in the Jews.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DIBON</p>
<p class="list">1. City in Moab, east of the Dead Sea and north of the Arnon River. It was located on the King’s Highway in Amorite territory and was a camping station for the Israelites during the exodus. Israel asked permission of Sihon, the Amorite king, to pass through his territory, but he refused. Israel then fought and defeated Sihon, thus gaining control of Dibon (<a href="?bref=Num.21.30">Nm 21:30</a>). Following the Hebrew conquest of Palestine and its division among the 12 tribes, Dibon was given to Gad (<a href="?bref=Num.32.3,34">32:3, 34</a>), being also referred to as Dibon-gad (<a href="?bref=Num.33.45-46">33:45-46</a>). One biblical reference assigns it to Reuben (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.17">Jos 13:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">During the period of the judges, Moab under King Eglon oppressed Israel and apparently retook Dibon. It was probably recovered under the leadership of Ehud (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-30">Jgs 3:12-30</a>). Subsequently, Dibon was ruled by Israel under King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.2">2 Sm 8:2</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In the preexilic period Dibon was again under Moabite influence (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.18,22">Jer 48:18, 22</a>). Isaiah condemned Dibon (Dimon) as chief among the wicked cities of Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.9">Is 15:9</a>). Dimon is probably a play on words (from the root “blood”) predicting Dibon’s bloody and disastrous fate.</p>
<p class="list-text">In 1868 excavations uncovered the famous Moabite Stone at Dibon, erected by Mesha, king of Moab, who built “Qarhah” as his capital. This may have been a new capital city replacing Dibon, or a renaming of Dibon by Mesha. Most likely “Qarhah” referred to the fact that Dibon was built on two elevations. The higher one was Qarhah, the defensive citadel of the city, surrounded by a wall and possessing a water reservoir, several cisterns, the royal palace, and a shrine (“high place,” <a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>) to Chemosh, the principal god of Moab.</p>
<p class="list-text">Excavations conducted in 1950–56 at Dibon (modern Dhiban) uncovered remains of the city from a period about 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Evidence indicated that it contained only a nomadic population in the period 2100–1300 <span class="era">BC</span> and that it was settled again about 1300 <span class="era">BC</span>. The earliest excavations found five city walls, the oldest dating to about 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. The heaviest wall was from 7½ to almost 11 feet (2 to 3 meters) thick, built with large, well-squared blocks, and is considered to have been built in Mesha’s time.</p>

The practices described in the manual were established much earlier, however. The Didache (which means “teaching”) was compiled from various sources that detail the traditions of well-established church communities.</p>
<p>This handbook contains a number of texts that were intended to instruct new converts in the Christian faith. Chapters 1–6 present the “Two Ways” of life and death, based on <a href="?bref=Deut.30.15">Deuteronomy 30:15</a>. This section resembles many Jewish teachings and may find its source in the apocalyptic writings of the Qumran community (where the Dead Sea Scrolls were compiled). The manual also contains several parallels with the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. These first chapters include a distinctly Christian collection of sayings that resemble Jesus’ teachings about loving one’s neighbor (as recorded by Matthew and Luke).</p>
<p>Chapters 7–10 contain instructions for baptism, fasting, prayer, and the Eucharist. Baptism is to be performed “in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit”; fasting is to be practiced on Wednesdays and Fridays, in contrast with the Jews who fasted on Mondays and Thursdays; and the Lord’s Prayer (with the doxology) is to be recited daily. The prayers in chapters 9 and 10 are based on Jewish table prayers, so it is not clear whether they are meant for the Eucharist or for a common church meal (sometimes called a “love feast”). The prayers contain no references to the words of Jesus at the Last Supper, and they place the blessing of the cup before the blessing of the bread (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16">1 Cor 10:16</a>). The Didache does note that believers are not required to use these model prayers.</p>
<p>Chapters 11–15 give instructions for church leadership. They discuss the marks of true apostles and prophets, who are referred to as “high priests,” and the church’s responsibilities toward them. The Didache ends with a prediction of the imminent return of Christ.</p>
<p>The Jewishness of the Didache may reflect the influence of the Jerusalem church’s teachings. The description of church leadership, however, seems to be drawn from Paul, who details the roles of apostles, prophets, and teachers in 1 Corinthians. The Didache also stresses the function of the prophets. The teachings of the Didache reflect those of a church in the developmental stages of its institutions and practices. The church still appears to be developing characteristics that clearly distinguish it from Judaism. The Didache was highly regarded by the early church. Eusebius listed it with the orthodox writings that were eventually excluded from the NT canon.</p>

<p class="h2" id="HolinessandDietaryLaw">Holiness and Dietary Law</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical laws concerning diet and cleanness were based on the idea of holiness. The underlying meaning of the Hebrew word for “holiness” is difficult to ascertain but most probably was “to cut,” or “to be separate,” or “to set apart.” The Lord told Israel, “You shall be holy to me; for I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> am holy, and have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine” (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.26">Lv 20:26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). God is the supreme example of holiness; he is the one uniquely separate in his character and being (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Is 6:3</a>). But God wanted his covenant people to be holy, too. One of the ways that God made the Israelites different from the other peoples of the world was by giving them dietary laws: “I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.44">Lv 11:44</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Keeping the dietary laws did not automatically make the people “holy” (i.e., separated to God); rather, it was one of the ways OT believers could show their gratitude to God for his deliverance.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BeforeMoses">Before Moses</p>
<p class="fl">From the Creation, God approved all varieties of fruit and vegetables as legitimate, clean food (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.29">Gn 1:29</a>). After the fall of humanity, God distinguished between clean and unclean animals. At the time of Noah, God directed that additional specimens of clean animals be taken aboard the ark (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.2">7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.8.20">8:20</a>). After the Flood, God prohibited the eating of blood because blood represented life (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.4">9:4</a>). To commemorate the patriarch Jacob’s wrestling with the Angel of the Lord, Jacob’s descendants refrained from eating a certain hip muscle (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.32">32:32</a>), though that was not a command from God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMosaicLaw">The Mosaic Law</p>
<p class="fl">The primary revelation of the Lord’s dietary standards for Israel was given through Moses. Dietary laws are found among the ceremonial regulations received at Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">Lv 11</a>). Moses repeated many of those laws 39 years later, shortly before the people entered the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.3-21">Dt 14:3-21</a>). The dietary laws concerned only animal products, except for the prohibition of wine to certain people (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.9">Lv 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.3-4">Nm 6:3-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.13.14">Jgs 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.35.6">Jer 35:6</a>).</p>
<p>Five categories of living things were regulated for food. To be edible an animal had to have cloven (divided) hooves and had to chew its cud. According to Leviticus, that requirement ruled out camels, horses, rabbits, and pigs (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.2-8">Lv 11:2-8</a>). Sea life had to have fins and scales (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.11.9-12">9-12</a>). Birds were edible if they were not predatory (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.11.13-19">13-19</a>); Moses went on to list 20 species specifically prohibited because they were birds of prey or scavengers. Winged insects were forbidden (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.11.22-23">22-23</a>) except for certain types of locusts and grasshoppers (food commonly eaten by desert nomads). Finally, “the animals that move about on the ground,” including reptiles and rodents (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.11.29-31">29-31</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>), were ruled out.</p>
<p>Further prohibitions were made about food that otherwise would have been considered clean. For example, nothing found already dead (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.21">Dt 14:21</a>) or that had been torn by beasts (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.15">Lv 17:15</a>) was to be eaten. Food could become defiled by contact with some other thing that was unclean, like a dead mouse that happened to fall into a food container (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.32-34">11:32-34</a>). A young goat was not to be boiled in its mother’s milk (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.19">Ex 23:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.26">34:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.21">Dt 14:21</a>). When clean animals were slaughtered, their blood was to be drained out (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.14">Lv 17:14</a>). All pieces of fat (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.16">3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.23">7:23</a>), especially a sheep’s fat tail (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.22">Ex 29:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.3.9">Lv 3:9</a>), were restricted for use in sacrifices to the Lord. Through Moses the Lord reiterated the prohibition against eating blood (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.10">Lv 17:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.26">19:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.16">Dt 12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.23">15:23</a>).</p>
<p>Several reasons, stated in or inferred from Scripture, account for the dietary laws and apply to the Bible’s cleanness regulations in general. Some seem to be natural reasons; others may be symbolic or relational.</p>
<p class="h3">Hygiene</p>
<p class="fl">Some dietary laws, such as those against eating vermin or decomposing flesh, circumvented obvious health hazards and were given for the people’s protection. But hygiene alone cannot account for all the regulations; in fact, some foods that might have been acceptable from a hygienic viewpoint, such as rabbit or clams, were excluded.</p>
<p class="h3">Aversion</p>
<p class="fl">Worms and snakes are generally considered loathsome, whatever their actual food value. Such animals were not <span class="ital">kosher</span> (proper).</p>
<p class="h3">Relationship to Pagan Practice</p>
<p class="fl">Boiling a young goat in its mother’s milk has now been documented as a pagan rite among Moses’ contemporaries, the Canaanites. God’s people were not to imitate the practices of the peoples around them (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.9">Dt 18:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="AfterMoses">After Moses</p>
<p class="fl">The dietary laws given at Mt Sinai continued to be recognized throughout Israel’s history. Before the birth of Samson, the child’s mother was warned, “Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean” (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.4">Jgs 13:4</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). During the Philistine wars of the next century (c. 1041 <span class="era">BC</span>), King Saul’s soldiers sinned by disregarding requirements about the proper draining of blood from animals (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.32-34">1 Sm 14:32-34</a>).</p>
<p>Later, when the Israelites were exiled in heathen lands, they were faced with situations in which the selection of food and its preparation could render it unclean (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.12-14">Ez 4:12-14</a>). Daniel’s refusal to be defiled by pagan delicacies at Nebuchadnezzar’s Babylonian court (605 <span class="era">BC</span>) illustrated his loyalty to God (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.8">Dn 1:8</a>).</p>
<p>From the prophet Isaiah’s day (740 <span class="era">BC</span>) onward, the most abhorrent food to the Israelites was the meat of swine (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.4">Is 65:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.3,17">66:3, 17</a>). In the Maccabean period the “abomination of desolation,” which the Jewish hero Judas Maccabeus and his followers resisted to the death, included sacrifices of pigs on the temple altar in Jerusalem by the pagan ruler Antiochus Epiphanes (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.54,62-63">1 Macc 1:54, 62-63</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.5">2 Macc 6:5</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.7.1">7:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Symbolism">Symbolism</p>
<p class="fl">Certain food products were ruled out because of something they symbolized. God said not to eat blood: “Be sure that you do not eat the blood; for the blood is the life, and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.23">Dt 12:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Blood had a ritual function. It was used to make atonement on God’s altar and therefore was not to be eaten (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.11-12">Lv 17:11-12</a>). The NT writers recognized the sacrificial blood of the OT as a “type” or foreshadowing of the blood of Jesus Christ shed on the cross as a sacrifice for sin (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.1,4,12">Heb 10:1, 4, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-19">1 Pt 1:18-19</a>). A symbolic regard for maternal life may explain why one who came upon a bird’s nest was allowed to take the eggs or the young but had to leave the mother bird unharmed (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.6-7">Dt 22:6-7</a>). The need to preserve a fragile desert ecosystem may also have been a factor.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ReactionsfromtheChurch">Reactions from the Church</p>
<p class="fl">At first the early church, with its Jewish background, found it difficult to break away from Hebrew dietary traditions. The apostle Peter was given a vision, repeated three times, about no longer calling either non-Jewish food or the non-Jews who ate it “unclean” (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.9-16">Acts 10:9-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.1-10">11:1-10</a>). Later, a council at Jerusalem officially decided not to retain Moses’ ceremonialism in the church, except that gentile Christians should abstain “from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.20">Acts 15:20</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>) in order not to offend Jewish Christians. That was an application of the NT teaching of consideration for those with sensitive consciences. “Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. . . . But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin” (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.20,23">Rom 14:20, 23</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>Jewish dietary laws also have relevance to Christians because of certain OT promises. God promised, first to Abraham and, by reiteration or allusion, throughout the OT, that the Gentiles would be included in his covenant. By preserving the health of the Hebrew people, God was ensuring their continuation as a nation. According to the NT, the salvation of both Jews and Gentiles was achieved by Christ, a Jew. The nation through which Christ came was protected in order that God’s promise could be fulfilled. Thus, the dietary laws need not be seen as burdensome restrictions of the law; they were part of God’s way of working out his redemptive plan.</p>

<p>Part of the name may have referred to the Macedonian month Dios, but the significance of the rest is unknown.

<p>In the Gospels the immediate followers of Jesus, called by his authority from a wide variety of circumstances, not only the Twelve but all those who were sympathetic to his teaching and committed to him, are called “disciples.” The calling of these disciples took place at a time when other teachers had their disciples, most notably the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.18">Mk 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.33">Lk 5:33</a>) and John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.14">Mt 9:14</a>). It is evident from the practice of John the Baptist that different leaders called for different disciplines from their followers. John’s way was considerably more ascetic in character than that of Jesus; however, it too involved not only teaching regarding conduct and manner of life, but also a distinctive pattern of praying (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.1">Lk 11:1</a>).</p>
<p>The disciples of Jesus had a unique experience. Not only did they benefit from the immediate teaching of Jesus, his looks and tones of voice (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.21">Mk 10:21</a>) as well as his words, but they were also witnesses of the unfolding drama of redemption that had Christ as its center. They followed a teacher who embodied the substance of that teaching. The first disciples could be taught by Christ only little by little, not only because of the need to remove their misconceptions (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21">Mt 16:21</a>), but also because the full significance of what Jesus said and did could not be most fully appreciated until after the events of his death and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.9">Mt 28:9</a>). It is not surprising that the period of “discipling” covered the time before and after Christ’s death and resurrection, and also after Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit taught the disciples about matters that they could not “bear” while Jesus remained on earth (<a href="?bref=John.16.12">Jn 16:12</a>).</p>
<p>Groups of Jesus’ first disciples, both the Twelve and the Seventy (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.20">Mt 26:20</a>: <a href="?bref=Luke.10.1">Lk 10:1</a>), received his teaching, taught others in turn (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.1-11">Lk 10:1-11</a>), and were given power to heal (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.1">Mt 10:1</a>). They were also to proclaim the message of salvation through Christ. Yet the Twelve were given special prominence, and with the exception of Judas Iscariot (whose place was taken by Matthias, <a href="?bref=Acts.1.26">Acts 1:26</a>), they became the foundation teachers of the newly emerging Christian church. Their authority in the church, given by Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">Mt 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.16-20">28:16-20</a>), was to be characterized by a unique style of self-giving service (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.24-30">Lk 22:24-30</a>). To this group of disciples, who came to be known as the apostles (though this term is occasionally given to a wider application), Saul of Tarsus was added. At his conversion on the road to Damascus, he saw the risen Lord and was immediately commissioned by Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.12,16">Gal 1:12, 16</a>) as the apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.15">Acts 9:15</a>).</p>
<p>At the time of his ascension Christ commissioned the first disciples to “make disciples of all nations” (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Mt 28:19</a>); hence, the term “disciple” is also used in the book of Acts to describe believers, those who confess Christ. Though they have not been directly called by Christ himself, such disciples are called by Christ’s Spirit through the message delivered by the first disciples; disciples called later are not in any sense inferior to the first disciples, even though they are less privileged. It was proper for early Christians to be called disciples of Jesus of Nazareth or simply “the disciples” (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-2,7">Acts 6:1-2, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.36">9:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">11:26</a>) because they were carrying on the teaching of Jesus and living the life he had exemplified. They were thus recognized as a “school” or living community that embodied the teaching of their “master” in practice. The book of 1 John emphasizes that only those who keep Christ’s commandments show real love for God (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.3-6">1 Jn 2:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.10-11">3:10-11</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Learning that molds character and enforces correct behavior—from a Latin word meaning “instruction” or “training.” To discipline a person or a group means to put them in a state of good order so that they function in the way intended. Discipline, in spite of a popular misconception, is not inherently stern or harsh. Bible translators chose “disciple” as an appropriate term for one who learns by following.</p>

<p class="fl">Although used only once in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> (<a href="?bref=Job.36.10">Jb 36:10</a>), the word “discipline,” in various noun and verb forms, occurs frequently in modern versions of the Bible. The Hebrew and Greek words commonly rendered “discipline” are sometimes translated as “reproof,” “warning,” “restraint,” “correction,” or (especially in <span class="sc">kjv</span>) “chastisement.” More positive synonyms include “upbringing,” “training,” “instruction,” and “education.”</p>
<p>OT usage of “discipline” is noticeably more negative than in the NT, principally because of the legal aspect of God’s approach to Israel under the old (Mosaic) covenant. The “new covenant” approach to the church leads to a more positive language of discipline in the NT. Yet both covenants had the same goal: righteousness. Considered in that light, even the OT emphasis on punishment proceeds from a positive motive toward a constructive goal. Where the OT emphasized retaliation, it was to teach offenders the nature of their offense by showing them an effect like the one they had caused. Vindication of a wronged person’s rights also vindicated God’s righteousness. Vindication was an important way of upholding God’s justice. Retribution was also important. Covenant breaking brought on the covenant curse (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.26">Dt 27:26</a>) in the form of punitive discipline. Retribution reestablished the authority of God’s law and taught respect for his standards of righteousness.</p>
<p>Complementary to punitive discipline, positive discipline can be thought of as reinforcive discipline. God always disciplines; he does so punitively when necessary, but reinforcingly when possible.</p>
<p>Discipline is frequently spoken of as being exercised by God over Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.23">Lv 26:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.36">Dt 4:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.8.5">8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.18">Jer 31:18</a>), over the nations (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.10">Ps 94:10</a>), or over individuals (<a href="?bref=Job.5.17">Jb 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.10,12">Ps 94:10, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-11">Heb 12:5-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.19">Rv 3:19</a>). In Israel parental responsibility to discipline children was taken seriously (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.18">Dt 21:18</a>). Fathers were solemnly charged to discipline their sons (<a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">Prv 13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.15">22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.13">23:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.29.17">29:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.6.4">Eph 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.7-10">Heb 12:7-10</a>). In the church, disciplining was a pastoral responsibility (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.25">2 Tm 2:25</a>).</p>
<p>It is understandable that people fear discipline from God (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.1">Ps 6:1</a>), but it is his wrath that should be feared. His wrath is directed only against those who have proved themselves by their actions to be God’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.2-3">Dt 11:2-3</a>). God’s discipline is different from his wrath and should not be despised (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.11">Prv 3:11</a>) or taken for granted (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.5">Heb 12:5</a>). Only a fool or wicked person hates it (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.17">Ps 50:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.5.12">Prv 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.18">Jer 31:18</a>). God disciplines his people as a loving father disciplines a beloved son (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.5">Dt 8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.11-12">Prv 3:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-7">Heb 12:5-7</a>). According to Scripture, a wise person should love discipline (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.1">Prv 12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.7">2 Tm 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5,9">Heb 12:5, 9</a>).</p>
<p>The fruit of discipline is knowledge (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.1">Prv 12:1</a>) and parents’ delight (<a href="?bref=Pr.29.17">29:17</a>). One who is disciplined can be spoken of as “blessed” (<a href="?bref=Job.5.17">Jb 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.12">Ps 94:12</a>). Where the purpose of discipline is left unspecified, the discipline is nevertheless understood as good and righteous (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.36">Dt 4:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.36.10">Jb 36:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">Prv 13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.19">Rv 3:19</a>). Specifically, discipline is called “the way of life” (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.23">Prv 6:23</a>). It saves one from destruction (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.18">19:18</a>) and allows one to escape both folly (<a href="?bref=Pr.22.15">22:15</a>) and God’s condemnation of the world (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.32">1 Cor 11:32</a>). It eventually leads to sharing God’s holiness (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.7">Heb 12:7</a>), and yields “the peaceful fruit of righteousness” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.12.11">11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In contrast, the consequences of a lack of discipline are stipulated to be abandonment by God (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.23-24">Lv 26:23-24</a>), death (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.23">Prv 5:23</a>), and destruction (<a href="?bref=Pr.19.18">19:18</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Proverbs speaks of discipline as necessary to avoid sexual immorality (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.12-23">5:12-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.23-24">6:23-24</a>). Loose or wicked women probably symbolize many kinds of deceptive and enticing situations. To be able to act maturely and responsibly in such situations requires that young people respond to wise and loving parental discipline so that they learn to live disciplined lives. They will then do by “bent of nature” what is right because their nature has been shaped to what it right. Evil can then be shunned, even when it is encountered unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews also urges its readers to respond to discipline rather than to react against it. In Hebrews two harmful reactions are stipulated and the helpful response is identified. On the one hand, no individual should regard lightly the discipline of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.5">Heb 12:5</a>). Discipline should be regarded neither as worthless nor as being of little value. On the other hand, one should not lose courage when he is punished by the Lord. That is, preoccupation with the negative aspect of the disciplinary procedure must not obscure its goal or demoralize persons being disciplined. There is a purpose for what happens, which should be sought and realized: “No discipline is enjoyable while it happening—it is painful! But afterward there will be a quiet harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.11">Heb 12:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The exhortation is not to reject discipline or be dejected by it, but to accept it and be instructed by it.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Self-Discipline">Self-Discipline</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus’ ethics of righteousness both fulfill and surpass the stringent code of the old covenant (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.17-48">Mt 5:17-48</a>). Yet Christians are not therefore inherently more legalistic than were the Pharisees. Set free from “the law of sin and death,” Christians have “the law of the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-8">Rom 8:1-8</a>) to provide a built-in dynamic to fulfill the will of God. Beyond slavish obedience to the letter of the law, believers are enabled by the indwelling Spirit of God to exercise self-discipline. Spiritual transformation is accompanied by renewal of the mind (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>), which brings fresh understanding of oneself, one’s motivations, and one’s attitudes.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="DisciplineIsGoodForUs"/>
<p class="h2" id="ParentalDiscipline">Parental Discipline</p>
<p class="fl">The family constitutes the basic unit of the human community. Within that cell of intimate relationships, parents are entrusted with the responsibility of guiding and correcting their children (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.7">Dt 6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.6">Prv 22:6</a>). The biblical view is essentially pessimistic about the perfectibility of human nature. Therefore, parents are urged not to leave children at the mercy of their own natural tendencies. Undisciplined children are potential victims of the powerful conditioning exerted by a predominantly pagan culture. To exercise their responsibilities properly, parents must model values, practices, and attitudes to their children, besides teaching them through instruction and correction.</p>
<p>The parents’ educational task is best accomplished through positive means such as advice, exhortation, counseling, family devotions, and Christian training in church and Sunday school. But it also may require negative measures, such as prohibitions and disciplinary action. When verbal admonitions are not heeded by small children, punishment becomes an effective form of persuasion (<a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">Prv 13:24</a>). Physical discipline, however, should be administered on the basis of clearly stated and understood principles. Christian parents must avoid punishing out of anger or personal animosity, and must never cause injury to a child. Physical discipline should be viewed as a last resort intended to obtain maximum educational results with minimum outrage to children (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.4">Eph 6:4</a>).</p>
<p>Human fallenness (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Gn 3</a>) means that self-centeredness infects even children (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.51.5">Ps 51:5</a>). Somehow children must learn respect for themselves and for others. Left on their own and then battered by a fallen society, they can become rebellious social misfits leaving a trail of heartache in their own lives and in the lives of other people. Love for one’s children does not preclude the use of negative disciplinary measures. As distasteful as they may seem to both parents and children, genuine love may require them. A family environment regulated by consistent and loving firmness will enhance the chances for children to mature as responsible and considerate individuals.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChurchDiscipline">Church Discipline</p>
<p class="fl">The church is basically a large family of which each believer is a member. The nature of the church—as a community intended to reflect in the faith, worship, and lives of its members the true character of God—distinguishes it from all other groups.</p>
<p>At the same time, the church is called to be an open community of concern, reaching out in compassion to desperately needy human beings. Christian lifestyles clearly differ from pagan lifestyles. That difference often creates a barrier isolating the “lost” from the very people who could extend to them God’s deliverance from loneliness, addictions, disorientation, broken relationships, and so on. The church has a responsibility not to place unscriptural obstacles in the way of its outreach to unbelievers, yet the tension between openness and purity is difficult to resolve. Without a careful balance, a church can easily become unduly restrictive or overly permissive. In either extreme its witness is impaired.</p>
<p>The solution to the dilemma lies in formulating church discipline that is authentically biblical. The Scriptures provide the church with ample guidance for the formulation of standards of conduct (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">Ex 20:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.11">1 Cor 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">6:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.25-32">Eph 4:25-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.1-21">5:1-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.5-11">Col 3:5-11</a>). As those standards are spelled out, however, it is necessary to differentiate between biblical absolutes and cultural norms. For instance, though drunkenness is expressly forbidden in the NT, there is no scriptural prohibition on the drinking of wine. Some churches allow drinking but decry drunkenness, others recommend abstinence to their members, and still others make abstinence from alcoholic beverages a condition of membership. The NT, recognizing that conflict sometimes occurs between Christian liberty and Christian responsibility, gives guidelines for resolving such conflicts (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">1 Cor 8</a>).</p>
<p>For the sake of scriptural consistency and in order to be credible, church discipline should oppose sins of attitude with the same severity as for “gross sins.” The NT condemns immorality, murder, and drunkenness—but along with them envy, jealousy, anger, selfishness, complaining, and criticism. Each of the vices is an impediment to entering the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-21">Gal 5:19-21</a>). Unbelievers are often made to feel unwelcome in the church because of secondary matters such as smoking or drinking. Yet gossiping, complaining, and selfishness among church members are seldom exposed and properly disciplined. A more consistent position would promote the purity of the church and would also enhance its ministry as a supportive, accepting center of Christian love.</p>
<p>In addition to affirming the necessity for discipline within the church, the NT delineates a procedure for carrying out disciplinary action (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.15-18">Mt 18:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.3-13">1 Cor 5:3-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.1">Gal 6:1</a>). Offenders are first to be approached and admonished privately. If they refuse to repent or mend their ways, the case is to be presented before the leadership of the church and then, if necessary, before the whole congregation. Should offenders persist in their error, they are to be ostracized, not out of vindictiveness but with the hope of bringing them to repentance and restoration (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.14-15">2 Thes 3:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible’s emphasis on the necessity for self-discipline, parental discipline, and church discipline seems underscored by the moral decline evident in many areas of modern society. God’s love, as depicted in the Bible and exemplified in Jesus Christ, is intended to teach all people how to live. Those who spurn God’s “positive reinforcement” encounter the negative aspects of his discipline. Christians who discipline themselves, their children, and each other in a loving way honor Christ and model his way of life, thus helping others to understand God’s purposes.</p>

  <title>Disease</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DISEASE</p>
<p class="fl">Term used in Scripture synonymously with sickness, infirmity, illness, plague, and pestilence. However, plague and pestilence are generally used when there are large numbers of victims, as in epidemics. “Pestilence” literally means “destruction” and usually describes an epidemic with a high mortality rate. “Affliction” and “torment” are other terms that may include disease, but are broader and are not used synonymously with disease.</p>
<p>During the time the Bible was written, people did not have a detailed concept of anatomy or of how the specific organs of the body functioned. Disease was thought of as abnormal, something that limits one’s ability to function with strength and vitality. The Hebrew word translated “sickness” as a noun means “to be weak” in its cognate verb form. The sick man by the pool of Bethesda is described as being “impotent” (<a href="?bref=John.5.7">Jn 5:7</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), unable to get around by himself.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SourcesofDisease">Sources of Disease</p>
<p class="fl">According to the Bible, disease has four sources: (1) God, (2) Satan, (3) sins of ancestors, and (4) breaking of physical, mental/emotional, or moral laws of nature.</p>
<p class="h3">God</p>
<p class="fl">All early peoples attributed events and phenomena to the supernatural, either to various gods or to evil spirits. The Hebrews were different by being strong monotheists, attributing all phenomena to the one true God who had revealed himself to them (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.21">Is 45:21</a>). God was responsible for everything, including disease and evil (v <a href="?bref=Isa.45.7">7</a>). This same God could also give material blessings, health, and heal all diseases (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.3">Ps 103:3</a>). To the Hebrews, God could give health or sickness, and in either case, he had his purpose or reason.</p>
<p>One purpose of disease was punishment for wrongdoing (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1,12-16">2 Sm 24:1, 12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.8">1 Cor 10:8</a>). In the Hebrew mind, even when the immediate cause of the disease and death was obvious—as in many poisonous snakes biting people in the camp—the response was not to kill all the snakes but to pray to God for forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Nm 21:4-9</a>). Leprosy, which literally means “a smiting,” was a devastating disease sent by God to punish individuals who sinned (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-16">Nm 12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.27">2 Kgs 5:27</a>).</p>
<p>God also sent disease to demonstrate his power or to protect his people. The 10 plagues in Egypt illustrate the former; the elimination of Sennacherib’s army, the latter (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.34-36">2 Kgs 19:34-36</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Satan</p>
<p class="fl">Satan and other evil spirits could also be responsible for disease. In the biblical scheme of things, Satan’s ability to bring disease is in the permissive will of God. The restriction on Satan’s capacity for harm is clearly spelled out in the case of Job (<a href="?bref=Job.1.12">Jb 1:12</a>). The message of the NT is also clear that, despite cases of demonpossession and of people acting under Satan’s influence, Satan’s time is finite and his ultimate total defeat and destruction are certain.</p>
<p class="h3">Sins of Ancestors</p>
<p class="fl">Sickness could also come about because of the sins of one’s ancestors (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.5">Ex 20:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.26.29">Lv 26:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.18">1 Kgs 17:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.21.19">Jb 21:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.5.7">Lam 5:7</a>). The most striking example of this is the death of David’s son as a result of his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.15">2 Sm 12:15</a>). This concept of the origin of disease continued into NT times and was familiar to the disciples of Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.9.2">Jn 9:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Violation of Natural Laws</p>
<p class="fl">This idea sets the Hebrews apart from the other peoples of their day. With the understanding that disease can follow the violation of fixed physical, mental/emotional, and moral laws comes the idea of personal accountability in obeying these laws and avoiding disease. A person is responsible for his and the community’s health and is not merely a passive victim of supernatural forces.</p>
<p>Based on this concept, Moses set up elaborate codes of behavior to maintain personal health and the health of the community. The Mosaic law covers the areas of diet, personal hygiene, Sabbath observance, sanitary regulations in the camp, cleanliness, and sexual relations. In following these natural laws established by God, the Hebrews could expect freedom from disease (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.26">Ex 15:26</a>) and long life (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.1-2">Prv 3:1-2</a>). These health laws of Moses make a lot of sense from a public health point of view even today and are far more rational than the approach of any other ancient people.</p>
<p>Another major consequence of understanding that disease can follow the breaking of the laws of nature is the shift away from the priest and toward physicians when looking for cures. As long as diseases were of supernatural origin, there was no basis for attempting to learn about disease processes in the search for cures. The Hebrews were familiar with physicians in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.2">Gn 50:2</a>), where they seem to have functioned as embalmers. Physicians were practicing in Israel throughout its history, but only gradually developed the capacity to be of much help (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.12">2 Chr 16:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.26">Mk 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Col 4:14</a>). While validating the use of physicians for sick people (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.12">Mt 9:12</a>) and of drugs for medicinal purposes (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.6">Prv 31:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.23">1 Tm 5:23</a>), the Scriptures emphasize the role of the Christian community and its elders in ministering to the sick (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.14">Jas 5:14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusChristandDisease">Jesus Christ and Disease</p>
<p class="fl">Christ’s approach to people with disease was distinctly different than that of the OT. He was nonjudgmental, interacting with them as people of worth, not as social outcasts. He was full of genuine compassion for them as suffering people—touching them, comforting them, healing them, and speaking normally and naturally with them.</p>
<p>Jesus evidently thought of disease as a hindrance that prevented people from being the whole persons they were created to be. When confronted by a woman with a severe back deformity of 18 years duration, he healed her, saying she had been “bound by Satan” (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.16">Lk 13:16</a>). His healing of incurable diseases was one of the proofs he offered that he was the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.19-23">Lk 7:19-23</a>). His ministry was directed toward releasing men and women to live life more abundantly (<a href="?bref=John.10.10">Jn 10:10</a>). He did not fully subscribe to the punitive concept of disease (<a href="?bref=John.9.3">9:3</a>). When a leper mentioned the possibility that it might not be God’s will for him to be well, Jesus healed him instantly (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.40">Mk 1:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.12-13">Lk 5:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus was always concerned with the person’s total health or wholeness, rather than merely the symptoms of disease. He frequently dealt with spiritual issues first, even though the sick person was brought to him for a physical problem. His conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well focused on the basic conflicts in her disturbed personality (<a href="?bref=John.4.5-30">Jn 4:5-30</a>). And the Sermon on the Mount, which basically deals with right attitudes and motives for human behavior, would greatly reduce personal and social suffering if it were followed. To Jesus, health is more than the mere absence of physical and mental disease; it is whole persons being all that they were meant to be.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">DIVORCE</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical provisions regulating divorce are closely bound up with the various definitions given to marriage within the successive phases of God’s progressive revelation in history.</p>
<p>In the Genesis Creation account, marriage is defined as the “one flesh” union established by God in the context of a sinless environment (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>). Given such conditions, the dissolution of the marriage relationship was inconceivable. During his ministry, Jesus affirmed this aspect of God’s original design for marriage. He described the implications of the “one flesh” relationship as the abrogation of the separatedness of the spouses and the creation of an inviolable union (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.6">Mt 19:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheOldTestamentsViewonDivorce">The Old Testament’s View on Divorce</p>
<p class="fl">The disruptions brought about by the fall had grievous consequences for the male/female relationship. Having allowed sin to sever their primary dependency on God, man and woman became respectively subject to the elements from which they had been originally made. Man became subject to the dust of the ground whence he had come (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.19">3:19</a>), and woman became subject to the man from whom she had been formed (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.22">2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.16">3:16</a>). Prior to the fall, man and woman had enjoyed a relationship of equality as cosharers in the divine image (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.27">1:27</a>) and as partners in the divine mandate to exercise dominion over creation (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">28</a>). After the fall man became ruler over woman, and woman became subject to man (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16">3:16</a>).</p>
<p>As a result of these new conditions, man assumed rights of disposition over woman that he did not possess prior to the fall. The “one flesh” relation was violated when the right of rulership opened the way for the male ruler to multiply the number of his female subjects. This disparity between male and female resulted in the practice of polygamy (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.19">Gn 4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.16.3">16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.29.30">29:30</a>) and of serial monogamy, which required the termination of each successive marriage by an act of divorce (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.1-4">Dt 24:1-4</a>). Thus, the emergence of the practice of divorce appeared as the inevitable consequence of the principle of male rulership. Neither rulership nor divorce was part of God’s original design for the marriage relationship. The Mosaic regulation on divorce was a concession made by God to the fallen condition of mankind (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.8">Mt 19:8</a>). Characteristically, the option of divorce was a right available only to the male rulers. As subjects of their male rulers, wives became the victims of divorce. Men could divorce their wives; women could not divorce their husbands.</p>
<p>As unfair as it may seem, the Deuteronomic provisions for divorce were actually intended to offer a modicum of protection for its female victims. A husband had to justify a divorce action against his wife by citing something indecent about her. He was to give his divorced wife a bill of divorce that accounted for her marriage to him (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.1">Dt 24:1</a>). Moreover, a divorced husband was forbidden to remarry his ex-wife after her subsequent marriage, since his original divorce was viewed as a defilement of her (v <a href="?bref=Deut.24.4">4</a>).</p>
<p>Although the Mosaic dispositions on divorce were granted as a divine concession to Israel’s hardness of heart, the OT emphatically states that God hates divorce (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.16">Mal 2:16</a>). The right of divorce was grudgingly granted as an accommodation to the principle of male rulership that had resulted from the fall. But God’s original design, reflected in the “one flesh” marital relation, remained the standard for the union of man and woman in marriage.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusTeachingonDivorce">Jesus’ Teaching on Divorce</p>
<p class="fl">Inasmuch as Christ’s ministry of redemption signaled a return to God’s original purposes in Creation, the old covenant regulations on divorce were abrogated in the Christian community. In order to justify the inviolability of the marriage bond among his followers, Jesus directed them to the creational model. Referring negatively to the intervening Mosaic allowance for divorce, Jesus upheld God’s original creation order by stating that “from the beginning it was not so” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.8">Mt 19:8</a>). Christ repudiated the fall and affirmed the Creation design.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Matt.5.31-32">Matthew 5:31-32</a> Jesus explicitly abrogated the Mosaic legislation that allowed men to divorce their wives. He viewed the practice as a violation of the integrity of women. Adulterous men who divorce their wives reduce them to the status of whores, using them as commodities to be passed around through the expediency of easy divorce. By divorcing their wives, men treat them as adulteresses. By marrying a woman discarded from a previous marriage, a man perpetuates the demeaning process and becomes guilty of adultery.</p>
<p>Jesus deliberately withdrew from men the ruler’s right of discarding a wife at will and reinstated the creational pattern of the lifelong “one flesh” union. His disciples understood his intent accurately. But the principle of male privilege was so deeply ingrained in their mentality that they declared the freedom available in celibacy preferable to a commitment to lifelong monogamous marriage (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.10">Mt 19:10</a>).</p>
<p>Not only did Jesus reaffirm the validity of the “one flesh” union for the community of redemption, but the NT reinforced the inviolability of the marriage bond by defining it as an earthly copy of the relationship between Christ and the church (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.25">Eph 5:25</a>).</p>
<p>Despite such strong sanctions for the permanency of the marriage bond, the NT permits divorce as an exception intended to protect the innocent spouse in the case of immorality and desertion. Jesus made exceptions that established the right of a spouse wronged by an unfaithful mate to press for divorce (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.32">Mt 5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.9">19:9</a>). Obviously, the wronged spouse has the option of maintaining the marriage bond despite the breach of commitment by the unfaithful mate. But in view of the exception allowed by Scripture, the obligation to maintain or reinstate the disrupted marriage may not be imposed upon the innocent spouse.</p>
<p>The other exception that justifies divorce, according to the NT, is desertion. Although the provisions of <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.15">1 Corinthians 7:15</a> refer primarily to desertion by an unbelieving spouse, it should be noted that a believer guilty of desertion is to be treated as an unbeliever (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.8">1 Tm 5:8</a>). Behavior equivalent to the abandonment of the marriage relationship constitutes a breach of conjugal commitment and becomes subject to the provision stated in <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.15">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>.</p>
<p>In either case, adultery or desertion, the aggrieved party has the right to seek divorce from the offending spouse and, having obtained it, becomes again a single person. Should repentance and reconciliation fail to restore the violated union, the aggrieved spouse is not bound to the marriage. According to Scripture, a person who is not bound is free to remarry, but only “in the Lord,” meaning to another Christian (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.39">1 Cor 7:39</a>). The injunction for a single person who does not have the gift of celibacy to marry (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.9">9</a>) applies to a person formerly married but who has become single by a scripturally legitimate divorce. In keeping with Christ’s teaching in <a href="?bref=Mark.10.11-12">Mark 10:11-12</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.16.18">Luke 16:18</a>, the remarriage of believers may not be approved when the divorce has been used as a means of changing mates, since such intent makes the divorce adulterous.</p>
<p>Many factors usually combine to destroy a marriage; therefore, the church must deal with each case of divorce and remarriage on an individual basis, taking into account God’s inexhaustible capacity to forgive sin and to restore broken lives. Obviously, the scriptural restrictions on divorce do not apply to believers whose broken marriages predate their conversion, since God’s forgiveness wipes clean the sin of their pre-Christian past and makes them new creatures in Christ.</p>

The reason for his presence at the sanctuary at Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.7">1 Sm 21:7</a>) is not clear, though he had some religious purpose in being there, maybe being detained while in a purification process (e.g., a Nazirite vow, <a href="?bref=Num.6.13">Nm 6:13</a>). Possibly he secretly hid there as a spy for Saul.

It is mentioned occasionally in connection with events in the period of the judges and the united monarchy (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.11">Jos 17:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.29">1 Chr 7:29</a>). Dor is probably the same city as Naphath-dor (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.23">Jos 12:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.11">1 Kgs 4:11</a>) and Naphoth-dor (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.2">Jos 11:2</a>). During the days of the Conquest, the king of Dor joined Jabin’s confederacy against Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.2">Jos 11:2</a>), but was defeated (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.23">12:23</a>). The city was assigned to Manasseh’s tribe, but the tribe failed to dispossess its inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">DORCAS</p>
<p class="fl">Christian woman in Joppa of Judea, noted for her acts of charity (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.36-41">Acts 9:36-41</a>). Dorcas is called a disciple in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.36">Acts 9:36</a>, which is the only instance where the feminine form of the word is used in the Greek NT. Her ethnic origins are not known, since Dorcas, her Greek name, was in common use among both Jews and Greeks. The Aramaic equivalent, Tabitha, meant “gazelle.”</p>
<p>When Dorcas died, the apostle Peter was nearby at Lydda. In response to news of his healing ministry there, two men were sent to bring Peter to Joppa. When he arrived, the body had been prepared for burial and placed in an upper room. Peter sent the mourners from the room, knelt to pray, and raised Dorcas back to life. Her restoration was the first of such miracles performed by an apostle.</p>

<p class="h1">DOTHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient city located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Jerusalem, 13 miles (21 kilometers) north of the city of Samaria, and about 5 miles (8 kilometers) southeast of Megiddo. The two cities of En-gannim (modern Jenin) and Ibleam guarded a narrow pass on the road leading to Dothan and on to the coastal plain.</p>
<p>The mound of Tell Dotha, site of Dothan, rises 200 feet (61 meters) above the surrounding plain to a height of 1,200 feet (365.6 meters) above sea level. The top of the mound comprises some 10 acres (4 hectares). From there one can look out upon fertile land boasting good crops. Flocks pasture here as they did in biblical times, drawn to the area in part by the adequate water supplied by its springs.</p>
<p>Dothan was the place where Joseph’s brothers sold him to a caravan of Ishmaelites (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.1-36">Gn 37</a>). A millennium later the city was surrounded by Syrian forces in an attempt to capture Elisha, who lived there and who was thought to be betraying the Syrian plans to the Israelite king (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.8-14">2 Kgs 6:8-14</a>). Dothan was mentioned also in the lists of places conquered by Pharaoh Thutmose III and, in the intertestamental period, in connection with the military campaigns of Holofernes.</p>

  <title>Dreams</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">DREAMS</p>
<p class="fl">Thoughts, images, or emotions occurring during sleep. Dreams have always fascinated people; the events experienced in dreams are too vivid and real to be ignored.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AncientUnderstanding">Ancient Understanding</p>
<p class="fl">From the earliest times people viewed dreams as a mystery, provoking speculation about another actual sphere of existence in which the person lived and acted while the body slept. Dreams, especially those of emperors and kings, were held to be messages from the gods.</p>
<p>Ancient recorded dreams focused on three main areas: religion, politics, and personal destiny. Religious dreams called for piety and devotion to the gods. Political dreams supposedly forecast the outcome of battles and the future destiny of nations. Personal dreams guided family decisions and presaged serious crises.</p>
<p>Sometimes the god took the initiative and forewarned the person about something unexpected. Sometimes the ruler or general would go to a pagan temple or holy place and sleep there, hoping to bring on a dream that would help him cope with some serious problem. In some dreams the message was clear; more often it had to be discovered by individuals who specialized in dream interpretation. Records were kept concerning specific dreams and the subsequent events.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentUse">Old Testament Use</p>
<p class="fl">Dreams played an important part in the lives of God’s people. Of the nearly 120 references to dreams in the OT, 52 come in Genesis during the early patriarchal period and 29 in the book of Daniel. In reality, however, only 14 specific dreams are recorded in the OT. Most of them are in Genesis and reflect God’s direct revelation to the patriarchs. Even Daniel tells about only two of Nebuchadnezzar’s dreams—the large, manlike image and the gigantic tree chopped down—and his own dream about the four beasts and the Ancient of Days.</p>
<p>The OT understanding of dreams had several significant features. Like the rest of the ancient world, people of God believed that God communicated in dreams. Yet there is in the OT accounts a reserve that is lacking in the perverse and obscene scenes often described in pagan dream records. Another distinction is that God is the initiator; he gives the revelatory dreams when, where, and to whom he pleases—a truth painfully learned by Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.6,15">1 Sm 28:6, 15</a>). More significantly, the secular approach to interpretation was specifically rejected. Understanding of dream symbols came not by research in dream books or by natural human ability. When Joseph interpreted the dreams of his two Egyptian fellow prisoners and later of the pharaoh himself, he insisted on giving full credit to God (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.8">Gn 40:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.7,25,28,39">41:7, 25, 28, 39</a>). Similarly, Daniel informed Nebuchadnezzar that the God in heaven who reveals secrets would make known the king’s dream and its meaning, in which task professional dream interpreters had failed (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.27-28">Dn 2:27-28</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike their neighbors, the OT saints knew that a dream was a “vision of the night” (<a href="?bref=Job.33.15">Jb 33:15</a>), and figuratively represented the spiritual realm (<a href="?bref=Job.20.8">Jb 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.20">Pss 73:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.126.1">126:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.29.7-8">Is 29:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>God used dreams in OT days to protect his servants (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">Gn 20</a>), to reveal himself to people in a special way (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.12">28:12</a>), to provide guidance in specific circumstances (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.10-13">31:10-13</a>), and to forewarn about personal future events (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.5-20">37:5-20</a>). Dreams were also used to predict the history of nations (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.40.1-41.57">40–41</a>) and to foretell the four great successive world empires that would be replaced by God’s eternal kingdom (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.19-27">Dn 4:19-27</a>).</p>
<p>During the approximately 1,000 years between Joseph and Daniel, only two dreams are recorded. One assured Gideon that God would defeat the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.13-15">Jgs 7:13-15</a>); the other concerns how Solomon became so wise after his humble, unselfish request for “an understanding heart” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.9,15">1 Kgs 3:9, 15</a>) thoroughly pleased God.</p>
<p>In the final OT dreams, God gave Nebuchadnezzar an overview of future world history (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.31-45">Dn 2:31-45</a>) and a prediction of the king’s temporary insanity (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.19-27">4:19-27</a>). Daniel’s dream of the four beasts was similar to the king’s first dreams, but with added details concerning future international relations (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">7:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>Dreams were seen as one means by which God would speak to prophets (<a href="?bref=Num.12.6">Nm 12:6</a>). But how could the people of God distinguish a true prophet from an imposter? God gave two tests: the ability to predict the immediate future (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.22">Dt 18:22</a>) and the consistency of the message with previously revealed truth (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-4">13:1-4</a>). False prophets were put to death (v <a href="?bref=Deut.13.5">5</a>). False prophecy was a serious problem in the days of Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.25-32">Jer 23:25-32</a>) and Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Zech.10.2">Zec 10:2</a>). Despite repeated warnings by Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.32">Jer 23:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.9-10">27:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.8-9">29:8-9</a>), the people preferred to listen to the false prophets with their empty messages of hope. Dreams were also a part of Israel’s prophetic hope (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentUse">New Testament Use</p>
<p class="fl">The few specific dreams in the NT all come from Matthew, five of these in the first two chapters. They emphasize the divine care and protection of the baby Jesus. First, there was God’s provision that Jesus would grow up in a home with a father and mother and thus avoid the cruelty and shame of being unjustly called an illegitimate child (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.19-23">Mt 1:19-23</a>). Then the wise men were instructed in a dream not to tell Herod where Jesus was living (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.12">2:12</a>). Jesus was further protected from jealous King Herod by the dream that told Joseph to flee to Egypt with Mary and the child (v <a href="?bref=Matt.2.13">13</a>). On Herod’s death, Joseph was divinely advised in a dream to return home from Egypt (v <a href="?bref=Matt.2.20">20</a>). Finally, God warned Joseph to avoid Judea, where Herod’s evil son Archelaus reigned, and to settle in Galilee instead (v <a href="?bref=Matt.2.22">22</a>).</p>
<p>The only other specific dream mentioned in the NT prompted Pilate’s wife to warn her husband, “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.19">Mt 27:19</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>

The word “dropsy” has generally been replaced with more specific medical terms: excessive abdominal fluid is now referred to as ascites, cutaneous or subcutaneous dropsy as edema, and pleural dropsy as hydrothorax. Dropsy is not mentioned directly in the OT. A reference to swollen feet (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.4">Dt 8:4</a>) could refer to pedal edema or simply to the formation of blisters.</p>

<p class="h1">DYE, DYEING, DYER</p>
<p class="fl">Method of coloring textiles practiced in the Near East with natural materials even before the time of the patriarch Abraham. The Bible mentions four colors of dyes: purple, blue (actually a shade of violet), crimson, and scarlet. The purple and blue dyes were extracted from small murex shellfish found along the Phoenician coast. The dye, a glandular secretion of the mollusk, changed color on exposure to air from whitish-yellow to red, violet, or purple, depending on how it was treated. Because that dye was costly to produce, only the rich could afford purple clothing; purple, therefore, became a symbol of royalty and luxury. The dye was commonly known as “Tyrian purple” because the Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon were the major suppliers (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.16">Ez 27:16</a>).</p>
<p>Crimson and scarlet were among several shades of bright red obtained from the kermes insect, a grub that feeds on a species of oak growing in southern Europe and Asia Minor. Some Syrian dyers still use the kermes in spite of the availability of artificial European dyes. The “tanned rams’ skins” mentioned in <a href="?bref=Exod.25.5">Exodus 25:5</a> are still made in Syria. The tanned skin is rubbed with dye made by boiling the kermes in water. When dry, the skin is oiled, polished, and used for Bedouin slippers and other beautiful leather articles.</p>
<p>The “purple goods” sold by Lydia of Thyatira (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14">Acts 16:14</a>) were actually a dull red, now sometimes called “Turkey red.” It was produced from the root of the madder plant, both for export to Europe and for local use in dyeing cotton and wool for rugs and clothing. Cultivation of madder was a major industry in Cyprus and Syria. A father customarily planted a new madder field for each son born, which would eventually be that son’s inheritance. Thyatira had a dyers’ guild.</p>

As the verse indicates, high fever accompanies acute dysentery, epidemics of which still plague Malta. A disease described in the OT was probably amoebic dysentery, in which intestinal tissue can be sloughed off day by day (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.14-19">2 Chr 21:14-19</a>). A sporadic form of dysentery occurs when the body is able to tolerate the disruptive organism for the most part.</p>

<p class="fl">Name given to the repentant thief on the cross in apocryphal narratives based on <a href="?bref=Luke.23.39-43">Luke 23:39-43</a>. Sources such as the Arabic Gospel of the Infancy and the Acts of Pilate contain fanciful accounts of earlier dealings between Christ and Dysmas. Patristic writers often commended the repentance of the “good thief,” and the Latin church ultimately canonized him as a saint.</p>
