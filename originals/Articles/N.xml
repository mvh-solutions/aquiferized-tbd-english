<p class="list">2. Commanding general of the Aramean army during the reign of Ben-hadad, king of Syria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.1-27">2 Kgs 5</a>). He was held in honor by the king, evidently for his character as well as for military achievements, “but he had leprosy.” This did not exclude him from society, as it would have done in Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-14.57">Lv 13–14</a>), but the possibility of a cure suggested by a captive Israelite girl sent Naaman, with Ben-hadad’s approval and gifts, to the court of his highly suspicious neighboring monarch (unnamed, but probably Jehoram). Elisha the prophet intervened and prescribed an unlikely mode of healing. The reluctant Naaman followed through because of the good sense of his servants, who said, “If the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?” Naaman confessed that the one true God is in Israel, and he returned home with two mule-loads of earth, perhaps on the assumption that this was a God who could be worshiped only on his own ground (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.20.24">Ex 20:24</a>). In <a href="?bref=Luke.4.27">Luke 4:27</a> Jesus reminds his synagogue listeners of how Naaman, a non-Israelite, was the only one of his time to be cleansed of leprosy.</p>

<p class="h1">NABAL</p>
<p class="fl">Wealthy, successful farmer of Maon in the southern wilderness of Judah. Unlike his godly forefather, Caleb, Nabal was hard of heart and wicked in all his ways (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.3">1 Sm 25:3</a>).</p>
<p>When he enters the story of David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1-44">1 Sm 25</a>), it is sheep-shearing time, which seems to have been a time of festivity and hospitality. Fleeing from Saul, who wanted to kill him, David decided to ask Nabal for a gift, not only to mark the occasion, but also because David’s presence in the area had served to protect Nabal’s flocks. Nabal refused in a most insulting way, suggesting that David was no better than a runaway slave.</p>
<p>David decided on revenge. But Abigail, Nabal’s quick-witted wife, saved Nabal by bringing David the presents he had asked for and by begging him not to stain his record by acting in anger. David agreed. But when Nabal heard what had happened, he was struck down by what appears to have been a stroke and died 10 days later.</p>
<p>Nabal, whose name means “fool,” stands as a reminder of the deep folly of opposing God. God himself, not David, took revenge.</p>

  <title>Nabataeans*, Nabateans</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NABATAEANS*, NABATEANS</p>
<p class="fl">Inhabitants of an independent kingdom bordering Judea, which existed from 169 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 106. The reader of the Bible and of standard histories often overlooks them for two reasons: their achievements are of recent discovery, and they flourished in a period when other major events, including the life of Christ and the beginning of the church, vastly overshadowed their existence.</p>
<p>The Judeans and Nabateans of the Hellenistic-Roman era shared borders and politics. The mother of Herod the Great, son of the Idumean ruler Antipater, was herself a Nabatean. Herod fled to Petra, the Nabatean capital, in 40 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the Parthians attacked Jerusalem. Relations between the two kingdoms were strengthened by the marriage in the next generation of Herod Antipas to a daughter of the powerful Nabatean king Aretas IV (9 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 40); relations soured again due to his divorce to marry his niece and sister-in-law, Herodias.</p>
<p>The NT alludes to the extent of Nabatean influence in the region, when Paul tells of his narrow escape from incarceration following his return from the Arabian desert: “At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas guarded the city . . . in order to seize me, but I was let down in a basket . . . and escaped his hands” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.32-33">2 Cor 11:32-33</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Nabatean origins are obscure. The best-known remains of Nabatean culture are the funerary monuments of Petra. Aramaic inscriptions abound, standardized on coins and dedicatory items, with papyri and ostraca (sherds) revealing a cursive variation that anticipates Arabic script. Adoption of Aramaic language and Syrian deities shows the pragmatism by which they also adapted to their hostile environment. Only their Byzantine heirs approached their ingenuity for capturing precious water to sustain life in an arid region. Caravan travel was enhanced and permanent control thereof made possible only by skillful engineering.</p>
<p>The earliest historical reference to the Nabateans associates them with Antigonus, Alexander’s successor in Syria (312 <span class="era">BC</span>). The succession of known kings begins with Aretas I, around 170 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.8">2 Macc 5:8</a>). Josephus writes that about 100 <span class="era">BC</span> the citizens of Gaza looked to “Aretas [II], king of the Arabs,” for aid against Alexander Janneus. Aretas III controlled Damascus (80–70 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>The golden age at Petra lasted from 50 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 70 and included the reigns of Malichus I and Obodas II (period of Herod the Great), Aretas IV, and Malichus II. The rule of Rabbel II marks the end of the Nabatean kingdom. His predecessor, Malichus III, had moved the capital to Bostra, 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) east of Galilee. This in turn became the capital of the Roman province of Arabia, following Trajan’s conquests, in <span class="era">AD</span> 106. The Nabateans were absorbed into the population, while their distinctive script continued into the fourth century.</p>

<p class="fl">Owner of a vineyard that Ahab, king of Israel, coveted (see the story in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-29">1 Kgs 21</a>). Ahab’s request was perhaps not unreasonable, and Naboth’s refusal may have been a little curt. While Ahab sulked, however, Jezebel had two scoundrels accuse Naboth of blasphemy, the greatest crime an Israelite could commit, which was punishable by death (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.10-23">Lv 24:10-23</a>). Two witnesses secured a conviction, according to the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.6-7">Dt 17:6-7</a>). The murder that was carried out had the appearance of being a legal and just execution. A fast was proclaimed and held according to royal instructions. The accusation and trial of Naboth was supervised by the elders of the city, and he was stoned to death in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The prophet Elijah, however, knew the real wickedness that lay behind the deed. He faced Ahab with it and prophesied that he and Jezebel and all their family would be wiped out because of it.</p>
<p>The words came true. Ahab got a temporary reprieve when he repented but was later killed in battle (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.34-40">1 Kgs 22:34-40</a>). The blood of Jezebel was indeed licked up by dogs (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.36">2 Kgs 9:36</a>), and the body of Joram, their son, was flung into Naboth’s vineyard (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.25">25</a>).</p>

  <title>Nadab</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NADAB</p>
<p class="list">1. Eldest son of Aaron and Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23">Ex 6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.2">Nm 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.1">1 Chr 24:1</a>), who became one of Israel’s first priests together with his brothers and father. He participated in the ratification of the covenant with God on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1,9">Ex 24:1, 9</a>) and was ordained to the priesthood (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.1">28:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Nadab and his brother Abihu, Aaron’s second son, died because they offered “strange fire” to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-2">Lv 10:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.4">Nm 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.2">1 Chr 24:2</a>). Incense offered in the morning usually preceded the cutting up of the sacrifice. In this case “fire from the Lord devoured them.” The offering of “strange fire” does not appear anywhere else in the Bible.</p>
<p class="list-text">Rabbis have offered various explanations of the offense committed by Nadab and Abihu. Since an admonition against drinking wine in the tent of meeting follows this tragedy (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.9">Lv 10:9</a>), an early tradition held that the brothers were drunk. Death was the penalty for any priest drinking in this sacred tent.</p>
<p class="list-text">An interesting point arises in the instructions that Moses gave to the grieving father of Nadab and Abihu. Moses exhorted Aaron not to mourn or to interrupt his priestly functions. Since Aaron had been sanctified by the sacred anointing oil, he had to continue serving God. He was not allowed to go out of the door of the tent “lest he die.” Instead, the rest of Israel mourned for Nadab and Abihu (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.3-7">Lv 10:3-7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Jeroboam, whom he succeeded to the throne of Israel (909–908 <span class="era">BC</span>). Nadab ruled two years (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.20">1 Kgs 14:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.25">15:25</a>), coming to power in the second year of Asa’s reign in Judah; he was succeeded in the third year of Asa’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.28">15:28</a>). His rule may have been arranged before the death of Jeroboam, for he surely recognized the dangers of the charismatic ideal that continued among the northern tribes. However, Nadab was not successful in stabilizing the kingdom. To gain the acclamation of the army, he went into battle against the Philistines at Gibbethon, about two and a half miles (4 kilometers) southwest of Gezer. Baasha from the tribe of Issachar, presumably a military officer, assassinated Nadab and all his sons and usurped the throne. So he fulfilled the prophecy predicted by Ahijah the Shilonite against the house of Jeroboam (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.29">29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Jerahmeelite, the son of Shammai and grandson of Onam, and the great-grandson of Jerahmeel. Nadab in turn had two sons, Seled and Appaim (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.26-30">1 Chr 2:26-30</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Son of Jeiel and Maacah, a Gibeonite (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.30">1 Chr 8:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.36">9:36</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">NAG HAMMADI MANUSCRIPTS*</p>
<p class="fl">A collection of 12 Coptic codices containing 52 tractates, or Gnostic documents.</p>
<p>In 1947 the area of Jabal al-Tariff (near Chenoboskion and Nag Hammadi in Egypt) yielded a magnificent collection of 12 Coptic codices containing 52 tractates, or documents, 6 of which are duplicates. One volume was smuggled out of Egypt and was finally purchased in 1952 by the Jung Institute in Zurich. (Gnosticism is important to the study of the psychology of religious experience.) After publication, the owners agreed to return the pirated manuscript to Egypt, and together with the remainder of the Nag Hammadi documents, it is now housed in the small but very significant Coptic Museum in Cairo. The documents in the Nag Hammadi library can be divided into several categories.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GnosticTextswithChristianOrientation">Gnostic Texts with Christian Orientation</p>
<p class="fl">In this category, those documents that have received considerable attention are The Gospel of Thomas, which is a series of sayings and is thought by some scholars to be a sayings-source for the canonical Gospels of Matthew and Luke; The Gospel of Truth, which some scholars have thought came from the pen of the well-known heretic Valentinus; The Gospel of Philip, which contains a unique series of logia related to Gnostic sacraments; and the Apocryphon of John, which has close affinities to the theories of the Ophites and Sethians as described by the heresiologs and provides a full-scale primary source for the Syrian Gnostic reinterpretation of the Garden of Eden story. Some of the other documents in this category that show indisputable signs of Christian influence on Gnosticism are The Treatise on the Resurrection, the several apocalypses of Peter and James, The Book of Thomas the Contender, and Melchizedek.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GnosticTextswithLessThanClearChristianOrientation">Gnostic Texts with Less Than Clear Christian Orientation</p>
<p class="fl">Some scholars have considered that these texts suggest a pre-Christian Gnosticism, but such a conclusion does not seem to be fully substantiated. <span class="ital">Eugnostos</span> is the document usually cited in this matter and is frequently viewed as an undeveloped stage of the more Christianized form of the text known for some time as The Sophia of Jesus Christ. Even the so-called pre-Christian <span class="ital">Eugnostos,</span> however, seems to bear unmistakable signs of being related to the Alexandrian school of Christian writings and has been found to contain some allusions to the NT. The Paraphrase of Shem is another document frequently assigned to this category. Its references to baptism and the Redeemer, however, may be the result of a reinterpretation of Christian views and may reflect the conflict between the church and the Gnostics. Other documents in the library usually assigned to this category are The Apocalypse of Adam, The Three Stelaes of Seth, and The Thunder. </p>
<p class="h2" id="Non-GnosticChristianDocuments">Non-Gnostic, Christian Documents</p>
<p class="fl">There are also in the library several non-Gnostic, Christian documents, which include The Acts of Peter and the Twelve, The Sentences of Sextus, and The Teachings of Silvanus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MiscellaneousDocuments">Miscellaneous Documents</p>
<p class="fl">There are several documents that are neither Christian nor technically Gnostic but that were probably read with great interest by the Gnostic scribes. Of particular note are the hermetic treatises that are Egyptian in orientation but contain a less radical dualism than is evident in typical Gnostic literature. Hermetic literature has long been known by scholars through the publication of a hermetic library known as the <span class="ital">Corpus Hermeticum</span> (English translation, <span class="ital">Thrice-Greatest Hermes</span>). The first tractate, “Poimandres,” is probably of the greatest interest to biblical students because of its rather positive view of creation and its interesting parallels with some of the theological ideas, such as “light” and “life,” in the fourth Gospel.</p>

<p class="fl">Northwestern Mesopotamian city; home of Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, and Nahor, Abraham’s brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.10">Gn 24:10</a>). Nahor is frequently mentioned in the Mari documents (18th century <span class="era">BC</span>) as the town of Nakhur, located near Haran in the Balikh River Valley. This city was probably the home of some of the ancient Habiru people. Its site is unknown.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">NAHUM (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. A prophet of Judah whose name means “consolation” or “consoler.” This name fits his message, as he wrote to encourage the people of Judah while they were being oppressed by the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">Na 1:1</a>). Other than being the prophet who wrote the book of Nahum, nothing is known of him except that he came from the village of Elkosh. Its exact location is unknown, but four suggestions have been made. First, it was the town of Alqush, near Mosul on the Tigris River just north of Nineveh. A tradition declares this to be the site of Nahum’s tomb, but it is first mentioned by Masius in the 16th century. The tomb and its location have no archaeological confirmation, and its authenticity is highly suspect. Second, Jerome recounts a Jewish tradition identifying it with “a village in Galilee called ‘Helcesaei’ ” (Helcesei or Elcesi), and writes, “A very small one, indeed, and containing in its ruins hardly any traces of ancient buildings, but one which is well known to the Jews and was also pointed out to me by my guide.” This village is located about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) northwest of the Sea of Galilee. Third, on the northern edge of the Sea of Galilee rest the ruins of Capernaum, meaning “village of Nahum.” But there is no proof that this name goes back to the prophet. Finally, some believe it should be identified with Elcesi, near Bet-gabre, about halfway between Gaza and Jerusalem in the territory of Judah. Internal evidence seems to support this position (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.15">Na 1:15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">It is entirely possible that Nahum may have been a member of the northern tribes but migrated to Judah after the conquest of 722 <span class="era">BC</span> and ministered there.</p>

<p class="fl">Nahum is identified as an Elkoshite in the superscription to the book (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">Na 1:1</a>). The term is somewhat doubtful in meaning but probably refers to a city now unknown. If the term does refer to a geographical location, it may be the village of Elcesi in Judah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Nahum deals with the fall of two great cities, Nineveh and Thebes. The fall of Thebes is cited in <a href="?bref=Nah.3.8-10">3:8-10</a>, and the entire book deals with the destruction of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, which was yet future. Thebes was destroyed by the Assyrians around 663 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Nineveh fell in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>. Within this range of history a number of dates for the composition of Nahum have been suggested. Some scholars prefer a date very close to the fall of Nineveh, perhaps during the time when Assyria was being invaded. However, Assyria’s influence extended to Judah at the time of the writing of the book (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.13-15">1:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.2.2">2:2</a>), a fact that is hardly consonant with the impending downfall of that nation. Since the influence of Assyria in the western provinces began to decline in the latter half of the seventh century, it is best to place the writing of the book in the middle of the seventh century, subsequent to the destruction of Thebes but before the erosion of Assyrian power in Syro-Palestine.</p>
<p>Scholars who deny the validity of biblical prophecy generally date the book in the period subsequent to the fall of Nineveh.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The extent of Assyrian dominance in the mid-seventh century was unparalleled. Never before had Assyrian influence extended so far. The destruction of Thebes brought to an end any significant resistance to Assyria by Egypt, their most powerful foe.</p>
<p>The destruction of Thebes occurred during the reign of Manasseh of Judah (696–642 <span class="era">BC</span>), who was, for all intents and purposes, a vassal of the Assyrians. Assyrian influence in Judah led to the intrusion of non-Yahwistic influences, such as the revival of fertility cults and the worship of Assyrian astral deities (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1-9">2 Kgs 21:1-9</a>).</p>
<p>Within the structure of Assyria’s enormous expansion there were many weaknesses that would bring about the decline and eventual demise of that empire. For one thing, it had overextended itself. The task of keeping hostile captive countries in line, many of which were at vast distances from the capital, became increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Assyria began to experience internal difficulties, particularly with the Chaldeans, a group of loosely knit tribes who had been absorbed into the Assyrian Empire. Egypt also began to withhold tribute. Numerous border raids by barbarians caused the empire to gradually weaken.</p>
<p>The situation worsened as the internal strife began to burgeon into a major crisis. Finally a coalition of Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians brought about the collapse of Assyria when, after a three-month siege, Nineveh fell in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The site of Nineveh was excavated in 1840 by Henry Layard. The excavation revealed that the city was heavily fortified. Evidence still remains of the moats and bulwarks constructed for its defense. The palace of Sennacherib, with its 71 rooms decorated with artistic works, was also uncovered by Layard. Even though the palace lay buried for millennia, it still revealed the splendor of the days of Nineveh’s greatness.</p>
<p>The prophet Nahum predicted that the city would be burned (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.13">Na 2:13</a>). In his description of the city, Layard indicated that a great fire had destroyed Nineveh. This became evident even when only two small portions of the tell had been explored. The massive gates of the city, which Nahum said would be open to its enemies (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.13">3:13</a>), were also burned. The massive sculptures that originally stood by the gates were found buried in debris of earth, brick, and stones mixed with charcoal.</p>
<p>An important archaeological find is a Babylonian chronicle recording events in the reign of the Babylonian king Nabopolassar (625–605 <span class="era">BC</span>). This chronicle fixes the date of the fall of Nineveh, placing it in the 14th year of Nabopolassar—that is, 612 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of the book of Nahum is to predict the downfall of the Assyrian Empire as prefigured in its capital city, Nineveh. It sets forth the mighty power of God revealed in the arena of history.</p>
<p>At first glance the book may seem to be lacking substantial theological teaching. It is, after all, an extended ode celebrating the downfall of a pagan city. However, when one looks at history from the perspective of a prophet, history becomes the context for the revelation of many of God’s attributes.</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Nah.1.1-15">1</a> the prophet weaves several significant theological themes into his account of the demise of the city. He sets forth the fact that God loves and cares for his own. In <a href="?bref=Nah.1.7">1:7</a> he describes the Lord as knowing those who take refuge in him. In <a href="?bref=Nah.1.13">1:13</a> God promises the end of Assyrian oppression of Judah.</p>
<p>God’s sovereignty is set forth as well. God is sovereign over the nations that oppose him (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.2">1:2</a>). He is sovereign over nature, for the clouds are but the dust of his feet (v <a href="?bref=Nah.1.3">3</a>). God cannot be defied (v <a href="?bref=Nah.1.6">6</a>). He is the sovereign of his people (v <a href="?bref=Nah.1.13">13</a>).</p>
<p>Basic to the theological structure of the book is its affirmation that God is the Lord of history. History is the arena of his activity. God is not merely an abstract concept to the prophet, nor is he a disinterested deity. He brings nations into being and he destroys them. History is not under the control of godless nations or fortuitous events; it is under the control of the Creator.</p>
<p>Nahum points out that God does not deal with people only in wrath. His wrath is revealed against those who oppose him. He deals in tenderness and love with those who find him to be their refuge.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Superscription (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">1:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Like other prophetic books, Nahum begins with a superscription. It attributes the authorship of the book to the prophet Nahum. The first part of the superscription reads, “An oracle concerning Nineveh,” which indicates the book’s content.</p>
<p class="h3">The Prophet Considers the Wrath and Might of God (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.2-6">1:2-6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The message of the prophet begins with a descriptive account of a number of attributes of God, specifically his anger and sovereign power. The statement that God is a jealous God (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.2">1:2</a>) is not to be understood as attributing selfish motives to God. Rather, it expresses God’s intense devotion and loyalty to those who are his own.</p>
<p>Basic to this section is the affirmation that God takes vengeance on his foes. This theological principle is the basis for Nahum’s description of the fall of Nineveh. That Assyria was an enemy of God was made clear in history. The Assyrians were not only an instrument used by God to punish his people, but also they were a pagan people who opposed and harassed the Hebrews at every opportunity. Their conquest and exile of the kingdom of Israel was the ultimate manifestation of their opposition to Yahweh. Perhaps it was this dreadful period in Hebrew history that was uppermost in Nahum’s mind.</p>
<p>An opening statement in this book says, “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is slow to get angry, but his power is great, and he never lets the guilty go unpunished” (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.3">1:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Even toward his enemies God acts in grace; he does not lash out in uncontrolled rage but deals with them to change their ways. The statement “he never lets the guilty go unpunished” is an allusion to the great affirmation of God in <a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Exodus 34:6</a>. It is best translated, “He will not completely clear the guilty,” which affirms that God forgives but often allows the effects of sin to have their course. This is illustrated in the case of David, whose sin with Bathsheba was forgiven, but the child of the union died. The destruction of Nineveh was thus certain to occur, according to the theological principle established by Nahum: God punishes those who oppose him.</p>
<p>The sovereignty of God over the sphere of nature is established in <a href="?bref=Nah.1.3b-6">Nahum 1:3b-6</a>. It, too, is the arena in which his awesome power is revealed.</p>
<p class="h3">The Fall of Nineveh and the Deliverance of Israel (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.7-15">1:7-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophet then turned to the city of Nineveh in direct address. In verse <a href="?bref=Nah.1.11">11</a> he speaks of one who comes forth from Assyria plotting evil against the Lord—a reminder of the Rabshakeh, the Assyrian emissary cited in <a href="?bref=Isa.36.14-20">Isaiah 36:14-20</a> as counseling the people to give in to his demands for surrender. The words of doom for Nineveh become words of comfort for Judah, for Nahum says that Assyria will afflict them no longer (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.12">Na 1:12</a>).</p>
<p>The ultimacy of the destruction of the city is set forth in verses <a href="?bref=Nah.1.13-15">13-15</a>. No longer would Assyria rise to afflict the Jews. This great truth is celebrated in verse <a href="?bref=Nah.1.15">15</a>, where the prophet encourages the people to return to their worship of God, for they will no longer have Assyria as an enemy.</p>
<p class="h3">The Fall of Nineveh (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.1-13">2:1-13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The literary style of Nahum in this section is superb. The fast-moving action, expressed by concise, almost clipped phrasing, lends an atmosphere of excitement and urgency to the description of the collapse of the city. One hears the orders of the defenders in these words: “Sound the alarm! Man the ramparts! Muster your defenses, and keep a sharp watch for the enemy attack to begin!” (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.1">2:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Nahum seems to describe the rush into the city just moments after the walls had been breached. One sees the flashes of red as shields are brandished (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.3">2:3</a>) and hears the crushing sound of the madly dashing chariots (v <a href="?bref=Nah.2.4">4</a>), but the defenders are too late (v <a href="?bref=Nah.2.5">5</a>).</p>
<p>An important part of Nineveh’s defensive structure were the moats that surrounded the city. These moats, fed by two rivers in the vicinity, are alluded to in <a href="?bref=Nah.2.6,8">2:6, 8</a>. But these moats can’t keep back the invaders.</p>
<p>The language again becomes vivid, punctuated with brisk commands: “Stop, stop!” (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.8">2:8</a>). And the invaders are heard to say, “Loot the silver! Plunder the gold!” Finally the siege is over, and there is only desolation and ruin (v <a href="?bref=Nah.2.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>This section closes with a reference to lions (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.11-13">2:11-13</a>). Lions in the OT often stand for the wicked, particularly when the wicked devour the righteous. Assyria was very lionlike in its treatment of the Jews. But God declares that he is against the Assyrians (v <a href="?bref=Nah.2.13">13</a>) and will completely cut them off.</p>
<p>This section, vivid and colorful in its style, contains a deep theological message that should not be overlooked. It affirms God’s activity in history and assures the believer that the enemies of God will never ultimately conquer the people of God. For God is almighty; he is an avenging God who jealously cares for his own.</p>
<p class="h3">A Lament for Nineveh (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.1-19">3:1-19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophet pronounces “woe” on the city in a lengthy ode celebrating Nineveh’s fall. If he seems to get undue satisfaction from Nineveh’s destruction, it is not necessarily because he has a cruel nature. The OT writers viewed the godless nations of the world as the personification of evil. When Nineveh fell, the sphere of history witnessed God’s conquest of evil in that particular realm.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Nah.3.1-7">3:1-7</a> the prophet speaks of the shame that Nineveh will experience as a result of her fall. He describes one of the causes of Assyria’s downfall as her sorceries and harlotries (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.4">3:4</a>). This is an evident reference to the idolatrous religion of Assyria. The Assyrian priests were noted for their use of divination and omens. Particularly noteworthy were their attempts to predict the future by observing the motions of the heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>The prophet pointed to other countries that fell prey to their enemies (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.8-11">3:8-11</a>) and affirmed that Assyria is no better than these. He closed by describing the grandeur and might of Nineveh, but he vividly showed how all of that would pass away. Whether it is fortifications (v <a href="?bref=Nah.3.12">12</a>) or extensive trade (v <a href="?bref=Nah.3.16">16</a>), or soldiers (v <a href="?bref=Nah.3.17">17</a>)—all will crumble.</p>

<p class="fl">Place where David was given refuge from Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.18-20.1">1 Sm 19:18–20:1</a>). Here Samuel supervised a group of prophets. According to verses <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.19">19</a> and <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.23">23</a> of chapter <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.1-24">19</a>, Naioth was located within Ramah, Samuel’s hometown.</p>
<p>The derivation of the term is enigmatic. The word occurs nowhere else in Scripture, and the Hebrew text seems intentionally obscure. The word perhaps stems from a Hebrew root meaning “pastoral abode” or “dwelling place.” In <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.25">2 Samuel 15:25</a> another derivative of the Hebrew root refers to the Lord’s habitation, prompting some to suggest that Naioth is a proper noun referring to a sanctuary in Ramah (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>, where prophets were also associated with a sanctuary). Others conclude that Naioth alludes to a school, cloister, or settlement of prophets, of which Samuel was head.</p>

<p class="h1">NAMES, Significance of</p>
<p class="fl">In biblical times names were given in order to express something about a person, or to express something through him, and not simply to hang a convenient label around his neck. At least seven motivations appear in the choice of names:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. To record some aspect of a person’s birth. Moses was so called by his adoptive mother because he was drawn from the water, the sound of the name recalling a Hebrew verb “to draw out” (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.10">Ex 2:10</a>). The circumstances surrounding their births gave Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.26">Gn 25:26</a>) and also Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.20">1 Sm 1:20</a>) their names. In Samuel’s case it is interesting to note that his name, meaning “heard by God,” records not the offering of prayer but the hearing and answering of it. Something of the deeper and more far-reaching implications of naming is seen in the fact that while the names Jacob and Samuel arise from birth circumstances, they also reveal in advance the person the child will become: Jacob the sneaky opportunist (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.27.36">Gn 27:36</a>), Samuel the man of prayer (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.5-9">1 Sm 7:5-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.8.6,21">8:6, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.19-23">12:19-23</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. To express parental reactions to the birth. Isaac means “laughter” (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">Gn 17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.12">18:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.3-6">21:3-6</a>). Nabal (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.25">1 Sm 25:25</a>), which means “fool,” must have been the essence of a mother’s prayer—“Let him not be a fool”—though sadly he was! Abimelech (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.31">Jgs 8:31</a>) means “My father is king” and may express a secret ambition of Gideon’s, at variance with his public testimony (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.22-23">Jgs 8:22-23</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. To secure the solidarity of the family. This may explain the proposal to call the baby Zechariah in <a href="?bref=Luke.1.59">Luke 1:59</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. To reveal the nature of the person, his function, or some other significant thing about him. The preeminent example of this is Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>), named for his saving vocation. Isaiah seems to have seen his own name as significant of his message “the Lord saves” (see <a href="?bref=Isa.8.18">Is 8:18</a> <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg).</p>
<p class="list">5. To communicate God’s message. Isaiah (see <a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Is 7:3</a>) called his first son Shear-jashub (“a remnant shall return”) in order to embody the double-sided thrust of his message: as a result of faithlessness, the people will be reduced to a mere remnant (“only a remnant shall return”); as a result of God’s faithfulness, his people will be preserved in life (“a remnant shall indeed return”). He called his second boy Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.3">8:3</a>), (“speed-prey-haste-spoil”), indicating the certainty of the imminent onset of a victorious foe.</p>
<p class="list">6. To establish religious affiliation. All the names in the Bible with the endings <span class="hebrew">-iah</span> (alternatively <span class="hebrew">-jah</span>) or <span class="hebrew">-el</span> (e.g., Jeremiah, Nathanael) are in fact statements with “the Lord” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">-yah</span><span class="ital">)</span> or “God” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">-el</span><span class="ital">)</span> as subject. For example, Adonijah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.4">2 Sm 3:4</a>) means “the Lord is Sovereign”; Nathanael (<a href="?bref=John.1.47">Jn 1:47</a>) means “God gave.” Such names were often chosen in times of religious decline in order to affirm the true faith of the parents.</p>
<p class="list">7. To affirm authority over another. In the ancient Near East, the naming of an object or person implied power and authority over what was named (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.19-20">Gn 2:19-20</a>). Thus, a person not knowing another’s name could do neither harm nor good to that person (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.12,17">Ex 33:12, 17</a>). In the ancient world a name described the person or his work in some way. When the individual or his situation changed, so did the name, as with Abram (Abraham) and Jacob (Israel). Pharaoh, as master of the patriarch Joseph, changed Joseph’s name when his status altered, calling him Zaphenath-paneah (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.45">Gn 41:45</a>). When Eliakim was made king of Judah, the pharaoh changed the Jewish king’s name to Jehoiakim (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.34">2 Kgs 23:34</a>). In captivity, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were forced to change their names to Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego by order of the eunuch (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.6-7">Dn 1:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="sp">In the NT, John the Baptist was named by an angel who represented God, and similarly Jesus was given his name by an angel. The naming of those children symbolized God’s authority over John the Baptist and his special relationship as Father to Jesus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewNames">New Names</p>
<p class="fl">The ability of the name to reveal the nature or status of the person who bears it is well illustrated in the biblical practice of giving new names, as when Sarai became Sarah (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.15">Gn 17:15</a>). Three motivations are possible:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The new name replaces the old in order to signify the bestowal of powers not hitherto possessed. In this case the new name is equivalent to the experience of regeneration. The childless Abram becomes the “father of a multitude of nations,” Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5">Gn 17:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. The new name may indicate a new character and status with God, as when Jacob the trickster became Israel the man of power with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.27">Gn 32:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.3-4">Hos 12:3-4</a>); thus also, Simon became Peter (<a href="?bref=John.1.42">Jn 1:42</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. The new name may cement a new loyalty in the place of an old. Daniel the captive was given the name Belteshazzar, incorporating the name Bel, one of the gods of Babylon—presumably to turn him from the God of his fathers to that of his captors (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.7">Dn 1:7</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">NAPHTALI, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 12 tribes of Israel that migrated from Egypt to Canaan, ultimately settling in northern Canaan in the high country of Galilee.</p>
<p>During the period of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, Naphtali’s tribe is mentioned only incidentally. Acting as the leader of the tribe, Ahira, Enan’s son (<a href="?bref=Num.2.29">Nm 2:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.28">7:28</a>), helped conduct the census of Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Num.1.15">1:15</a>) as Israel prepared for the prospect of war. The first census records 53,400 men ready for war (vv <a href="?bref=Num.1.42-43">42-43</a>), whereas a later census taken near the end of their desert sojourning records 45,400 men capable of battle (<a href="?bref=Num.26.48">26:48</a>). When Moses sent the 12 spies to search out the land of Canaan, Nahbi, Vophsi’s son, represented Naphtali’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.13.14">13:14</a>). Other significant activities involving Naphtali’s tribe during the wilderness wanderings include the position of encampment around the tabernacle while in the desert (<a href="?bref=Num.2.29">2:29</a>); the distribution of the land, in which Pedahel, Ammihud’s son, represented Naphtali in the ceremony of choosing lots (<a href="?bref=Num.34.28">34:28</a>); and the ratification of the covenant at Shechem (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.13">Dt 27:13</a>). Finally, like the rest of the tribes, Naphtali was the recipient of a blessing from Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.23">Dt 33:23</a>).</p>
<p>The tribal inheritance of Naphtali was located on the eastern side of upper Galilee, bordered on the south by Zebulun and by Asher on the west (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.34">Jos 19:34</a>). Within its borders were several Levitical cities (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.6">Jos 21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.62">1 Chr 6:62</a>) and a city of refuge, Kedesh (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.7">Jos 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.76">1 Chr 6:76</a>). Though they successfully occupied the region, they did not initially drive out the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.33">Jgs 1:33</a>). They did, however, subjugate the inhabitants of the Canaanite cities Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath to forced labor. As a result of their location, they were involved in some major conflicts with the indigenous population and foreign invaders. The most significant of these was the war with Jabin, king of Hazor. Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali joined Deborah, the prophetess, and together they led the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali against the Canaanites (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">4–5</a>). Along with the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Manasseh, the tribe of Naphtali was also called by Gideon into battle against the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.35">6:35</a>).</p>
<p>During the united monarchy, the tribe of Naphtali sent troops to Hebron, demonstrating their support of David’s kingship over all of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.34">1 Chr 12:34</a>). Naphtali’s continued allegiance to the Davidic dynasty was evidenced in their support of Solomon’s administrative system. Ahimaaz of Naphtali’s tribe was one of 12 officers who administered the various regional districts for the king; this same Ahimaaz also married Basemath, the daughter of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.15">1 Kgs 4:15</a>).</p>
<p>The history of the tribe during the divided monarchy is sketchy, and references to Naphtali occur in the contexts of military conflicts. During the reign of Asa in Judah, Baasha, king of Israel, sought to build a fortress at Ramah on the central Benjamite plateau. Feeling threatened, Asa encouraged Ben-hadad of Syria to attack the northern kingdom. The Syrian monarch complied, and the brunt of his attack was felt by Naphtali’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.16-24">1 Kgs 15:16-24</a>). Baasha withdrew his troops from the Benjamite plateau only to encounter the powerful onslaught of the Syrian army. The other major foreign power to exert its influence in the region of Naphtali was Assyria, particularly during the reign of Tiglath-pileser III. During the rule of Pekah in Israel and Rezon in Syria, this Assyrian monarch came and captured Gilead, Galilee, and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>) in 732 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>According to the prophet Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1">Is 9:1</a>), though the Lord had made Naphtali’s land contemptible, he would make it glorious once again. Matthew sees the fulfillment of this prophecy in the person of Christ, who brought the message of God’s kingdom to the Jews living in the region of Naphtali’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13-15">Mt 4:13-15</a>). In the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.6">Rv 7:6</a>), 12,000 members of Naphtali’s tribe are included among the sealed multitude of Israel.</p>

Nathan, Solomon’s older brother, is featured in the apocalyptic oracle of <a href="?bref=Zech.12.12">Zechariah 12:12</a> and Christ’s line of descent via Joseph (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.31">Lk 3:31</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text"><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="?item=GenealogyofJesusChrist_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Genealogy of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. One of the early prophets and adviser of David. When David’s military campaigns were almost completed, he shared with Nathan his desire to erect a suitable dwelling place for God. Nathan’s immediate reaction was favorable, but on receiving direct instructions from the Lord, he countermanded his initial approval. He foretold that one of David’s sons would build God a house, and that God would establish a house (dynasty) for David through his son Solomon. The prophecy includes not only the Davidic line but also the messianic king. Nathan’s oracle, therefore, was of vital importance, since it dealt with two great institutions, the temple and the Davidic monarchy (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-7">2 Sm 7:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.17.1-15">1 Chr 17:1-15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">During the Ammonite war, David, having fathered an illegitimate child, tried to cover his sin by involving the woman’s husband, Uriah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-13">2 Sm 11:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.39">23:39</a>). When this attempt failed, he had Joab, the general of the army, engineer Uriah’s death, whereupon David took Bathsheba openly as his wife (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.14-27">11:14-27</a>). Nathan confronted the king, courageously exposing the enormity of David’s crime by a parable that provoked the king’s righteous anger and turned the finger of condemnation upon David himself (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.1-9">12:1-9</a>). Nathan foretold the fearful consequences for David’s family resulting from his sin and evil example (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.10-12">10-12</a>). This prophecy was fulfilled in rape, the deaths of three of David’s sons, and civil war (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.1-18.33">2 Sm 13–18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-53">1 Kgs 1</a>). Bathsheba’s child also would not live (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.14">2 Sm 12:14</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When David was near death, one of his sons, Adonijah, seized power (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1,10">1 Kgs 1:1, 10</a>). Nathan prompted Bathsheba to remind David of an earlier promise concerning Solomon’s succession, supporting her by his own timely intervention (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.10-27">10-27</a>). David immediately authorized Solomon’s coronation (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.28-53">28-53</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Nathan was an important chronicler (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.29">2 Chr 9:29</a>). With David he played a vital part in developing the musical aspects of temple worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.25">2 Chr 29:25</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Man of Zobah and the father of Igal, one of David’s 30 heroes (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.36">2 Sm 23:36</a>). He was possibly the Nathan noted as the brother of Joel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.38">1 Chr 11:38</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Father of two important court officials (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.5">1 Kgs 4:5</a>); probably either the prophet or David’s son.</p>
<p class="list">5. Descendant of Judah, in the clan of Jerahmeel, the son of Attai and the father of Zabad (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.36">1 Chr 2:36</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. One of a deputation sent by Ezra to secure Levitical reinforcements for the Israelites returning to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.16">Ezr 8:16</a>).

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Nathanael">
  <title>Nathanael</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NATHANAEL</p>
<p class="fl">Jew from Cana of Galilee whom Jesus called to be a disciple (<a href="?bref=John.1.45-50">Jn 1:45-50</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.2">21:2</a>). Initially skeptical when Philip described Jesus as the fulfillment of the whole OT (<a href="?bref=John.1.45-46">1:45-46</a>), Nathanael proclaimed Jesus to be the Son of God and the King of Israel (v <a href="?bref=John.1.49">49</a>) after an astonishing personal encounter.</p>
<p>The fact that the only NT references to Nathanael occur in the Gospel of John has led some scholars to identify him with several personalities appearing in the synoptic Gospels. Because his call appears with those of Andrew, Peter, and Philip, some have speculated that he was one of the 12, possibly Bartholomew. Three pieces of evidence are cited in support of this position: (1) the name Bartholomew is patronymic (literally “son of Tolmai”) and would be accompanied by another name; (2) each of the Synoptic lists of the 12 apostles place Bartholomew after Philip (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2-4">Mt 10:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.16-19">Mk 3:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.14-16">Lk 6:14-16</a>), paralleling the call of Nathanael after Philip in John’s account; and (3) Bartholomew’s name does not appear in the fourth Gospel.</p>
<p>A second position identifies Nathanael as James, the son of Alphaeus. According to this view, Jesus’ comment in <a href="?bref=John.1.47">John 1:47</a> should read “Behold, Israel [not “an Israelite”] indeed, in whom is no guile!” Israel is the name God gave to Jacob, and the NT form of Jacob is James. John addressed James, the son of Alphaeus, as Nathanael in order to distinguish him from others who had become prominent in the early church.</p>
<p>Two less plausible identifications equate Nathanael with either Matthew or Simon the Cananaean. The first is precariously founded on the similar etymologies of the names Matthew (“gift of Yahweh”) and Nathanael (“Yahweh has given”). The second identifies the two on the basis of the common hometown of Cana.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, Nathanael was most likely a disciple who was not a member of the 12 and was known only to John. This suggestion conforms to early patristic evidence. In the fourth Gospel, Nathanael serves as a symbol for the true Jew who overcomes initial skepticism to believe in Christ. This is confirmed by three observations: (1) his initial reaction to Jesus parallels that of others who believed in the Law and the Prophets (<a href="?bref=John.7.15,27,41">Jn 7:15, 27, 41</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.41">9:41</a>); (2) Jesus’ perception of Nathanael under a fig tree (<a href="?bref=John.1.48">1:48</a>) identifies the latter’s devotion to the Torah (in rabbinic literature the proper place to study the Torah is under a fig tree); and (3) Jesus identifies Nathanael with Jacob, the father of the Israelite nation. In <a href="?bref=Gen.25.1-32.32">Genesis 25–32</a>, Jacob is certainly sly and cunning in his dealings with Esau and Laban. <a href="?bref=John.1.51">John 1:51</a> strengthens the ties between Nathanael and Jacob by presenting the imagery of angels ascending and descending, reminiscent of Jacob’s dream, and by locating the event in Galilee close to Bethel and Jabbok, the sites of Jacob’s experiences. Nathanael is thus a symbol of the pious Israelite for whom Christ came. His response typifies what the fourth Evangelist understands as the appropriate response of the true Israelite to Jesus—from initial skepticism to faith (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.6">Rom 9:6</a>).</p>

  <title>Nations</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NATIONS</p>
<p class="fl">Groups formed on the basis of political or social interests or on kinship. Generally, the word “nations” implies peoples of the world other than the Hebrews, although it can also include the Jews.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Origins">Origins</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Genesis attributes to the three sons of Noah the origin of the various “families” or ethnic groups (about 70 in all) who inhabited the eastern Mediterranean regions (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Gn 10</a>). The narrative presupposes that each group has its own individual geographical location and language (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.5,20,31">5, 20, 31</a>). The story of the tower (ziggurat) of Babel, whose peak was to reach to heaven (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-32">11</a>), explains that ethnic groups were separated by language barriers and scattered geographically so that they might not collaborate on presumptuous ventures.</p>
<p>Paul, in his sermon in Athens, assumes that the various nations had a common origin, just as the writer of Genesis did, and accepts as part of the design of God the fact that nations should be separated by geographical boundaries (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.26">Acts 17:26</a>). The prophet Zephaniah looked forward to the day when God would reverse this state of affairs and cause all the nations to speak one language (<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.9">Zep 3:9</a>). The writer of Revelation, in his vision of the new heaven and the new earth, saw these natural boundaries abolished. The nations freely intermingle in the new Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.22-26">Rv 21:22-26</a>).</p>
<p>The distinction between “Israel” and “the nations” is not clear-cut. “Israel” evolved from various ethnic groups, and several of “the nations” traced their origins to prominent figures in the Israelite community. Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, lived in Ur of the Chaldees in the delta region of the Tigris-Euphrates valley. With his father he migrated north to Haran, and finally southwest to the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31-12.9">Gn 11:31–12:9</a>). <a href="?bref=Deut.26.5">Deuteronomy 26:5</a> (“a wandering Aramean was my father”) suggests Abraham’s residence was in the district of Mesopotamia known as Aram-naharaim. When Abraham entered into covenant with God, God gave him the token of the covenant relationship: circumcision. Foreigners purchased as slaves were circumcised, thus including them in the covenant community. When Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt into the wilderness, a mixed multitude also went up with them (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.38">Ex 12:38</a>), which suggests again that people not biologically related nevertheless identified themselves with the people of Israel.</p>
<p>The nation of Israel did not include all of those physically descended from Abraham. The first son of Abraham, Ishmael, had an Egyptian mother and is the ancestor of the Ishmaelites, bedouins who roamed the southern wilderness region (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">Gn 16</a>). Of the twin sons born to Isaac and Rebekah, Esau, the firstborn, is the father of the Edomites living in the southeast, traditional enemies of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.23">Gn 25:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.20.21">Nm 20:21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="GodandtheNations">God and the Nations</p>
<p class="fl">Scripture presents negative and positive attitudes toward the nations. The nations inhabiting the territory between the Tigris-Euphrates valley and the Nile River were wicked nations. Therefore, God took away their land and gave it to the descendants of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.16-20">Gn 15:16-20</a>). Incestuous relationships, adultery, homosexuality, and sexual relationships between men and animals characterized the nations and incurred God’s displeasure (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lv 18</a>). The nations indulged in the practice of spiritism, augury, witchcraft, and necromancy, so the Hebrews were instructed to avoid such activities (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.26">19:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.6">20:6</a>). The nations worshiped many gods and included in their worship the practice of human sacrifice, often the sacrifice of children—a ritual that God abhors (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-5">Lv 20:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.29-34">2 Kgs 17:29-34</a>). The prophet Isaiah spoke scathingly of the craftsman who, taking a branch of a tree, used part of it to kindle a fire and fashioned from the remainder a graven image that he then worshiped (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.12-20">Is 44:12-20</a>). The Baalim and Ashteroth, fertility gods of the Canaanites, were a constant source of temptation to the people of Israel. The message repeated throughout Scripture is that for these reasons God would drive out the nations and give their territory to Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.24">Ex 34:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.29-31">Dt 12:29-31</a>). The prophetic oracles against the nations reinforced this negative attitude (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-51.64">Jer 46–51</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2.3">Am 1:3–2:3</a>).</p>
<p>However, the Scripture also reflects a more positive attitude toward the nations. As revealed in the book of Psalms, God is not only concerned about Israel; his eyes keep watch over the nations, and all the earth praises and worships him (<a href="?bref=Ps.66.1-8">Ps 66:1-8</a>). The psalmist prays that God’s saving power may be known among all the nations. He affirms that God righteously judges the peoples and guides the nations. All the ends of the earth should fear him (<a href="?bref=Ps.67.7">67:7</a>). The prophet Isaiah declares that the Jerusalem temple is to be a house of prayer for all peoples and that God welcomes the foreigner who comes with sacrifices and offering worship (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.6-8">Is 56:6-8</a>). Isaiah’s vision of hope for the latter days pictures people of all nations pouring into Jerusalem to worship the Lord and learn his ways. Instead of nation warring against nation, all will live in peace, ruled by God (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">2:2-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNationsintheNewTestament">The Nations in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">According to the Gospels, Jesus ministered not only to the Jews but also to the Gentile nations in accordance with ancient prophecy (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.15-16">Mt 4:15-16</a>). Jesus taught in Galilee, a predominantly non-Jewish area, traveled to Tyre and Sidon (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.24">Mk 7:24</a>) and through the Decapolis (v <a href="?bref=Mark.7.31">31</a>). He ministered to a Roman centurion (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.1-10">Lk 7:1-10</a>), the widow of Nain (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.7.11-17">11-17</a>), and a Syrophoenician woman (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.26">Mk 7:26</a>). People from Idumea came to observe his miracles (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.8">3:8</a>).</p>
<p>The teaching of Jesus was also wide in scope. The narrative of the great judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Mt 25:31-46</a>) depicts all nations gathered before the Son of Man, and Jesus commissions the apostles to “make disciples of all nations” (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Mt 28:19</a>).</p>
<p>Although the book of Acts does not overlook the nations’ role in the death of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.27">Acts 4:27</a>) and their role in opposing the ministry of Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.17">26:17</a>), it nevertheless clearly indicates that the church fulfilled its commission to present the gospel to non-Jewish peoples. Peter proclaims the message about Jesus to the household of Cornelius, a Roman soldier of the Italian Cohort (ch <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10</a>). Although the early church resisted the fact that non-Jewish peoples might freely receive the gift of the Spirit, they eventually welcomed this conclusion (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.1-8">11:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-29">15:1-29</a>). Paul traveled through Cyprus, Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy, founding or visiting churches that were predominantly Gentile. The book of Acts ends dramatically with Paul preaching the gospel in the city of Rome, the heart of the Roman Empire.</p>

  <title>Nazarene</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NAZARENE</p>
<p class="fl">Native or inhabitant of Nazareth, a NT town in lower Galilee.</p>
<p>Nazareth was Jesus’ hometown during the first 30 years of his life. Since the name Jesus was a common name among the Jews, and since surnames were not used, perhaps the designation Nazarene differentiated Jesus of Nazareth from others with the same name (see Greek texts of <a href="?bref=Matt.27.16-17">Mt 27:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.45">Acts 7:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.11">Col 4:11</a>; and <a href="?bref=Heb.4.8">Heb 4:8</a>, where the name Jesus refers to other men).</p>
<p>In the original texts, the designation Jesus the Nazarene was used by demons (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.24">Mk 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.34">Lk 4:34</a>), the crowd outside Jericho (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.47">Mk 10:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.37">Lk 18:37</a>), a servant girl (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.67">Mk 14:67</a>), soldiers (<a href="?bref=John.18.5-7">Jn 18:5-7</a>), Pilate (<a href="?bref=John.19.19">Jn 19:19</a>), the two disciples on the road to Emmaus (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.19">Lk 24:19</a>), and the angel at the tomb (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.6">Mk 16:6</a>).</p>
<p>The apostles in Acts used the designation to identify Jesus. Peter speaks of Jesus the Nazarene in his sermon on the day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.22">Acts 2:22</a>), and at the temple gate in a subsequent healing (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.10">4:10</a>). Paul identifies Jesus as such in <a href="?bref=Acts.26.9">Acts 26:9</a>.</p>
<p>One hostile reference to the name is in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.14">Acts 6:14</a>. The false witnesses against Stephen accused him before the Sanhedrin of saying, “This Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place [temple] and alter the customs that Moses handed down to us” (see Greek). Another antagonistic reference is in <a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">Acts 24:5</a>, the only reference to Jesus’ followers as Nazarenes. Tertullus accused Paul, saying, “For we have found him to be a troublemaker, a man who is constantly inciting the Jews throughout the world to riots and rebellions against the Roman government. He is a ringleader of the sect known as the Nazarenes” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>With regard to the name “Nazarene,” <a href="?bref=Matt.2.23">Matthew 2:23</a> has always been problematic: “So they went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets concerning the Messiah: ‘He will be called a Nazarene’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). No OT prophecy directly states that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. Some scholars relate Matthew’s reference to <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Isaiah 11:1</a>, which speaks of the Messiah as a Branch, a Hebrew term derived from the same root as “Nazareth.” Others suggest that the OT prophecies concern the despising and reviling of the Messiah as having been thought by others to be a Nazarene, when it was well known that the Messiah was supposed to come from Bethlehem, the city of David. Of course, that is where Jesus was born, but he was raised in Nazareth and subsequently was known as a Nazarene and thereby ridiculed. Thus, the prophecy was fulfilled when some of his contemporaries called him a Nazarene, from the despised town of Nazareth (<a href="?bref=John.1.46">Jn 1:46</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.13.54">Mt 13:54</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.2-3">Mk 6:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.22">Lk 4:22</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">NAZARENES</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to those who followed Jesus of Nazareth. Since Jesus was known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus the Nazarene, it was easy to transfer that title to his followers. They were “followers of the Nazarene” or “Nazarenes.” The earliest use of the term is in <a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">Acts 24:5</a>, where Tertullus accused the apostle Paul of being “a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.” Certainly, he did not intend the title as a compliment. The early Christians probably did not use that name for themselves, whereas later Jewish-Christian and Gnostic groups did call themselves Nazarenes. One early writing was even called <span class="ital">The Gospel of the Nazarenes.</span></p>

<p class="h1">NAZARETH</p>
<p class="fl">Village in the Roman province of Galilee, the home of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus. Always small and isolated, Nazareth is not mentioned in the OT, the Apocrypha, intertestamental Jewish writings, or the histories of Josephus. The town lies just north of the plain of Esdraelon in the limestone hills of the southern Lebanon range. It is situated on three sides of a hill. This location forms a sheltered valley with a moderate climate favorable to fruits and wildflowers. Trade routes and roads passed near Nazareth, but the village itself was not on any main road. Nazareth is about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) west of the Sea of Galilee and 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) east of the Mediterranean. Jerusalem lies about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) south. Archaeological remains indicate that the ancient town was higher on the western hill than the present village (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.4.29">Lk 4:29</a>). In the time of Christ, Nazareth, along with the entire region of south Galilee, lay outside the mainstream of Jewish life, providing the background for Nathanael’s wry remark to Philip, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (<a href="?bref=John.1.46">Jn 1:46</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfNazareth"/>
<p>Nazareth is first mentioned in the NT as the home of Mary and Joseph (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-27">Lk 1:26-27</a>). Sometime after Jesus was born at his parents’ ancestral town of Bethlehem (about 80 miles, or 128.7 kilometers, to the south), Mary and Joseph returned to Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.23">Mt 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.39">Lk 2:39</a>). Jesus grew up there (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.39-40,51">Lk 2:39-40, 51</a>), leaving the village to be baptized by John in the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.9">Mk 1:9</a>). When John was arrested, Jesus moved to Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13">Mt 4:13</a>). Though Jesus was often identified by his boyhood city as “Jesus of Nazareth” (see <a href="?bref=Mark.10.47">Mk 10:47</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.5,7">Jn 18:5, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.22">Acts 2:22</a>), the NT records only one subsequent visit by Jesus to Nazareth. On this occasion, Jesus preached in the synagogue and was rejected by the townspeople (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-30">Lk 4:16-30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.13.54-58">Mt 13:54-58</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.1-6">Mk 6:1-6</a>). Jesus’ followers were also derisively called “Nazarenes” (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">Acts 24:5</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheNazarethDecree"/>
<p>Nazareth remained a Jewish city until the time of the emperor Constantine (d. <span class="era">AD</span> 327), when it became a sacred place for Christian pilgrims. A large basilica was built in Nazareth about <span class="era">AD</span> 600. Arabs and Crusaders alternately controlled the village until 1517, when it fell to the Turks, who forced all Christians to leave. Christians returned in 1620, and the town became an important Christian center.</p>

  <title>Nazarite*, Nazirite</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NAZARITE*, NAZIRITE </p>
<p class="fl">Person who was either chosen or consecrated for life or for a set period of time to complete a vow to God. The Nazirite (Nazarite) devoted himself to self-imposed discipline in order to perform some special service (<a href="?bref=Num.6.1-21">Nm 6:1-21</a>).</p>
<p>Israelite tradition viewed the Nazirite as consecrated for life. Samson was the ancient hero of the Nazirites. He was “consecrated to God” through the vow of his mother (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.5">Jgs 13:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.16.17">16:17</a>) and remained under that vow to the “day of his death” (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.7">13:7</a>). As long as Samson’s hair was not cut, he was able to receive the Spirit of the Lord and thereby perform amazing physical feats.</p>
<p>Early Nazirite vows may have been associated with holy-war ceremonies. Combatants were consecrated to God and perhaps wore long hair (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.5">Jgs 13:5</a>). The prophet Samuel did not cut his hair because of his mother’s vow that no razor would touch his head (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.11">1 Sm 1:11</a>); the Septuagint adds that he was not to drink wine. The Nazirite vow of uncut hair was associated with being consecrated to God’s service and was especially common during the charismatic days of Israel’s early leaders.</p>
<p>Naziritism developed into a ritual for those who sought to consecrate themselves temporarily to God. During the period of consecration, the devotee abstained from drinking wine, allowed his hair to grow, and avoided all contact with dead bodies.</p>
<p>Uncut hair symbolizes strength and life. Perhaps this is the intended meaning of <span class="hebrew">nazir</span> when used to describe Joseph in the blessing of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.26">Gn 49:26</a>) and in the blessing of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.16">Dt 33:16</a>). Vineyards that were not pruned in sabbatical or jubilee years were said to be <span class="hebrew">nazir</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>In later times, touching or coming in close proximity to a dead body was the most serious offense against the vow. Should anyone die in his presence, a Nazirite became impure. Such a contaminated Nazirite was expected to shave his “defiled head” on the day of cleansing. Next, he would bring two young pigeons to the priest, who would offer one as a sin offering. And finally, he must bring a male lamb for a guilt offering (<a href="?bref=Num.6.9-12">Nm 6:9-12</a>). Because of this defilement, the Nazirite had to begin his days of separation again.</p>
<p>At the end of his period of separation he “desecrated” himself through a ceremony: he offered a sacrifice for sin and a communion sacrifice, then he shaved his head and burnt the hair. Thereafter, the Nazirite returned to his normal life and could drink wine (<a href="?bref=Num.6.13-21">Nm 6:13-21</a>).</p>
<p>Paul completed a similar vow at Cenchrea in NT times (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">Acts 18:18</a>) and, then again, along with four other Nazirites in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.23-24">Acts 21:23-24</a>). In the Talmud the period of time for the consecration was usually 30 days. It was customary for the wealthy to aid poor Nazirites in the purchase of their offerings. During the Maccabean period, the Nazirites were unable to complete their rites because the temple was profaned (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.49-51">1 Macc 3:49-51</a>).</p>

<p>Nebuchadnezzar states that he conquered all of “Hatti-country,” which is a term used for all of Palestine and Syria, including Judah. Jehoiakim had been made king of Judah by Pharaoh Neco (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.34">2 Kgs 23:34</a>) and initially submitted to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.2">24:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-2">Dn 1:1-2</a>), but three years later rebelled. Jehoiakim died and his son Jehoiachin succeeded to the throne (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.6">2 Kgs 24:6</a>); however, he reigned for only three months. Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem in 598 <span class="era">BC</span> and took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.10-17">10-17</a>). He replaced Jehoiachin with his Uncle Mattaniah, whom he renamed Zedekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.17">2 Kgs 24:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.10">2 Chr 36:10</a>).</p>
<p>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.20">2 Kgs 24:20</a>). Nebuchadnezzar’s armies besieged the city of Jerusalem and captured Zedekiah. He was brought to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, where Zedekiah’s sons were slain before his eyes. He was then blinded, bound, and taken captive to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.6-7">25:6-7</a>). The temple was looted and burned, the city walls were dismantled, and the city was plundered and razed (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.9-17">9-17</a>). The leading people of the nation were either killed or taken into captivity.</p>
<p>The remnant of the people in Judah were put under the charge of Gedaliah, the appointed governor. After his treacherous murder, the Jews fled to Egypt. Both Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.8-13">Jer 43:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.13-24">46:13-24</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.1-32.32">Ez 29–32</a>) prophesied that Nebuchadnezzar would invade Egypt. Josephus gives the date as the 23d year of Nebuchadnezzar (582/581 <span class="era">BC</span>), but a fragmentary historical inscription dating to the 37th year of Nebuchadnezzar (568/567 <span class="era">BC</span>) indicates that the defeat of Egypt occurred during the reign of Amasis.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar’s military successes were in many respects overshadowed by his building activities in Babylon. The king voiced his pride when he declared, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my majesty?” (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.30">Dn 4:30</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The hanging gardens were acclaimed as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. They were built on terraces in an effort to cure his Median queen of her homesickness for the mountains of her homeland.</p>
<p>The events of the book of Daniel center on Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel was among the captives taken to Babylon in 605 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nebuchadnezzar became aware of Daniel when the king had a dream that none of his occult experts could interpret (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">2</a>). The Lord gave to Daniel the interpretation of the dream; the human image that the king saw in his dream represented the various governments from the New Babylonian Empire to the reign of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar set up a large human statue that was 90 feet (27.4 meters) high and 9 feet (2.7 meters) wide. Failure to worship the image would incur death by fire. The three compatriots of Daniel refused and were thrown into a furnace from which the Lord delivered them unhurt (ch <a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">3</a>).</p>
<p>The king had another dream about a great tree that was cut down but later sprouted from the stump (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.4-27">4:4-27</a>). Again the “wise men of Babylon” could not give the interpretation, but Daniel informed the king that the dream prophesied a humbling experience lasting seven years as a consequence of the king’s pride (vv <a href="?bref=Dan.4.28-33">28-33</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Pharaoh of the 26th dynasty of the Saite kings, who succeeded his father, Psammetichus, in 610 <span class="era">BC</span>. Psammetichus had ruled 54 years over Egypt and was instrumental in the renewal of archaic art forms and in the revival of religious fervor. In addition to this, Psammetichus had fortified the borders with garrisons and driven the Assyrians beyond the northeast border into Canaan. The alliance of the Babylonians and Medes made Psammetichus realize the potential threat to Egypt’s independence, and he allied himself with Assyria, his former enemy.</p>
<p>Neco fell heir to the accomplishments of his father and to an international political scene out of which he could not easily withdraw. He was allied with a losing power, as Nineveh, Assyria’s capital, fell in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>. Neco was called upon to assist the king of Assyria, who had retreated to Harran from the Babylonian forces under Nebuchadnezzar. Neco moved his troops through Judah on his way to Carchemish to engage in battle with the Babylonians. As the troops moved through the Megiddo pass, they were ambushed by Judean troops under King Josiah. Neco had requested safe passage, but Josiah foolhardily refused. Josiah was killed in the field (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29-30">2 Kgs 23:29-30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.20-25">2 Chr 35:20-25</a>). Neco continued onward to Carchemish. The battle (605 <span class="era">BC</span>) turned out to be a great victory for the young Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar recorded it in glowing terms: “As for the rest of the Egyptian army which had escaped from the defeat . . . the Babylonian troops overtook and defeated them; so that not a single man escaped to that country.” The OT briefly observes: “The king of Egypt never returned after that” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.7">2 Kgs 24:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Neco strengthened Egypt by a policy of isolation. He made Judah a buffer zone and fortified the borders successfully in order to keep the Babylonians from penetrating into Egypt. He had deposed Jehoahaz, the newly enthroned king of three months, brought him to Riblah in Syria, and later to Egypt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.33-34">2 Kgs 23:33-34</a>). Jehoiakim succeeded to the Davidic throne in Jerusalem, and Judah was forced to pay a tribute of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.33-36">33-36</a>). When Judah fell to Babylon, the Judeans considered the Egyptian interest in their survival as vital to Egypt’s independence and requested help against Babylonia. The prophet Jeremiah strongly spoke against this dependence on Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.17-24">Jer 46:17-24</a>). Whether Neco risked his forces to penetrate into Judah, a Babylonian province, is not certain. Nebuchadnezzar quickly moved his forces to Judah, exiled Jehoiakim to Babylon, and enthroned Zedekiah (597 <span class="era">BC</span>). Shortly thereafter, Neco died (595 <span class="era">BC</span>). His son, Psammetichus II, succeeded him.</p>

<p class="h1">NEEDLE</p>
<p class="fl">Object used in Jesus’ lesson about the rich man and entrance into God’s kingdom. Following his discussion with the rich young ruler, Jesus told his disciples that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.24">Mt 19:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.25">Mk 10:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.25">Lk 18:25</a>). Jesus was not condemning riches or wealth but rather the change of will and false security that they may engender, as was the case with the rich young ruler (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.19.21-22">Mt 19:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.21-22">Mk 10:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.22-23">Lk 18:22-23</a>). Entrance into God’s kingdom is an act of God, not of man. Using the largest land animal in Palestine, Jesus paralleled the absurdity of a camel’s passing through the eye of a needle with a rich man’s attempt to use his position and possessions to gain entrance into heaven. A similar expression is found in rabbinic literature, where the elephant is pictured as passing through the eye of a needle.</p>

<p class="h1">NEGEB*, NEGEV</p>
<p class="fl">Southernmost region of Palestine. The name comes from the root “to be dry, parched,” although its basic meaning is “south country, south.” It is an area with no precise geographical boundaries. From north to south, the Negev covers the area between Beersheba and Kadesh-barnea. From west to east it extends from near the Mediterranean to the Arabah, a distance of some 70 miles (112.6 kilometers).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AvedatCanyonInTheNegev"/>
<p>This is an arid section of the country, with infrequent and limited rainfall. With limited water resources, there was restricted opportunity for agriculture, although in the northern area some grain farming was done on a small scale, with possibly one crop failure every three years. A pastoral economy existed based primarily on the raising of sheep, goats, and camels. Simeon received this territory, including the cities, such as Arad and Rehoboth, in the tribal division of the Promised Land. Later, Judah absorbed this tribe. During the monarchy, the Israelites pushed into the Negev. During the reigns of Solomon and Jehoshaphat, there was commercial traffic to and from the port of Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqaba. In Greco-Roman times the Nabateans inhabited the Negev. Through careful preservation of rainwater, they developed limited agriculture and sustained a number of towns. During NT times the Idumeans controlled the Negev.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">kjv</span> does not use the term Negev but ordinarily translates it as “the south.” On the other hand, the <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, and <span class="sc">nlt</span> regularly use the name for the territory. Abraham was often associated with the Negev (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.9">Gn 12:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.13.1-2">13:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.20.1">20:1</a>). David told Achish, king of Gath, that he had raided “the Negev of Judah,” “the Negev of Jerahmeelites,” and “the Negev of the Kenites” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.10">1 Sm 27:10</a>), while the Egyptian captured by David stated that the Amalekites had made incursions against “the Negev of the Cherethites,” “the Negev of Judah,” and “the Negev of Caleb” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.14">1 Sm 30:14</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Name of three men mentioned in the OT after the period of the exile. The name means “the Lord comforts” and was appropriate for this time of hope and fulfillment.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Leader mentioned in a list of Jewish exiles who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel sometime after 538 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.2">Ezr 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.7">Neh 7:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ruler of half the district of Beth-zur who helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall in 444 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.16">Neh 3:16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Governor of Judah during the restoration. Originally cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes I (464–424 <span class="era">BC</span>), Nehemiah pleaded to be sent to Judah to aid his fellow Jews in their difficulties and in particular to rebuild Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1-2.8">Neh 1:1–2:8</a>). He was appointed governor of Judah for 12 years.</p>
<p class="list-text">After inspecting the walls upon his arrival, he realized that their repair was to be his prime task. This repair would guarantee the security of the city and could provide a focal point for the Jewish community scattered throughout Judah. That he was able to marshal support for this project and to complete it attests to his skills in management and administration. He also had a strong personal faith, as his prayers (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.4-11">Neh 1:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.4">2:4</a>) and conviction of divine guidance and help (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.8,18,20">2:8, 18, 20</a>) attest. He had to overcome hostility and intimidation from powerful neighboring authorities in Samaria, Ammon, and Arabia (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-9">4:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-14">6:1-14</a>). He also required economic justice (ch <a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-19">5</a>). A few rich Jews were exploiting a food shortage by exacting high interest from their poorer brothers.</p>
<p class="list-text">Included in Nehemiah’s concern for Jerusalem was a strong interest in the maintenance of temple worship. He was involved in the production of a document in which the Jewish community pledged themselves to support the temple personnel and to provide offerings (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.1,32-39">Neh 10:1, 32-39</a>). Clearly, he realized that Judah needed at its heart a religious emphasis as well as political stability. These particular religious reforms are linked with those of his second period as governor (ch <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1-31">13</a>). Other reforms of that period concerned the observance of the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-22">13:15-22</a>) and the problem of marriages to non-Jews (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-27">13:23-27</a>). Nehemiah was a forceful leader (v <a href="?bref=Neh.13.25">25</a>) who used his imperial powers to restore to the settlers a national and religious identity in a period of political and economic weakness.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">In 597 <span class="era">BC</span> Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon took away the first exiles from Jerusalem. In 586 <span class="era">BC</span> the Babylonians returned, pillaged and burned the city and its temple, and took an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Judeans into exile. The expatriates settled in various districts where they enjoyed a measure of freedom. They engaged in agriculture and commerce and in some instances acquired considerable wealth. The elders continued to function, prophets like Ezekiel ministered among the exiles, and resistance to religious apostasy was kept alive in the popular mind.</p>
<p>With the appearance of the Persian king Cyrus the Great (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Jewish exiles’ prospects altered dramatically. Cyrus was a civilized and enlightened statesman, and within a short time after his conquest of Babylon, he issued an edict (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezr 1:2-4</a>) that granted the expatriates permission to return to their homeland. Two separate groups of exiles returned to Judah and built a new sanctuary in Jerusalem on the site of Solomon’s temple in 516 <span class="era">BC</span>. Then, under King Artaxerxes I (464–424 <span class="era">BC</span>), two separate groups returned from Babylon under Ezra (458 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Nehemiah (445 <span class="era">BC</span>), respectively. From this seedbed there sprang the theocratic people of Judah, the Jews, dedicated to the law of God, isolated from foreign influence, and centered in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Nehemiah’s personal memoirs form a considerable portion of the book that bears his name. These memoirs reveal a man of nobility and piety, who was compassionate, prudent, and patriotic. He was a man of generosity and fidelity, political acumen, and religious zeal, of total dedication to God, outstanding organizational ability, and dynamic leadership. At the same time Nehemiah possessed a capacity for ruthlessness when confronting the sin and waywardness of his compatriots (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.1-13">Neh 5:1-13</a>) and the intrigues of powerful non-Jewish enemies (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.8,28">13:8, 28</a>). Not surprisingly, then, a dispirited and dejected people awoke from their lethargic and apathetic state and responded to Nehemiah’s stringent approach to their situation (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.4">2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.14,22,31">13:14, 22, 31</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoricalAuthenticity">Historical Authenticity</p>
<p class="fl">According to Josephus and other early writers, the books of Ezra and Nehemiah formed one book in the early Hebrew Bible entitled the book of Ezra. The earliest Hebrew manuscript in which the two books are divided is dated 1448, and modern Hebrew Bibles refer to them as the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. In manuscripts of the Greek OT (LXX) they also formed one book. Origen, in the beginning of the third century, is the first to attest to a division. There is general acknowledgment of the genuineness of the personal memoirs of Nehemiah, which constitute a major part of the book.</p>
<p>The historical framework of the book is confirmed by papyri that were discovered between 1898 and 1908 in Elephantine, an island in the upper Nile. Here Psammetichus II (593–588 <span class="era">BC</span>) established a Jewish colony. The Elephantine papyri are well preserved, written in Aramaic, and are the fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> literary remains of this Jewish colony of the Persian period.</p>
<p>The most important item among the papyri is a copy of a letter sent to the Persian governor of Judah in 407 <span class="era">BC</span>. Three years earlier the Jewish temple in Elephantine had been destroyed. This disaster was the occasion of a letter to Jehohanan, the high priest in Jerusalem (see <a href="?bref=Neh.12.12-13">Neh 12:12-13</a>). Now, in their letter to the governor in Judah, they asked permission to rebuild their temple and said that they had sent a similar request to Delaiah and Shelamiah, the sons of Sanballat (Nehemiah’s enemy, <a href="?bref=Neh.2.10,19">2:10, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1">4:1</a>). The Elephantine papyri reveal that Sanballat was governor of the province of Samaria and that Tobiah was governor of the province of Ammon in Transjordan (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.10,19">2:10, 19</a>). Here, then, is evidence that there was in Judah a twofold authority, civil and religious, and that the high priest of 408–407 <span class="era">BC</span> was Jehohanan (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.13">12:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Chronology">Chronology</p>
<p class="fl">The question about whether Ezra or Nehemiah came to Jerusalem first has been hotly debated. There is no doubt that Nehemiah arrived in the city in 445 <span class="era">BC</span>. The objections to the view that Ezra came to Jerusalem 13 years earlier, in 458 <span class="era">BC</span>, raise questions concerning historical and textual data that are of such complexity as to preclude discussion of them here. However, achieving an understanding of the spiritual values of the book does not depend on a correct interpretation of the details of chronology. Arguments against the traditional chronology are neither altogether decisive, nor do they dispel the inherent complexities.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Significance">Significance</p>
<p class="fl">When the exiles returned to Jerusalem, Judah had neither nationhood nor political status. Only one thing remained to them: their religion. They were the “remnant” of Yahweh’s chosen people, from whom would rise the new and glorious Israel. It was this vision that explains Nehemiah’s insistence that the Jewish people maintain the purity and exclusiveness of their religious faith and practice in order to rejuvenate their national life and rebuild the city walls (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">6:15</a>), because this symbolized the racial and the religious purity of the people. He also insisted on separation from paganism, prohibition of marriage with non-Jews (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-28">13:23-28</a>), and careful observance of the laws of the Sabbath (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-22">15-22</a>).</p>
<p>It is, therefore, difficult to exaggerate the significance of the book of Nehemiah. Along with the book of Ezra, it furnishes the only consecutive Hebrew account of that period in Jewish history when the foundations of Judaism—with its inflexible segregation of the Jews and its passionate veneration of the Mosaic law—were laid. Of course, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi also contribute to knowledge of the period, but Nehemiah (with Ezra) provides a progressive narrative of this epoch. The return of the expatriates from Babylon to Jerusalem constitutes a resumption of the saving purposes of God for his ancient people, leading to the advent of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The account of the return from Babylon under Nehemiah emphasizes the religious aspect of the community of repatriates in Jerusalem. But other, secondary factors should be noted: Nehemiah’s preoccupation with Judah’s political security and constitutional status to ensure its independence of Samaria; the rebuilding of the city walls; Nehemiah’s resettlements of population (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.4">7:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.1-2">11:1-2</a>); and his appointment to the governorship of the new province. However, there is no reference in the book of Nehemiah (or for that matter in Ezra) to a restoration to nationhood under a scion of the house of David—no mention of a Messiah, no allusion to the universal kingdom of God. Nehemiah manifests absolute loyalty to the Persian overlord who, while showing remarkable openness to Nehemiah’s request (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.4-9">2:4-9</a>), still continues to levy taxes (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.4,15">5:4, 15</a>).</p>
<p>The repatriates retreated behind their city’s new walls and congregated around the second temple, completed in 516 <span class="era">BC</span>. “The book of the law of Moses” (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.1">8:1</a>), recognized by the Persian overlord as the law of the land of Judah, became central to Jewish devotion and worship. Judaism was the product of the restoration, which became both a protective barrier against, and a wall of separation from, the Gentiles. Religious institutions initiated during the Babylonian exile and transplanted to Jerusalem took deep and firm root: the synagogue where the Law and the Prophets were read and the prayers were offered; the scribes who worked with single-minded devotion; and the Sanhedrin that continued to serve the new theocracy.</p>
<p>The Jewish remnant of the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> parallels the modern Christian church in that both share the challenge of spiritual reconstruction and renewal essential to God’s purposes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">In the winter of 445 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Persian court was in Susa, the ancient capital of Elam (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1">1:1</a>). There Nehemiah occupied a position of honor and influence (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">2:1</a>). From Jerusalem, a company of Judeans arrived, among them Nehemiah’s brother, whose description of conditions in Jerusalem horrified and grieved Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.2-4">1:2-4</a>). Four months later, and after much prayer, he reached Jerusalem with an armed escort (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.5-2.11">1:5–2:11</a>). After a three-day inspection of the situation, Nehemiah realized that rebuilding the walls would be his primary task (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.12-3.32">2:12–3:32</a>).</p>
<p>An outburst of new national spirit caused latent opposition to surface. Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem were powerful, resourceful, astute antagonists. Through ridicule and rumors, they insinuated that work on the walls was a form of rebellion against the king (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.1-3,7-14">4:1-3, 7-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-9">6:1-9</a>). But Nehemiah countered every subterfuge and stratagem with prayer and with an adamant refusal to deviate from his goal. There was also hostility from traitors within the camp (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.10-19">6:10-19</a>). Despite all opposition, Jerusalem’s walls were reconstructed (v <a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">15</a>) and rededicated amid enthusiastic celebration (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.27-43">12:27-43</a>).</p>
<p>The community’s response to the reading by Ezra, priest and scribe, of the law of Moses and to its interpretation by the Levites (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.1-8">8:1-8</a>), was a complex response of sorrow for sin and rejoicing in God (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.8.9-18">9-18</a>); of fasting and prayer (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.1-37">9:1-37</a>); of renewing the covenant (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.38-10.29">9:38–10:29</a>); and of self-commitment to obey God’s commandments, ordinances, and statutes (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.30-39">10:30-39</a>). Chapters <a href="?bref=Neh.11.1-36">11</a> and <a href="?bref=Neh.12.1-47">12</a> refer to various offices and duties, civil and religious, and the names of the people appointed to them. Then follows the decision to exclude all people of foreign descent from Judaism (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>At this juncture Nehemiah traveled to Susa to give an account of his stewardship; a further leave of absence being granted, he returned to Jerusalem to find that serious irregularities were again present. His enemy Tobiah and the priest Eliashib were embroiled (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.4-9">13:4-9</a>); the people failed to provide the Levites with adequate maintenance (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.13.10-14">10-14</a>); the laws of the Sabbath were being violated (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.13.15-22">15-22</a>); and Jews were marrying non-Jews (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-32">23-32</a>). Due to the increase of intermarriage with foreigners, the offspring could not speak Hebrew (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-25">23-25</a>). The danger of assimilation was halted by enforcing a policy of exclusivism.</p>
<p>The book of Nehemiah ends rather abruptly with a description of his vigorous and ruthless handling of these deviations from the newly established principles and precepts of Judaism.</p>

<p class="h1">NEIGHBOR</p>
<p class="fl">Concept apparently limited in the OT period and late Judaism to one’s fellow Israelite, or member of the covenant, and extended by Jesus to include anyone encountered in life.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Although it is never explicitly limited as such, the prominent connotation of “neighbor” in the OT is that of a fellow member of the covenant community; that is, another Israelite (see <a href="?bref=Lev.6.1-7">Lv 6:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.1-37">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.2-3">Dt 15:2-3</a>). In <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Leviticus 19:18</a>, a passage often quoted in the NT, the Israelite is commanded to “love your neighbor as yourself.” In <a href="?bref=Lev.19.34">19:34</a>, it is explicitly stated that such love should also be shown to the foreigner (or “sojourner”) passing through the land. If “neighbor” (v <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">18</a>) implied a more encompassing notion, such as “mankind” or “fellow man,” there presumably would have been no need to include the further stipulation in verse <a href="?bref=Lev.19.34">34</a>. “Neighbor” was therefore probably taken to mean one’s immediate neighbor, the fellow Israelite.</p>
<p>Within the covenant community, love of neighbor involved certain responsibilities explicitly set forth in the law. The neighbor was to be treated fairly (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.5-15">Ex 22:5-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.2-7">Lv 6:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-18">19:9-18</a>) and respected (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.16">Ex 20:16</a>), as were his belongings (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>). To foster such just and merciful relationships within the covenant community, the neighbor was to be thought of as a “brother” (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.25">Lv 25:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.1-4">Dt 22:1-4</a>). What one did to one’s neighbor was to be returned in kind (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.19-23">Lv 24:19-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.19.11-19">Dt 19:11-19</a>).</p>
<p>The grave importance attached to treatment of the neighbor is understandable when seen as part of one’s wider relationship with God and was considered something that could affect significantly the divine-human relationship (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.1-7">Lv 6:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.1-37">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.17">25:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.10-13">Dt 24:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.12.1-8">Ps 12</a>). Israelites were to treat their neighbors in the same loving way they had themselves been treated by God (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.21">Ex 22:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.35-38">Lv 25:35-38</a>).</p>
<p>The importance of the neighbor relationship within the covenant community is also demonstrated by the fact that when such responsibilities were ignored, a societal breakdown or national turmoil followed (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">Dt 28:15-68</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.1-3">Hos 4:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-7">Am 2:6-7</a>). That the Israelites often did neglect love for neighbor, particularly the neighbor in need, is a contributing cause for the divine punishment of the exile (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.7-9">Jer 5:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.1-15">7:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.2-9">9:2-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.1-3">Hos 4:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-7">Am 2:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.10-13">5:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.4-6">8:4-6</a>). The mere fact that proper love of neighbor was also part of Israel’s hope for the messianic age to come (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.34">Jer 31:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.10">Zec 3:10</a>) also points to its common neglect within the OT covenant community.</p>
<p class="h2" id="InLateJudaism">In Late Judaism</p>
<p class="fl">From the exilic experience, Israel recognized that divine blessing was conditional somewhat on justice and love exercised toward one another (<a href="?bref=Zech.8.14-17">Zec 8:14-17</a>). The identity of the “neighbor” was debatable, however. Several factors suggest that “neighbor” was limited in this period to the fellow Israelite and the proselyte (gentile convert to Judaism). Evidence from rabbinic material excludes Samaritans and the Gentiles living in the land from being considered “neighbors” and thus worthy of love. Within the Jewish Essene community at Qumran, the “neighbor” to be respected and treated fairly was restricted to one’s fellow community members. Finally, when Jesus recalls, “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy’” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43">Mt 5:43</a>), he is quoting only partially from the OT (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18</a>—“You shall love your neighbor”). The last phrase (“and hate your enemy”) reflects the contemporary Jewish feeling toward outsiders; that is, God did not require love toward those considered “enemies” but only toward fellow countrymen.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus differed dramatically from his Jewish contemporaries by eradicating the limitations on the neighbor to be loved. In contrast to those who would limit love to one’s fellow countrymen, Jesus advocated extending the obligation reserved for the neighbor to the enemy as well (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-48">Mt 5:43-48</a>), and in so doing, he destroyed the distinction between neighbor and enemy altogether.</p>
<p>On another occasion, a scribe asked Jesus what was the greatest commandment given by God (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.28-31">Mk 12:28-31</a>). In response, Jesus cited <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> concerning the nature of God and man’s obligation to love God with his entire being: heart, soul, and mind. Of significance is that Jesus did not stop there but linked with this a second commandment to “love your neighbor as yourself” (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18</a>). Some scholars suggest that this dramatic and close association of love of God and love of neighbor originated with Jesus. If Jesus was the first to tie these commands together (see <a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Mt 22:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.29-31">Mk 12:29-31</a>), it reveals our Lord’s own understanding of the relation of these two obligations; proper love for neighbor derives from love for God, and conversely, love for God is inseparable from meeting the needs of a neighbor in love.</p>
<p>The debate in Jesus’ time was not over how to properly treat a neighbor but who, in fact, was the neighbor. Jesus is asked this very question by an expert of the law (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.29">Lk 10:29</a>). Jesus had complimented the lawyer for his clear understanding of what was required to inherit eternal life, namely, love of God and love of neighbor. Luke suggests that the lawyer asked the further qualifying question in order to “justify himself,” that is, justify his actual behavior of limited love toward his fellow man. Jesus chose not to respond directly but through the use of a parable, in this case, the familiar parable of the Good Samaritan (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.10.30-35">30-35</a>).</p>
<p>In order to open the lawyer’s eyes to the tragic shortsightedness of his question, Jesus related an everyday story of a man traveling the treacherous road from Jerusalem down to Jericho, a road particularly plagued by robbers. The traveler is robbed, stripped, beaten, and left half dead. To this point, the lawyer might have assumed Jesus was offering an example of who constitutes a “neighbor”—a fellow Jew in need. Jesus proceeds, however, to introduce two figures, a priest and a Levite who, in an academic discussion, could have argued quite ably on who is the neighbor God calls one to love. The lawyer would no doubt have anticipated such experts in the law to act rightly toward the victim. In contrast, the priest and Levite, upon seeing the man in need, respond by “passing by on the other side.” Unable to determine whether the victim was dead or barely alive, and possibly not wanting to risk uncleanness, the experts of the law pass by, thus violating the greatest of the commandments just identified by the lawyer (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.25-28">10:25-28</a>).</p>
<p>Enter a Samaritan—a figure especially despised by the Jews. Viewed as heretics by the Jewish religious authorities, the Samaritans were disqualified in rabbinic circles from being considered a “neighbor” and thus worthy of love. In fact, previous centuries had witnessed the slaughter of many Samaritans by Jewish rulers, and animosity clearly existed between the two peoples (see <a href="?bref=John.4.9">Jn 4:9</a>). While the lawyer listening to the parable would have expected the priest and Levite to act justly toward the victim, he must have been surprised that a hated Samaritan would show compassion and thus fulfill the greatest commandment. Jesus intentionally spelled out the extent of the Samaritan’s compassion (immediate care in dressing wounds, transport to the inn, care for the victim there and extended care in paying for care by others while he is away, <a href="?bref=Luke.10.34-35">Lk 10:34-35</a>) to such a degree that the lawyer would have no doubt as to the genuineness of the Samaritan’s love. The irony of the story is that one not considered worthy to be called “neighbor” by Jews was precisely the one who showed himself to be “neighbor” to the victim (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.10.36-37">36-37</a>).</p>
<p>The parable, like the statement in <a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-48">Matthew 5:43-48</a>, reveals Jesus’ own understanding of “neighbor” and what “love of neighbor” demands. Jesus sets no limitation on who qualifies as the neighbor commanded by God to be loved.</p>
<p>The forcefulness and power of Jesus’ teachings on the love of neighbor and its relationship to one’s love for God are demonstrated by a similar emphasis within the early church. Paul on two occasions called the love of neighbor the fulfillment of the entire law (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.14">Gal 5:14</a>), while James referred to the same commandment as “the royal law” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.8">Jas 2:8</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Early group of the human race, mentioned only twice in the OT (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.4">Gn 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Nm 13:33</a>; <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (the Septuagint) rendered the name “Nephilim” as “giants,” and other versions followed this rendering, including the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. Modern translations, however, usually designate them as Nephilim, thus identifying them with the Anakim (<a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Nm 13:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.21">Dt 2:21</a>) and the Rephaim (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">Dt 2:20</a>). The latter two were reputed to be large physically, hence the rendering “giants.”</p>
<p>The Nephilim are of unknown origin. Some writers have taken the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">naphal</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to fall,” to imply that the Nephilim were “fallen ones”—that is, fallen angels who subsequently mated with human women. But Christ taught that angels do not have carnal relationships (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.34-35">Lk 20:34-35</a>), and therefore this view can only be maintained by assuming that <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-4">Genesis 6:1-4</a> reflects Greek mythology, in which such unions occurred. The Genesis passage, however, deals with anthropology, not mythology.</p>
<p>The Nephilim were evidently not the “sons of God” and seem to be different also from the “daughters of men.” The best classification is with the Anakim and Rephaim as ancient peoples of unknown origin.</p>

Although Ner’s father’s name was given as Abiel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.51">1 Sm 14:51</a>), disputed readings put Ner among the sons of Jeiel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.29-30">1 Chr 8:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.35-36">9:35-36</a>).

Ner was, then, the grandfather or the uncle of Saul, probably the latter. One suggestion is that there were two men called Kish, one of whom was Ner’s brother, the other his son. Another is that there were two men called Ner. These speculations demonstrate that genealogical tables were sometimes incomplete or ambiguous.</p>

  <title>Nethinim*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NETHINIM*</p>
<p class="fl">Term appearing only in the books written after Israel’s return from exile (1 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah). <span class="hebrew">Nethinim</span> derives from the verb <span class="hebrew">nathan</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to give, set apart, dedicate,” and means “those given” or “those set apart or dedicated.” The Septuagint translates the word <span class="greek">dedomenoi</span><span class="ital">.</span> Some recent translators have followed Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 11.5.1) by referring to them as “temple slaves.” The <span class="sc">nlt</span> reads “Temple assistants.”</p>
<p>Before the exile, the Nethinim were active in temple service. <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.2">First Chronicles 9:2</a> lists them with the priests and Levites who took possession of their allotted cities. Their listed order—priests, Levites, and Nethinim—suggests their subordinate role to the Levites (see also <a href="?bref=Neh.7.73">Neh 7:73</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.3,20-21">11:3, 20-21</a>). They returned from exile as temple personnel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.43,58">Ezr 2:43, 58</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7,24">7:7, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.17,20">8:17, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.46,60">Neh 7:46, 60</a>). They had their dwelling in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7">Ezr 7:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.3.31">Neh 3:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.21">11:21</a>) and joined in the repair of the walls (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.26">Neh 3:26</a>).</p>
<p>The identification of the Nethinim is not absolutely certain. <a href="?bref=Num.31.47">Numbers 31:47</a> records that the Levites received captives who were assigned laborious and menial tasks. When the Gibeonites were accepted within Israel as servants, they too were appointed as water carriers and wood choppers for the entire community and the altar of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.9-27">Jos 9:9-27</a>). David augmented the number of tabernacle servants by assigning captives taken in war to these duties (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.20">Ezr 8:20</a>). At the completion of the temple, the temple services called for more workers, and Solomon added to their number. This new group became known as “Solomon’s men.” Ezra records that from the Nethinim, 392 returned from exile to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.58">2:58</a>) and performed the work in the rebuilt temple that had been done by their ancestors before the exile. Considered full members of the restored covenant community, the Nethinim devoted themselves to God (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.28">Neh 10:28</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Home and designation for two of David’s thirty mighty men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.28-29">2 Sm 23:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.30">1 Chr 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.13-15">27:13-15</a>). Seraiah, one of the captains who came to Gedaliah, the governor in Jerusalem after its fall to Babylon in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, was a Netophathite (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.23">2 Kgs 25:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.40.8">Jer 40:8</a>). Fifty-six men of Netophah are mentioned as among the exiles who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.22">Ezr 2:22</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=1Chr.9.16">First Chronicles 9:16</a> speaks of Levites who lived in the villages of Netophathites, while <a href="?bref=Neh.12.28">Nehemiah 12:28</a> says that temple singers were gathered from the villages surrounding Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites. Both of these references suggest that Netophah was the name of a district and not just of a town.</p>
<p>The linking of Netophah with Bethlehem (see <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.54">1 Chr 2:54</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.26">Neh 7:26</a>) indicates that it was in that vicinity. The actual site of Netophah is not known; however, the most probable location is the modern Khirbet Bedd Faluh, three miles (4.8 kilometers) southeast of Bethlehem.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">NEW</p>
<p class="fl">That which has just been made or come into existence—often replacing that which already existed, thereby turning the old into new.</p>
<p>That the second part of the Bible is called the <span class="ital">New</span> Testament indicates how fundamental the idea of “new” is to biblical revelation. Many key theological expressions incorporate the idea: new creation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>), new birth (<a href="?bref=John.3.3">Jn 3:3</a>), new man (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.15">Eph 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>), new commandment (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>), new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31">Jer 31:31</a>), new life (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.4">Rom 6:4</a>), and various others.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheExpectationoftheNew">The Expectation of the New</p>
<p class="fl">The totality of the expectation of the <span class="ital">new</span> is best expressed in Jeremiah and Ezekiel and in the reference in the Psalter to the “new song” to be given to the people to sing (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.33.3">Pss 33:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.3">40:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.1">149:1</a>; cf., also <a href="?bref=Isa.42.10">Is 42:10</a>). Jeremiah speaks of the day when God will make a new covenant with the house of Israel (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.25-31">Ez 34:25-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.26-28">37:26-28</a>). In contrast with the old, this new covenant will be written upon the heart—that is, it will be internalized. Similarly Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.22-32">Ez 36:22-32</a>) tells of the day when God, as an expression of his own holiness, will cleanse his people and will give a heart of flesh in place of the heart of stone. This will usher in the age of the Spirit and will bring about a new existence, characterized by security and freedom, in which the laws of God are carried out. The supreme feature of this new time is the new spirit within them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.19">Ez 11:19</a>). Joel speaks also of that day when the Spirit of God will be poured out on all flesh (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>). <a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">Isaiah 65:17</a> states the promise of “new heavens and a new earth,” words that often reflect national circumstances and hopes (for example, after the exile). However, they came to take on new eschatological significance beyond the hope of the nation Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheComingoftheNew">The Coming of the New</p>
<p class="fl">The central proclamation of the presence of the kingdom in the world through Jesus is a declaration that the promised new age has broken into time in powerful ways. Jesus’ ministry is one of fulfillment; what has been promised by prophets has begun to take place. John the Baptist had prepared the way for the one who would bestow the promised Spirit. The giving of this Spirit is the giving of new life. Through faith in Christ, one is born anew (<a href="?bref=John.3.3-7">Jn 3:3-7</a>). But Jesus had to die in order for this new life to be given. At the Last Supper the cup of wine Jesus shared with his disciples symbolized the blood of the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mk 14:24</a>).</p>
<p>The early church expressed this significance in varying metaphors. This “newness of life” is expressed sacramentally through baptism (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.4">Rom 6:4</a>). The eucharistic cup is the new covenant through blood (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>). An extended discourse on the old and new covenants shows that by the shedding of his blood Christ has become mediator of a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.15">Heb 9:15</a>); by his blood he has opened up a new and living way into the Holy Place (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.19-20">10:19-20</a>). Paul restates the promise of Ezekiel for a heart of flesh (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.3">2 Cor 3:3</a>), after which he gives an account of the ministry of the new covenant in contrast to the old. The church represents the appearance of the new age in the domain of the old.</p>
<p>The one who comes to Christ by faith is declared a new person, a new creation, for whom the old has passed away (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">Gal 6:15</a>). Jewish-Gentile hostility disappears in the resulting “new humanity” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.15">Eph 2:15</a>). All other social distinctions (such as male-female, slave-free) pass away in the new humanity created afresh in Christ Jesus (<a href="?bref=Col.3.10-11">Col 3:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>The newness of a person in Christ is the foundation for NT ethics (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">Eph 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>). The new commandment (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.8">1 Jn 2:8</a>) is not really new (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.7">1 Jn 2:7</a>), but now has new possibility and dimension by virtue of the power and pattern of Jesus. Though this new life is a gift of God, the <span class="ital">process</span> of being made new continues. Transformation by the renewing of the mind (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>) brings realization of the will of God. Paul declares the inner man being renewed day by day (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16">2 Cor 4:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRealizationoftheNew">The Realization of the New</p>
<p class="fl">As real as the new life of the believer may be, Scripture recognizes a tension between the new age that has come in history but is not yet fully realized. There is a projection to that time when all things are made new (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.5">Rv 21:5</a>). With the end of the old, there is a new heaven and new earth. The new Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">2</a>) “descends” as the dwelling place of God. The people of God receive a new name (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">3:12</a>) as the former things pass away. To the redeemed of the Lord, a new song is given, the song of the Lamb slain from the very foundation of creation: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!” The antiphonal song returns, “To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might for ever and ever!” (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.12-13">5:12-13</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p>The most fundamental truth of the Bible is that God is the Creator of heaven and earth, who sustains and controls everything (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Gn 1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6-11">Pss 33:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.1-35">104</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.25-32">Mt 6:25-32</a>). The most basic consideration about men and women is that they are creatures made in God’s image (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-2.25">Gn 1–2</a>). Accordingly, the Bible’s message of salvation is unintelligible apart from what it teaches about God as Creator. The true nature and perversity of humanity’s sin stem from the fact that they “worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.25">Rom 1:25</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). God is Redeemer because he is Creator. By the same token, the objects of God’s saving activity are his rebellious creatures who, along with the entire created order, are cursed with futility and decay (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.17-18">Gn 3:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.20-21">Rom 8:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The tie between creation and salvation is especially prominent in the latter part of Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">Is 40–66</a>). The prophet surveys the grandeur of the final redemption God will accomplish for Israel. Repeatedly the perspective on this promised eschatological deliverance is that God is the Creator of heaven and earth and of Israel in particular (see also the full statement of <a href="?bref=Isa.40.12-31">40:12-31</a>; e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.44.24">44:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.18">45:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.13">48:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.16">51:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.64.8">64:8</a>).</p>
<p>In this context, expectation centers on “the new heavens and the new earth” (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">65:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.22">66:22</a>). This reference to the new creation gives the broadest conceivable scope to the eschatological salvation prophesied by Isaiah. God’s work of renewal and restoration at the end parallels his work of creation in the beginning (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.12">48:12</a>). What God will do in bringing all things to their consummation is of the same order of magnitude as what he did in calling them into existence out of nothing. At the same time, the new creation concept reveals that the end-time salvation promised to Israel has universal and cosmic proportions. The underlying hope is the ultimate entrance of the faithful from among the nations, as well as in Israel, into the bliss of the eternal, new creation order. These themes from Isaiah are taken up and developed by the NT writers, and are integral to their message.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewCreationandChrist">The New Creation and Christ</p>
<p class="fl">The NT ties together creation and redemption. Several writers either parallel or in other ways relate the saving work of Christ to his activity at creation (<a href="?bref=John.1.3">Jn 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-18">Col 1:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.2-3">Heb 1:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.14">Rv 3:14</a>). What he has done at the end, in “the fullness of time” (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.4">Gal 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.10">Eph 1:10</a>), “in these last days” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">Heb 1:2</a>), roots in what he did in the beginning. The redemption accomplished by Christ is a work of new creation.</p>
<p>This association of the new creation with Christ’s work is unmistakable when Paul designates Christ as the “last Adam” and “second man” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45-47">1 Cor 15:45-47</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.22">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.14">Rom 5:14</a>). This description has close affinities with “Son of Man,” a self-designation of Jesus. Paul’s use of the last Adam designation is obviously intended to heighten the contrast between Adam and Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-32">Rom 1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">1 Cor 15</a>). In antithesis to Adam, who through his disobedience brought into the world sin and the consequent condemnation of death, Christ by his obedience has established righteousness, resulting in justification and life.</p>
<p>Paul discloses something of the full range and implications of the Adam-Christ contrast in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.42-49">1 Corinthians 15:42-49</a>. He contrasts the believer’s present bodily existence, in its weakness and mortality, with the body to be received at the resurrection. He sums up this contrast: the one body is “natural,” the other is “spiritual.” Adam and Christ exemplify these two bodies, the natural and the spiritual. At the same time, however, Adam and Christ are brought into view as whole persons. They are the representatives of others and heads over contrasting orders of life. Adam, the first man, is representative head of the natural earthly order of existence, made subject to corruption and death by his sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-19">Rom 5:12-19</a>). Christ, the second and last Adam, is the representative head over the spiritual, heavenly order, characterized by life, power, and glory. Ultimately, the contrast in this passage is between two successive world orders, creation and its consummation (new creation), each beginning with an Adam.</p>
<p>Two other points also bear on the new creation gospel of Paul and the other NT writers. First, the believer’s resurrection is fully dependent on the resurrection of Christ, who, as the last Adam, became life-giving Spirit in resurrection (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">45</a>). The controlling emphasis is on the unity between the resurrection of Christ and that of believers (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-20">1 Cor 15:12-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>). In the NT proclamation, the resurrection of Christ is the great redemptive counterpart to creation (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.17">Rom 4:17</a>). According to the NT, the new creation is a present reality, dating from the resurrection of Christ. Second, in stating that the last Adam became life-giving Spirit, <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Corinthians 15:45</a> points to the unity that exists between the exalted Christ and the Holy Spirit in their life-giving activity. The Holy Spirit is the power of the new creation (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.6.5">Heb 6:5</a>). Where the Spirit is at work as the gift of the glorified Christ, the new creation is present.</p>
<p>The new creation is the eschatological fulfillment promised and anticipated in the OT. As such it has already been inaugurated and realized by the work of Christ (the last Adam), particularly by his death and resurrection, and will be consummated at his return. The interval in between receives its fundamental character from the coexistence of the two creations; the new has begun, while concurrently the old continues to pass away (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.31">1 Cor 7:31</a>). The concept of new creation closely parallels that of the kingdom of God. According to the synoptic Gospels, it is the central theme of Jesus’ proclamation. Tied to his own person and work in its coming, the kingdom is announced by him as both present (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.28">Mt 12:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.11,16-17">13:11, 16-17</a>) and future (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.11">Mt 8:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.34">25:34</a>). In terms of the two-age distinction, coined by contemporary Judaism to express its eschatological expectations and taken over by Jesus and the early church (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.12.32">Mt 12:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.21">Eph 1:21</a>), the new creation is the longed-for “age to come.” “New creation” serves to indicate the comprehensive nature of this eschatological reality; redemption involves nothing less than the renewal of all things (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.5">Rv 21:5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewCreationandtheChurch">The New Creation and the Church</p>
<p class="fl">Salvation, according to the NT, is from beginning to end a matter of union with Christ and sharing in all the benefits resulting from his once-for-all redemptive work. Accordingly, because Christ died and was raised, anyone in Christ is already a participant in the new ceation order (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.15">2 Cor 5:15</a>). The reference is not only personal but cosmic, as seen from the context with its correlative emphasis on the reconciliation and its scope (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17-19">17-19</a>).</p>
<p>In the only other NT occurrence of the expression “new creation” (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">Gal 6:15</a>), the perspective is cosmic as well as individual. The new creation, in which neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters, stands in opposition to the world, to which the believer has been crucified with Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.14">Gal 6:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Col.2.20">Col 2:20</a>). “When anyone is united to Christ, there is a new world; the old order is gone, and a new order has already begun” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>).</p>
<p>Resurrection is not only a future hope for believers but a present reality; they have already been raised with Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.5-6">Eph 2:5-6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Col.2.12-13">Col 2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1">3:1</a>). Consequently, believers are “created in Christ Jesus for good works” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.10">Eph 2:10</a>). Further, the church is the new covenant reality of “the new man,” made up of Israel and the nations (v <a href="?bref=Eph.2.15">15</a>). As such, its members are already being renewed inwardly (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16">2 Cor 4:16</a>) by the Lord-Spirit according to the glorified image of the last Adam (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4-6">4:4-6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">Eph 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>). And they will bear this same image bodily at his return (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.49">1 Cor 15:49</a>). The deepest motive for holy living is not gratitude for the forgiveness of sin but the determination of the believer’s existence as a new creature. The ethics of the NT are new creation ethics (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.20">Col 2:20</a>).</p>
<p>The new creation is not only a present reality but a future hope. For the new creation, too, the church lives “by faith, not by sight” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.7">2 Cor 5:7</a>). Reminiscent of Isaiah’s expectation, believers are looking to Christ’s return for “new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells” and where sin and its effects are nothing more than memories (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-4">Rv 21:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>This hope raises the question of the relationship between this final, eternal order and the original creation. The picture of destruction by burning (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10-12">2 Pt 3:10-12</a>) and some of the images in <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">Revelation 21</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-21">22</a> (e.g., no sun, moon, night; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.6.12-14">6:12-14</a>) seem to suggest an absolute disjunction. Other passages, however, interpret this as imagery. With all the radical differences before and after the resurrection, the natural and spiritual bodies (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">1 Cor 15:44</a>) are not distinct from each other as bodies. This body, sown in corruption, dishonor, and weakness, will be raised up incorruptible, glorious, and powerful. And what holds true for the believer’s body also holds for creation. The anxious longing and groaning of the entire (nonpersonal) creation is not for annihilation but that it may be set free from bondage to futility and decay and may share in the glorious freedom of the children of God, which will be revealed in the redemption (resurrection) of the body (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-23">Rom 8:19-23</a>). The new creation is not merely a return to conditions in the beginning but a renewed creation, the consummation of God’s purposes set from before the beginning and realized, despite man’s sin and its destructive effects, by the redemption in Christ, the last Adam. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=AdamPerson_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Adam (Person)</a>; <a href="?item=Creation_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Creation</a>; <a href="?item=EternalLife_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Eternal Life</a>; <a href="?item=ManOldandNew_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Man, Old and New</a>; <a href="?item=New_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">New</a>; <a href="?item=NewHeavensandNewEarth_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">New Heavens and New Earth</a>.</p>

  <title>New Heavens and New Earth</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NEW HEAVENS AND NEW EARTH</p>
<p class="fl">Concept of a new or renewed universe first found in the book of Isaiah. God declares, “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind. . . . For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me . . . so shall your descendants and your name remain” (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">Is 65:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.22">66:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Some scholars think that long before Isaiah’s time there existed among many ancient peoples the belief that the end of human history would correspond to its beginning and therefore some sort of universal restoration would take place. The world renewal taught in Scripture regards the event as supernatural and as taking place in a different and higher sphere.</p>
<p>That God is Creator of the heavens and earth is basic to all biblical theology. “In ages past you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands” (<a href="?bref=Ps.102.25">Ps 102:25</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). If God created the heavens and earth, then it is entirely appropriate that, once they have served their purpose, God may do with them what he wishes. “Even they will perish, but you remain forever; they will wear out like old clothing. You will change them like a garment, and they will fade away” (v <a href="?bref=Ps.102.26">26</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The same metaphor is found in <a href="?bref=Isa.51.6">Isaiah 51:6</a>, which speaks of the earth wearing out like a garment.</p>
<p>Scripture (quoted below from the <span class="sc">nlt</span>) gives considerable attention to the passing away of the old order, speaking of a future time when heaven and earth will disappear (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.4">Is 34:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.6">51:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.35">Mt 24:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rv 21:1</a>). A number of related phrases portray the same idea: “And this world is fading away” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.17">1 Jn 2:17</a>); “They [the heavens and earth] will wear out like old clothing” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.11">Heb 1:11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.102.26">Ps 102:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.6">Is 51:6</a>); “But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and everything in them will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be exposed to judgment” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10">2 Pt 3:10</a>). This consummation by fire will take place at the time of final judgment. It will be “the day when God will set the heavens on fire and the elements will melt away in the flames” (v <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>This judgment, which brings to a close the old order, clears the way for new heavens and a new earth. Peter continues, “But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world where everyone is right with God” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>). It will be so wonderful that no one will even remember the old (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">Is 65:17</a>). Peter, preaching in Solomon’s Colonnade, says that Jesus will remain in heaven until the time comes for establishing all that God spoke by his holy prophets (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.21">Acts 3:21</a>). This recovery or renewal is eagerly awaited by the created order. Paul writes, “For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children really are” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.19">Rom 8:19</a>) because “all creation anticipates the day when it will join God’s children in glorious freedom from death and decay” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.8.21">21</a>).</p>
<p>The heaven that will be renewed is not the heaven of God’s presence, but the heaven of human existence, the starry expanse that constitutes the universe. In the book of Revelation we learn that the new Jerusalem comes down from heaven to earth (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.2,10">Rv 21:2, 10</a>) and forms the eternal dwelling place of God and his people. The new earth will be a place of perfect righteousness (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.6">Is 51:6</a>), divine kindness (<a href="?bref=Isa.54.10">54:10</a>), eternal relationship to God (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.22">66:22</a>), and total freedom from sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.21">Rom 8:21</a>).</p>

According to <a href="?bref=John.3.1-36">John 3</a>, Nicodemus came to Jesus at night and acknowledged him as a teacher sent by God. He was convinced that Jesus could not perform such things if God were not with him. Following an exchange concerning the need to be born again, Jesus asked how Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish religious court, could fail to understand such things. At that time he evidently made no profession of faith, but later he did defend Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href="?bref=John.7.50-52">7:50-52</a>). After Jesus’ death, Nicodemus openly assisted Joseph of Arimathea with the burial of his body (<a href="?bref=John.19.39-42">19:39-42</a>).</p>
<p>Some scholars suggest that Nicodemus was one of the Jewish leaders who believed in Jesus but did not confess him openly for fear of excommunication (<a href="?bref=John.12.42">12:42</a>). Tradition subsequently held that he belonged to the household of faith, as one persuaded to believe through the message and deeds of Jesus, but remained intimidated by the religious establishment.</p>

<p class="h1">NICOLAITANS</p>
<p class="fl">Heretical sect in the early church that is mentioned by name twice in the book of Revelation. The church at Ephesus was commended for hating the works of the Nicolaitans (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.6">Rv 2:6</a>), and the church at Pergamum was criticized for having some members who held their doctrine (v <a href="?bref=Rev.2.15">15</a>).</p>
<p>Since the specific sins condemned at Pergamum—the eating of food sacrificed to idols and the practice of immorality—were also present at Thyatira (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.20">Rv 2:20</a>), it is commonly thought that the woman Jezebel was a leader of the Nicolaitans in that church. In the letter to Pergamum, their sins are equated with the teaching of Balaam (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.14">Rv 2:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-2">Nm 25:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.16">31:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.15">2 Pt 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>), who advised Balak, the king of the Moabites, to bring about Israel’s downfall by inviting them to worship the Moabite gods and engage in intermarriage and the sexual immoralities connected with Moabite religious practices. Thus, the Jews would have been separated from God and his protection. In Jewish thought, Balaam was the symbol of all that led men to obscene conduct and the forsaking of God. The ungodly practices at Thyatira are called the “deep things of Satan” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.24">Rv 2:24</a>).</p>
<p>The early church was also threatened by the combination of idolatry and immorality so prevalent in the world. The necessity for frequent warning in the NT reveals the gravity of the problem. The Jerusalem Council (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.20">Acts 15:20</a>) called upon the Gentiles to abstain from eating food that had been offered to idols and sexual immorality. Paul called for a voluntary avoidance of this kind of fare for the sake of those who were weak or immature in the faith (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">1 Cor 8</a>). He strongly condemned actual participation in idol feasts (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.14-22">1 Cor 10:14-22</a>) as well as fornication in general and temple prostitution in particular (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-20">6:12-20</a>).</p>
<p>Who the Nicolaitans were is more difficult to determine. The tendency among the church fathers was to identify them as followers of Nicolaus of Antioch, a Gentile convert to the Jewish faith, who had become a Christian and was chosen to be one of the original seven deacons (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">Acts 6:5</a>). Both Irenaeus and Hippolytus believed that he had fallen from the faith. Clement claimed that the heretical and immoral Nicolaitans were not actual followers of Nicolaus but falsely claimed him as their teacher. In any event, there is no direct evidence available.</p>
<p>Since the 19th century it has been common to view the name as a translation into Greek of the Hebrew name Balaam. This is in accord with the allegorical, symbolical nature of Revelation and the apparent linking of the two names in the letter to Pergamum (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.14-15">Rv 2:14-15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">NICOLAS, NICOLAUS*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the seven men named in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">Acts 6:5</a>, who was enlisted for service in the Jerusalem church in its early days. His duty as specified in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-4">Acts 6:1-4</a> was to direct the fair and equal distribution of food. Due to the use of terms in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">Acts 6:1</a> (“daily distribution” or “service”) and <a href="?bref=Acts.6.2">6:2</a> (“to distribute at tables” or “to serve”), these seven men traditionally have been called “deacons” (or “servers”).</p>
<p>Nicolas, the last-named in the list, is identified as a proselyte. Thus, he was a Gentile convert to Judaism before he became a Christian. His name is Greek, and the city of Antioch is mentioned as his home. The NT writings provide no further information about him.</p>

  <title>Nicopolis</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NICOPOLIS</p>
<p class="fl">Name meaning “Victory City,” a popular choice in the Roman Empire when a newly founded city required a name, especially when a newly built town was created to commemorate some military victory in days of warfare.</p>
<p>In his letter to Titus, Paul directs him to leave Crete, where he had been ministering (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>), and make his way to Nicopolis, where the apostle was working and intended to spend the winter (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">3:12</a>). Of the nine Nicopolises throughout the empire, Paul almost certainly meant the city situated northwest of the Gulf of Corinth and southeast of the promontory of Epirus.</p>
<p>Octavian founded this city in 31 <span class="era">BC</span> to celebrate his victory over Mark Antony in the great battle of Actium fought nearby. Nicopolis was Greek both in name and constitution. The center of a number of nearby towns, the new Nicopolis was a metropolis, enjoying an independence similar to that of neighboring Athens. Temples, theaters, a stadium, and an aqueduct were built, and games were instituted for the four yearly festivals. Nicopolis’s most famous citizen, Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher, lived there around <span class="era">AD</span> 90. Paul made this splendid metropolis and its satellite communities a field for evangelism.</p>

  <title>Night</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NIGHT</p>
<p class="fl">Word in Scripture denoting that time of darkness from dusk until dawn when no light of the sun is visible. For example, Joseph took Mary and Jesus to Egypt by night (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.14">Mt 2:14</a>). The shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks at night (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.8">Lk 2:8</a>). Nicodemus came to see Jesus at night (<a href="?bref=John.3.2">Jn 3:2</a>). An angel from the Lord came and opened the prison doors at night in order to let the disciples out (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.19">Acts 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a>, the day-night cycle was instituted by God and “night” was the name given to the period of darkness (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.5">Gn 1:5</a>). Later, God put the lights in the expanse of the heavens, appointing the sun to rule or dominate the day, and the moon, the lesser light, to dominate the night (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.1.16-18">16-18</a>). The covenant of the Lord is the basis of the regularity of the rotation of day and night.</p>
<p>The night in OT times was apparently divided into three periods or “watches.” The latter name originated with the changing of the guard at these times. Gideon’s 300 men blew their trumpets and broke their pitchers at the beginning of the middle watch (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.19">Jgs 7:19</a>). Although no references in the OT give the limits of these three periods, night was considered to begin at sunset, and consequently the periods may have been 6:00 to 10:00 <span class="sc">pm</span>, 10:00 <span class="sc">pm</span> to 2:00 <span class="sc">am</span>, and 2:00 to 6:00 <span class="sc">am</span>.</p>
<p>Later, according to the Roman calculation of time, night was divided into four watches. Some historians think they began at 9:30 <span class="sc">pm</span>, at midnight, at 2:30 <span class="sc">am</span>, and at 5:00 <span class="sc">am</span>. Others think that the nighttime period between 6:00 <span class="sc">pm</span> and 6:00 <span class="sc">am</span> was divided equally into four periods, the first beginning at 6:00 <span class="sc">pm</span>, the second at 9:00 <span class="sc">pm</span>, the third at midnight, and the fourth at 3:00 <span class="sc">am</span>. <a href="?bref=Mark.13.35">Mark 13:35</a> contains the popular designations for these four watches, namely late in the day (early evening), midnight, the cock-crowing, and early in the morning.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="?bref=Matt.14.25">Matthew 14:25</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.6.48">Mark 6:48</a> follow the Roman calculation when they locate Jesus’ walking on the water at about the fourth watch of the night.</p>
<p>A specialized use of the word “night” along with the word “day” emphasizes the continuance of activity. For example, the man with an unclean spirit is said to have been in the mountains and in the tombs “night and day” (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.5">Mk 5:5</a>). Paul refers to his having labored, working night and day, so as not to be a burden to the church (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">1 Thes 2:9</a>). Later in the same book he refers to his continuous praying night and day (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.10">3:10</a>).</p>
<p>Along with this literal usage of the word “night,” there is also a figurative or metaphorical usage. In some references it refers to divine judgment (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.8-9">Am 5:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.6">Mi 3:6</a>). Jesus uses “night” to refer to death (<a href="?bref=John.9.4">Jn 9:4</a>). Once the night (death) comes, time for working is over.</p>
<p>Paul compares this present age (soon to be over with) to the night that is almost gone (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.12">Rom 13:12</a>). Again, Paul speaks of himself and his readers as children of the light and of the day, not the night and darkness (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.5">1 Thes 5:5</a>). In this context he links night with separation from God, sin, intemperance, careless living, as well as spiritual blindness and ignorance, especially regarding the Lord’s return.</p>

  <title>Nile River</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">NILE RIVER</p>
<p class="fl">Life-giving river of Egypt in northeast Africa. Perhaps no other river has been so vital to the history of the nation through which it flows. With an attributed length of some 4,160 miles (6,693.4 kilometers), the Nile is the longest river in the world, although its drainage system is ranked third (other sources say sixth) in area (nearly 1.3 million square miles, or 3.4 million square kilometers).</p>
<p>The origin and meaning of the name “Nile” are unknown. To the ancient Egyptians the Nile was simply “the river.” The Egyptians found it hard to conceive of any river different from the Nile, so when they reached the Euphrates, they assumed it was running backward, since it flowed south, whereas the Nile flows north.</p>
<p class="h2" id="UnusualFeatures">Unusual Features</p>
<p class="fl">Among the characteristics that distinguish the Nile are its six cataracts, areas where the river has failed to erode a clear channel through hard rock formations. These are numbered from north to south, in order of their discovery by modern explorers. The first cataract is at Aswan in Egypt, near the famous islands of Elephantine and Philae. The other five cataracts lie in the Sudan, with the second just above the city of Wadi Halfa.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature of the Nile is that it flows from south to north. This was of importance to Egyptian river transport, for sailing vessels could take advantage of the prevailing north wind for going upstream, while the current propelled travelers downstream.</p>
<p>The Nile River determined the three seasons of about four months each: (1) inundation (mid-July to mid-November); (2) winter (mid-November to mid-March); (3) summer (mid-March to mid-July).</p>
<p>The inundation culminated in late October, softening the soil of the agricultural land for planting.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CourseandTributaries">Course and Tributaries</p>
<p class="fl">The Nile has two main streams named for their respective colors, the White Nile and the Blue Nile. These streams owe their existence to the annual rains in equatorial Africa.</p>
<p>The White Nile has its origin in the lake country. Lake Victoria is usually said to be its source, but some geographers pinpoint the source as a little stream that flows into the lake. The only outlet at Lake Victoria is the Victoria Nile, northeast of the lake at Ripon Falls.</p>
<p>The most important junction of the river is at Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile are united. At this point one can often clearly see the color difference in the waters of the two rivers.</p>
<p>The Blue Nile, only about 850 miles (1,367.7 kilometers) long, originates at Lake Tana in the highlands of Ethiopia. A much more precipitous stream than the White Nile, it is also dependent upon the rainy season in the high country. The White Nile begins its flooding first, but when the onrush of the Blue Nile sets in, it holds in check the water of the White Nile. During flood season, the Blue Nile has twice the volume of the White Nile and provides the greater part of the alluvium that built up the soil of Egypt.</p>
<p>To the north of Khartoum is the sixth cataract, the first of the natural barriers. The Atbara, the last tributary of the Nile, enters from the east. At the fourth cataract, near Napata, is a group of cemeteries and ruins associated with the Ethiopian or Kushite (25th) dynasty of Egypt. Farther downstream is the important archaeological site of Kerma, where the Egyptians maintained a trading post during the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<p>Downstream from the second cataract is the celebrated temple of Abu Simbel, the work of Ramses II, with the smaller temple honoring Nefertari, his wife. These temples were moved to the cliff above their original position before Lake Nasser engulfed the site.</p>
<p>Just above Aswan and the first cataract is the new High Dam and the older Aswan Dam. Between the two dams is the island of Philae, with its well-known temples. A short distance above the Delta lies Cairo and the Giza pyramids, and farther south are the ruins of Memphis, the first capital of Egypt.</p>
<p>The Delta measures some 125 by 115 miles (201.1 by 185.0 kilometers). Seven ancient streams of the Nile found their way into the sea, but there are only two modern ones: the Rosetta on the west, which gave the name to the Rosetta Stone, and the Damietta to the East.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ImportancetoEgypt">Importance to Egypt</p>
<p class="fl">Without the water of the river, life would be impossible in northeast Africa, and the civilizations of Egypt could not have come into being. The Greek writers, first Hecataeus and later Herodotus, commented that Egypt is the gift of the Nile. The fertile soil of Egypt, which has produced such abundant crops over so long a span of time, is the alluvium laid down by the river over the course of centuries. Not only was the river the source of the soil itself, but with the annual inundation the Nile fertilized the land by bringing down new alluvium and by depositing organic materials. At the same time, the inundation thoroughly soaked the soil, so that it was possible to produce good crops with a minimum of effort expended on irrigation.</p>
<p>The Nile also satisfied many personal needs of the people, providing drinking water and a washing place for both the people and their clothing. In ancient times, even members of the royal family came to the river to bathe (see <a href="?bref=Exod.2.5">Ex 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.8.20">8:20</a>).</p>
<p>The Nile teemed with fish and waterfowl, and sport fishing (mostly spearfishing) and waterfowling were traditional diversions of the upper classes. Fish and fowl were also regular food, especially for the wealthy. A more hazardous sport, in which nobles traditionally engaged, was the hunting of hippopotami in reed watercraft with harpoons.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheNileRiver"/>
<p>The Nile was the primary means of communication, with boats plying up and down its channels. Riverboats of large size moved goods from one end to the other. The building of temples, palaces, and tombs throughout the land demanded the moving of granite for hundreds of miles along the river.</p>
<p>The river was also a feature of the religious life of the Egyptians. The river was deified in the form of the god Hapi, a man who is shown in the various forms of art as having pendulous breasts and a somewhat corpulent body, probably to represent luxuriant overabundance, along with the fish and vegetation from the river.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNileandtheBible">The Nile and the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">The biblical references to the Nile River are naturally found in those parts of the Bible that have to do directly with Egypt, which means that many occur in the Joseph narrative in the latter part of Genesis and in the account of the Israelite bondage in Egypt and subsequent exodus in the early chapters of Exodus.</p>
<p>The first reference to the Nile appears in the mysterious dream of Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.1-57">Gn 41</a>). In his dream the king stood on the riverbank and saw seven well-fed cows, followed by seven lean cows, which came out of the river and devoured the fat cattle (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.41.1-4,17-21">41:1-4, 17-21</a>). This agrees with grazing practices of ancient Egypt and coincides with the depiction of cattle on the funerary monuments.</p>
<p>During the sojourn in Egypt, when the Israelites multiplied and became a possible threat to Egyptian security, Pharaoh decreed that every Israelite male child should be thrown into the river upon birth (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.22">Ex 1:22</a>). This led to the events that marked the early life of Moses.</p>
<p>Moses declared the judgments of the Lord at the river (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.15">7:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.8.20">8:20</a>). The first plague, the turning of water to blood (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.15-24">7:15-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.17.5">17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.44">Ps 78:44</a>), was directed against the river and against the Nile god, Hapi. The second plague (frogs) was also associated with the river (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.3,5,9,11">8:3, 5, 9, 11</a>), for the swarms of frogs came up out of the river and enveloped the land (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.78.45">Ps 78:45</a>), discrediting the frog-headed goddess Heket.</p>
<p>There are numerous references to the Nile in the books of prophecy. Isaiah often mentions the Nile, but not always in the same context. In <a href="?bref=Isa.7.18">7:18</a> Isaiah writes that Israel would be invaded and humiliated by armies from the Nile. In the “oracle concerning Egypt” (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.1-25">Is 19</a>), the prophet foresees both evil and good for the land of the Nile. The natural vegetation and sown crops along the river will be destroyed, while the fishermen will lament. These dire prospects are offset by the prediction of final blessing for Egypt.</p>
<p>In the burden of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.1-18">Is 23</a>) the revenue of the Sidonian merchants was “the harvest of the Nile” (v <a href="?bref=Isa.23.3">3</a>), indicating the importance of agricultural produce in the Nile valley. In verse <a href="?bref=Isa.23.10">10</a>, Tyre casts off all restraint and is told to overflow the land like the Nile, for the Lord is bringing the pride of Tyre to an end. Jeremiah also predicted a severe defeat for Egypt and speaks of Egypt rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.7-8">Jer 46:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>The prophecy of Ezekiel concerning Egypt (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.1-21">Ez 29</a>) singles out Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and describes him in figures of speech drawn from the Nile. He is described as the great dragon that lies in the midst of his streams—a reference to the mighty crocodile. Pharaoh boasts, “My Nile is my own,” but the Lord said that he would put hooks into the king’s jaws and draw him out of the water of his streams with all of the fish sticking to his scales. The king and the fish of the streams will perish in the wilderness. Because of the proud boasts of the king, the Lord declares that he is against him and his streams and that Egypt will become a desolation and a waste.</p>
<p>Amos described the northern kingdom of Israel as being tossed about, and sinking again, like the Nile of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Amos.8.8">Am 8:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.5">9:5</a>). Finally, Zechariah spoke of an ingathering of Israel by the Lord and comments that in this process the Nile would be dried up (<a href="?bref=Zech.10.11">Zec 10:11</a>).</p>
<p>Although the prophetic references to the Nile primarily deal with severe judgments, the prophets looked forward to a time beyond judgment to eventual blessing for this land of the Nile.</p>

<p class="fl">Cush’s son and grandson of Ham the son of Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.8">Gn 10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.10">1 Chr 1:10</a>). He is described as “the first man of might on earth” and “a mighty hunter” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.8-9">Gn 10:8-9</a>). Nimrod was the first to establish a great empire and was a well-known hunter. Tradition makes him ruler over Babylon and Akkad in southern Mesopotamia, and over Nineveh in Assyria. The phrase “land of Nimrod” seems to be synonymous with Assyria (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.6">Mi 5:6</a>).</p>
<p>The OT references to Nimrod indicate that in ancient tradition he was a man of indomitable personality, possessing extraordinary talents and powers. Some scholars identify him with a Mesopotamian king who united Assyria and Babylon in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. This conflicts with the statement connecting him with Cush the son of Ham and pointing to an association with the south of Egypt where Cush was located (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.8">Gn 10:8</a>).</p>
<p>The name and fame of Nimrod have a secure place in Talmudic Judaism and in Islamic tradition. In the former he personifies both rebellion against God and military might in the earth. In rabbinic tradition, the Tower of Babel (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">Gn 11:1-9</a>) is “the house of Nimrod” where idolatry was practiced and divine homage offered to Nimrod. In Islam, Nimrod persecutes Abraham and has him thrown into a fiery furnace.</p>

<p>The larger mound, Kouyunjik, to the northwest (approximately a mile by 650 yards [1.6 kilometers by 594.4 meters] in area and some 90 feet [27.4 meters] in height above the plain), is separated from Nebi Yunus by the Khosr River.

Materials from the various early cultures (Hassuna, Samarra, Halaf, Ubaid) have been found at Nineveh.</p>
<p>Sargon of Akkad (mid-24th century <span class="era">BC</span>) was acquainted with Nineveh, which flourished during his time. A record from the reign of a later king, Shamsi-Adad I (c. 1800 <span class="era">BC</span>), relates that a son of Sargon, Manishtusu, restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh.</p>
<p>Ishtar (Inanna), the goddess of love and war, was a fitting deity for the rapacious and warlike Assyrians. Many other deities were worshiped at Nineveh, and gates of the city were named after them. The Assyrians worshiped at the temple of Nabu, the god of writing and of arts and sciences, who reflects the Assyrian interest in records, literature, and sculpture in relief and in the round.</p>
<p>Shamsi-Adad I and Hammurabi also restored the temple of Ishtar at Nineveh, Shalmaneser I and Tukulti-Ninurta I enlarged and strengthened the city, and other rulers built their palaces here—Tiglath-pileser I, Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Sargon II (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>). But Sennacherib (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) made Nineveh the capital and went to great lengths to beautify the city. In addition to his famous palace, he undertook many projects, rebuilding the city walls, creating parks, making botanical and zoological collections, and constructing aqueducts to bring water for the city from 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) away. To Nineveh came the tribute that the conquering Assyrians exacted from the nations, including Israel and Judah, which fell victim to their awesome armies.</p>

<p>After the assassination of Sennacherib, his son and successor, Esar-haddon (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>), captured Nineveh from the hands of rebels. He built a palace at Nineveh and had another at Calah, where he spent most of his time.</p>
<p>Esar-haddon’s son Ashurbanipal (669–633 <span class="era">BC</span>) made his residence at Nineveh, where he had been educated and trained in sports and military skills. He was something of an antiquarian and mastered the reading of Akkadian and Sumerian. In his palace was housed the famous library for the study of Assyriology. The temple of Nabu contained a library dating at least to the time of Sargon II, but the royal library of Ashurbanipal far surpassed it in size and importance. Sargon and his successors had collected many tablets, but Ashurbanipal sent scribes all over Assyria and Babylonia to gather and to copy tablets, so that tens of thousands of tablets accumulated. Like the library of Nippur, the Nineveh collection covers a great range of materials: business accounts, letters, royal records, historical documents, lexicographical lists and bilingual texts, legends, myths, and various other kinds of religious inscriptions, such as hymns, prayers, and lists of deities and temples. Among the tablets were 7 that preserved a Babylonian creation story and 12 that bore the epic of Gilgamesh, with a version of the Flood. Other writings that sometimes are cited as parallels to Bible accounts include the story of Adapa, with the lost opportunity to achieve immortality, and the legend of Etana, a shepherd who ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>Ashurbanipal was also well known for his wars and for his cruelty. The palace relief showing a peaceful banquet scene also displays the severed head of an Elamite leader hanging in a tree.</p>
<p>In the later years of the aging king, and after his demise, the vassal kingdoms rebelled. Babylon became independent and joined with the Medes to take Ashur and Calah in 614 <span class="era">BC</span>. Cyaxares the Mede, Nabopolassar of Babylon, and a Scythian force laid siege to Nineveh in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>; the city fell and King Sinshariskum (Sardanapalus) perished in its flames.</p>
<p>Although a Ninevite remnant under Ashuruballit held out at Harran until 609 <span class="era">BC</span>, Nineveh had been destroyed: the divine predictions of the Hebrew prophets had their complete fulfillment.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NinevehandtheBible">Nineveh and the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">Six books of the OT refer to the city of Nineveh. In Genesis the only mention of Nineveh appears in the table of nations (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Gn 10</a>), which states that Nimrod went out from the land of Shinar to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.11-12">11-12</a>; the <span class="sc">kjv</span> attributes this building to Asshur).</p>
<p>The tribute paid by Menahem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19-20">2 Kgs 15:19-20</a>) and the spoil taken at the fall of Samaria (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.4">Is 8:4</a>) were brought to Nineveh. To this city also came the tribute that Sennacherib received from Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.1-16.20">2 Kgs 14–16</a>).</p>
<p>Among the scenes commemorated in the reliefs found in Sennacherib’s palace at Nineveh is the depiction of the siege and capture of Lachish (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.8">2 Kgs 19:8</a>). Sennacherib is shown on a throne, with suppliant captives before him. The siege itself is shown in progress, with archers and battering rams on the attack, while defenders on the walls use bows and arrows and firebrands to repulse the onslaught. From one gate people are emerging with bundles on their backs as if in surrender or flight. At the lower right three naked men have been impaled on poles.</p>
<p>On the prism at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and on the Taylor Prism at the British Museum there is Sennacherib’s account of this invasion of Judah. Since the Assyrians did not take Jerusalem, Sennacherib had to be content with boasting: “As to Hezekiah the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke. I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities, walled forts and to the countless small villages in their vicinity, and conquered them. . . . Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage.”</p>
<p>The Assyrian kings associated with Nineveh played an important part in the history of Israel, but the name Nineveh occurs only once in the historical books of the Bible. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.36">Second Kings 19:36</a> states that after the loss of 185,000 soldiers at the hand of the angel of the Lord, Sennacherib went home and stayed in Nineveh. There, in 681 <span class="era">BC</span>, he was murdered by his sons (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.37">2 Kgs 19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.21">2 Chr 32:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.38">Is 37:38</a>).</p>
<p>There are many references to Nineveh in the book of Jonah, for the prophet was expressly sent to that city to warn it of impending judgment. Nineveh is called “that great city” (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.2">Jon 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.2">3:2</a>) and it is described as “a city so large, that it took three days to see it” (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.3">3:3</a>). Nineveh must have included more than the area represented by the mounds of Kouyunjik and Nebi Yunus. Some commentators believe that Nineveh encompassed other cities associated with it, including the “Assyrian triangle,” the angle of land between the Tigris and the Great Zab rivers, reaching from Khorsabad in the north to Nimrud in the south.</p>
<p>The Lord speaks of “that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who do not know their right hand from their left” (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.11">Jon 4:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Some writers interpret this statement as indicating the number of innocent children in the city and therefore arrive at a total population of some 600,000 for greater Nineveh. However, it is more reasonable to conclude that the entire population is meant and that the descriptive clause relates to the utter spiritual darkness of the Ninevites—as is translated in the <span class="sc">nlt</span>.</p>
<p>Jonah preached a message of judgment and destruction, but the repentance of the city brought about its deliverance (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.6-10">3:6-10</a>). Nahum declared the final downfall of the city in language that is vivid and stirring. Zephaniah also foretold the doom of Nineveh and prophesied that it would be a desolation, a place for flocks to lie down, as even the casual visitor to the site would note (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.13-15">Zep 2:13-15</a>).</p>
<p>Nineveh was destroyed by a coalition of Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. The devastation of the city was overwhelming and complete; within several centuries the very location of the city was forgotten. Xenophon and the Greek armies retreated past the site in 401 <span class="era">BC</span> without realizing it. In the second century <span class="era">AD</span> the Greek satirist Lucian commented: “Nineveh is so completely destroyed that it is no longer possible to say where it stood. Not a single trace of it remains.”</p>
<p>The only NT references to Nineveh in the Gospels also have to do with judgment. Jesus asserted, in response to a demand from the scribes and Pharisees, that an evil generation looks for a sign; as Jonah had been a sign to the Ninevites, so Jesus would be a sign to his generation (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.38-40">Mt 12:38-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.29-31">Lk 11:29-31</a>). He went on to declare that the people of Nineveh would rise at the judgment with his generation and condemn it, for the Ninevites repented at the preaching of Jonah. Now one greater than Jonah had come (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.41">Mt 12:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.32">Lk 11:32</a>).</p>

Following God’s precise instructions, Noah constructed an ark into which went only eight people—Noah and his wife and his three sons and their wives—and all kinds of creatures in pairs. They were thus protected from the ensuing deluge in which all other living things perished (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.14-8.19">6:14–8:19</a>). When they emerged from the ark, Noah built an altar and sacrificed burnt offerings that pleased God, who promised that the Flood would never be repeated or the sequence of the seasons disrupted, despite man’s sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20-9.17">8:20–9:17</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">City located on the eastern slopes of Mt Scopus opposite the Mt of Olives and northeast of Jerusalem. An important religious center, 86 priests resided there, as did the ephod (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.13-20">1 Sm 22:13-20</a>). Nob was the central sanctuary in which the priests served who had fled from Shiloh when the Philistines destroyed the sanctuary there.</p>
<p>The episode of David and the priests of Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.2-7">1 Sm 21:2-7</a>) attests to the antiquity of the details of the table and the bread of the presence (<a href="?bref=Exod.37.10-16">Ex 37:10-16</a>). Jesus cites David’s hunger as a just reason for breaking the ritual laws governing Sabbath observance (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.23-28">Mk 2:23-28</a>). David, fleeing from Saul and needing food, went into the sanctuary at Nob and took the loaves laid out each Sabbath as an offering to the Lord.</p>
<p>Ahimelech, a descendant of Eli and leader of the priests of Nob, gave the showbread to David, along with the sword with which Goliath had been slain. This incensed Saul, who ordered the murder of Ahimelech and the massacre of all the priests and citizens of Nob (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.6-23">1 Sm 22:6-23</a>), an act that sealed the fate of the king. Abiathar, a priest who evaded the massacre, played a prominent role in the reign of David until Solomon eventually removed him from his position (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">1 Kgs 2:26-27</a>).

<p class="h1">NORTH, NORTH COUNTRY</p>
<p class="fl">Cardinal point on a compass opposite the south, often having the connotation of “dark,” perhaps because the north side is often in shadow. In biblical literature, notably in the books of Joshua and Ezekiel, the term “north” is used frequently to designate direction, whether of tribal boundaries or of a temple.</p>
<p>An enemy from the north is mentioned at least 40 times in the prophecies of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah. During the time of the exile (Jeremiah and Ezekiel), it referred to invaders who came from the East, pushed westward north of the Syrian desert, and then turned south to invade Judah from the north. Hence, they were viewed as invading from the “north country”; this latter phrase occurs at least 10 times in Jeremiah and Zechariah.</p>
<p>Jerusalem is vulnerable only from the north. The topography of the country is such that seldom in history has any invader conquered the Holy City from any direction except from the northern approach. The city was protected by deep valleys on each of the other three sides. In biblical times only the Egyptians and the Philistines threatened Jerusalem from the west; even the Philistines, during the time of Saul, were successful only in the areas north of Jerusalem. In Daniel the “king of the north” doubtless refers to Syrian forces in mortal combat with the “king of the south” (Egypt).</p>

<p class="h1">NUMBERS AND NUMEROLOGY*</p>
<p class="fl">Individual numbers have a symbolic as well as a literal sense in the Bible. In Daniel, and to a lesser extent in Revelation, there is a developed system of numerology where interrelated systems of numbers are used in a definite pattern.</p>
<p>Traditionally, conservative Christians have been suspicious of numerology because of its unwise use by groups of Christians who see theological symbolism in every number in the OT, even the most factual. This view was inherited from mystical, pre-Christian Jewish groups, and later carried to extremes by the Kabbalists.</p>

<p class="h2" id="ExpressionofNumbers">Expression of Numbers</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew, and indeed any other Semitic language, has a simple but adequate system of numeration. The number one is an adjective. After that, the numerals are nouns, in parallel masculine and feminine forms, although the masculine is used with the feminine noun and vice versa. Ordinal numbers (first, second, third, etc.) exist alongside cardinal numbers (one, two, three), but as in most languages, the second set can be used instead of the first (“day two” instead of “second day”). From ten to nineteen, there is one composite form built like English “thirteen” (“three-ten”), but “twenty” is literally “tens” (the plural of “ten”). Thirty, forty, and so on are literally “threes,” “fours” (the plural of the words “three” and “four,” respectively) and so on, up to a hundred, which is a new word. There are also separate words for “thousand” and for “ten thousand,” as in Greek, Chinese, and many other languages. Larger numbers must be expressed by multiples of these (“ten thousand times ten thousand” and “thousands of thousands”), suggesting that large figures, rarely needed for small populations and tiny kingdoms, were expressed approximately. Hebrew has not only a singular and plural but also a dual form to express two of anything (two hundred, two thousand). Fractions (a half, a third, a tenth, etc.) could be expressed, and multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction were used. Indeed, instances of all four operations can be found in the Bible. The Hebrew mathematical system was basically part of the larger western Asian mathematical system, of which we know a great deal from Mesopotamia and Egypt. These countries, however, used a more highly developed mathematical system than Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WaysofWritingNumerals">Ways of Writing Numerals</p>
<p class="fl">In the Bible, numbers are always written out in words, as on the famous Moabite Stone and the Siloam Inscription. But every nation in the ancient world could also express numbers by using figures or ciphers of various kinds (like our 1, 2, 3, . . .). Because of this danger of error, in later days numbers were normally written out in full, in words, where confusion, although still possible, was not nearly so likely. An additional way of writing numbers, known both to the Hebrews and the Greeks, was the use of consecutive letters of the alphabet instead of consecutive numerals (as if we used A for 1, B for 2, etc.). This system, in wide use by NT times, is the usual system in modern Hebrew and has the advantage that numerical combinations can be pronounced by inserting arbitrary vowels, thus making artificial words. For example, if the number of the beast (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.18">Rv 13:18</a>), 666, is expressed in alphabetical letters, it can spell out the consonants of “Nero Caesar,” although other names are possible, especially if the variant reading 616 is used.</p>

<p class="h2" id="ProblemsofLargeNumbers">Problems of Large Numbers</p>
<p class="fl">Even allowing for all these possibilities, there remain certain problems connected with large numbers, particularly in the OT. The most obvious is that of the ten long-lived patriarchs, whose ages are recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-32">Genesis 5</a>. Different figures (varying by whole centuries) are recorded for their ages in the Hebrew text, the Samaritan text, and the earliest Greek translation (known as the Septuagint), but all figures are very large. Some interpret these figures literally and point out that there is a steady reduction from the ages attained by these patriarchs to the more modest 120 years allotted to man in Noah’s time (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>) and the 70 years accepted later as the human life span (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.10">Ps 90:10</a>). This would correspond to the progressive spiritual deterioration of mankind after the fall, from the perfect state of Adam to the present condition. Whatever the explanation of the figures, there is no doubt that this is the theological intent of the Bible.</p>
<p>The large number of Israelites who left Egypt is also problematic. If there were actually 600,000 fighting men (<a href="?bref=Num.1.46">Nm 1:46</a>), this would correspond to a whole nation of some 2 million or more. Possibly the word translated “thousand” means “clan units”; it would clearly be a much smaller total body, whatever its exact size. Of course, God could have maintained any number of people in the desert. The evidence of archaeology as to the population of Canaan both before and after the Israelite onslaught seems to support a lower number. The same principle might explain the large numbers given for the fighting men of the various Israelite tribes, and the huge totals for Israel and Judah’s military strength given at later times in the historical books of the OT.</p>
<p>To the ordinary Bible reader, perhaps one of the biggest problems is the different numbers recorded in Chronicles and Kings, when the same incidents are being described. Manuscript errors, or confusion of numbers written by signs or single letters of the alphabet, may account for numerous individual inconsistencies, but not for wholesale differences, particularly as the figures in Chronicles are consistently much larger. These very large round numbers may have symbolic significance and may not be intended to be taken in their literal sense at all. Indeed, since the Jews had before them the book of Kings and the book of Chronicles at the same time, they can hardly have taken both sets of numbers literally themselves.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CountingbyGenerations">Counting by Generations</p>
<p class="fl">One of the problems of the OT is that of the dating of events. Even with an exact number system, there is no absolute fixed point from which to reckon. Later Jews and Christians counted from the presumed date of the Creation. Not until after the time of David and Solomon are both internal reference between the comparative dates of kings of Judah and Israel and external reference to monarchs outside Israel used. This open-endedness accounts for the vague period of “forty years” used so often in the OT (e.g., the book of Judges) for any long but indeterminate period of time, almost certainly corresponding to a generation (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">dor</span>). Counting by generations is specific in some places in the Bible and may be implicit in others. For instance, Abraham’s descendants are to return to Canaan “in the fourth generation” (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.16">Gn 15:16</a>), and the genealogy of Christ is neatly constructed on a pattern of three groups of fourteen generations (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.17">Mt 1:17</a>), rather than on periods of years. Wherever people use and recite genealogies, such counting by generations is natural. But Abraham’s descendants are said to have returned to Canaan approximately four centuries later (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.17">Gal 3:17</a>), and therefore the word “generation” sometimes stands for 100 years. The Hebrew word for “generation” may mean 120 years (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>). Usually, the ancient Hebrews used vague phrases like “in those days” or “after those days” or “the days are coming,” which expressed past, present, and future without any specific mention of number. In other words, the Bible writers were more concerned with theology than with mathematics.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ApproximateUseofNumbers">Approximate Use of Numbers</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT, Israel’s 40 years in the desert is a good example of the approximate use of numbers (<a href="?bref=Num.14.33">Nm 14:33</a>). In the NT, Jesus was in the wilderness 40 days during the temptation (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.2">Mt 4:2</a>), and there were 40 days between his resurrection and ascension (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.3">Acts 1:3</a>). Moses was 40 years old at his call (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.23">Acts 7:23</a>), apparently lived 40 years in Midian (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.7">Ex 7:7</a>), and spent 40 years leading Israel out of Egypt and through the desert (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.7">Dt 34:7</a>), for he is said to be 120 years old at his death. However, two generations of 40 years is the normal maximum for a healthy man (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.10">Ps 90:10</a>), and even this is often shortened to 70 years by the rigors of life. Seventy is also used at times in this approximate sense.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SymbolicUseofNumbers">Symbolic Use of Numbers</p>
<p class="fl">In Scripture, seven symbolizes completeness or perfection. On the seventh day God rested from his labors and creation is finished (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.2">Gn 2:2</a>). Pharaoh in his dream saw seven cattle coming from the Nile (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.2">41:2</a>). Samson’s sacred Nazirite locks were braided in seven plaits (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.13">Jgs 16:13</a>). Seven devils left Mary of Magdala, signifying the totality of her previous possession by Satan (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.2">Lk 8:2</a>); “seven other devils” will enter the purified but vacant life of a person (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.45">Mt 12:45</a>). However, on the positive side, there were the seven spirits of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.1">Rv 3:1</a>). In the seventh year the Hebrew slave was to be freed (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.2">Ex 21:2</a>), having completed his time of captivity and service. Every seventh year was a sabbatical year (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.4">Lv 25:4</a>). Seven times seven reiterates the sense of completeness. In the Year of Jubilee (at the completion of 7 x 7 years = the 50th year), all land is freed and returns to the original owners (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.10">Lv 25:10</a>). Pentecost, the Feast of Weeks, is seven times seven days after Passover. “Seventy,” which is literally “sevens” in Hebrew, strengthens the concept of perfection. There are 70 elders (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1">Ex 24:1</a>) in Israel. Israel was exiled to Babylon for 70 years (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.12">Jer 25:12</a>) to complete its punishment. “Seventy times seven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.22">Mt 18:22</a>) reiterates this still further. The Lord was not giving Peter a mathematical number of times that he should forgive another person, but rather was insisting on limitless forgiveness for a brother’s sin.</p>
<p>“Three” may well share in this meaning of completion or perfection, although not so forcibly (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.18">2 Kgs 13:18</a>). Many things happen “on the third day” (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.2">Hos 6:2</a>). Jonah spent three days in the stomach of the fish (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">Mt 12:40</a>), and the Lord rose again on the third day (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.4">1 Cor 15:4</a>). David was offered a choice of divine punishments—three years, three months, three days (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.13">2 Sm 24:13</a>). For the Christian, “three” takes on a far deeper significance as the number of Persons of the Trinity. The three Persons are clearly expressed, for instance, in the Great Commission (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Mt 28:19</a>) and in the Pauline benediction (<a href="?bref=2Cor.13.13">2 Cor 13:13</a>). Many echoes of this threefold expression are in the NT, and many anticipations of it in the OT, of which the thrice-repeated “Holy” in <a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Isaiah 6:3</a> is the most famous.</p>
<p>Some scholars see four as another symbol of completeness (four winds of heaven, <a href="?bref=Dan.7.2">Dn 7:2</a>; four horsemen, <a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-7">Rv 6:1-7</a>; four living creatures around the throne of God, <a href="?bref=Rev.4.6">Rv 4:6</a>). Five is certainly used in an indefinite sense as a small number (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.18">Is 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.17">30:17</a>). Nor do eight or nine seem to have any special significance, although, like other numbers, they may be used in a factual sense to describe any of God’s activities (nine plagues on Egypt, <a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-10.29">Ex 7–10</a>). “Ten” does have significance because of the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">Ex 20:1-17</a>), but not any special symbolism earlier in the Bible. If anything, “ten” is elsewhere used in a vague way. Laban changes Jacob’s wages ten times (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.7">Gn 31:7</a>); Daniel and his friends are ten times better than all other students (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.20">Dn 1:20</a>); ten times over, the Jewish settlers will be warned of impending enemy attacks (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.12">Neh 4:12</a>).</p>
<p>Eleven appears to have no special biblical significance, but 12 certainly has. The clearest proof of this is the existence of the 12 tribes in Israel. In <a href="?bref=Rev.7.4-8">Revelation 7:4-8</a>, where it is mathematically important that the number of tribes be limited to 12, the tribe of Dan is altogether omitted—probably on account of Dan’s sin of idolatry (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.14-20">Jgs 18:14-20</a>). Ishmael’s descendants were also divided into 12 clans (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.20">Gn 17:20</a>), so that the number 12 was apparently significant outside Israel as well. In the NT Christ chose 12 apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.1-4">Mt 10:1-4</a>). The link with the number of tribes is made specific when Christ tells the apostles that they will sit on 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">Mt 19:28</a>). However, it is interesting that, after the election and appointment of Matthias (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.26">Acts 1:26</a>), the Christian church apparently made no subsequent efforts to maintain the number of apostles. Like “seven times seven,” “twelve times twelve” increases the force of the number. When this is further multiplied by a thousand, the figure becomes the 144,000 redeemed (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.4">Rv 7:4</a>), who were sealed “out of all the tribes of Israel.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="ExactStatistics">Exact Statistics</p>
<p class="fl">As distinct from the metaphorical use of numbers to denote completion, immensity, and the like, numbers in Hebrew were often used to give exact tallies or measurements. Such usage is known to us only from clay tablets and ostraca (broken pieces of potsherd engraved in ink, used as rough notebooks). However, ascertaining exactly what the text was in its earliest form and what that text means is difficult.</p>
<p>An example is the number of the sons of Jeconiah among the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh. They were struck down by the Lord because of their failure to rejoice with the others when God’s ark returned to Israel from the Philistine country (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.19">1 Sm 6:19</a>). The Greek text (LXX) reads “seventy”; the later Hebrew manuscripts add “fifty thousand.” But, as Beth-shemesh itself was only a small frontier town, and the “sons of Jeconiah” was presumably only one clan among several, the smaller number is obviously the original, and the large addition due to some later manuscript confusion.</p>
<p>A good rule in trying to decide whether a number is statistical or impressionistic is to determine whether it is a small number, or an unusual number for which there is no obvious theological explanation. When the men of Ai killed some 36 Israelites at the first assault on the city (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.5">Jos 7:5</a>), the smallness of the number is evidence that this is a vividly remembered factual detail. Similarly, in the case of the number of Abraham’s 318 men (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.14">Gn 14:14</a>) or the catch of 153 fish after the resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.21.11">Jn 21:11</a>), the numbers, though large, are not round numbers but unusual combinations, and are obviously meant in a literal or statistical sense. Irrelevant details like this have a habit of remaining in the memory, and are the best guarantee of the trustworthiness of the narrative.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Numerology">Numerology</p>
<p class="fl">Numerology may be said to be an extended application of the metaphorical significance of numbers (7, 40, etc.) already discussed. In the Bible, this systematization of numbers always goes with a strong sense of the sovereignty of God, his control over human history, and a belief in his ongoing purpose and its triumphant conclusion.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first clear instance of numerology in the Bible is <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kings 6:1</a>, where Solomon began to build the temple 480 years after the exodus, a period 5 times 10 times 12, or 4 times 120, the ideal life span of man in early days (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>). <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3-8">First Chronicles 6:3-8</a> gives 12 generations of men (presumably 40 years each) to cover the same period, so “twelve generations” is probably the real basis for the computation, rather than any exact year-by-year tally. A tally would have been impossible in the days of the judges and unlikely before the monarchy. David was the first to establish an official scribe or recorder to keep daily annals in Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.16-17">2 Sm 8:16-17</a>), as was common in the great kingdoms from far earlier times. Such Israelite annals are later mentioned as sources of the books of the kings (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.18">2 Kgs 14:18</a>). The number 480 is probably a rough approximation rather than exact and denotes the end of one of God’s epochs.</p>
<p>When Jeremiah prophesies an exile of 70 years for Judah (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.11">Jer 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.10">29:10</a>), it is not only a historical prediction that was literally fulfilled but also a symbol of completeness; Judah’s punishment is complete (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.40.2">Is 40:2</a>). Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.15">Is 23:15</a>) had made a similar prophecy of a 70-year punishment for Tyre, and Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.11-13">Ez 29:11-13</a>) prophesied a 40-year “exile” for Egypt. When these 70 years are regarded as sabbatical years, where the land must lie untilled to compensate for the 7 times 70 years of sin before, then true numerology begins (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.21">2 Chr 36:21</a>). Here numerology is used only as an explanation of past and present, but it can also be used to explain the future, especially in the book of Daniel.</p>
<p>Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.2">Dn 9:2</a>) refers to the literal 70 years of the exile as foretold by Jeremiah. In <a href="?bref=Dan.9.24">Daniel 9:24</a>, this has been extended to 70 weeks of years (490 years) applied to the distant future. <a href="?bref=Dan.9.25">Daniel 9:25</a> sees 69 of these (483 years) as elapsing before Messiah appears. Presumably, the last week of the 70 is therefore thought of as the time of his activity. However this may be interpreted in terms of actual dates, it must be harmonized with <a href="?bref=Dan.9.26">9:26</a>, where the Messiah is “cut off” after 62 weeks of years (434 years). The difficulty lies in establishing the starting point for this long period. This is an example of an elaborate numerology, embracing centuries of history, all ultimately based on the 70 years of Jeremiah. According to biblical principles, this can have both an “immediate” fulfillment in the return from exile, and a “prophetic” fulfillment in the far distant future in connection with the coming of Christ.</p>
<p>The other major example of extended numerology in Daniel is in connection with the “time, times, and half a time” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.25">7:25</a>). This must stand for three and a half “times,” that is, half of seven “times.” Thus, it refers either to three and a half years (half a “week” of years) or three and a half “weeks” of years (cf. “seven times” in <a href="?bref=Dan.4.16">4:16</a>, where “seven years” is clearly meant). Whatever may be its ultimate prophetic fulfillment in Christ, the “initial” or “partial” fulfillment is the roughly three and a half years of bitter persecution of God’s people by Antiochus Epiphanes (167–164 <span class="era">BC</span>). This figure of three and a half years reappears in <a href="?bref=Rev.11.2">Revelation 11:2</a> (“forty-two months”), and <a href="?bref=Rev.12.14">12:14</a> (“a time, and times, and half a time”), to describe the period of Rome’s persecution of the Christian church. The figure had possibly become a symbol of any bitter but limited persecution. The “two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings” of <a href="?bref=Dan.8.14">Daniel 8:14</a> may mean 1,150 days, which is approximately the same length of time.</p>
<p>The three and a half years of <a href="?bref=Dan.7.25">Daniel 7:25</a> reappear in <a href="?bref=Rev.11.1-19">Revelation 11</a> in the form of “forty-two months,” the time when the heathen will trample down Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.2">Rv 11:2</a>). The 1,290 days of <a href="?bref=Dan.12.11">Daniel 12:11</a> reappear here (in the slightly different form of 1,260 days) as the time that God’s two witnesses will prophesy (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.3">Rv 11:3</a>). The 42 months reappear in <a href="?bref=Rev.13.5">Revelation 13:5</a> as the period that the wild beast will be allowed to blaspheme. While the “thousand years” of <a href="?bref=Rev.20.6">20:6</a> is not derived from Daniel at all, the metaphorical use of “thousand” is familiar to the OT. The closest direct parallel is in <a href="?bref=Deut.7.9">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, where God’s covenant will be kept with a “thousand generations” to come.</p>

<p class="fl">The question of the authorship of Numbers is part of the larger question of the authorship of the Pentateuch. Until the appearance of the higher-critical documentary theories of the 19th century, the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch was almost universally held by both Jews and Christians alike. This time-honored tradition is supported by the Pentateuch itself (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.17.14">Ex 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">24:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.27">34:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.2">Nm 33:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31.9,24">Dt 31:9, 24</a>), the rest of the OT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.23.6">Jos 23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.4">Jgs 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.4">Mal 4:4</a>), as well as Jesus’ teaching (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.5.46-47">Jn 5:46-47</a>), and the rest of the NT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.28.23">Acts 28:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.19">Rom 10:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.9">1 Cor 9:9</a>). Although discrepancies in the Pentateuch were widely and openly acknowledged, nevertheless Moses, the 15th-century <span class="era">BC</span> lawgiver, was affirmed as the primary author of the Pentateuchal literature.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="h3">Sinai Peninsula</p>
<p class="fl">The historical background of Numbers begins primarily in the geographical region of the Sinai Peninsula of the mid-second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The Sinai Peninsula is in the shape of an inverted triangle with the base on the north. It is approximately 240 miles (386.2 kilometers) long from north to south and 175 miles (281.6 kilometers) wide at the northern base, with an area of approximately 22,000 square miles (56,980 square kilometers). It is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Sea and the southern border of Canaan, on the west by the Bitter Lakes and the Gulf of Suez, and on the east by the Arabah and the Gulf of Aqaba. Beginning in the north at the Mediterranean coast and moving south, for about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) the soil is sandy. South of this coastal plain is a high plateau (Et-Tih) of gravel and limestone (about 2,500 feet, or 762 meters, above sea level), stretching south into the peninsula for approximately 150 miles (241.4 kilometers). Rising above the plateau at this point is a granite mountain formation with peaks up to 8,000 feet (2,438.4 meters) above sea level. In this mountainous region at the apex of the peninsular triangle, Jebel Musa (7,363 feet, or 2,244.2 meters, high), the traditional site where Israel camped before Mt Sinai and Moses received the law, rises above the plain.</p>
<p>The peninsula itself is comprised of five wilderness areas. In the north and immediately east of the land of Goshen is the approximately 40-mile- or 64.4-kilometer-wide wilderness of Shur, which runs past the River of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish) to the region of Kadesh-barnea and northeast to Beersheba. East of this region is the wilderness of Zin, extending east from the wilderness of Shur to the southern tip of the Dead Sea. Kadesh-barnea is located on its southern border (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1">Nm 20:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.36">33:36</a>). South of the wilderness of Shur is the wilderness of Etham, and east of this wilderness in the east-central region of Sinai is the great wilderness of Paran (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.19">Dt 1:19</a>). Kadesh-barnea is on the northern border of this territory (<a href="?bref=Num.13.26">Nm 13:26</a>). In this area the Israelites spent 38 of their 40 years of wandering. Southwest of the wilderness of Paran, on the western slopes of the peninsula, not far from the granite mountains standing in the southern apex of the triangle, is the wilderness of Sin.</p>
<p>While the region is generally desolate and barren, it is not impassable or incapable of sustaining travelers. Wells and springs dot both the western and eastern borders at reasonable distances from each other. The water table is fairly close to ground level, making the digging of wells possible (<a href="?bref=Num.20.17">Nm 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.21.16-18">21:16-18</a>). The limestone rocks are also capable of holding great amounts of water (<a href="?bref=Num.20.11">20:11</a>). Vegetation is sparse except around the more permanent streams where vegetation and date palms flourish. The rainy season in winter is approximately 20 days. Quail (<a href="?bref=Num.11.31-32">11:31-32</a>) are known to migrate across the peninsula to Europe in the spring.</p>

<p class="h3">The Peoples Israel Confronted</p>
<p class="h4">Amalekites and Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Num.14.25,43-45">14:25, 43-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.20">24:20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Amalekites were descendants of Amalek, son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.12,16">Gn 36:12, 16</a>). They were generally a nomadic people. In the Sinai Peninsula they were the first to war against Israel at Rephidim (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.24.20">Nm 24:20</a>), perhaps the Wadi Refayid in southwest Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">Ex 17:8-16</a>), before Israel reached Horeb. A year later, the Amalekites settled in the hills and valleys north of Kadesh-barnea. In league with the Canaanites, the inhabitants of Palestine, they blocked the effort of Israel to invade the land of promise from the south (<a href="?bref=Num.14.45">Nm 14:45</a>). Israel’s will to wage war appears to have been completely broken for years to come.</p>
<p class="h4">Edomites (<a href="?bref=Num.20.14-21">20:14-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.21.4,10-11">21:4, 10-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Edom, or Seir (<a href="?bref=Num.24.18">24:18</a>), is the territory south of the Dead Sea occupied by Esau’s descendants. Stretching from its northern border at the Wadi Zered (<a href="?bref=Num.21.12">21:12</a>), which flowed into the Dead Sea at its southern tip, 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) south to the Gulf of Aqaba, it occupied both sides of the Arabah, with Kadesh-barnea again standing on the edge of its western border (<a href="?bref=Num.20.16">20:16</a>), giving it a land area of approximately 4,000 square miles (10,360 square kilometers). It is a rugged mountain region with peaks rising to 3,500 feet (1,066.8 meters). The “king’s highway,” an ancient trade route from Damascus through the Transjordan to the Gulf of Aqaba, passed through its territory and major cities, Bozrah and Leman. While Edom was not fertile, it did have cultivable areas (<a href="?bref=Num.20.17-19">20:17-19</a>).</p>
<p>During Israel’s march to the Transjordan region, Edom refused to let Israel journey directly east from Kadesh through its territory but forced Israel to move southeast into and up the Arabah (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4,11">21:4, 11</a>). In spite of this hostility to God’s people, Israel was forbidden to attack (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.2-8">Dt 2:2-8</a>) or to hate the Edomites (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.7">23:7</a>), and so Edom was spared from destruction during the conquest of the land. The area was later conquered by David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.13-14">2 Sm 8:13-14</a>) according to Balaam’s prophecy (<a href="?bref=Num.24.18">Nm 24:18</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Arad (<a href="?bref=Num.21.1-3">21:1-3</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Arad was a south Canaanite settlement in the Negev. Its king, after fighting against Israel and taking some captives, was later defeated at Hormah.</p>
<p class="h4">Moabites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.11-15">21:11-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">22:1–24:25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Moab, occupied by the descendants of Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.37">Gn 19:37</a>), is the territory east of the Dead Sea lying primarily between the Wadi Arnon (<a href="?bref=Num.21.13">Nm 21:13</a>) and the Wadi Zered with a land area of approximately 1,400 square miles (3,626 square kilometers).</p>
<p>In the late middle Bronze Age, the Moabites had overflowed their main plateau and had extended well to the north of the Arnon all the way to the northern end of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Num.21.20">21:20</a>). At the time of the events recorded in Numbers, however, the Amorites occupied the area from Arnon all the way north to the Wadi Jabbok (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.13">13</a>, <a href="?bref=Num.13.21-24">21-24</a>), having earlier taken this land from Moab (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.26-30">26-30</a>). The Moabite kingdom was highly organized, with agriculture and livestock, splendid buildings, distinctive pottery, and strong fortifications around her borders. Its god was Chemosh (v <a href="?bref=Num.21.29">29</a>).</p>
<p>Balak, king of Moab during the period of the conquest, in league with Midian, hired Balaam to curse Israel (chs <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">22–24</a>). When this failed, the two heathen powers sought to neutralize Israel by luring the people of God into the worship of Chemosh and into idolatry (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-2">25:1-2</a>). In the war that ensued, Israel defeated Midian (<a href="?bref=Num.31.1-18">31:1-18</a>), but by God’s express command (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.9-13">Dt 2:9-13</a>) spared Moab. But as Balaam had prophesied earlier (<a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Nm 24:17</a>), David in the 11th century warred against and defeated Moab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.2,13-14">2 Sm 8:2, 13-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Amorites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.21-35">21:21-35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Amorites, the people who had occupied northern Moabite territory (<a href="?bref=Num.21.25-30">Nm 21:25-30</a>), were descendants of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.16">Gn 10:16</a>) who had scattered throughout the hill country on both sides of the Jordan River. Heshbon was their capital city. Both Sihon of Heshbon and Og of Bashan were Amorite kings (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.8">Dt 3:8</a>).</p>
<p>As for Bashan (<a href="?bref=Num.21.33-35">Nm 21:33-35</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.1.4">Dt 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.1-12">3:1-12</a>), it is the fertile grazing region (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-5">Nm 32:1-5</a>) east of the Sea of Kinnereth (Galilee), whose northern border extended to Mt Hermon and whose southern border, while normally the river Yarmuk, in the Mosaic age was the Wadi Jabbok (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.4-5">Jos 12:4-5</a>). Its land area covered approximately 5,000 square miles (12,950 square kilometers). Its major cities were Ashtaroth, Edrei, and Golan. After the conquest of the land, this territory fell to the half-tribe of Manasseh, with Gad occupying southern Gilead, and Reuben the region south to the Wadi Arnon.</p>
<p class="h4">Midianites (<a href="?bref=Num.25.16-18">25:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.1-54">31:1-54</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Midianites, descendants of Abraham through the concubine Keturah (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.2">Gn 25:2</a>), were desert dwellers in Transjordan from Moab to the region south of Edom. The elders of Moab and Midian cooperated in hiring Balaam to curse Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.22.4-7">Nm 22:4-7</a>). Later, when that effort proved fruitless, the Midianites, again with Moab, led Israel into idolatry and immorality (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-6,14-15">25:1-6, 14-15</a>). Cozbi, the Midianite woman who was executed for her wickedness (<a href="?bref=Num.25.8">25:8</a>), was the daughter of Zur, one of the five Midianite kings confederate with the Amorite king Sihon (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.21">Jos 13:21</a>) who were later killed in Israel’s holy war against Midian (<a href="?bref=Num.31.8">Nm 31:8</a>). This war with Midian apparently broke the back of any remaining Amorite resistance, for <a href="?bref=Josh.13.15-23">Joshua 13:15-23</a> clearly intimates that as a result the tribe of Reuben occupied this territory.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Numbers serves a twofold purpose. First, as a historical book, it contains the account of Israel’s fortunes from Mt Sinai to the plains of Moab on the eve of the conquest of Canaan—that almost-40-year period spent in the wilderness of Sinai and in Transjordan (1447–1407 <span class="era">BC</span>). While recounting Israel’s many failures and God’s many faithful acts, it depicts Moses, Israel’s leader, in all of his greatness and in all of his weakness. The two army rolls (chs <a href="?bref=Num.2.1-34">2</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.26.1-65">26</a>) introduce the “acts” of the main drama of its history: the first in preparation for entering the land, which failed due to Israel’s unbelief; the second, after the death of the entire generation that left Egypt, in preparation for the successful invasion of Canaan under Joshua’s leadership.</p>
<p>Second, in line with Paul’s general belief that “whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope” (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.4">Rom 15:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), and in keeping with his specific teaching that “these things [that befell Israel in the wilderness] happened to them as a warning, but they were written down for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has come” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.11">1 Cor 10:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), Numbers serves a doctrinal, typical, and hortatory purpose (cf. v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.12">12</a>). Historical events are divinely invested with spiritual truths, thereby becoming object lessons for the Christian.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.1.1-54">1</a></p>
<p class="fl">The Lord commanded Moses to register (<a href="?bref=Num.1.18">Nm 1:18</a>) the men able to go to war (vv <a href="?bref=Num.1.2-3">2-3</a>). The total number of soldiers in Israel was 603,550 (v <a href="?bref=Num.1.46">46</a>). The Levites were not numbered in this roll (vv <a href="?bref=Num.1.47-54">47-54</a>), since they were to be set apart for special service pertaining to the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.2.1-34">2</a></p>
<p class="fl">The Lord instructed Moses concerning the arrangement of the tribes while encamped and on the march. With the tabernacle in the center of the camp, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, totaling 186,400 (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.9">9</a>), were to camp on the east; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, totaling 151,450 (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.16">16</a>), were to camp on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, totaling 108,100 (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.24">24</a>), were to camp on the west; and Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, totaling 157,600 (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.31">31</a>), were to camp on the north.</p>
<p>On the march, Judah’s east group (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.9">9</a>) was to set out first, followed by Reuben’s south group (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.16">16</a>). The Levites with the tabernacle were to follow (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.17">17</a>). Then Ephraim’s west group (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.24">24</a>) was to follow the Levites, with Dan’s north group (v <a href="?bref=Num.2.31">31</a>) bringing up the rear. This means that the Levites were flanked by two groups, before and behind.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.3.1-51">3</a></p>
<p class="fl">Aaron, the great-grandson of Levi through Kohath (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.16-20">Ex 6:16-20</a>), and his descendants were designated to serve as priests at the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.3.2-3">Nm 3:2-3</a>). The remaining descendants of Levi, from the families of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, were to serve the Aaronic line at the tabernacle (vv <a href="?bref=Num.3.5-10">5-10</a>). The Gershonites were responsible for the tabernacle coverings, hangings, and screens (vv <a href="?bref=Num.3.25-26">25-26</a>); the Kohathites were responsible for the “furniture” in the tabernacle (v <a href="?bref=Num.3.31">31</a>); and the Merarites were responsible for the frames, bars, and foundations for the tabernacle (vv <a href="?bref=Num.3.36-37">36-37</a>).</p>
<p>God instructed Moses to number the three Levitical families. Gershon’s descendants, totaling 7,500 (v <a href="?bref=Num.3.22">22</a>), were to camp on the west, between the western group of tribes and the tabernacle. Kohath’s descendants, totaling 8,600 (v <a href="?bref=Num.3.28">28</a>), were to camp on the south, between the southern group of tribes and the tabernacle. Merari’s descendants, totaling 6,200 (v <a href="?bref=Num.3.34">34</a>), were to camp on the north, between the northern group of tribes and the tabernacle. Moses and the Aaronic family were to camp on the east, between the eastern group of tribes and the tabernacle (v <a href="?bref=Num.3.38">38</a>). Both in camp and on the march, then, the tabernacle was in the midst of Israel.</p>
<p>The census of Israel’s firstborn males disclosed 273 more male babies than Levites (vv <a href="?bref=Num.3.40-46">40-46</a>), and since the Levites were a ransom for Israelite males on a one-to-one basis, the 273 additional male children had to be ransomed by atonement money (vv <a href="?bref=Num.3.46-51">46-51</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.4.1-49">4</a></p>
<p class="fl">God instructed Moses that only Levites between the ages of 30 and 50 were to serve at the tabernacle. A census disclosed that there were 2,750 Kohathites (v <a href="?bref=Num.4.36">36</a>), 2,630 Gershonites (v <a href="?bref=Num.4.40">40</a>), and 3,200 Merarites (v <a href="?bref=Num.4.44">44</a>), making a total of 8,580 (v <a href="?bref=Num.4.48">48</a>) who were eligible to serve the Aaronic priests.</p>
<p>God further ordered the Aaronic priests, when the tabernacle was being dismantled for the march, to cover all the tabernacle “furniture” before the Kohathites even looked at them (v <a href="?bref=Num.4.20">20</a>) lest the Kohathites, either looking at or touching them (v <a href="?bref=Num.4.15">15</a>), should die (vv <a href="?bref=Num.4.15,20">15, 20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.5.1-31">5</a></p>
<p class="fl">For ceremonial purposes, God demanded that lepers, those with a bodily discharge, and those who had touched the dead, must be put outside the camp until they were purified (vv <a href="?bref=Num.5.1-4">1-4</a>). Furthermore, God instructed those making restitution for a wrongdoing, if the wronged person was no longer alive, to give the restitution price to a priest (vv <a href="?bref=Num.5.5-10">5-10</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, if a woman was suspected by her husband of infidelity but there was no evidence of such, the woman was to undergo a trial by water ordeal to relieve the man of his suspicions. The priest was to give her holy water with dust from the floor of the tabernacle in it to drink. If she was guilty, the water by divine direction would cause her pain, make her abdomen swell, and her thigh waste away (vv <a href="?bref=Num.5.11-31">11-31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-27">6</a></p>
<p class="fl">Laws pertaining to the Nazirite were given next. A Nazirite was a person who determined to take a vow to separate himself wholly to the Lord. To dramatize this separation, the Nazirite was to drink no intoxicating beverage, let the hair grow long, and touch no dead body (vv <a href="?bref=Num.6.3-6">3-6</a>). Should he defile himself, he was to follow prescribed rules for ceremonial cleansing (vv <a href="?bref=Num.6.9-12">9-12</a>). When his vow had run its course, he was to follow prescribed rules for terminating his vow (vv <a href="?bref=Num.6.13-21">13-21</a>). Finally, God instructed the Aaronic priesthood concerning the blessing they were to pronounce upon the Israelite worshiper (vv <a href="?bref=Num.6.22-27">22-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.7.1-89">7</a></p>
<p class="fl">The leaders in Israel brought six wagons and twelve oxen for use in the transfer of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.7.3">7:3</a>). Moses gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonites (v <a href="?bref=Num.7.7">7</a>), and four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarites (v <a href="?bref=Num.7.8">8</a>). (The Kohathites were to carry the “furniture” of the tabernacle on their shoulders, v <a href="?bref=Num.7.9">9</a>.) For twelve consecutive days, to consecrate the altar after it was anointed (vv <a href="?bref=Num.7.10,88">10, 88</a>), the tribal leaders, in the order of march (cf. ch <a href="?bref=Num.2.1-34">2</a>), brought similar offerings. God demonstrated his pleasure with this gesture by speaking to Moses from the mercy seat (v <a href="?bref=Num.7.89">89</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.8.1-26">8</a></p>
<p class="fl">God granted the prerogative to light the seven-branched lampstand to the Aaronic priests (vv <a href="?bref=Num.8.1-4">1-4</a>). Following divine instructions, Moses and Aaron consecrated the Levites to the service of the tabernacle by means of a purification ceremony (vv <a href="?bref=Num.8.5-22">5-22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapters <a href="?bref=Num.9.1-10.10">9:1–10:10</a></p>
<p class="fl">For the benefit of the worshiper who was ceremonially unclean or away on a journey at the time of the Passover, God granted permission to observe the Passover a month later (vv <a href="?bref=Num.9.6-12">6-12</a>; see also ch <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-23">27</a>).</p>
<p>God gave final instructions to the people before their departure from Sinai. They were to prepare for marching when they saw the cloud ascending from the tabernacle, and they were to stop at the place where the cloud settled down (<a href="?bref=Num.9.15-23">9:15-23</a>). The people were to assemble at the tabernacle if two silver trumpets were blown; only the leaders were to come if one was blown; and at the blast of a military alarm, the several groups of tribes were to prepare for an immediate march (<a href="?bref=Num.10.1-10">10:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapters <a href="?bref=Num.10.11-14.45">10:11–14:45</a></p>
<p class="fl">The next section recounts the march from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea, a period of time approximately one and a half to two months in length (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.10.11">10:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.20">13:20</a>). Almost immediately the people began to complain as they passed through the terrible wilderness of Paran (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.19">Dt 1:19</a>), angering the Lord at Taberah (<a href="?bref=Num.11.1-3">Nm 11:1-3</a>) and at Kibroth-hattaavah (<a href="?bref=Num.11.4-35">Nm 11:4-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.26-31">Pss 78:26-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.13-15">106:13-15</a>). Miriam and Aaron challenged Moses’ sole right to speak for God to the people, which resulted in temporary leprosy as punishment for Miriam (doubtless the leader in the provocation). Through Moses’ intercession, the two were forgiven (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-16">Nm 12</a>). Out of this event, however, came the remarkable description of Moses’ relationship to God as a unique means of revelation (vv <a href="?bref=Num.12.6-8">6-8</a>).</p>
<p>From Paran (Kadesh-barnea) Moses dispatched the spies to survey the land (ch <a href="?bref=Num.13.1-33">13</a>). <a href="?bref=Deut.1.22">Deuteronomy 1:22</a> suggests that the plan to spy out the land originated with the people, with Moses (at God’s behest) acquiescing. At the end of 40 days, they returned. Only Caleb and Joshua urged the people to advance to the conquest; the other 10 spies spoke of foes too formidable for them to defeat. The people, greatly discouraged, attempted to stone Caleb and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Num.14.10">Nm 14:10</a>), and were prevented from doing so only by the sudden appearance of the glory cloud at the tabernacle. God swore in his wrath (<a href="?bref=Num.14.21">Nm 14:21</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-4.10">Heb 3:7–4:10</a>) that, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, none of that generation would enter the land of promise (<a href="?bref=Num.14.21-35">Nm 14:21-35</a>). He then struck down the 10 unbelieving spies (v <a href="?bref=Num.14.37">37</a>). Presumptuously, and in spite of God’s express command to the contrary (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.42">Dt 1:42</a>), Israel attempted to advance on the land, leaving Moses and the ark of the covenant in the camp. They were challenged by the Amalekites and Canaanites.</p>
<p>Israel remained in this general area with tribal families fanning out over the wilderness and settling around springs and oases (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.46">Dt 1:46</a>). <a href="?bref=Num.15.1-21.20">Numbers 15:1–21:20</a> relates the account of the 38 years of wilderness wandering. Much of this time was probably spent around Kadesh-barnea (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.46">Dt 1:46</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.15.1-41">15</a></p>
<p class="fl">Further priestly legislation was given (<a href="?bref=Num.15.1-21">Nm 15:1-21</a>). Also, the procedure to be followed when an Israelite committed a sin deliberately and defiantly was spelled out in terms of excommunication: there was no atonement for such an attitude (vv <a href="?bref=Num.15.22-31">22-31</a>). A Sabbath violator was executed (vv <a href="?bref=Num.15.32-36">32-36</a>), perhaps as an illustration of the foregoing legislation. Finally, to assist them in obeying God’s laws, the Israelites were instructed to tie blue tassels to their outer garments as reminders (vv <a href="?bref=Num.15.37-41">37-41</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">16</a></p>
<p class="fl">Korah challenged Aaron’s high priesthood, and Dathan, Abiram, and On challenged Moses’ leadership (vv <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-14">1-14</a>). God, at Moses’ word, opened up the earth and swallowed the offenders (<a href="?bref=Num.16.32">Nm 16:32</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.9.6">Dt 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.16-18">Ps 106:16-18</a>). Korah is regarded in the NT (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>) as a classic example of a rebellious malcontent.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Num.26.11">Numbers 26:11</a> states that Korah’s young children did not perish with him. Perhaps they became the ancestors of the “sons of Korah,” the sacred musicians of the temple who composed 12 Korahite psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-49.20">Pss 42–49</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-85.13">84–85</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.87.1-88.18">87–88</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.17.1-13">17</a></p>
<p class="fl">God then instructed the leaders of each tribe to bring rods, 12 in all, to write the names of the tribes upon them (with Aaron’s name on Levi’s rod), and to deposit them in the tabernacle. The following day, Aaron’s rod had sprouted with blossoms and ripe almonds, thus vindicating Aaron’s special high-priestly status.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapters <a href="?bref=Num.18.1-19.14">18–19</a></p>
<p class="fl">Further priestly legislation was given. In <a href="?bref=Num.18.1-7">18:1-7</a>, the full responsibility for the priestly service was given to the Aaronic priests—a very natural consequence of the preceding chapter. The Levites were to assist the Aaronic order (v <a href="?bref=Num.18.6">6</a>). Since the tribe of Levi received no land inheritance, they were to be supported from the offerings of the people (vv <a href="?bref=Num.18.8-20">8-20</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Num.19.1-22">19:1-22</a> instructions concerning ceremonial impurity were given. When an Israelite became ceremonially unclean through contact with death (vv <a href="?bref=Num.19.11-16">11-16</a>), God required that he be purified from his sin (vv <a href="?bref=Num.19.9,17">9, 17</a>) by the sprinkling of specially prepared water upon him.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.20.1-29">20</a></p>
<p class="fl">With Israel once again at Kadesh on the southern border of the wilderness of Zin in the first month of the 40th year of wandering, Miriam died and was buried (v <a href="?bref=Num.20.1">1</a>). According to the encampment list in chapter <a href="?bref=Num.33.1-56">33</a>, 18 encampments may have occurred for Israel since the nation had last been at this site (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.33.18-36">33:18-36</a>).</p>
<p>At this time the nation complained once again because there was little water (<a href="?bref=Num.20.2">20:2</a>). Moses, at God’s instruction, brought forth water from a rock (vv <a href="?bref=Num.20.8-11">8-11</a>), but because of a gross infraction by Moses and Aaron on this occasion, God announced that they would not be permitted to lead Israel in the conquest of the land (vv <a href="?bref=Num.20.12,23-24">12, 23-24</a>).</p>
<p>The chapter closes with Edom refusing Israel passage across its territory (vv <a href="?bref=Num.20.14-21">14-21</a>) and Aaron dying on Mt Hor on the border of Edom (vv <a href="?bref=Num.20.22-29">22-29</a>) in the fifth month of the 40th year (<a href="?bref=Num.33.38">33:38</a>). Eleazar, Aaron’s son, assumed the office of high priest.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.21.1-35">21</a></p>
<p class="fl">After a quick victory over Arad (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.1-3">1-3</a>), Israel started south to encircle Edom. Becoming impatient with God and with Moses, the people expressed their disgust with God’s provision of manna. The Lord sent poisonous snakes to the camp, causing many to die. But at God’s command Moses fashioned a snake out of bronze and placed it atop a standard. All who looked to the bronze snake survived (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.4-10">4-10</a>). The bronze snake was preserved and later was destroyed by Hezekiah, the symbol having become by his time an idol (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kgs 18:4</a>). Later still, Jesus drew an analogy between these wicked sinners looking to the bronze snake and being delivered and men looking to him by faith and being saved (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-15">Jn 3:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>Leaving that fateful place, Israel journeyed into and up the Arabah, crossed the Wadi Zered in an eastern swing around Moab, finally crossing the Arnon into Amorite territory. Journeying north, they camped at Pisgah (<a href="?bref=Num.21.10-20">Nm 21:10-20</a>).</p>
<p>At this point the conquest of the Transjordan begins. In quick succession Israel defeated Sihon of Heshbon (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.21-31">21-31</a>) and Og of Bashan (vv <a href="?bref=Num.21.33-35">33-35</a>) and settled in the plains of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1">22:1</a>). This encampment was the scene for the remainder of the activities of Numbers, Deuteronomy, and <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-3.17">Joshua 1–3</a>. In a real sense, one can say the wilderness wanderings were now over.</p>
<p>Here is the place, then, to summarize the spiritual condition of Israel on the eve of the conquest of Canaan. Numbers makes it quite evident that the entire generation that left Egypt, with the exception of Joshua and Caleb, was to die in the wilderness because of its apostasy (cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.5.25">Am 5:25</a>), unbelief, and general failure to keep covenant with God. None of the generation of male children born in the wilderness had been circumcised (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.2-9">Jos 5:2-9</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-17">Psalm 90</a> underscores Israel as the recipient of God’s wrath in the wilderness. It is in this pitiable spiritual condition that Israel arrived on the plains of Moab.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapters <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">22–24</a></p>
<p class="fl">Balak, king of Moab, frightened by Israel’s presence, joined with Midian to hire Balaam, the false prophet, to curse Israel. For gain, Balaam agreed (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.15">2 Pt 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>), but God prevented him, causing him rather to bless Israel in his four oracular utterances (<a href="?bref=Num.23.7-10,18-24">Nm 23:7-10, 18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.3-9,15-19">24:3-9, 15-19</a>) and to predict the destruction of Moab, Edom, Amalek (<a href="?bref=Num.24.20">24:20</a>), the Kenites (<a href="?bref=Num.24.21">24:21</a>), and Asshur (<a href="?bref=Num.24.24">24:24</a>). With that, Balak and Balaam separated. Balaam, in collusion with Midian, agreed to counsel Israel to commit idolatry and immorality (<a href="?bref=Num.31.16">31:16</a>). And so, where Balak failed to turn the Lord against Israel, Balaam succeeded (ch <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">25</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">25</a></p>
<p class="fl">Israel sinned against God by idolatrous and immoral acts with the people of Moab (vv <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-3">1-3</a>). In carrying out the command of God to destroy the reprobate Israelites, Phinehas killed Zimri and Cozbi, the latter being a daughter of one of the five kings of Midian (vv <a href="?bref=Num.25.4-14">4-14</a>). This event provided the occasion for God to declare a holy war against Midian (vv <a href="?bref=Num.25.16-18">16-18</a>; cf. ch <a href="?bref=Num.31.1-54">31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.26.1-65">26</a></p>
<p class="fl">The Lord commanded Moses to take a roll of the men of the second generation who were capable of warring against Israel’s enemies. The total number came to 601,730 (v <a href="?bref=Num.26.51">51</a>), a reduction of 1,820 men from the first count. With a smaller force than the first generation, Israel conquered Canaan, clearly indicating that Israel could have spared itself the years of wandering if only the nation had obeyed God 38 years before Kadesh. The Levites totaled 23,000 males a month old and upward (vv <a href="?bref=Num.26.57-62">57-62</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-23">27</a></p>
<p class="fl">At the request of the daughters of Zelophehad (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.26.33">26:33</a>) that they be granted the right to inherit their father’s possessions since he had no sons, the Lord agreed that they could, using the occasion to give further laws of inheritance (vv <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-11">1-11</a>).</p>
<p>Reminded that he would soon die in Abarim, Moses requested that God appoint his successor. God selected Joshua, and Moses commissioned him (vv <a href="?bref=Num.27.12-23">12-23</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapters <a href="?bref=Num.28.1-30.16">28–30</a></p>
<p class="fl">Further priestly legislation regarding offerings for various occasions was given. God also instructed Moses to inform the people concerning vows. When a man made a vow, it was inviolable (<a href="?bref=Num.30.2">30:2</a>), but if a woman made a vow, the man (father, husband) responsible for her could nullify it if he felt that it was rash (vv <a href="?bref=Num.30.1-16">1-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.31.1-54">31</a></p>
<p class="fl">The account of the holy war declared against Midian in <a href="?bref=Num.25.16-18">25:16-18</a> is given. With Phinehas accompanying 12,000 warriors, Israel defeated Midian, killing Balaam along with the five kings and many male adults of Midian (<a href="?bref=Num.31.1-8">31:1-8</a>). The Midianite women and children were taken captive, but Moses commanded that all the male children and the nonvirgin women be killed (vv <a href="?bref=Num.31.9-18">9-18</a>). One must not conclude that this war meant the end of Midian as such, for Midian later proved a formidable foe of Israel in the time of the judges (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-40">Jgs 6</a>).</p>
<p>After the battle, the warriors were instructed to purify themselves, their clothing, and the booty from the war before coming into the camp (<a href="?bref=Num.31.19-24">Nm 31:19-24</a>). Furthermore, they were instructed to divide the booty in half and to contribute one-fifth of one percent of their half to the high priest (“the Lord’s tribute”). The other half was divided among the people who had remained in camp, after the Levites received a two percent contribution (vv <a href="?bref=Num.31.25-31">25-31</a>).</p>
<p>Verses <a href="?bref=Num.31.32-47">32-47</a> give the tally of the booty after its division into two parts and the amount that was given from each part to Eleazar and the Levites. The tally is said by some to be too high to be authentic, but there is no evidence that disputes the recorded figures.</p>
<p>In thanksgiving to God because no Israelite had been killed in the war (v <a href="?bref=Num.31.49">49</a>) and to make atonement for themselves (v <a href="?bref=Num.31.50">50</a>), the army officers brought a special offering of gold trinkets to Moses and Eleazar, which was placed in the tabernacle as a memorial (vv <a href="?bref=Num.31.48-54">48-54</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">32</a></p>
<p class="fl">At their request and on the condition that they aid the other tribes in the conquest of Canaan, Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh were allotted the Transjordan region. Moses earnestly besought the Lord to change his mind about not permitting him to enter the land of promise (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.23-27">Dt 3:23-27</a>). But God would not let him.</p>
<p class="h3">Chapters <a href="?bref=Num.33.1-34.29">33–34</a></p>
<p class="fl">At God’s command, Moses kept a written record of Israel’s itinerary from Egypt to the plains of Moab. Here is biblical evidence of the Mosaic authorship of Numbers.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the Promised Land were now given. The southern boundary would run from the southern tip of the Dead Sea, south of Kadesh-barnea up to the River of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish), and on to the Mediterranean Sea (<a href="?bref=Num.34.3-5">34:3-5</a>). The western boundary would be the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea itself (v <a href="?bref=Num.34.6">6</a>). The northern boundary, not realized until the times of David and Solomon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3-12">2 Sm 8:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.65">1 Kgs 8:65</a>), was to extend from the Mediterranean Sea east to Hamath, at the head of the Orontes River (<a href="?bref=Num.34.7-9">Nm 34:7-9</a>). The eastern boundary was to be practically on a vertical line, with the Jordan Valley running north to the northern boundary (vv <a href="?bref=Num.34.10-12">10-12</a>). The nine and a half tribes were to divide this area among themselves (vv <a href="?bref=Num.34.13-15">13-15</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord then selected the men who were to bear the responsibility of dividing the land of Canaan among the western tribes after the conquest (vv <a href="?bref=Num.34.16-29">16-29</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.35.1-34">35</a></p>
<p class="fl">God instructed Israel to give 48 cities throughout the land on both sides of the Jordan to the Levites for a permanent possession (vv <a href="?bref=Num.35.1-8">1-8</a>), since that tribe was not included in the land allotments to the other tribes. The number of cities each tribe was to give was to be determined by its size (v <a href="?bref=Num.35.8">8</a>). Six of the Levitical cities, three on each side of the Jordan, were to be designated “cities of refuge” for the manslayer (v <a href="?bref=Num.35.6">6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-9">Jos 20</a>).</p>
<p>Legislation concerning the manslayer follows (vv <a href="?bref=Num.35.9-34">9-34</a>). If the slayer committed murder, the kinsman avenger had the right to fulfill his role as executioner (vv <a href="?bref=Num.35.16-21">16-21</a>). If, however, the killing was unintentional, the manslayer was to flee to the nearest city of refuge for a trial. If found innocent of murder, he was assigned to remain within the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. If he left the city before then, the kinsman avenger was permitted to execute him (vv <a href="?bref=Num.35.22-34">22-34</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Chapter <a href="?bref=Num.36.1-13">36</a></p>
<p class="fl">Basing their question on the earlier law established in chapter <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-23">27</a>, the leaders from Manasseh asked whether an heiress should be allowed to marry outside her tribe, with the accompanying transfer of property from one tribe to another that would ensue. God directed that an heiress would have to marry within her tribe (vv <a href="?bref=Num.36.1-12">1-12</a>).</p>
<p>The last verse of the book refers to all the laws given in the plains of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.26.1-36.12">26:1–36:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.27.34">Lv 27:34</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalTeaching">Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">In the book of Numbers God is revealed as the unchangingly faithful God of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Num.23.19">Nm 23:19</a>). This faithfulness to his covenant required that he both guide and care for his people and punish their sins against him. But no impediment was so great that God’s design to bring his people to the land of promise was thwarted (<a href="?bref=Num.11.23">11:23</a>).</p>
<p>Both by his wrathful reaction to Israel’s sin and by the numerous priestly laws, God highlights his awesome holiness. The legislation expressly teaches that the person who approaches God must be clean. Even to look with unholy eyes upon the holiness of God meant death (<a href="?bref=Num.4.20">4:20</a>).</p>
<p>His sovereignty over all of life is evident from the attention he displays over even the minutest aspects of life. The phrase “And the Lord said unto Moses” occurs over 50 times, and the words that follow in each case deal with all kinds of matters.</p>
<p>As the God of the covenant, God’s “christological” character is also apparent. God’s blessing and faithfulness reflect the christological motif. Finally, Moses’ prophetic leadership (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.37-38">Acts 7:37-38</a>) and intercessory ministry (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.11.2">Nm 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.13">12:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.19">14:19</a>), in the Aaronic priesthood (e.g., ch <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">16</a>), in the animal sacrifices (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.19.9">19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.13">Heb 9:13</a>), and in the symbols (the manna, the water, the bronze snake) foreshadow the future Christ.</p>
<p>In Israel’s responses to God, the people depict all of human sinfulness and faithlessness. Israel’s wanderings illustrate the results of unbelief. The punishments of Israel prove the maxim of <a href="?bref=Num.32.23">Numbers 32:23</a>: “But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Numbers forcefully teaches that safety and blessing are to be found only in trust in the Lord. Only he is capable of bringing men and women to the place of rest (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.9">Heb 4:9</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Son of Antiochus, a Jewish diplomat sent first by Jonathan, and later by Simon the Hasmonean to Rome and Sparta to strengthen alliances. Numenius and Antipater, son of Jason, were warmly received in Sparta, and according to Josephus, a friendly alliance with the Jews was decreed (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13:169-170). The writer of Maccabees said, “What they said we have recorded in our public decrees, as follows, ‘Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, envoys of the Jews, have come to us to renew their friendship with us. It has pleased our people to receive these men with honor and to put a copy of their words in the public archives, so that the people of the Spartans may have a record of them. And they have sent a copy of this to Simon the high priest’ ” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.22-23">1 Macc 14:22-23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Since Jonathan probably died during the mission, the correspondence from Sparta was went to Simon, his successor (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.20-49">1 Macc 14:20ff</a>.). Simon sent Numenius to Rome in 141 <span class="era">BC</span> with a special gift, a gold shield weighing 1,000 pounds (453.6 kilograms) in honor of the new pact. When Numenius returned two years later, he brought with him copies of Lucius’s letters to the surrounding states, in which the Roman council declared friendship for the Jews and forbade the surrounding nations to hurt the Jewish people: “We therefore have decided to write to the kings and countries that they should not seek their harm or make war against them and their cities and their country, or make alliance with those who war against them” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.19">1 Macc 15:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Moreover, the rulers of the surrounding nations were requested to hand over any traitors who had left Judah to seek asylum in another country. The traitors were to be punished in accordance with the Jewish laws. According to Josephus, Numenius made another journey to Rome to strengthen the diplomatic ties during the priesthood of Hyrcanus II.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">NURSE</p>
<p class="fl">A woman who took care of an infant that did not belong to her, or a man who took care of young children. The work was limited to the nursing and caring of an infant. Women usually took care of their own children, such as Sarah (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.7">Gn 21:7</a>) and Hannah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.23">1 Sm 1:23</a>). A wet nurse often became a part of the family circle and had a special place. Rebekah had a nurse, and when she passed away, the woman was even mentioned in the biblical text: “Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.8">Gn 35:8</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Moses’ mother became his nurse, as she was being paid by Pharaoh’s daughter (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.7">Ex 2:7</a>). Royal sons were cared for by nurses, as in the case of Joash, who was hidden with his nurse by Jehosheba his aunt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.2">2 Kgs 11:2</a>). Since Joash was hidden for six years and was seven when he acceded to the throne, Joash was about a year old when he was hidden—and his nurse must have been a wet nurse.</p>
<p>Royal sons received special care and were under the supervision of a nurse after they had been suckled. Children were nursed up to the age of three, and when they were weaned, there was a feast (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.8">Gn 21:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.23-24">1 Sm 1:23-24</a>). Thereafter, a nurse-teacher took charge of the youngster. Mephibosheth was five years old when his nurse fell with him, causing him to be lame (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.4">2 Sm 4:4</a>). Naomi took care of her grandson as a nurse (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.16">Ru 4:16</a>). It is probable that male nurses were used as teachers for the young aristocrats, such as we find in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1">2 Kings 10:1</a>, when it is said that Ahab’s children had tutors (cf. also v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.5">5</a>). In this sense we must understand Moses’ reference to himself, too, as a “nurse”: “Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?” (<a href="?bref=Num.11.12">Nm 11:12</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Paul saw himself, too, as a “nurse” to the church (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.7">1 Thes 2:7</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Town in northeastern Mesopotamia, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) southwest of present-day Kirkuk. In ancient times the site was called Gasur, but the modern name is Yorgan Tepe. Excavations at Yorgan Tepe were carried out from 1925 to 1931 by an expedition of a number of cooperating archaeologists who made many interesting finds. But Yorgan Tepe is best known for its clay tablets, which primarily deal with business transactions.</p>
<p>In the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span> the population of Gasur was largely Semitic, but by the middle of the second millennium, the inhabitants were Hurrians, and the name of the city had been changed from Gasur to Nuzi. The Hurrians are identified as the Horites of the Bible (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.14.6">Gn 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.20-21">36:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.12,22">Dt 2:12, 22</a>).</p>
<p>Many clay tablets of the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span> were unearthed, including one tablet inscribed with a map regarded as the oldest map in the world. The records also show that installment buying was practiced even then.</p>
<p>In the 15th to 14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, Hurrian scribes wrote on thousands of clay tablets, mostly in the Babylonian language. These records provide much information about Near Eastern customs and legal practices, and shed light on the patriarchal period of the Bible.</p>
<p>The following examples may serve as illustrations of possible relationships between Nuzi and the Bible. In Nuzi a childless wife could give her handmaid to her husband so that the maid could bear children in the name of the wife. This practice was followed by Sarai, who gave her maid, Hagar, to her husband, Abram (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-4">Gn 16:1-4</a>); by Rachel, who gave Bilhah to Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-8">30:1-8</a>); and by Leah, who gave Zilpah to Jacob (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.30.9-13">9-13</a>). In such a case, the father had a responsibility to rear the child as the offspring of his legal wife, and the wife could not drive away the child. According to this rule, Sarai had no right to drive out Hagar’s son, Ishmael (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.16.4-6">16:4-6</a>).</p>
<p>In Nuzi there was a law against the sale of property outside one’s own family. Several schemes were employed to circumvent this prohibition, including adoption and the exchange of property. In return for a guarantee of lifelong care and burial costs, a wealthy landowner would have himself “adopted” by landholding peasants so that he received their property. The records indicate that the very same man could be adopted by 300 or 400 peasants. A couple without children could legally adopt someone to provide for them in their old age and for their burial. The adopted person would be the heir to the property of his adopting parents; this may have been the relationship between Abram and his servant Eliezer (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2">Gn 15:2</a>). One could also exchange property of little value for valuable property. In some instances, the difference in value could be made up in money. At Nuzi a man named Tehip-tilla sold his inheritance rights in a grove to his brother, Kurpazah, in exchange for three sheep, paralleling Esau’s sale of his birthright to Jacob for a serving of stew (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.27-34">25:27-34</a>).</p>
<p>In Nuzi an oral will or blessing given on one’s deathbed was legally binding and irrevocable. A man named Huya was lying on his sickbed at the point of death. He took the hand of his son, Tarmiya, and gave to him a woman, Sululi-Ishtar, to be his wife. Tarmiya’s two brothers challenged his claim in court, but the court recognized the validity of Tarmiya’s case. Although Jacob obtained the blessing of his blind and aged father by deception, Isaac had to stand by what he had done (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.33">Gn 27:33</a>).</p>
<p>The Nuzi tablets also indicate that the person who had possession of the teraphim, or household gods, was the heir to the property of the owner of the idols. For this reason, Rachel took the teraphim of her father Laban (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.19">Gn 31:19</a>), who was very disturbed over their disappearance (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.31.30-35">30-35</a>).</p>
<p>Another case of adoption parallels the relationship between Jacob and Laban. Nashwi adopted Wullu and gave his daughter, Nuhuya, to him in marriage. If Wullu married another wife, he would have to forfeit the property he had received from Nashwi. Laban also made a covenant with Jacob that he would not take a wife other than Laban’s two daughters, Leah and Rachel (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.50">Gn 31:50</a>).</p>
