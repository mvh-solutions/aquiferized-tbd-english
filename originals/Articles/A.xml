<p class="h1">AARON</p>
<p class="fl">Moses’ brother and Israel’s first high priest. In the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, Aaron was Moses’ spokesman and assistant during the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt. Aaron was three years older than Moses and was 83 when they first confronted the pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.7">Ex 7:7</a>). Their sister, Miriam (<a href="?bref=Num.26.59">Nm 26:59</a>), must have been the eldest child, old enough to carry messages when the infant Moses was found by the pharaoh’s daughter (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.1-9">Ex 2:1-9</a>). Aaron’s mother was Jochebed and his father was Amram, a descendant of the Kohath family of Levi’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.18-20">Ex 6:18-20</a>).</p>
<p>Aaron and his wife, Elisheba, had four sons (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23">Ex 6:23</a>), who were to follow him in the priesthood (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.5">Lv 1:5</a>). Two of them, Nadab and Abihu, violated God’s instructions by performing a sacrilegious act while burning incense and were burned to death as a result (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-5">Lv 10:1-5</a>). The priesthood was then passed on through the other two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, who also sometimes failed to carry out God’s instructions precisely (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.6-20">10:6-20</a>).</p>
<p>Aaron’s prominence in the events of the exodus arose partly from the fact that he was Moses’ brother. When Moses tried to avoid becoming Israel’s leader on the grounds of having a speech impediment, Aaron’s ability as a speaker was recognized and used by God (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.10-16">Ex 4:10-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="EventsofAaronsLife">Events of Aaron’s Life</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew people were slaves in Egypt at the beginning of Aaron’s life. Raised as an Egyptian by one of the pharaoh’s daughters, Moses had fled into the Midian Desert after killing a cruel Egyptian taskmaster (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.1-2.25">Ex 1–2</a>). When God sent Moses back as a liberator (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4.31">3–4</a>), he also sent Aaron out to meet Moses in the desert (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.27">4:27</a>). Moses was a stranger to his people after so many years of exile, so Aaron made contact with Israel’s elders for him (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.29-31">4:29-31</a>). When Moses and Aaron went to see the pharaoh, God told the Egyptian monarch through the two of them to let the Israelites go (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.1">Ex 5:1</a>). When the pharaoh made life even more miserable for the Hebrew slaves, God began to show his power to the Egyptian ruler through a series of miracles (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.5.1-12.51">5–12</a>). God performed the first three miracles through Aaron, using a rod (probably a shepherd’s staff). The pharaoh had his palace sorcerers do similar tricks. After God brought a plague of gnats (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “lice”) over all Egypt, the Egyptian magicians admitted defeat and said, “This is the finger of God!” (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.19">Ex 8:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Then God brought on more plagues through Moses, culminating in the deaths of all the Egyptians’ firstborn sons. Aaron was with Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-28">12:1-28</a>) when God revealed how he would “pass over” the properly marked homes of the Israelites, sparing their children on the night the Egyptian children died. That event was the origin of the Passover feast still observed by Jews today (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.1-16">13:1-16</a>).</p>
<p>After God led the Israelites to safety and destroyed the pursuing Egyptians, Aaron participated with Moses in governing the people on their long wilderness journey to the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.1-6">Ex 16:1-6</a>). Later, battling against Amalek’s army, Aaron helped hold up Moses’ weary arms in prayer to maintain God’s blessing (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">17:8-16</a>). Although always subordinate to Moses, Aaron seems to have been recognized as an important leader (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.12">18:12</a>). God summoned him to be with Moses when God gave the law on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.24">19:24</a>). Aaron was among the representatives of the people who ratified God’s statutes in the Book of the Covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-8">24:1-8</a>). Aaron went with those leaders partway up the holy mountain and saw the vision of the God of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.9-10">24:9-10</a>). With Hur, he was left in charge when Moses was with God on the mountaintop (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.24.13-14">13-14</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AaronThePriest"/>
<p>Moses was gone for over a month, and in a moment of weakness, Aaron gave in to the people’s request for an idol to worship. He melted down their gold ornaments to make a golden image of a calf (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-4">Ex 32:1-4</a>). (The Israelites had probably been influenced in Egypt by the cult of Apis, a fertility god in the form of a bull.) At first, Aaron seemed to think he might be doing something acceptable to God (v <a href="?bref=Exod.32.5">5</a>), but things got out of hand and a drunken sex orgy took place around the idol (v <a href="?bref=Exod.32.6">6</a>). God was angry enough to destroy the people, but Moses interceded, reminding God of his promise to multiply Abraham’s descendants (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.7-14">Ex 32:7-14</a>). Moses furiously confronted Aaron about the immorality and idolatry, which Aaron blamed on the people without admitting any guilt of his own (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.32.21-24">21-24</a>). Although the idolators were punished by death (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.25-28">Ex 32:25-28</a>) and the whole camp by a plague (v <a href="?bref=Exod.32.35">35</a>), Aaron was evidently not punished. In a retelling of the events, Moses said that Aaron was in great danger but was spared because he had prayed for him (<a href="?bref=Deut.9.20">Dt 9:20</a>).</p>
<p>In their second year of nomadic wilderness life, Aaron helped Moses carry out a census (<a href="?bref=Num.1.1-3,17-18">Nm 1:1-3, 17-18</a>). Eventually, Aaron may have become jealous of Moses’ position of leadership, for Miriam and Aaron began to slander their brother, even though the elderly Moses was by then more humble than any man on earth (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-4">Nm 12:1-4</a>). God’s anger toward the two was averted by Moses’ prayer, although Miriam did suffer for her sin (<a href="?bref=Num.12.5-15">12:5-15</a>). Aaron again seems to have escaped punishment entirely. With Moses, Aaron opposed a rebellion at Kadesh (<a href="?bref=Num.14.1-5">14:1-5</a>). He stood with Moses against a later revolt (ch <a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">16</a>). After a final incident at Meribah, where the Israelites almost revolted again, God accused Moses and Aaron of having failed to take him at his word and denied them entry into the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1-12">20:1-12</a>). Aaron died at the age of 123 on Mt Hor, after Moses had removed his elaborate priestly garments and put them on Aaron’s son Eleazar (<a href="?bref=Num.20.23-29">Nm 20:23-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.38-39">33:38-39</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">AARON’S ROD*</p>
<p class="fl">Staff belonging to Moses’ brother, Aaron, symbolizing the two brothers’ authority in Israel. When the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, a threat against Moses and Aaron’s leadership was led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram (<a href="?bref=Num.16.1-40">Nm 16:1-40</a>). In spite of the Lord’s destruction of those rebels and their followers, the rest of the people of Israel turned against Moses and Aaron, saying that they had killed the people of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Num.16.41">16:41</a>). In order to restore respect for the divinely appointed leadership, the Lord told Moses to collect a rod from each tribe and have the leader of the tribe write his name on it. Aaron was told to write his name on the rod of Levi. The rods were placed in the inner room of the tabernacle, in front of the ark (of the covenant). In the morning, Aaron’s rod had sprouted blossoms and had produced ripe almonds. The rod was then kept there as a continual sign to Israel that the Lord had established the authority of Moses and Aaron (<a href="?bref=Num.17.1-11">Nm 17:1-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.4">Heb 9:4</a>).</p>
<p>Following that incident the people of Israel entered the wilderness of Zin, but there was no water for them and their flocks. Again the people argued with Moses and Aaron. The Lord instructed Moses to get the rod and, in the presence of Aaron and the rest of the people, command a particular rock to bring forth water. Taking the rod, Moses asked dramatically, “Must we bring you water from this rock?” (<a href="?bref=Num.20.10">Nm 20:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>) and struck the rock twice. Water gushed out and the people drank. Yet Moses and Aaron were forbidden to enter the Promised Land because they did not sanctify the Lord in the people’s eyes (<a href="?bref=Num.20.12-13">Nm 20:12-13</a>). An earlier event had provided evidence that the Lord was able to provide needed water in that manner (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1-7">Ex 17:1-7</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Hebrew word that means “place of destruction.” The word occurs six times in the OT, generally referring to the place of the dead (<a href="?bref=Job.26.6">Jb 26:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.28.22">28:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.31.12">31:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.11">Ps 88:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.15.11">Prv 15:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.20">27:20</a>). It serves as a synonym for Sheol and is variously translated “hell,” “death,” “the grave,” or “destruction.” The same Hebrew word occurs once in the NT in its Greek equivalent, Apollyon (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">Rv 9:11</a>). Here the idea of destruction is personified as the “angel from the bottomless pit,” so the word is often translated “destroyer.” Abaddon (or Apollyon) was the angel reigning over the realm of the dead, who appeared after the fifth trumpet in John’s vision (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1">Rv 9:1</a>).</p>

<p>Abel’s older brother, Cain, was engaged in agriculture, but Abel himself was a shepherd. When both brothers brought offerings, God accepted Abel’s animal sacrifice but rejected Cain’s vegetable offering. As a result, Cain became jealous of Abel and killed him.</p>
<p>The narrative indicates that Abel’s character was more worthy of God’s blessing; hence his offering was accepted and Cain’s was not (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.7">Gn 4:7</a>). There is no scriptural evidence that cereal or vegetable offerings were less effective as either sin offerings or fellowship meals than offerings involving the shedding of blood, since in later Mosaic law both were prescribed.

<p class="h1">ABIATHAR</p>
<p class="fl">One of two high priests during the reign of King David. The other high priest was Zadok, who evidently was appointed by David after his conquest of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Only Abiathar escaped when the priestly families at Nob were massacred at the instigation of King Saul. The priests of Nob had given food and Goliath’s sword to David during his escape from the wrath of Saul, thus earning Saul’s hatred (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-22.23">1 Sm 21–22</a>). When Abiathar joined David he brought the ephod, which David then used in determining the will of God (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.6,9-11">1 Sm 23:6, 9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.7-8">30:7-8</a>). Abiathar was one of the first persons from Saul’s administration to support David. His support was formidable because he represented the priesthood of the old tribal league of the line of Eli.</p>
<p>During the last days of David’s kingship, his sons struggled for the throne. The two major rivals were Adonijah and Solomon. Abiathar the high priest supported Adonijah’s claim to the throne, probably because Adonijah was David’s oldest living heir and because David’s general Joab, one of the strongest men in the kingdom, supported Adonijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-7">1 Kgs 1:5-7</a>). Zadok supported Solomon, who actually succeeded David on the throne. Having fallen out of favor with the new king, Abiathar was banished to his estate in Anathoth (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">1 Kgs 2:26-27</a>), a village about four miles (6.4 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem. </p>
<p>The relationship of Abiathar to Ahimelech is confusing. Ahimelech could have been the name of both Abiathar’s father (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.20">1 Sm 22:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.23.6">23:6</a>) and son (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sm 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.16">1 Chr 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.6">24:6</a>). If each of the references was to the same Ahimelech, then the names were reversed in the later passages. In the NT, Abiathar is mentioned as the high priest when David came to Nob needing food and weapons (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.26">Mk 2:26</a>). The OT account says that Ahimelech was the priest at that time (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-2">1 Sm 21:1-2</a>). The apparent discrepancy may have resulted from a copyist’s error or from the fact that Abiathar as high priest was more prominent than Ahimelech.</p>

<p class="h1">ABIGAIL</p>
<p class="list">1. Nabal’s wife, who later became the wife of David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.2-42">1 Sm 25:2-42</a>). Nabal was a wealthy sheep owner whose holdings had been protected by David’s men. When David requested provisions in return for that protection, Nabal refused. Enraged, David set out with 400 armed men to destroy Nabal and his house. Abigail had been informed of her husband’s behavior and met David with many provisions, taking the blame for her foolish husband. David thanked God for using Abigail to restrain his anger.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Nabal woke from a drunken stupor the next morning and learned what had happened, he had a stroke from which he died 10 days later. Abigail then married David and shared his adventurous life among the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.3">1 Sm 27:3</a>). She was captured by the Amalekites and rescued by David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-19">1 Sm 30:1-19</a>). Abigail went with David to Hebron when he became king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.2">2 Sm 2:2</a>), and she bore his second son, Chileab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.3">2 Sm 3:3</a>), also called Daniel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1">1 Chr 3:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. David’s sister, who married Jether and gave birth to Amasa (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.16-17">1 Chr 2:16-17</a>). There appears to be confusion as to the ancestry of this Abigail. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.13-17">1 Chronicles 2:13-17</a> she is listed as a daughter of Jesse. However, in <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.25">2 Samuel 17:25</a>, her father is identified as Nahash. The discrepancy could be due to scribal error, or Nahash may be another name for Jesse, or the widow of Nahash could have married Jesse.</p>

<p class="fl">Rehoboam’s son and successor as king of Judah, 913–910 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.10">1 Chr 3:10</a>; alternately called “Abijah” in <a href="?bref=2Chr.11.18-22">2 Chr 11:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.16">12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.1-22">13:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.14.1">14:1</a>). A major focus of Abijam’s reign was his war with King Jeroboam I of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.1-3">2 Chr 13:1-3</a>). Before a decisive battle, Abijam stood on Mt Zemaraim and shouted condemnation of Jeroboam’s political divisiveness and religious idolatry (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.4-12">2 Chr 13:4-12</a>). Abijam and his army then prayed for God’s help in their precarious military position. Against two-to-one odds, they fought their way out of an ambush and won a stunning victory over Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.13-19">2 Chr 13:13-19</a>). Abijam’s reign in the southern kingdom of Judah was summed up rather unfavorably in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.1-8">1 Kings 15:1-8</a>: “He committed the same sins as his father before him, and his heart was not right with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of his ancestor David had been” (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3">3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). But God had promised to keep David’s descendants on the throne in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.36">1 Kgs 11:36</a>), so Abijam’s son Asa succeeded him. Being of David’s line, Abijam was an ancestor of Jesus, the Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.7">Mt 1:7</a>, “Abijah”).</p>

<p class="h1">ABIMELECH</p>
<p class="fl">Royal title for Philistine rulers, similar to the designation “pharaoh” among the Egyptians and “agag” among the Amalekites.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. King of Gerar in Abraham’s time. At Gerar, a city a few miles south of Gaza, Abraham presented his wife as his sister out of fear for his life (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">Gn 20:1-18</a>), as he had once done in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.10-20">Gn 12:10-20</a>). Because of this, Sarah was taken into Abimelech’s harem. But Abimelech was warned by God in a dream not to come near her on pain of death because she was a married woman, so she was restored to her husband. The same Abimelech and Abraham later entered into a treaty to clarify water rights in the Negev Desert at Beersheba (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.22-34">Gn 21:22-34</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. King of Gerar in Isaac’s time. Isaac, too, passed off his wife, Rebekah, as his sister at Gerar. Abimelech, perhaps remembering the near judgment on his predecessor, acted decisively to protect Rebekah’s integrity. He proclaimed a death penalty on any who touched her or her husband (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.1-11">Gn 26:1-11</a>). Abimelech asked Isaac to leave Philistine territory because of overcrowding and continuing dispute over water (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.12-22">Gn 26:12-22</a>). Eventually, at Beersheba, Isaac and Abimelech ended their hostility by renewing the treaty made by Abraham and the earlier Abimelech (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.26-33">Gn 26:26-33</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Gideon’s son by a concubine in Shechem (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.31">Jgs 8:31</a>). After his father’s death, Abimelech conspired with his mother’s family to assassinate his 70 half brothers. Only one of them, Jotham, escaped (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.1-5">Jgs 9:1-5</a>). In Abimelech’s third year of rule, he cruelly suppressed a rebellion (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.22-49">Jgs 9:22-49</a>). Eventually his skull was crushed by a millstone thrown down by a woman on a tower. Abimelech ordered his armor bearer to kill him with a sword so that no one could say he had been killed by a woman (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.53-57">Jgs 9:53-57</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ABNER</p>
<p class="fl">Ner’s son and Saul’s cousin. Abner was commander of Saul’s army (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.50">1 Sm 14:50</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.55">17:55</a>). Highly respected by Saul, he even ate at the king’s table together with David and Jonathan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.25">1 Sm 20:25</a>).</p>
<p>Five years after Saul’s death, Abner made Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, king over Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-9">2 Sm 2:8-9</a>). War between Ishbosheth and David, who then was king over Judah, lasted for two years. Abner was in command of Ish-bosheth’s army, Joab of David’s, in a series of skirmishes. David’s position was generally stronger, but Abner became a powerful figure among Saul’s followers.</p>
<p>Although only the king had a right to sexual relationships with the previous king’s concubines, Abner slept with Saul’s concubine Rizpah, perhaps planning to take over the kingdom himself at the first opportunity. When Ishbosheth rebuked him, Abner became so angry that he broke with Ishbosheth and came to terms with David. David showed him great respect, and in return, Abner promised to bring the whole of Israel over to David. Joab, however, feared Abner’s influence with the king and killed him, claiming revenge for the death of his brother at Abner’s hand in battle. Abner was honored with a public funeral and mourning, an honor given only to a ruler or great leader. King David wept aloud at the tomb, and even the people wept with him (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.7-34">2 Sm 3:7-34</a>). David condemned Joab for murdering Abner.</p>

  <title>Abomination</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ABOMINATION</p>
<p class="fl">Repugnant or detestable act, person, or thing. The idea of abomination derives from the specific demands God’s holiness makes upon his people. Adjectives frequently used for abominations in the OT are “abhorrent,” “loathsome,” “unclean,” and “rejected.”</p>
<p>Of the four major Hebrew words translated “abomination,” the one most frequently used indicates violation of an established custom or ritual that, in turn, brings the judgment of God. Examples range from defective sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.1">Dt 17:1</a>) to magic and divination (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.12">Dt 18:12</a>) or idolatrous practices (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.3">2 Kgs 16:3</a>). A second Hebrew word refers to the meat of certain kinds of animals that was ritually defiling, whether touched or eaten (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.10-13">Lv 11:10-13</a>). A third word designates three-day-old sacrificial meat (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.18">Lv 7:18</a>). A fourth word refers almost exclusively to idolatrous objects of pagan origin (<a href="?bref=Jer.4.1">Jer 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.30">7:30</a>). Apart from the specialized usage of “abomination of desolation,” the Greek word for “abomination” is used infrequently in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.15">Lk 16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.22">Rom 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.16">Ti 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.4-5">Rv 17:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.8,27">21:8, 27</a>) and is translated by many English words. The primary connotation is anything that is abhorrent to a holy God.</p>

<p class="h1">ABRAHAM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Bible’s most significant personalities, whom God called from the city of Ur to become patriarch of God’s own people.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="AbramsJourneytoCanaan"/>
<p>Abraham’s name was originally Abram, meaning “[the] father is exalted.” When he was given that name by his parents, they were probably participants in the moon cult of Ur, so the father deity suggested in his old name could have been the moon god or another pagan deity. God changed Abram’s name to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5">Gn 17:5</a>), partly, no doubt, to indicate a clear-cut separation from pagan roots. The new name, interpreted by the biblical text as meaning “father of a multitude,” was also a statement of God’s promise to Abraham that he would have many descendants, as well as a significant test of his faith in God—since he was 99 years old at the time and his childless wife was 90 (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.30">Gn 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-4,17">17:1-4, 17</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="AbrahamsLife">Abraham’s Life</p>
<p class="fl">The story of Abram begins in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-32">Genesis 11</a>, where his family relationships are recorded (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.26-32">Gn 11:26-32</a>). Terah, Abram’s father, was named after the moon deity worshiped at Ur. Terah had three sons, Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran, the father of Lot, died before the family left Ur. Terah took Lot, Abram, and Abram’s wife, Sarai, from Ur to go to Canaan but settled at the city of Haran (v <a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">31</a>). It is stated in <a href="?bref=Acts.7.2-4">Acts 7:2-4</a> that Abraham heard the call of God to leave for a new land while he was still in Ur.</p>
<p>A note of major importance to the course of Abram’s life is found in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.30">Genesis 11:30</a>: “Sarai was not able to have any children” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The problem of Sarai’s barrenness provided the basis for great crises of faith, promise, and fulfillment in the lives of Abram and Sarai.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AbrahamTheFriendOfGod"/>
<p>After Terah’s death, God told Abram, “Leave your country, your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you.” This command was the basis of a “covenant,” in which God promised to make Abram the founder of a new nation in that new land (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Abram, trusting God’s promise, left Haran at the age of 74. Entering Canaan, he went first to Shechem, an important Canaanite royal city between Mt Gerizim and Mt Ebal. Near the oak of Moreh, a Canaanite shrine, God appeared to him (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.7">12:7</a>). Abram built an altar at Shechem, then moved to the vicinity of Bethel and again built an altar to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.8">12:8</a>). The expression “to call on the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) means more than just to pray. Rather, Abram made a proclamation, declaring the reality of God to the Canaanites in their centers of false worship. Later Abram moved to Hebron by the oaks of Mamre, where again he built an altar to worship God. Another blessing given in a vision (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.1">15:1</a>) led Abram to exclaim that he was still childless and that Eliezer of Damascus was his heir (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2">15:2</a>). Discovery of the Nuzi documents has helped to clarify that otherwise obscure statement. According to Hurrian custom, a childless couple of station and substance would adopt an heir. Often a slave, the heir would be responsible for the burial and mourning of his adoptive parents. If a son should be born after the adoption of a slave-heir, the natural son would of course supplant him. Thus God’s response to Abram’s question is directly to the point: “No, your servant will not be your heir, for you will have a son of your own to inherit everything I am giving you” (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.4">Gn 15:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). God then made a covenant with Abram insuring an heir, a nation, and the land.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AbrahamSBosom"/>
<p>Abram was 86 years old when Ishmael was born. When Abram was 99, the Lord appeared to the aged patriarch and again reaffirmed his covenant promise of a son and blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">Gn 17</a>). Circumcision was added as the seal of covenantal relationship (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14">17:9-14</a>), and at that point the names Abram and Sarai were changed to Abraham and Sarah (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5,15">17:5, 15</a>). Abraham’s response to the promise of another son was to laugh: “Then Abraham bowed down to the ground, but he laughed to himself in disbelief. ‘How could I become a father at the age of one hundred?’ he wondered. ‘Besides, Sarah is ninety; how could she have a baby?’ ” (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">Gn 17:17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">Genesis 18</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">19</a> recount the total destruction of two cities of the Jordan plain, Sodom and Gomorrah. Chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">18</a> begins with three individuals seeking comfort in the heat of the day. Abraham offered refreshment and a meal to his guests. They turned out to be no ordinary travelers, however, but the Angel of the Lord along with two other angels (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-2">18:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1">19:1</a>). There is reason to believe that the Angel of the Lord was God himself (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.17,33">18:17, 33</a>). Another announcement of a promised son made Sarah laugh in unbelief and then deny having laughed (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.12-15">18:12-15</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-34">Genesis 21</a> to <a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">23</a> form the climax of the story of Abraham. At long last, when Abraham was 100 years old and his wife 90, “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> did exactly what he had promised” (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1">Gn 21:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The joy of the aged couple on the birth of their long-promised son could not be contained. Both Abraham and Sarah had laughed in unbelief in the days of promise; now they laughed in joy as God had “the last laugh.” The baby, born at the time God promised, was named Isaac (“he laughs!”). Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter! All who hear about this will laugh with me” (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.6">Gn 21:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The laughter over Isaac’s birth subsided entirely in the test of Abraham’s faith described in chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-24">22</a>, God’s command to sacrifice Isaac. Only when one has experienced vicariously with Abraham the long 25 years of God’s promise of a son can one imagine the trauma of such a supreme test. Just as the knife was about to fall, and only then, did the angel of God break the silence of heaven with the call, “Abraham!” (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.11">22:11</a>). The name of promise, “father of a multitude,” took on its most significant meaning when Abraham’s son was spared and the test was explained: “I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld even your beloved son from me” (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.12">Gn 22:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Those words were coupled with a promise implicit in the discovery of a ram caught in the thicket. The Lord provided an alternative sacrifice, a substitute. The place was named “the Lord will provide.” Christian believers generally see the whole episode as looking ahead to God’s provision of his only Son, Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.</p>

  <title>Absalom</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ABSALOM</p>
<p class="fl">Son of King David and his wife Maacah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.3">2 Sm 3:3</a>). The name is also spelled Abishalom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.2,10">1 Kgs 15:2, 10</a>). Absalom was a handsome young prince who was noted for his long, full hair (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.25-26">2 Sm 14:25-26</a>). He had a beautiful sister, Tamar, who was raped by their half brother Amnon. After dishonoring Tamar, Amnon refused to marry her (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.1-20">2 Sm 13:1-20</a>).</p>
<p>Absalom took his dejected sister into his own house, expecting his father, David, to punish Amnon for his incestuous act. After two years of suppressed rage and hatred, Absalom plotted his own revenge. He gave a feast for King David and his princes at his country estate. Although David did not attend, Amnon did and was murdered by Absalom’s servants after Absalom got him drunk. Then, afraid of King David’s anger, Absalom fled across the Jordan River to King Talmai of Geshur, his mother’s father (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.21-39">2 Sm 13:21-39</a>).</p>
<p>After three years in exile, Absalom was called back to Jerusalem through the efforts of David’s general, Joab, and a wise woman from Tekoa. After two years he was back in full favor with the king (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.1-33">2 Sm 14</a>), and in that position he began to maneuver himself to gain the throne. He put on an impressive public relations campaign, in the process undermining confidence in his father, the king (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-6">2 Sm 15:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>Eventually, Absalom plotted a rebellion against David, gathering supporters in Hebron from all over Israel. After Ahithophel, one of David’s wisest counselors, joined Absalom, the prince announced his own kingship. By the time news of Absalom’s conspiracy reached him, David was unable to do anything but flee from Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-37">2 Sm 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.3.1-8">Ps 3</a>).</p>
<p>Absalom arrived in Jerusalem without a struggle, and Ahithophel asked permission to attack David immediately with 12,000 troops. But Hushai, David’s secret agent in Absalom’s court, advised Absalom instead to take the time to mobilize the entire nation against David. He also used flattery, suggesting that Absalom himself should lead the attack. Absalom preferred Hushai’s advice, and Ahithophel out of desperation committed suicide. Meanwhile, Hushai sent word of Absalom’s plans to David by two priests, Zadok and Abiathar. With this information, David crossed the Jordan and camped at Mahanaim (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1-17.29">2 Sm 16–17</a>).</p>
<p>Absalom led his forces across the Jordan to do battle in the forest of Ephraim. David’s loyal forces were under the able generalship of Joab, Abishai, and Ittai the Gittite, who routed Absalom’s forces. Absalom himself fled on a mule, but his long hair got caught in the branches of an oak tree, and he was left dangling helplessly. Joab, leading his men in pursuit, came upon Absalom and killed him. Joab’s men threw the body in a pit and piled stones on it (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-18">2 Sm 18:1-18</a>). Absalom’s death stunned David, who had given explicit orders to keep Absalom from harm. David moaned: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I could have died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son!” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.33">2 Sm 18:33</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In his excessive grief, David took no notice that a serious rebellion had been crushed until Joab reminded him that David’s followers had risked their lives for him (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.1-8">2 Sm 19:1-8</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=David_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">David</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Member of Judah’s tribe who kept some of the spoils from the Israelite victory at Jericho in violation of Joshua’s order and God’s command (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-7.1">Jos 6:1–7:1</a>). A subsequent Israelite defeat at Ai, a weaker city than Jericho, revealed God’s anger to Joshua. With God’s help, Joshua determined which of the Israelites had been guilty of disobedience. Achan confessed that he had buried a robe and some gold and silver from Jericho in his tent (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.20-22">Jos 7:20-22</a>). The recovered loot was taken to the valley of Achor (meaning “trouble,” “calamity”), where Achan and his family were stoned. In the Hebrew text, <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.7">1 Chronicles 2:7</a> gives Achan’s name as Achar (“disaster”) because he “brought disaster on Israel by taking plunder that had been set apart for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">ACRA*</p>
<p class="fl">Citadel of Jerusalem during the Seleucid and Hasmonean periods. The citadel was located on a high point near the temple. An exceptionally strong fortress, the Acra housed the garrison and controlled the city throughout the Maccabean wars. The Seleucid government considered the Acra a royal stronghold to be administered separately from the rest of Judea. At times, one armed force held the Acra and its opponent held the city itself, so that the fortress almost became an independent city. Josephus made mention of two forts called Acra. The earlier citadel was captured by Antiochus III in 198 <span class="era">BC</span>. That Acra must be identical with the temple fortress of the Persian and Ptolemaic periods, the “castle” of <a href="?bref=Neh.7.2">Nehemiah 7:2</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The site later became the fortress called Antonia in the Roman period.</p>
<p>A new citadel, the Acra proper, was later built by the Seleucids. Antiochus IV Epiphanes (ruled 175–164 <span class="era">BC</span>), after a humiliating defeat in Alexandria by the Romans, decided to abolish all Jewish worship practices. In 167 <span class="era">BC</span>, he violated the most sacred Jewish laws by constructing an altar to the Greek god Zeus in the temple at Jerusalem and perhaps by sacrificing a pig on it (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.20-64">1 Macc 1:20-64</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.1-6">2 Macc 6:1-6</a>). The next year Antiochus sent a garrison to build the Acra and maintain his religious reforms, primarily to see that no aspect of the Jewish religion was practiced in the city. The Acra also served as a storehouse for food and loot plundered from the city. The Jews considered it “an ambush against the sanctuary, an evil adversary of Israel continually” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.36">1 Macc 1:36</a>).</p>
<p>Josephus reported that Simon, the second of the Maccabean brothers, captured the Acra in 142 <span class="era">BC</span> and spent three years leveling both the fort and the hill on which it stood. Josephus’s account is questioned, however, because other accounts mention Simon as ritually cleansing the citadel and using it to maintain the city’s security (see <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.13.50">1 Macc 13:50</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.37">14:37</a>).</p>

<p>The temple of Aphrodite on the summit was unjustly notorious in antiquity. The geographer Strabo (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 20) said that 1,000 prostitutes served at the temple during Greece’s golden age. The Athenians may have perpetuated the myth of Corinthian licentiousness. “Not every man’s ship is bound for Corinth” was a common saying among the ancient Greeks. Modern scholars tend to discount Strabo’s statement, though it still influences interpretation of Paul’s letters to the Corinthians. It is possible that the Corinthians were no less moral than the residents of other cities of mainland Greece. Even Strabo could find only a small temple of Aphrodite, of which there are virtually no archaeological remains.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Acts does not state clearly who its writer is, but the general consensus is that Luke was its author.</p>
<p>Early church tradition from the second century states that Acts (as well as the third Gospel) was written by a traveling companion and fellow worker of the apostle Paul. That companion is identified in <a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Colossians 4:14</a> as “Luke, the beloved physician” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>) and mentioned among Paul’s coworkers (<a href="?bref=Col.4.10-17">Col 4:10-17</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">2 Tm 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>).</p>
<p>Strong support for the tradition that the author of Acts was a companion of Paul comes from the second half of the book recounting Paul’s ministry. There, several narratives are told in the first person plural:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. “That night Paul had a vision. He saw a man from Macedonia in northern Greece, pleading with him, ‘Come over here and help us.’ So we decided to leave for Macedonia at once, for we could only conclude that God was calling us to preach the Good News there” (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.9-10">16:9-10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="list">2. “They went ahead and waited for us at Troas . . . we boarded a ship at Philippi in Macedonia and five days later arrived in Troas, where we stayed a week” (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.5-6">20:5-6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="list">3. “When the time came, we set sail for Italy” (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1">27:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="sp">These “we” sections (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.9-18">16:9-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.5-21.18">20:5–21:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-28.16">27:1–28:16</a>) sound like part of a travel narrative or diary written by an eyewitness who accompanied Paul from Troas to Philippi on his second missionary journey; from Philippi to Miletus on the third; from Miletus to Jerusalem; and from Caesarea to Rome. Since the style and vocabulary of these travel narratives resemble those of the rest of the book, it is highly probably that the diarist was also the author of the entire book.</p>
<p>The sophisticated literary style and polished use of the Greek language in the book, as well as the fact that it is addressed to someone called Theophilus (possibly a high-ranking Roman official), provide strong support for the tradition that Luke was a gentile convert to Christianity. His consistent and frequent use of the Greek OT may indicate that he had been a gentile “God-fearer” before conversion to the new faith.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginDestination">Date, Origin, Destination</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="KeyPlacesinActs"/>
<p class="fl">The question of the date and place of the origin of Acts continues to be debated. There are no clear indications in the book itself. With regard to its destination, however, Luke did not leave any doubt. In the opening verse he addresses a certain Theophilus, to whom he had already written an earlier book about the life of Jesus. There can be no doubt that he was referring to the work we know as the Gospel of Luke. In the preface to that Gospel (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-4">Lk 1:1-4</a>), Luke clearly stated his purpose for writing and addressed his account to the “most honorable Theophilus.” It is not clear who that person was. Some interpreters think that Theophilus (which means “dear to God” or “lover of God”) stands for Christian readers in general rather than any specific individual. However, the designation “most honorable” argues against such an assumption. That ascription was a common title of honor, designating a person with official standing in the Roman sociopolitical order (cf. use of the title for Felix, <a href="?bref=Acts.23.26">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.2">24:2</a>; and for Festus, <a href="?bref=Acts.26.25">26:25</a>). It is thus likely that Luke intended his two-volume work for an official representative of Roman society.</p>
<p>When was Acts written? Some scholars date it in the last quarter of the first century. Since the Gospel was written first, and since Luke based his story of Jesus on eyewitness accounts and written sources (among which was possibly the Gospel of Mark, probably written in the 60s), Acts should not be dated much before <span class="era">AD</span> 85. Proponents of such a late date claim support from the theology of Acts, which they see as picturing a Christian church settled into history, adjusted to the prospect of a lengthy period before the Lord’s return. Since expectation of the Lord’s imminent return was fanned into a living flame by the Jewish revolt and the fall of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, time must be allowed for that flame to have died down a bit.</p>
<p>Other scholars date Acts around <span class="era">AD</span> 70 or shortly thereafter. The Jewish rebellion of <span class="era">AD</span> 66–70, which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem, brought the Jewish faith—legal until then—into disrepute. The Christian movement, which had been accepted as a Jewish sect, became suspect. Christians were increasingly charged with being enemies of Rome. A study of Acts shows that among a number of purposes (see below), Luke seems to have been defending the Christians against the charge of hostility toward the state. He showed how Roman officials repeatedly testified to the complete innocence of Christians and above all else of Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.39">16:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.14-17">18:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.37">19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.29">23:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.25.25">25:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.32">26:32</a>). Luke also made it clear that Paul was allowed to carry on his mission with full approval of Roman officials in the very heart of the imperial capital (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.16-31">28:16-31</a>).</p>
<p>A still earlier date, closer to Paul’s Roman imprisonment (early 60s), has been advocated by a number of scholars. There are two compelling reasons: (1) The abrupt ending of Acts, describing Paul carrying on a ministry in Rome before his trial had commenced, may indicate that Luke was writing at that point. It is possible, of course, that Luke ended his story with Paul preaching the gospel in Rome because one of his purposes had been accomplished: namely, showing how the gospel spread from Jerusalem to Rome. But it seems highly unlikely that Luke would close his history without Paul’s defense of the gospel before Caesar himself if that had already happened. (2) The most appropriate period for Luke’s history, with its defense of the Christian movement against all kinds of accusations from both Jews and Gentiles, is the period when Christianity was becoming suspect but was not yet proscribed. That was the time before the start of the persecutions under Nero in <span class="era">AD</span> 64. The early date would correspond with the contention that Luke was with Paul during his Roman imprisonment and that he wrote his history in Rome while waiting for Paul’s trial to begin. It is possible that Luke’s work was partially intended to influence the verdict. Luke presented a picture of Christianity and of Paul that he hoped would enable Paul to continue his work among the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BackgroundandContent">Background and Content</p>
<p class="fl">Luke grounds his documentary of the rapid expansion of Christianity in the history of the Roman Empire and Palestine during the three decades from <span class="era">AD</span> 30 to 60. Some brief historical and geographical considerations will aid in understanding Luke’s history.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-12.25">Acts 1–12</a> reports the beginnings of the Christian movement within the imperial province of Syria, which included Judea and Samaria. In the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, those regions were generally governed by Roman procurators or puppet kings. At the time of Jesus’ death and resurrection (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 30), Pontius Pilate was procurator in Judea and Samaria (<span class="era">AD</span> 26–36). Galilee was ruled by King Herod Antipas (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 39). Tiberius was emperor of the Roman Empire (<span class="era">AD</span> 14–37). The account of <a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-12.25">Acts 1–12</a> took place in the period <span class="era">AD</span> 30–44.</p>
<p>The conversion of Saul (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-43">Acts 9</a>) is generally dated in <span class="sc">AD </span>33. After Saul’s conversion and departure to his native Tarsus, the church evidently enjoyed a period of tranquility, consolidating its gains and growing steadily (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.31-11.26">9:31–11:26</a>). It can be assumed, from <a href="?bref=Gal.1.18-21">Galatians 1:18-21</a> and the existence of Christian communities that Paul and Silas visited on the second missionary tour (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.40-41">Acts 15:40-41</a>), that Paul was not idle during that decade, but intensely involved in the mission to the Gentiles. (After <a href="?bref=Acts.13.9">Acts 13:9</a>, the name “Saul” is dropped from the narrative.)</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 41, Claudius became emperor of Rome and installed Herod Agrippa I as king of the Jews. (The procurator Pontius Pilate had been removed several years earlier for inept administration of the region.) Agrippa I was grandson of Herod the Great and his Jewish princess Mariamne. Because of his Jewish roots, he was more popular with his subjects than the former Herods. No doubt it was his desire to increase that popularity and gain the support of the Jewish religious authorities that led to a renewed outbreak of violence against the Jerusalem church. <a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-25">Acts 12</a> recounts the execution of James (the brother of the apostle John) and the imprisonment of Peter. The story of Agrippa I’s death (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.20-23">12:20-23</a>) is paralleled in an account by the Jewish historian Josephus, who dates the event in <span class="era">AD</span> 44.</p>
<p>A second event providing a time reference for the unfolding story of the early church is the collection of famine relief in Antioch for Christians in Judea (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-29">11:27-29</a>). Luke stated that a severe famine took place (v <a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">28</a>) during the reign of Emperor Claudius (<span class="era">AD</span> 41–54). Josephus, writing his <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> at the end of the first century, spoke of a severe famine in Palestine between the years <span class="era">AD</span> 44 and 48. According to <a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">Acts 12:25</a>, Barnabas and Paul finished their mission to famine-stricken Christians in Judea after the death of Agrippa I, making it possible to date their mission about <span class="era">AD</span> 45.</p>
<p>At that point in the narrative of Acts, Paul is launched officially into his mission to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">13:1-3</a>), for which the history and geography of the larger Roman Empire form the backdrop. The official Roman policy toward the various religions in the empire was one of toleration. That policy, plus use of the Greek language throughout the empire and a phenomenal network of roads and sea routes, paved the way for Paul’s far-ranging missionary work.</p>
<p>The first tour (<span class="era">AD</span> 46–47) took Paul and Barnabas through the island province of Cyprus in the northeastern tip of the Mediterranean Sea and into the province of Galatia, where churches were established in several cities of southern Galatia (Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe). Galatia is located in Asia Minor, bordered by the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea on its northern, western, and southern sides. Those cities, important colonial outposts for the Romans, contained mixed populations, including large Jewish communities. It was in the synagogues of those communities that Paul launched his missionary efforts, almost always meeting with considerable opposition (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-14.28">13–14</a>).</p>
<p>The deliberation of the Jerusalem Council about differences between Jewish and gentile Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">ch 15</a>) can be dated in the year <span class="era">AD</span> 48. It was followed by Paul’s second missionary journey, which led him through the already evangelized territory of his native Cilicia, Galatia, and through Troas on the Aegean coast to Macedonia and down into Achaia, the Greek Peninsula (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.40-18.22">15:40–18:22</a>). Churches were established in the important Macedonian cities of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea.</p>
<p>Paul’s one and a half years in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.11">18:11</a>) can be dated with some certainty in <span class="era">AD</span> 51–52. An ancient inscription among the ruins of Delphi, a city in central Greece, states that Gallio became proconsul of Achaia in 51. <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">Acts 18:12-17</a> tells how Paul was accused by antagonistic Jews before Gallio. The implication is that Paul’s adversaries in Corinth felt that a new proconsul could be persuaded to side with their cause. Thus, Paul’s stay in Corinth can be dated around the beginning of Gallio’s proconsulship.</p>
<p>Luke’s account of Paul’s return to Palestine and the beginning of his third missionary tour brings up a fascinating historical question about what happened to the followers of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.13-19.7">13:13–19:7</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-28">Acts 18:24-28</a> refers to a learned Jew, Apollos, who was actively teaching about Jesus in the synagogue at Ephesus, but who was apparently not a member of a distinctively Christian community, not having been baptized in the name of Jesus. He was acquainted only with the baptism of repentance practiced by John the Baptist. After Apollos went to Corinth to minister to the young congregation that Paul founded the previous year, Paul went to Ephesus. There he met several disciples of Jesus who, like Apollos, had experienced John’s baptism of repentance, but who had not been baptized as Christians.</p>
<p>Luke’s reference to Apollos and those disciples, as well as several passages in the Gospels, indicate that the movement begun by John the Baptist did not simply come to an end when Jesus began his ministry. Evidently John continued to baptize until his death (<a href="?bref=John.3.22-24">Jn 3:22-24</a>), and many of his disciples maintained John’s work after his death. Probably both Apollos and the disciples at Ephesus were products of the continuing ministry of John’s disciples. Eventually they were introduced to “the way of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.25">18:25</a>). Their lack of knowledge about a distinctive Christian baptism or about the reality of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.2-4">19:2-4</a>) shows how much diversity in both belief and practice existed in early Christianity.</p>
<p>Paul’s third missionary tour began with a three-year ministry in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-20.1">19:1–20:1</a>), continued with a visit to churches established on the previous journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.2-12">20:2-12</a>), and came to a climax with his arrest in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.1-40">Acts 21</a>). It took place in the mid-50s (<span class="era">AD</span> 53–57). Paul’s arrest in Jerusalem and arraignment before the provincial governor, Felix, in Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.23-24.23">23:23–24:23</a>) must be dated about 57. After Paul had spent two years under house arrest, no doubt prolonged by Felix to gain favor with Jewish subjects, Felix was replaced by Porcius Festus (<span class="era">AD</span> 59–60). Josephus noted that Felix was recalled because of an outbreak of civil strife between Jewish and gentile inhabitants of Caesarea and Felix’s unwise handling of the situation.</p>
<p>The new procurator, Festus, was uncertain about what to do with his prisoner. The Jewish leadership sought to seize that opportunity, aware of the desire of new procurators to gain popularity with their subjects (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-9">25:1-9</a>). Realizing the threat, Paul appealed his case to the highest court of the empire, presided over by Caesar himself (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.10-12">25:10-12</a>).</p>
<p>Festus was then left with a problem. He had to send with his prisoner a report to the emperor, clearly outlining the charges. Since he did not really comprehend the case (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.25-27">25:25-27</a>), he sought the advice of Herod Agrippa II, who with his sister had come to Caesarea to pay their respects to the new imperial governor of Palestine (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.13">25:13</a>). Agrippa II was the son of Herod Agrippa I and, at least in theory, a Jew. He ruled over parts of Palestine from <span class="era">AD</span> 50 to 100 and had been given the right to appoint the Jewish high priests. His familiarity with Jewish religious traditions and the Law thus put him in a better position to understand Jerusalem’s case against Paul. The outcome of Paul’s appearance before Festus and Agrippa (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.1-29">26:1-29</a>) was recognition of Paul’s innocence (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.31">26:31</a>). Yet Paul’s appeal to Rome had to be honored; the law governing such cases had to be followed (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.32">26:32</a>).</p>
<p>Paul’s relative freedom during the next two-year period (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.30">28:30</a>) seems unusual but was a rather common practice in Roman judicial proceedings, especially for Roman citizens who had appealed to the emperor. There is no good reason to believe that Paul was executed at the time when Luke’s narrative ends (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 61–62). The great fire of Rome and Nero’s subsequent persecution of Christians were still a few years away (<span class="era">AD</span> 64). It is likely that the case against Paul was dismissed, especially in light of the favorable verdict by Festus and King Agrippa. It is also likely that Paul was executed during the later, more general persecution of Christians. Such a sequence would correspond with the tradition cited by Eusebius, a fourth-century church historian, that Paul resumed his ministry and later suffered martyrdom under Nero.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">In the preface to the Gospel, intended to cover the second volume also, Luke told Theophilus (and the audience he represented) that he had set out to write an accurate, orderly account about the beginnings of the Christian movement in the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-4">Lk 1:1-4</a>). The opening lines in Acts indicate that the narrative beginning with Jesus of Nazareth (vol 1) is continuing and that Luke’s second volume intends to trace the story from Palestine to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-8">Acts 1:1-8</a>).</p>
<p>While recounting this story, Luke attempted to defend the Christian movement against false charges brought against it. A number of misconceptions attended the birth and growth of the Christian movement. One concerned the relationship between the new faith and Judaism. Many, both within the church and among Roman officials, understood the Christian faith as no more than a particular expression of, or sect within, Judaism. Against that restricted notion, Luke-Acts strikes a universal note. The Gospel proclaims Jesus as Savior of the world (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.29-32">Lk 2:29-32</a>). In Acts, Stephen’s defense before the Jewish council (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-60">ch 7</a>), Peter’s experience in Joppa with Cornelius (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">ch 10</a>), and Paul’s speech at Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.1-34">ch 17</a>) all demonstrate that Christianity is not merely a Jewish sect, some narrow messianic movement, but rather a universal faith. Another problem was popular identification of the new faith with the various religious cults and mystery religions in the Roman Empire. The accounts of the early church’s conflict with Simon the magician (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-40">ch 8</a>) and of Paul and Barnabas’s rejection of an attempt to worship them at Lystra (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.1-28">ch 14</a>) undermine the popular charge of superstition. Also, Christianity is not a mystery cult in which esoteric, secret rites bring a worshiper into union with the divine. The Lord worshiped by Christians, said Luke, belongs to real history; he lived his life in Palestine in the then-recent past, openly, for all to observe (see the speeches of Peter and Paul in <a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-52">13</a>).</p>
<p>Luke’s major purpose, however, was defense of Christianity against the charge that it posed a threat to the order and stability of the Roman Empire. There were, of course, grounds for such suspicions. After all, the founder of the movement had been crucified on a charge of sedition by a Roman procurator, and the movement that claimed his name seemed to evoke tumult, disorder, and riots wherever it spread. Luke’s account met those problems head-on. In the Gospel he presented the trial of Jesus as a serious miscarriage of justice. Pilate had handed Jesus over for crucifixion, but he had found Jesus not guilty. Herod Antipas likewise found no substance in the charges against Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.13-16">Lk 23:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.28">Acts 13:28</a>). A neutral or even friendly attitude of Roman officials toward leading Christians and the movement as a whole is documented throughout Acts. The Roman proconsul of Cyprus, Sergius Paulus, gladly received Paul and Barnabas and responded positively to their message (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.7-12">Acts 13:7-12</a>). The chief magistrate in Philippi apologized for the illegal beating and imprisonment of Paul and Silas (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37-39">16:37-39</a>). The proconsul of Achaia, Gallio, found Paul guiltless in the eyes of Roman law (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-16">18:12-16</a>). In Ephesus the magistrate intervened in a crowd’s attack on Paul and his companions, rejecting the charges against them (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.35-39">19:35-39</a>). A tribune of the Roman military contingent in Jerusalem arrested Paul, but it turned out that he really saved the apostle from the wrath of a mob; in his letter to the procurator Felix, the tribune acknowledged that Paul was not guilty by Roman law (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.26-29">23:26-29</a>). The same verdict was repeated after Paul’s arraignment before Felix, his successor Festus, and Herod Agrippa II: “This man hasn’t done anything worthy of death or imprisonment” (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.31">26:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Luke climaxed his story by telling how Paul carried on his missionary activity in Rome, the very heart of the empire, and with the permission of the imperial guards (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.30-31">28:30-31</a>). It is clear throughout Luke’s defense that the strife that attended the beginnings and progress of Christianity was not due primarily to anything within the movement, but rather to Jewish opposition and falsification.</p>
<p>Within his lengthy apology for the integrity of Christianity, Luke’s specific theological perspectives can be clearly seen. The two volume work presents a grand scheme of the history of redemption, extending from the <span class="ital">time of Israel</span> (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-2.52">Lk 1–2</a>) through the <span class="ital">time of Jesus,</span> and continuing through the <span class="ital">time of the church,</span> when the good news for Israel is extended to all nations. Paralleling that emphasis is an insistence that God is present in the redemptive story through the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel, Jesus is presented as the Man of the Spirit; the reality of the Spirit empowered him for his work (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.22">Lk 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1,14,18">4:1, 14, 18</a>). In Acts, the fellowship of Jesus’ disciples is presented as the community of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-8">2:1-8</a>). What Jesus in the power of the Spirit had begun in his own ministry, the church in the power of the Spirit continues to do.</p>
<p>For Luke, the empowering presence of God’s Spirit was a reality that gave the new faith its power, integrity, and perseverance. It enabled faithful witness (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a>) and created genuine community (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.44-47">2:44-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.32-37">4:32-37</a>), something for which the ancient world desperately longed. The Spirit in the new community produced courage and boldness (see Peter’s defenses in chs <a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-5.42">2–5</a>), empowered for service (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-15">ch 6</a>), overcame prejudice as in the mission in Samaria (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-40">ch 8</a>), broke down walls as in the Cornelius episode (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-11.30">10–11</a>), and sent believers out on missions (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-52">ch 13</a>).</p>
<p>The entire story is also punctuated by the centrality of Jesus’ resurrection. Luke, like Paul (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-21">1 Cor 15:12-21</a>), must have been convinced that without the resurrection of Jesus there would be no Christian faith at all. More than that, the resurrection put God’s stamp of approval on Jesus’ life and ministry, authenticating the truth of his claims. Luke announced his interest in that theme at the outset: the ultimate criterion for an apostolic replacement for Judas was that he must have been, with the other disciples, a witness to Jesus’ resurrection. Throughout Acts, from Peter’s Pentecost sermon and defenses before the Sanhedrin to Paul’s speeches before Felix and Agrippa, the church is shown bearing witness to Jesus’ resurrection as a great reversal executed by God (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.22-24,36">2:22-24, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.14-15">3:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.30-31">5:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.39-42">10:39-42</a>).</p>
<p>Acts falls naturally into two parts, chapters <a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-12.25">1–12,</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-28.31">13–28</a>. The first part, roughly speaking, contains the “acts of Peter.” Part two is largely concerned with the “acts of Paul.” In the first 12 chapters, Peter is the central figure who initiates the choosing of a replacement for Judas Iscariot (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-26">ch 1</a>); addresses the multitudes at Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">ch 2</a>); interprets the significance of the healing of a lame man to a temple crowd (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-26">ch 3</a>); delivers a defense of the Christian proclamation before the supreme Jewish council (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-37">ch 4</a>); leads the apostles in a healing ministry and speaks for them (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.1-42">ch 5</a>); stands in the forefront of conflict with a Samaritan magician, “Simon the Great” (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-40">ch 8</a>); launches—though somewhat unwillingly—the movement of the gospel to the Gentiles through Cornelius (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-11.30">10–11</a>); and draws the fire of Herod’s campaign against the church but is miraculously delivered from prison (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-25">ch 12</a>).</p>
<p>Proclamation of the gospel to the Gentiles through Paul’s ministry is the theme of part two of Acts (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-28.31">13–28</a>). The story primarily concerns three major missionary tours, each of which moved the gospel into yet untouched territory and expanded earlier missionary efforts. The account of Paul’s life and work climaxes in his arrest in Jerusalem (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.21.1-22.30">21–22</a>), a lengthy imprisonment in Caesarea (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.23.1-26.32">23–26</a>), and a voyage to Rome (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-28.31">27–28</a>).</p>
<p>Another way of getting at the structure and content of Acts is thematic. It has its starting point in Jesus’ statement, “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a>). Acts can be seen as the story of the fulfillment of that “Great Commission,” unfolding essentially in three stages: (1) witness to Judaism, focused in Jerusalem but also expanding into surrounding Judea and north into Galilee (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.1.1-7.60">1–7</a>); (2) witness to Samaria through Philip, Peter, and John (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-9.31">8:1–9:31</a>); (3) witness to the gentile world, first haltingly through Peter (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-12.25">9:32–12:25</a>), and then decisively through Paul (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-28.31">13–28</a>).</p>

  <title>Adam (Person)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ADAM (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">First man and father of the human race. Adam’s role in biblical history is important not only in OT considerations but also in understanding the meaning of salvation and the person and work of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The creation of Adam and the first woman, Eve, is recited in two accounts in the book of Genesis. The intent of the first account (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-31">1:26-31</a>) is to present the first pair in their relationship to God and to the rest of the created order. It teaches that with regard to God the first humans were created male and female in God’s image with his specific mandate to populate and rule over the earth. With regard to the rest of creation the first humans were, on one hand, part of it, being created on the same day as other land animals; on the other hand, they were distinctly above it, being the culmination of the creation process and sole bearers of God’s image.</p>
<p>The intent of the second account is much more specific (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.4-3.24">2:4–3:24</a>); it seeks to explain the origin of the present human condition of sin and death and to set the stage for the drama of redemption. The story treats in detail aspects of Adam’s creation omitted from the first story. For example, it tells of the formation of Adam from the dust of the ground and of his receiving the breath of life from God (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">2:7</a>). It recounts the planting of the Garden and the responsibility given to Adam to cultivate it (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.8-15">2:8-15</a>). God’s instruction to Adam that the fruit of every tree in the Garden was his for food, except one, is carefully recorded, as well as the solemn warning that the fruit of the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” was never to be eaten, under the pain of death (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">2:16-17</a>). Adam’s loneliness after naming the animals and not finding a suitable companion is also described, thus introducing the creation of the first woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.18-22">2:18-22</a>). The creation of Eve from Adam’s rib poignantly portrays the essential unity of spirit and purpose of the sexes intended by God.</p>
<p>The story does not end on such a positive note, however. It moves on to record the great deception Satan played upon Eve through the serpent. By clever insinuations and distortion of God’s original commandment (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1">3:1</a> with <a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">2:16-17</a>), the serpent tricked Eve into eating the forbidden fruit and sharing it with Adam. Eve seems to have eaten because she was deceived (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.14">1 Tm 2:14</a>), Adam out of a willful and conscious rebellion. Ironically, the two beings originally created in God’s image and likeness believed that they could become “like” God by disobeying him (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.5">Gn 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>The effects of their disobedience were immediate, though not at all what Adam had expected. For the first time a barrier of shame disrupted the unity of man and woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.7">3:7</a>). More important, a barrier of real moral guilt was erected between the first couple and God. The story relates that when God came looking for Adam after his rebellion, he was hiding among the trees, already aware of his separation from God (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8">3:8</a>). When God questioned him, Adam threw the blame on Eve and, by implication, back on God: “It was the woman you gave me who brought me the fruit” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.12">3:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Eve in turn blamed the serpent (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.13">3:13</a>).</p>
<p>According to the story in Genesis, God held all three responsible and informed each one of the calamitous consequences of their rebellion (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.14-19">3:14-19</a>). The two great mandates, originally signs of pure blessing, became mixed with curse and pain—the earth could now be populated only through the woman’s birth pangs and could be subdued only by the man’s labor and perspiration (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16-18">3:16-18</a>). Further, the unity of man and woman would be strained by man’s subjugation of her, or possibly by the beginning of a struggle for dominance between them (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16">3:16b</a> can be taken both ways). Finally, God pronounced the ultimate consequence: as he had originally warned, Adam and Eve were to die. Someday the breath of life would be taken from them, and their bodies would return to the dust from which they were made (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.19">3:19</a>). That very day they also experienced a “spiritual” death; they were separated from God, the giver of life, and from the tree of life, the symbol of eternal life (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.22">3:22</a>). God sent them out of Eden, and there was no way back. The entrance to paradise was blocked by the cherubim and flaming sword (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.23-24">3:23-24</a>). Only God could restore what they had lost.</p>
<p>The story is not devoid of hope. God was merciful even then. He made them garments of skin to cover their bodies and promised that someday the power of Satan behind the serpent would be crushed by the woman’s “seed” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.16.20">Rom 16:20</a>). Many scholars consider that promise to be the first biblical mention of redemption.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSignificanceofAdam">The Significance of Adam</p>
<p class="fl">Adam’s significance is based upon several assumptions, the first being that he was a historical individual. That assumption was made by many OT writers (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.25">Gn 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-5">5:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1">1 Chr 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.7">Hos 6:7</a>). The NT writers agreed (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.38">Lk 3:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.14">Rom 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.22,45">1 Cor 15:22, 45</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.13-14">1 Tm 2:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.14">Jude 1:14</a>). Equally essential to Adam’s significance is a second assumption, that he was more than an individual. To begin with, the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">adam</span> (more correctly <span class="hebrew">’a–dha–m</span>) is not merely a proper name. Even in the Genesis story it is not used as a name until <a href="?bref=Gen.4.25">Genesis 4:25</a>. The word is one of several Hebrew words meaning “man” and is the generic term for “human race.” In the vast majority of cases it refers either to a male individual (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.2">Lv 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.14.15">Jos 14:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.29">Neh 9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.56.2">Is 56:2</a>) or to humanity in general (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.11">Ex 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.12.3">Nm 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.16.29">16:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.28">Dt 4:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.31">1 Kgs 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.7.20">Jb 7:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.14.1">14:1</a>). The generic, collective sense of the word <span class="hebrew">adam</span> is also behind the phrase “children (or sons) of men” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.14">2 Sm 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.11.4">Pss 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.12.1">12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.14.2">14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.53.2">53:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.90.3">90:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.1.13">Eccl 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.3">2:3</a>). That phrase, literally “sons of <span class="hebrew">adam</span><span class="ital">,”</span> simply means “men” or “human beings,” and when it is used the entire human race is in view. Indeed, the universalistic human connotation of the word <span class="hebrew">adam</span> indicates a concern in the OT going far beyond Israel’s nationalistic hopes and its God—to all the earth’s people and the Lord of all nations (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.5-7">Gn 9:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.24">Dt 5:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.8.3">8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.38-39">1 Kgs 8:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.8.4">Pss 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.48">89:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.8-31">107:8-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.12.14">Prv 12:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">Mi 6:8</a>).</p>
<p>It is no accident, then, that the first man was named “Adam” or “Man.” The name intimates that to speak about Adam is somehow also to speak about the entire human race. Such usage can perhaps best be understood through the ancient concept of corporate personality and representation familiar to the Hebrews and other Near Eastern peoples. Modern thinking emphasizes the individual; existence of the social group and all social relationships has been seen as secondary to, and dependent upon, the existence and desire of the individual. The Hebrew understanding was quite different. Though the separate personality of the individual was appreciated (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.29-30">Jer 31:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.4">Ez 18:4</a>), there was a strong tendency to see the social group (family, tribe, nation) as a single organism with a corporate identity of its own. Likewise the group representative was seen as the embodiment or personification of the corporate personality of the group. Within the representative the essential qualities and characteristics of the social group resided in such a way that the actions and decisions of the representative were binding on the entire group. If the group was a family, the father was usually considered the corporate representative; for good or for ill his family, and sometimes his descendants, received the results of his actions (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-8">Gn 17:1-8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-9,18">Gn 20:1-9, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.5-6">Ex 20:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.24-25">Jos 7:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.28">Rom 11:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-10">Heb 7:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>As the original man and father of humankind, in whose image all succeeding generations would be born (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.3">Gn 5:3</a>), Adam was the corporate representative of humanity. The creation accounts themselves give the impression that the mandates of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-30">Genesis 1:26-30</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.9.1,7">Gn 9:1, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.8.5-7">Pss 8:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.14">104:14</a>) as well as the curses of <a href="?bref=Gen.3.16-19">Genesis 3:16-19</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.90.3">Ps 90:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.7">Eccl 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.13.8">Is 13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.21.3">21:3</a>) were meant not only for Adam (and Eve) but, through him, for the entire race.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Romans 5:12-21</a> the apostle Paul contrasted the death and condemnation brought upon humanity by Adam’s disobedience with the life and justification given to humanity through Christ’s obedience. More explicitly, in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45-50">1 Corinthians 15:45-50</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), Paul called Christ the “last Adam,” “second man,” and the “man of heaven” in juxtaposition to the “first Adam,” the “first man,” and the “man of dust.”</p>
<p>For Paul, the human race was divided into two groups in the persons of Adam and Christ. Those who remain “incorporated” in Adam are the “old” humanity, bearing the image of the “man of dust” and partaking of his sin and alienation from God and Creation (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-19">Rom 5:12-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.20-22">8:20-22</a>). But those who are incorporated into Christ by faith become Christ’s “body” (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.4-5">Rom 12:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-13,27">1 Cor 12:12-13, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">Eph 1:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>); they are recreated in Christ’s image (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.49">1 Cor 15:49</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>); they become one “new man” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.15">Eph 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.9-10">Col 3:9-10</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>); and they partake of the new creation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">Gal 6:15</a>). The old barriers raised by Adam are removed by Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1">Rom 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.27-28">Gal 3:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-16">Eph 2:14-16</a>). For Paul, the functional similarity of Adam and Christ as representatives meant that Christ had restored what Adam had lost.</p>

According to 1 Kings, David had promised his wife Bathsheba that their son Solomon would be the one to succeed him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.17">1:17</a>). When his elderly father seemed to be dying, Adonijah began preparations to crown himself king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-10">1:1-10</a>). Before the ceremonies could take place, David appointed Solomon as his successor (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.11-40">1:11-40</a>).

  <title>Adoption</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ADOPTION</p>
<p class="fl">Theologically, the act of God by which believers become members of “God’s family” with all the privileges and obligations of family membership. “Sons of God,” a common <span class="sc">kjv</span> expression, includes individuals of both sexes numbered among God’s children (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.6">Is 43:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.18">2 Cor 6:18</a>).</p>
<p>According to the NT, all persons are sinners by nature, and hence are called “children of wrath” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.3">Eph 2:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>); however, those upon whom God bestows his love become “children of God” by grace (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.1">1 Jn 3:1</a>). The adoption through which this happens has its origin in God’s love and its foundation in Jesus Christ who is uniquely the Son of God. Theologians regard the term “Son of God” as referring preeminently to Christ’s deity (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.25-27">Mt 11:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16-17">16:16-17</a>), for he is one in substance and glory with the Father. As the second person of the Trinity, Christ is distinguished from the Father as “the only begotten Son.” Believers in Christ, although “adopted,” are never seen as on a par with the uncreated, divine Son.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the beloved Son, sinners have been loved and predestined by God the Father to become his children by adoption (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.4-6">Eph 1:4-6</a>). That adoption is secured by Christ the Redeemer; through his death and resurrection he destroyed sin and its death penalty, restoring the righteousness and life requisite for the status of sonship. Christ is the head of the “new covenant” as its mediator and guarantor. His brothers and sisters, as its beneficiaries, become God’s heirs, and his joint heirs (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.17">Rom 8:17</a>). God gives to them the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of his Son, as the Spirit of adoption (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.15">Rom 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6">Gal 4:6</a>). The indwelling Spirit gives believers assurance that they are indeed God’s children and enables them to cry out to God as Father (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.15-16">Rom 8:15-16</a>). Such intimacy with the Creator and Savior in prayer is one privilege of adoption.</p>
<p>Adoption was a privilege given to God’s people under the “old covenant” (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.4">Rom 9:4</a>). Both Israel as a whole and individual Israelites knew God as Father (<a href="?bref=Isa.64.8-9">Is 64:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1">Hos 11:1</a>). Since the NT regards adoption as ultimately possible only through Jesus Christ, Israel’s adoption before the Incarnation was an under-age sonship comparable to the status of servanthood (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.1-7">Gal 4:1-7</a>). In Jesus the privilege of mature sonship was extended to include both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.25-29">Gal 3:25-29</a>). Though adoption is a benefit enjoyed in the present experience of God’s people (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.1">1 Jn 3:1</a>), its full extent is realized only at their resurrection from the dead (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.21-23">Rom 8:21-23</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ADULLAM, ADULLAMITE</p>
<p class="fl">Old Canaanite city between Lachish and Hebron, as well as a cave region nearby. The first biblical mention of the city is in the word “Adullamite” (someone from Adullam), used of Hirah, a friend of Judah. After acting as a ringleader in selling his brother Joseph into slavery, Judah left home and lived in Adullam with Hirah (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.1,12,20">Gn 38:1, 12, 20</a>).</p>
<p>Adullam was in the lowlands of Judah’s tribal territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.35">Jos 15:35</a>). It was one of 31 Canaanite royal cities conquered by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.15">Jos 12:15</a>) and one of 15 cities later fortified by King Rehoboam of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.7">2 Chr 11:7</a>). After the exiles’ return from captivity in Babylon, Adullam was again resettled by Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.30">Neh 11:30</a>).</p>
<p>A cave near Adullam figured in several events in David’s life. It was a refuge when he fled from King Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.1">1 Sm 22:1</a>) and a stronghold in his war against the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.13-17">2 Sm 23:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.15-19">1 Chr 11:15-19</a>).

  <title>Adultery</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ADULTERY</p>
<p class="fl">A breach of the unity of marriage. It describes any act of sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man other than her husband, and all sexual intercourse involving a married man and a woman other than his wife.</p>
<p>In OT times, polygamous unions were not considered adulterous (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.21.15">Dt 21:15</a>). Nor was a husband branded as an adulterer if he had intercourse with a slave woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-4">Gn 16:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-5">30:1-5</a>) or a prostitute (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.15-18">Gn 38:15-18</a>)—though the latter was, of course, condemned as immoral (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15">1 Cor 6:15</a>).</p>
<p>Any imbalance between the sexes was dispelled by Jesus in his teaching on divorce and remarriage. While he did not rule out the possibility of divorce in cases of sexual unfaithfulness (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.32">Mt 5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.9">19:9</a>), he warned that in all other circumstances remarriage involves both (ex-)husband and (ex-)wife in adultery. Paul added that the charge of adultery only applies if the remarried person’s original partner is still alive (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.2-3">Rom 7:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus also sharpened the OT’s definition of adultery by applying it to a man’s thought life. Any man who fantasizes in lust (as distinct from just being tempted) has committed adultery in mind and intention, even though there is no physical contact (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.27-28">Mt 5:27-28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Job.31.1,9">Jb 31:1, 9</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible’s condemnation of adultery is written into the heart of the OT law, prophecy, and wisdom literature. The Ten Commandments ban it unequivocally (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.14">Ex 20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.18">Dt 5:18</a>). The prophets list it among offenses that attract God’s anger and judgment (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.11-14">Jer 23:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.11">Ez 22:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">Mal 3:5</a>). And the book of Proverbs scorns it as a senseless act by which a man destroys himself (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.23-35">Prv 6:23-35</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.7.6-27">7:6-27</a>).</p>
<p>The NT echoes that clear condemnation. Where there is no repentance, adultery excludes those who practice it from God’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9">1 Cor 6:9</a>). It is the very opposite of love of one’s neighbor (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.9-10">Rom 13:9-10</a>), and it stands under the judgment of God himself (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.4">Heb 13:4</a>).</p>
<p>In the OT the penalty for adultery is death—for both the man and the woman (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.10">Lv 20:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.22">Dt 22:22</a>). The same applies if the woman is single but engaged to another man, assuming she has not been raped (in which case only the man is to be executed—<a href="?bref=Deut.22.23-27">Dt 22:23-27</a>). The refrain “You will cleanse the land from evil” (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.24">22:24</a>) shows that adultery was considered a serious threat to society’s health, not simply an attack on the family lives of the two people involved.</p>
<p>With such serious consequences, it was important to establish guilt beyond doubt. In cases of serious suspicion but insufficient evidence, the wife concerned was put through an elaborate ritual test that included taking an oath and drinking bitter water. The result was not a matter of chance because she stood in the Lord’s presence (<a href="?bref=Num.5.11-31">Nm 5:11-31</a>).</p>
<p>In both the OT and NT, the language of adultery is used figuratively to describe human unfaithfulness to God. The OT prophets likened God’s covenant relationship with his people to marriage (<a href="?bref=Isa.54.5-8">Is 54:5-8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">Rv 21:2</a>), so in their eyes the breaking of that relationship, especially by idolatry, was equivalent to spiritual adultery (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.7-8">Jer 5:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.22-27">13:22-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.37">Ez 23:37</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus used the same imagery to characterize those who either rejected his claims or showed their lack of faith in him by demanding unnecessary extra signs of his deity (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.39">Mt 12:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.4">16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mk 8:38</a>). And in another vivid NT passage, James describes God as a loving, jealous husband coming to deal with his adulterous people who have become good friends with the world and its false standards (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.4">Jas 4:4</a>).</p>
<p>This is the special theme of the prophet Hosea. God used the prophet’s own experience of a marriage broken by adultery to teach the seriousness of his people’s unfaithfulness to him (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.2-6">Hos 2:2-6</a>) and his keen longing for a full reconciliation (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.1-5">3:1-5</a>). Spiritual infidelity, like physical adultery, brings God’s judgment. But in both cases his overwhelming desire is for a mended relationship following sincere repentance (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.1-14">Jer 3:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">Ez 16:1-63</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">AEGEAN SEA*</p>
<p class="fl">Extension of the Mediterranean Sea between Greece on the west and north and Turkey on the east. The large island of Crete is its traditional southern limit. On the northeast, the Aegean connects with the Black Sea by way of the Strait of Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara. Approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) wide and 400 miles (640 kilometers) long, the Aegean Sea has hundreds of islands, including Lesbos and Patmos (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rv 1:9</a>). The sea was probably named for Aegeus, in Greek mythology a king of Athens and the father of Theseus.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul spent much time in the Aegean area on his second and third missionary trips. The three major modern cities on the Aegean are Athens (with its port of Pireaus), Salonika (biblical Thessalonica), both in Greece, and Izmir (biblical Smyrna) in Turkey.</p>

  <title>Age</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AGE</p>
<p class="fl">Long, but indefinite, period of time, past or future. The ages, past and future, make up the whole of time. God is spoken of as existing and planning “before the ages” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.7">1 Cor 2:7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). He is the King of ages (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.17">1 Tm 1:17</a>) and has a purpose that embraces the ages (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.11">Eph 3:11</a>). The Bible speaks of what God will do at the close or consummation of the age(s) (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.39-49">Mt 13:39-49</a>).</p>
<p>The NT, following on from earlier Jewish writings, speaks of the contrast between “the present age” (an “evil age,” <a href="?bref=Gal.1.4">Gal 1:4</a>) and “the age(s) to come” when, in God’s judgment, wrongs will be righted, and his people will come into their full inheritance (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.30">Mk 10:30</a>). There is a sense, however, in which it can be said that we are both living now in “the end of the ages” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.11">1 Cor 10:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) and that we experience “the powers of the age to come” (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.5">Heb 6:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) and its life.</p>
<p>Two other words are sometimes connected with the word “age.” One is “generation.” <a href="?bref=Col.1.26">Colossians 1:26</a> speaks of the mystery hidden “for ages and generations” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.3.21">Eph 3:21</a>), though there is no basis in the scriptural use of these words for dividing biblical times into dispensations, each involving some fresh development of the redemptive purpose of God. The other is the word “world.” <a href="?bref=Eph.2.2">Ephesians 2:2</a> speaks of unredeemed humanity as “following the course of this world” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). <a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:2</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.11.3">11:3</a> speak of God’s creation of the world.</p>
<p>The Bible often speaks of the age of men and women, reckoned in years or in other ways. Wisdom is seen as belonging especially to the aged (<a href="?bref=Job.12.12">Jb 12:12</a>), though not necessarily found there (<a href="?bref=Eccl.4.13">Eccl 4:13</a>). Age should be respected (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.32">Lv 19:32</a>), and length of days is a blessing of God (<a href="?bref=Pr.16.31">Prv 16:31</a>). At the same time, the frailty of old age is recognized (<a href="?bref=Eccl.12.1-6">Eccl 12:1-6</a>), and <a href="?bref=Ps.90.10">Psalm 90:10</a> speaks of 70 years as the allotted human span which, if it is extended to 80, may well be “trouble and sorrow.” <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Eternity_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Eternity</a>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Herding">Herding</p>
<p class="fl">Raising livestock is one of the first occupations mentioned in the Scriptures. Abel (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.2">Gn 4:2</a>) and Jabal (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.20">Gn 4:20</a>) were keepers of sheep or had cattle. This occupation fit the seminomadic life, providing both food and clothing while requiring a minimum of techniques and equipment.</p>
<p>The patriarchs were mainly herdsmen, pasturing their sheep and cattle on common land and generally neglecting to till the soil. Jacob and his sons entered Egypt as shepherds (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.3">Gn 47:3</a>). Later this pastoral life is still found in the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Transjordan (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1">Nm 32:1</a>) and in certain of the tribes dwelling in the western Palestinian hills (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.2">1 Sm 25:2</a>). Herding continued to be a part of Hebrew agriculture even in postnomadic days, partly because the animals utilized less productive lands and partly because of the people’s traditions. Important among these traditions were the sacrifices performed in the temple.</p>

<p class="h2" id="FieldCropping">Field Cropping</p>
<p class="fl">Most authorities agree that the Israelites learned field agriculture from the Canaanites, since contact with these people was contemporaneous with the settling of the Promised Land. The raising of grain is known to have existed before that time. Cain was a tiller of the soil (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.2">Gn 4:2</a>), although it is uncertain what he raised. Archaeologists date the existence of grain farming to around 6800 <span class="era">BC</span> in the Near East. Isaac sowed in Gerar (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.12">Gn 26:12</a>), and Joseph dreamed of sheaves of grain (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.6-7">Gn 37:6-7</a>). Joseph probably learned more about farming grain from the Egyptians, who raised it on the fertile soils of the Nile floodplain.</p>
<p>Yet it was from contact with the Canaanites that Israelites began to raise grain. The productivity of Canaan was reported by Joshua and Caleb at Kadesh-barnea (<a href="?bref=Num.13.26">Nm 13:26</a>), and the Canaanites, who were later conquered, were no doubt made to initiate their conquerors into agricultural practices. Probably such a relationship contributed to the continual Israelite lapses into idolatry (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.27">Jgs 9:27</a>). How rapidly they made the transition from the purely nomadic life is not clear. Some tribes never did shed the nomadic way, but cultivation of the soil seems to have been common by the time of the kings (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.30">2 Sm 14:30</a>).</p>
<p>Of the cereals raised, wheat was one of the most important. Solomon sent great amounts of it, along with barley and oil, to Hiram (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.10">2 Chr 2:10</a>), and it continued to be a chief item of export (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.17">Ez 27:17</a>). Barley was second in importance. In early times it was the chief ingredient of bread (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.13">Jgs 7:13</a>); later it became an important food for the poorer classes (<a href="?bref=John.6.9,13">Jn 6:9, 13</a>). It was also fed to cattle.</p>
<p>Other field crops were beans and lentils (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.28">2 Sm 17:28</a>), which were ground into meal and sometimes used for bread (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9">Ez 4:9</a>). Leeks, garlic, and onions were raised for seasoning, and cumin, coriander, dill, mint, rue, and mustard for spices. Flax was important (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.6">Jos 2:6</a>). Some cotton was grown (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.9">Is 19:9</a>). The fiber supply was supplemented with wool. By Roman times cotton had become much more important than flax.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FruitRaising">Fruit Raising</p>
<p class="fl">When the Israelites became well settled, orchards and vineyards were planted and came to be symbols of prosperity. Vineyards supplied wine to drink. Olive orchards provided oil for cooking, cosmetics, and medicine. Figs and pomegranates were also grown. For all of these crops more skill and equipment became necessary.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cultivating">Cultivating</p>
<p class="fl">Throughout biblical times, much of the labor for agriculture came from the farmer himself. To plant for the first time, it was necessary to clear the land of forest (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.18">Jos 17:18</a>), stones (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.2">Is 5:2</a>), weeds, and thorns. Sometimes the thin soil on hillsides was terraced, and sometimes irrigation was employed. Such tasks limited the size of farms so that only the wealthy, such as Job and Boaz, had large holdings.</p>
<p>To till the land, farmers used oxen or cows to pull very primitive plows (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.18">Jgs 14:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.12">Am 6:12</a>). Occasionally an ass was used (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.10">Dt 22:10</a>). Clods were broken with a hoe or the driver’s goad. The surface was evened by drawing a simple harrow, perhaps only a thornbush, or a stoneboat over it. Seed was sown by hand, sometimes carefully in the furrow, and covered lightly with the harrow or stoneboat. Weeds were controlled by the plow, harrow, or hoe.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="ThreshingSledge"/>
<p>Implements did not change much during Bible times. The plow consisted of an upright J-shaped piece of hardwood so fixed to be drawn by oxen at one end and held by the driver at the other. Such a primitive device could break up only four to five inches (10 to 13 centimeters) of soil. After the exodus, iron became available for the tip of the plow (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.20">1 Sm 13:20</a>), but this served mainly to cut down wear on the point.</p>
<p>The use of fertilizer was very limited on Palestinian farms. Of course, ceremonial law requiring that the soil lie fallow every seventh year helped to replenish water and nutrients, or at least delay their depletion. Manuring of fields was not common because dung was used for fuel. However, there is some mention of this practice in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.8">Lk 13:8</a>, where dung is placed around trees). There is mention in the Mishnah of the use of wood ashes, leaves, blood of slaughtered animals, and oil scum for fertilizer.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Harvesting">Harvesting</p>
<p class="fl">Seeding was done at the beginning of the rainy season and harvesting was begun at the end. Harvesting lasted at least seven weeks. Some crops were pulled up by the roots (pulse), others were dug with a hoe (some grain), but most were cut with a sickle. Iron sickles have been found in archaeological excavations, some with cutting edges set with flakes of flint. The cut grain was tied in sheaves (<a href="?bref=Ps.126.6">Ps 126:6</a>) and cast into heaps to be transported to the threshing floor. Barley was harvested first and wheat last.</p>
<p>Small quantities of grain, dill, cumin, and other small crops were beaten out with a flail (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.11">Jgs 6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.2.17">Ru 2:17</a>), but most grain was threshed on a floor placed on high ground so that the wind would carry off the chaff. The usual method was to scatter the loosened bundles of straw on the floor and to drive oxen over them to dislodge the grains. Sometimes heavy implements were drawn over the straw (<a href="?bref=Isa.28.27">Is 28:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.41.15">41:15</a>). These were weighted by stones and ridden by the driver. The resulting bits of straw, or chaff, were separated from the grain by a tedious winnowing process that involved throwing the material in the air with a fork or shovel (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.24">Is 30:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.7">Jer 15:7</a>). The lighter straw would be blown to the edge of the floor, and the grain would collect at the feet of the worker. The chaff was burned or used as fodder. Grain was sifted (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.9">Am 9:9</a>), shoveled into a heap, and later stored in covered pits in the field (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.8">Jer 41:8</a>). Sometimes storehouses or granaries were used (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.8">Dt 28:8</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">AHAB</p>
<p class="list">1. Eighth king of the northern kingdom of Israel, who reigned about 874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>. His father, Omri, founded a dynasty that lasted 40 years, through the reigns of Ahab and his two sons, Ahaziah and Jehoram. Omri’s dynasty had an impact beyond biblical history, being mentioned on the famous Moabite Stone and in several Assyrian inscriptions. According to 1 Kings, Omri was a general in the army of King Elah, son of Baasha. When Elah was assassinated, Omri was acclaimed king by his own forces in the field (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.8-16">16:8-16</a>). He prevailed in the resulting civil war and occupied Tirzah, the capital city (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.17-23">16:17-23</a>). Soon he moved his capital to Samaria and built fortifications in the region (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.24">16:24</a>). Omri also made an alliance with the Phoenicians, as David and Solomon had done, but was condemned for it by later generations. When Ahab succeeded his father (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.28">16:28</a>), he pursued this alliance by marrying the Phoenician king’s daughter, Jezebel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.29-31">16:29-31</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheShowdownatCarmel"/>
<p class="list-text">Ahab’s marriage to Jezebel, an immoral and fanatical pagan, strongly affected Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.21-26">21:21-26</a>) and had consequences even in the southern kingdom of Judah. Athaliah, their daughter, married Jehoram of Judah and the results of this marriage were disastrous (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.17-18,26-27">2 Kgs 8:17-18, 26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1-20">11:1-20</a>). Under Jezebel’s influence Ahab gave up the worship of God and took up Baal worship. Ahab’s new religion was a fertility cult that featured sexual unions between priests and temple “virgins,” practices explicitly contrary to the laws of God. Even in marrying Jezebel, Ahab had violated the biblical prohibition of marriage to pagans (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-5">Dt 7:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The biblical narrative mentions that Ahab built many cities (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.39">1 Kgs 22:39</a>) and fought a number of wars, but for the most part it centers on the great prophetic figure, Elijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1">18:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1">19:1</a>). Early in Ahab’s reign, God sent Elijah to predict years of drought and famine as punishment for the king’s sin (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.16-18">18:16-18</a>). The drought lasted three and a half years and was such a remarkable period in Israel’s history that it was remembered into NT times (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.25">Lk 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.17">Jas 5:17</a>). It was a time of great suffering for both people and animals (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.5">1 Kgs 18:5</a>). At the end of the three and a half years Elijah challenged Ahab to gather all the pagan prophets for a final confrontation between God and Baal. Elijah taunted the 450 prophets of Baal for not being able to attract the attention of their false god. Then he prayed to God, and fire fell from heaven on God’s altar. The people shouted their belief in God and helped Elijah execute the pagan prophets (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.16-40">1 Kgs 18:16-40</a>). The drought ended immediately (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.41-46">18:41-46</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When she heard what had happened to her prophets, Jezebel swore revenge. Elijah fled, and on Mt Horeb, God told him to anoint Jehu to become king of Israel in place of Ahab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-16">1 Kgs 19:1-16</a>). This assignment was carried out by the prophet’s successor, Elisha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.19-21">1 Kgs 19:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-10">2 Kgs 9:1-10</a>). Elijah then challenged Ahab’s acquisition of a vineyard owned by a man named Naboth (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-16">1 Kgs 21:1-16</a>). When Naboth refused to sell his land to the king, Jezebel had false witnesses swear that Naboth had cursed God and the king. Naboth was stoned to death for blasphemy. Elijah denounced Ahab, saying that as a judgment God would bring a bloody end to his family (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.17-24">1 Kgs 21:17-24</a>). Ahab’s repentance caused God to postpone the judgment until after Ahab’s death (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.27-29">1 Kgs 21:27-29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1-14">2 Kgs 10:1-14</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">During his reign Ahab had military encounters with King Ben-hadad II of Syria (Aram), largely provoked by the Syrians. In the first encounter Ben-hadad besieged Samaria, Israel’s capital, and demanded heavy tribute. Ahab refused the demands and called a council of elders. As the Syrians were preparing to attack, a prophet advised Ahab to attack first (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.1-14">1 Kgs 20:1-14</a>). The Syrians were routed and Ben-hadad barely escaped with his life (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.15-22">1 Kgs 20:15-22</a>). The following year Ben-hadad mounted another attack on Ahab’s forces, was again defeated, and eventually surrendered to Ahab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.23-33">1 Kgs 20:23-33</a>). Ben-hadad gave up some Israelite cities that had been overrun by his father and granted Israel trading posts in Damascus (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.34">20:34</a>). God rebuked Ahab through a prophet for forming such an alliance with a pagan power (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.35-43">1 Kgs 20:35-43</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In Ahab’s last war with Syria, he had the advantage of an alliance with the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.2-4">1 Kgs 22:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-3">2 Chr 18:1-3</a>). That alliance had been fortified by the marriage of Ahab’s daughter Athaliah to Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat. Ahab proposed a campaign for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead in the northeast corner of Israel. When Jehoshaphat refused to believe the optimistic predictions of Ahab’s 400 prophets, a prophet of God named Micaiah was called, who foretold Ahab’s death (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.5-28">1 Kgs 22:5-28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.4-27">2 Chr 18:4-27</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">For the battle with Syria, Jehoshaphat put on his royal robes. Ahab tried to disguise himself as an ordinary soldier, but a Syrian archer hit him between the joints of his armor. Ahab died that evening, and his troops gave up the battle. His chariot and armor were washed beside the pool of Samaria, where, as Elijah had prophesied, dogs licked Ahab’s blood. The fallen king was succeeded by his son Ahaziah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.29-40">1 Kgs 22:29-40</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.28-34">2 Chr 18:28-34</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">AHASUERUS</p>
<p class="list">1. Persian king better known to Western readers as Xerxes I (486–465 <span class="era">BC</span>); the son and successor of Darius I (Hystaspis). In <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">Ezra 4:6</a> Ahasuerus is mentioned as receiving letters of accusation from enemies of the Jews about their rebuilding the temple.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ahasuerus played a role in biblical history in the book of Esther. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, in the third year of his reign Xerxes (Ahasuerus) convoked an assembly of his leaders to plan an invasion of Greece. The book of Esther begins with a banquet scene probably reflecting that situation. The Greek campaign, begun in 480 <span class="era">BC</span>, was unsuccessful. Afterward, Xerxes turned to private matters, such as the events recorded in Esther. The Jewish heroine of that book was the second wife of Xerxes (Ahasuerus). She and her cousin Mordecai influenced the king to reverse an edict condemning all Jews to death. Ahasuerus hanged Haman, his chief minister, who had asked for the edict.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ahasuerus, who controlled an immense area “from India to Ethiopia” (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.1">Est 1:1</a>), was celebrated for massive building projects at Susa and Persepolis.

  <title>Ahaz</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AHAZ</p>
<p class="list">1. King of Judah (735–715 <span class="era">BC</span>) who was especially remembered for his apostasy. The name Ahaz (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.9">Mt 1:9</a>) is a shortened form of Ahaziah or Jehoahaz. The three main accounts of Ahaz (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.1-20">2 Kgs 16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.1-27">2 Chr 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-25">Is 7</a>) treat him as one of the most evil rulers of the southern kingdom of Judah. Consequently, his burial was relatively dishonorable (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.27">2 Chr 28:27</a>). He was succeeded by his son Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1">2 Kgs 18:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is little agreement on the chronology of this section of the OT. The chronological system that seems to have the fewest problems would place Ahaz’s accession in 735 <span class="era">BC</span>. If he first came to the throne as co-regent with his father, Jotham, from 735 to 732 <span class="era">BC</span>, his entire reign covered a span of approximately 20 years, ending in 715 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ahaz reigned over Judah during a critical time in the history of the ancient Near East. The Assyrians were pushing westward, threatening the Syro-Palestinian area. Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin, king of Syria, adopted a policy of resistance against the Assyrians and invaded Judah in order to effect a solid coalition by deposing Ahaz.</p>
<p class="list-text">Blatantly revealing a lack of trust in God, Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-pileser III, the Assyrian king, for help. That appeal brought the wrath of the prophet Isaiah upon Ahaz. The ensuing encounter (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-25">Is 7</a>) led to Isaiah’s prediction of the birth of Immanuel as a sign of the dissolution of the countries of Israel and Syria. Those two kingdoms were ultimately destroyed by Tiglath-pileser in a campaign that lasted about two years (734–732 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AhazSLackOfFaith"/>
<p class="list-text">Before the two kingdoms to the north were conquered by Assyria, their invasion of Judah caused great turmoil (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.8">2 Chr 28:8</a>). The invaders not only carried off much spoil but also attempted to depopulate portions of Judah by taking 200,000 people captive to Samaria. That attempt was protested by a prophet in Samaria named Obed, who condemned the act of slavery and ordered the captives returned (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.9">9</a>). He was joined by several leaders of Israel (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.12">12</a>), who succeeded in having the captives returned to Jericho with provisions from the spoil that had been taken.</p>
<p class="list-text">During that time, the kingdom of Judah may have been threatened from the south as well. The Edomites, who had long been under the domination of Judah, may have taken advantage of Judah’s growing internal weakness to assert their independence. The Masoretic Text of the OT refers to an invasion of the seaport town of Elath on the Red Sea by Aram, the Hebrew name for Syria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.6">2 Kgs 16:6</a>). The name Aram is quite similar to the name Edom in Hebrew, however, so many scholars think that invasion was actually by Edomites.</p>
<p class="list-text">By virtue of the alliance he had made, Ahaz placed his country in a dangerous position of dependence on Assyria. The kingdom of Judah became essentially a vassal state under the tacit control of Tiglath-pileser. Ahaz went to Damascus, the capital of fallen Syria, to appear before Tiglath-pileser, possibly to assure his allegiance to the king to whom his nation had become tributary (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10">2 Kgs 16:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">While in Damascus, Ahaz saw an Assyrian altar, a model of which he sent back to Judah. Under the direction of Uriah the priest, a similar altar was built in Jerusalem, replacing the original bronze altar. Several other alterations were made in the temple by Ahaz, all indicating his turning away from Jewish religion.</p>
<p class="list-text">The “dial of Ahaz” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.11">2 Kgs 20:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.8">Is 38:8</a>) later figured in a sign given to his son Hezekiah; the Hebrew word actually refers to a flight of stairs, no doubt built by Ahaz and used to tell time by the movement of a shadow across it.</p>

  <title>Ahaziah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AHAZIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Ahab’s son, who ruled the northern kingdom of Israel for two years as its ninth king (853–852 <span class="era">BC</span>). He came to the throne when Ahab was killed while trying to recover Ramoth-gilead from Syrian control. Ahaziah was a contemporary of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and of Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram. Politically, his short reign was characterized by peace with Judah, in contrast with the days of Asa and Baasha (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.37">2 Chr 20:37</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48-49">1 Kgs 22:48-49</a>). No sooner had he become king than he was compelled to launch an expedition against Mesha of Moab, who had ceased paying tribute to Israel.</p>
<p class="list-text">Evidently Ahaziah followed not only the corrupt religion of Jeroboam I but also the overt Baal worship of his parents, Ahab and Jezebel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.51-53">1 Kgs 22:51-53</a>). The first chapter of 2 Kings is devoted to Ahaziah’s terminal illness. He fell from the second story of his palace and was seriously injured. Instead of turning to the Lord for aid, he turned to the god of Jezebel, “Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron.” When the prophet Elijah condemned the king for his actions, Ahaziah, enraged, tried to arrest him. Two groups of soldiers were consumed by fire from God, a sign of victory over Baal since Baal was worshiped as the god of fire and lightning by his followers. Ahaziah died as predicted in Elijah’s pronouncement from God (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.2-18">2 Kgs 1:2-18</a>). He was succeeded by his younger brother, Jehoram, at a time when Ahaziah’s brother-in-law, also named Jehoram, was king of Judah.</p>
<p class="list">2. The son of Jehoram of Judah, grandson of Jehoshaphat and nephew of the Ahaziah just described. He ruled as the sixth king of Judah for only one year (841 BC) at the age of 22 (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.25-26">2 Kgs 8:25-26</a>). The apostasy of the northern kingdom of Israel reached into the southern kingdom of Judah partly because this Ahaziah was a grandson of Ahab and Jezebel (his mother, Athaliah, was their daughter).</p>
<p class="list-text">Ahaziah joined his uncle Jehoram of Israel (sometimes abbreviated Joram) in a campaign against King Hazael of Syria. In the battle Jehoram was wounded and went to Jezreel to recover. When Ahaziah went to visit his fallen kinsman at the royal residence at Jezreel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.22.7-9">2 Chr 22:7-9</a>), the visit proved to be a fatal mistake. Jehu, the army commander, anointed by Elisha to destroy Ahab’s descendants (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-13">2 Kgs 9:1-13</a>), seized this opportunity to kill both Joram and Ahaziah together (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.14-29">9:14-29</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, learned of his death, she seized the throne for herself and tried to kill all of his children. One child, Joash, escaped death and eventually became king (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1-21">2 Kgs 11:1-21</a>). Ahaziah’s name is sometimes given as Jehoahaz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.17">2 Chr 21:17</a>) or Azariah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.22.6">2 Chr 22:6</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; cf. <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg).</p>

<p class="h1">AHITHOPHEL</p>
<p class="fl">King David’s trusted counselor who turned traitor and joined Absalom’s conspiracy. Ahithophel’s counsel was highly regarded, almost as though it were an oracle of God (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.23">2 Sm 16:23</a>). On hearing about Ahithophel’s defection to Absalom, David prayed, “O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, let Ahithophel give Absalom foolish advice!” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.31">2 Sm 15:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Ahithophel advised Absalom to take over the royal harem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.20-22">2 Sm 16:20-22</a>). Taking possession of the harem was a public act declaring a former king to be deceased and replaced. Since David was still alive, the act was meant to bring about a final cleavage between David and Absalom. It also fulfilled Nathan’s prophecy to David that because David had taken another man’s wife in secret, his own wives would be taken from him in public (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.7-12">2 Sm 12:7-12</a>).</p>
<p>Ahithophel’s second stratagem was to attack David quickly with 12,000 elite troops (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.1-3">2 Sm 17:1-3</a>). Absalom rejected this advice, however, and accepted a counter suggestion by Hushai, David’s spy in Absalom’s palace. In a speech designed to inflate Absalom’s ego and gain time for David, Hushai advised a full campaign (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.4-14">2 Sm 17:4-14</a>). When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he went to his hometown and hanged himself (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.23">2 Sm 17:23</a>).</p>

The name suggests a “ruin” of special significance or striking appearance. The inhabitants of Ai, as well as those of other Canaanite cities (Shechem, Bethel, Jerusalem), did not hinder Abraham in his meanderings in the hill country throughout the land. Abraham may have met with representatives of those cities and convinced their kings of his peaceful intentions. Or he may have presented such a strong front with his sizable entourage that he forestalled any Canaanite move against him.</p>
<p>The people of Israel, led by Joshua, entered Canaan, the Promised Land, with the intention of ridding it of its former occupants and claiming it as their inheritance. Ai, the second city to face them, withstood the first Israelite attack against it. After dealing with Achan, a disobedient soldier whose taking of booty from Jericho had caused their defeat, the Israelites attacked Ai a second time and defeated it (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-8.29">Jos 7:1–8:29</a>). Joshua captured the king, executed him, and burned the city, leaving it a heap of ruins (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1">Jos 10:1</a>).</p>
<p>Ai, rebuilt and reoccupied during the monarchy (under Saul, David, and Solomon), seems to have been known under several names. It was evidently called Ayyah, one of the villages of Ephraim (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.28">1 Chr 7:28</a>); Aiath, a village through which Assyrian armies marched toward Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.28">Is 10:28</a>); and Aija, a village occupied by Benjamin’s descendants during the exilic period (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.31">Neh 11:31</a>).</p>

<p class="list">1. City located in a valley 15 miles (24 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem (at modern Yalo) and originally allotted to Dan’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.42">Jos 19:42</a>). Aijalon was designated as one of four levitical cities in Dan’s area (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.24">Jos 21:24</a>) and was later made a city of refuge by Ephraim’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.69">1 Chr 6:69</a>). Dan’s tribe had by then migrated north, having been unable to occupy its southerly allotment, including Aijalon (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.34-36">Jgs 1:34-36</a>). Near Aijalon, Saul and Jonathan won a victory over the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.31">1 Sm 14:31</a>). Members of Benjamin’s tribe occupied it at one time (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.13">1 Chr 8:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When the kingdom was divided after Solomon’s death, Aijalon, on the northwest border of the southern kingdom, was fortified by King Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.10">2 Chr 11:10</a>).

<p class="h1">AKIBA*, RABBI</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish leader, prominent about <span class="era">AD</span> 110–135. Akiba came from a humble background and began his scholarly training at the age of 40. Having attained recognition in rabbinical study, he taught at his own school in Bene-berak, near Jaffa. During the Jewish uprising against the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 132–135, Akiba was arrested for teaching the Jewish laws and willingly suffered a martyr’s death. He had strongly supported the revolutionary leader Bar-Kochba, holding him to be the long-awaited Messiah. Akiba’s rabbinical activities fall into three categories.</p>
<p>Akiba was at Jabneh (Jamnia) when discussions were held there (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 90) concerning books to be included in the Jewish Scriptures and those to be left out. The discussions were less concerned with admitting new books than with reaffirming the canonical status of books that had come into question, especially Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs.</p>
<p>Akiba had a view of biblical interpretation that differed from other rabbis. For example, Rabbi Ishmael held that the language of Scripture was to be treated as ordinary human language, following the same grammar, word meanings, etc. In contrast, Akiba insisted that Scripture was to be interpreted in a way that was not applicable to ordinary language. Ordinary language might allow different spellings of the same word with no difference in meaning, for example; but if such a thing happened in Scripture, to Akiba there had to be some reason. Other schools of interpretation accused him of twisting language to force his own interpretations on Scripture. Akiba encouraged a scholar named Aquila to make a Greek translation of the Scriptures that would embody his principles of interpretation. Aquila’s translation was therefore overliteral; because it disregarded standard principles of grammar, it cannot be said to be acceptable Greek.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">ALEXANDER</p>
<p class="list">1. The Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (356–323 BC), whose life has influenced history and culture for more than two millennia, down to the present time. He was a brilliant organizer and military strategist, but his greatest achievement was the Hellenization of the empire he won. This Greek cultural influence was a unifying element among many diverse peoples.</p>
<p class="list-text">The introduction of the Greek language throughout this empire also had far-reaching effect. The OT was translated into Greek in Alexandria, Egypt, and the NT books were written in that language. The earliest Christian missionaries were bilingual, so that it was possible to bring the gospel “to the Jew first, and also to the Greek” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Alexander was the son of an illustrious father, Philip II of Macedon. A seasoned military leader in his teens, Alexander succeeded to the throne at the age of 20 after the assassination of his father. After putting down the rebellions that broke out at his father’s death, Alexander crossed the Dardanelles and conquered Asia Minor. In 333 <span class="era">BC</span>, he met and defeated the vaunted Persian army of Darius III at Issus, in a battle that had a lasting historical significance. Moving down the Mediterranean coast, he captured Sidon, Tyre, and Gaza. Reaching Egypt in 332 <span class="era">BC</span>, he was hailed by the oracle of Amon at Siwa as the divine pharaoh. He founded Alexandria, one of the more than 60 cities he established with this name, and then pushed on to the East. At Arbela (331 <span class="era">BC</span>), he again defeated the Persians. When he reached Persia, he seized the cities of Susa, Persepolis, and Ecbatana. He forged eastward until he reached the Indus River; here, with his troops worn out and threatening mutiny, he turned back toward the West. He died in Babylon in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, a victim of fever, exhaustion, and dissipation, and master of an empire that stretched from the Danube to the Indus and south to the Egyptian Nile.</p>

<p class="list">4. Ephesian who was put forward by the Jews to serve as their spokesman when the silversmith Demetrius roused the Ephesians to riot (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.33">Acts 19:33</a>). The preaching of the gospel by Paul and his companions had resulted in the conversion of many people, who left the worship of the goddess Artemis (Diana) and thus reduced the income of the silversmiths, whose revenue derived from the manufacture of images of this deity (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-41">Acts 19:23-41</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. One who, with Hymenaeus, was mentioned as having shipwrecked his faith because of his rejection of conscience (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.20">1 Tm 1:20</a>). Paul states that he had “turned them over to Satan so they would learn not to blaspheme God.”</p>
<p class="list">6. Coppersmith (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.14">2 Tm 4:14</a>). Paul warns Timothy to beware of this man, who had done much harm to Paul and had strongly opposed the message of the gospel.

Janneus had advised his wife to make peace with the Pharisees who had rebelled against him. She took that advice, being the sister of a famous Pharisaic leader, Simon ben Shetach. Salome Alexandra reigned for almost a decade (76–67 <span class="era">BC</span>), a peaceful period during which the Pharisees won considerable power and were first admitted to the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish assembly. By the time of Christ, the Pharisees had about equaled the Sadducees in power in the Sanhedrin. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Hasmonean_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Hasmonean</a>.</p>

  <title>Alexandria</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ALEXANDRIA</p>
<p class="fl">Egyptian city established by Alexander the Great in 331 <span class="era">BC</span>. Alexandria was the capital city of Egypt through the Hellenistic and Roman periods and, next to Rome, was the most important city in the ancient world. It was built at the western edge of the Nile River delta on a peninsula between the mainland of Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Its harbor was protected by the island of Pharos, site of a huge lighthouse (the Pharos of Alexandria), one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Pharos formed the top of a “T,” the stem of which was a long mole running out from the peninsula; on both sides of the “T” lay the ancient harbor.</p>
<p>Alexander built the city to provide a military base, harbor facilities, and trading center with which to control Egypt and the East. The city was laid out in a grid, with two tree-lined streets, about 200 feet (61 meters) wide, that intersected in the middle. It was divided into three districts: Jews in the northeast, Egyptians in the west, and Greeks to the south.</p>
<p>Alexandria was famous in antiquity for its architecture: the lighthouse; the Museum, greatest library and learning center of the Hellenistic age; the mausoleum of Alexander, built by Ptolemy, one of his successors; the Serapeum, a temple to Pan (in the shape of a pine cone, according to the geographer Strabo); and the commercial buildings. Archaeological evidence of these structures of the ancient city is remarkably scarce. An earthquake damaged the lighthouse in <span class="era">AD</span> 796, and it was completely destroyed some 500 years later. Only one scroll holder and a statue have been found from the Museum.</p>
<p>Alexandria played a key role in the history of the Greco-Roman world. When Alexander the Great died in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, Egypt fell to Ptolemy, one of his four generals. Ptolemy established a dynasty that continued until Cleopatra. Because of Alexander’s destruction of Tyre, Alexandria became the Hellenistic center of commerce with the East and with central Egypt. Julius Caesar’s romance with Cleopatra led to the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty.</p>
<p>The Museum, not a museum in the modern sense, was actually a university and library. Founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus, it made Alexandria the intellectual center of the Greek world, with emphasis on grammatical studies, literary criticism, and textual preservation. Before its partial destruction by Egyptians and Julius Caesar’s forces in 47 <span class="era">BC</span>, it reportedly housed 700,000 volumes, including carefully edited texts of the Greek classics. In the late Hellenistic and Roman periods, the Museum turned in the direction of the new sciences, exemplified by the building of a great lighthouse that could be seen by ingenious use of mirrors 20 miles (32 kilometers) at sea.</p>
<p>From its inception Alexandria had a large Jewish population. Under the patronage of the Ptolemies, Jewish scholars produced the Greek translation of the OT known as the Septuagint. Ethnic tension in the city grew as the Jewish populace increased and prospered. In <span class="era">AD</span> 42 the tension erupted into riots by the Greeks and the expulsion of Jews from the gentile sections into which they had spread. Jewish commercial success, particularly in the wheat trade, led to intensified anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>There is little reference to Alexandria in Scripture. Stephen, who became the first Christian martyr, debated with “Jews from Alexandria” in Jerusalem concerning Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>). Apollos, described as “an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures,” was a native of Alexandria (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24">Acts 18:24</a>). The apostle Paul made his sea journey to Rome aboard two Alexandrian ships (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.6">Acts 27:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.11">28:11</a>).</p>
<p>The earliest emphasis in biblical studies at Alexandria was Gnostic, under Basilides and continuing under his son Isidore. Later, an allegorizing school developed, with regular support by wealthy patrons and an organized curriculum. Clement and Origen are the names most often associated with this school. The teaching emphasized three levels of meaning in the Scriptures: historical, ethical, and spiritual.</p>
<p>Arianism, a powerful heresy, was later formulated in Alexandria by Arius, presbyter of Alexandria. This school of thought denied the eternality of Christ, arguing that since he was begotten he therefore had a beginning. The chief opponent of Arianism, Athanasius, was also from Alexandria. It was primarily through his efforts that the heretical teaching was dissipated in the fourth century and the Symbol of Nicaea confirmed at the Council of Constantinople in <span class="era">AD</span> 381.</p>

  <title>Allegory*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ALLEGORY*</p>
<p class="fl">A method of interpretation (“allegorizing”), especially biblical interpretation, that seeks to find a deeper moral, theological, spiritual meaning behind the words and literal imagery of the text.</p>
<p>Allegory began among the ancient Greeks, for whom the writings of such epic poets as Hesiod and Homer provided the basis for religion and piety. Later developments in the understandings of life and the universe made these writings appear obsolete. Further, with the passage of time, the significance and identity of some literal expressions of historical, geographic, cultural, and social elements in the poets were lost. In order to maintain the validity of their traditions, interpreters began to employ ingenious schemes through which abiding truths and values were sought by using the objective, literal features of the texts as symbols pointing beyond themselves.</p>
<p>Hellenistic Judaism, best exemplified by the first-century Philo of Alexandria, used allegory to make the OT relevant in the Greco-Roman world. Later, a group of Christian interpreters centered around Alexandria employed allegory as their principal method of handling both the OT and NT. In one form or another allegory was the dominant interpretative method of the Middle Ages. It continues to be highly regarded by some pietistically and mystically oriented contemporary Christians, both Protestant and Roman Catholic.</p>
<p>Since allegorizing is a highly individualized interpretative method, its features widely differ from one practitioner to another. For all allegorists the obvious, literal, objective features and meaning of a text are either irrelevant or of only secondary importance; the significant or true meanings may well be dissociated from objective statements or the historical setting. In more advanced applications of the method the external and obvious are irrelevant and even the historicity of an account is of no consequence. Indeed, the understanding and intention of the original author may count for nothing in determining the “true,” “spiritual” meaning of a biblical passage. External and obvious features of a writing are but clues pointing beyond themselves to spiritual meanings. Hence the allegorist makes free use of devices that establish arbitrary connections between ancient and contemporary events, seeks alleged meanings and derivations of word roots or the supposed relationship between similar words and sounds, and emphasizes prepositions. He assigns symbolic significance to individual parts such as persons, places, things, numbers, colors, and the like and may claim to discover truth hidden even in the shapes of letters.</p>
<p>Although the allegorical method has had a long history in the Christian church (and indeed is once specifically used by Paul in <a href="?bref=Gal.4.24,26">Gal 4:24, 26</a>), it has inherent difficulties. These led the Reformers Luther and Calvin to reject allegory as a valid method of interpreting Scripture. The most serious problems include allegory’s separation of the meaning of the text from its plain statements in their original historical-grammatical-cultural setting and its inability to provide a basis for evaluating competing, contradictory interpretations of the same passage. Allegory provides no “controls” to protect the interpreter from reading his own meanings into Scripture rather than drawing out the Scripture’s more objective message.</p>

  <title>Alliance</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ALLIANCE</p>
<p class="fl">Close association of powerful individuals or nations for a common objective. Such alliances were ratified by various means, including gifts, oaths, dowries and marriages, and covenants.</p>
<p>In patriarchal times Israelites entered into alliances with foreign nations without hesitation. Abraham had an alliance with three Amorites: Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.13,24">Gn 14:13, 24</a>) and with Abimelech, king of Gerar (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.22-34">Gn 21:22-34</a>). Isaac also made an alliance with Abimelech (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.26-31">Gn 26:26-31</a>). Later, Moses forbade the Israelites to make alliances with the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.31-33">Ex 23:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.12">34:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-4">Dt 7:1-4</a>), primarily for religious reasons. In the time of the judges the Israelites were reminded of that command (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-3">Jgs 2:1-3</a>), but <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">Joshua 9</a> tells how Israel was tricked into making an alliance with the Gibeonites.</p>
<p>During the period of the monarchy, various kings formed alliances and intermarried with foreigners. David (before he was king of all Israel) made an agreement with Achish, king of Gath, under which he was expected to fight with the Philistines against the Israelite army of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.1">1 Sm 27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.28.2">28:2</a>). Solomon made alliances for the purpose of trade with Hiram of Tyre (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-18">1 Kgs 5:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">9:26-28</a>) and with the king of Egypt (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.16">1 Kgs 9:16</a>). After the division of the kingdom, Asa formed an alliance with the king of Syria, Ben-hadad (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.18-20">1 Kgs 15:18-20</a>). Shortly thereafter, Ahab, King of Israel, joined Jehoshaphat in fighting Syria (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-4">1 Kgs 22:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-13">2 Chr 18:1-13</a>). About a century later, King Pekah of Israel formed an alliance with Rezin, king of Syria, to fight Ahaz, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-9">Is 7:1-9</a>), and Ahaz in turn made an alliance with Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, to fight against Pekah and Rezin (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7-9">2 Kgs 16:7-9</a>). The last king of Judah, Zedekiah, made an alliance with Egypt against the Babylonians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.20">2 Kgs 24:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.1-21">Ez 17:1-21</a>). In general these alliances brought foreign cults into Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10-18">2 Kgs 16:10-18</a>) and led the prophets to cry out against them (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.8-10">Hos 8:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.1-3,15-16">Is 30:1-3, 15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.18">Jer 2:18</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ALLOTMENT OF THE LAND</p>
<p class="fl">Assignment of large territories of the Promised Land of Canaan to the 12 tribes of Israel following the Conquest. The specific territory in Canaan to be occupied by each of the 12 tribes of Israel was not left to their own initiative. They were not to possess whatever land they could wrest for themselves by military conquest. Rather, they were ordered to fight unitedly and then divide the total area by casting lots—a method analogous to drawing straws or tossing a coin. The same method was used at other times in Bible history as a means of determining the divine will. Besides avoiding arguments or intertribal fighting, the procedure had theological significance. The outcome was placed solely in God’s hands (see <a href="?bref=Pr.16.33">Prv 16:33</a>). The Lord thereby reminded his people that the land was his to apportion as he saw fit. In <a href="?bref=Num.26.52-56">Numbers 26:52-56</a> the Lord’s order for such a lottery was given (see also <a href="?bref=Num.34.1-29">Nm 34</a>). In Joshua chapters <a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-19.22">13–19</a> the allotment was planned and carried out at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.51">19:51</a>).</p>
<p>Assignment of the southern part of Transjordan to two and a half tribes had already been made by Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>). West of the Jordan the remaining nine and a half tribes received portions by lot after their faithful leader, Caleb, got his choice of the region around Hebron. The order in which the tribes were named somewhat follows their relative locations. The territory of the major southern tribe, Judah, included Caleb’s lands and extended north to the yet unconquered Jerusalem. Next came the large central portions of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the patriarch Joseph’s sons. Benjamin’s area lay between Judah and Ephraim. Then Simeon’s territory was named, lying in southern Judah. The remaining tribes listed in <a href="?bref=Josh.19.1-51">Joshua 19</a>, with one exception, received territorial inheritance north of Manasseh. They were Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan. Dan’s tribe drew an allotment west of Judah, but because the Philistines held the coastline, Dan’s tribe migrated north and renamed the captured city of Lachish for their tribal ancestor, Dan (see <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">Jgs 18</a>). From then on, “from Dan to Beersheba” meant all of Israel.</p>
<p>Such a method of assigning real estate seems strange to present-day economics, yet with respect to the customs of that time, it made theological sense. Kings and emperors in the ancient Near East were considered sovereign representatives of their gods. They held the ownership right to all lands and gave portions to whomever they pleased. From the time of the exodus, Israel was a theocracy. God was king. No human authority was sovereign or possessed sovereign property rights. God was the Israelites’ sole benefactor.</p>

<p class="h1">ALMS</p>
<p class="fl">Charitable gifts. The practice of giving alms to the poor. The English word “alms” comes from a longer Greek word used in the Septuagint (ancient Greek translation of the OT) to translate a Hebrew word for “righteousness.” The Hebrew term, in general, is unrelated to almsgiving; consequently the OT has no literal reference to almsgiving. Nevertheless, the Israelites were expected to care for the unfortunate in their midst. The Mosaic law contains many admonitions to treat the poor justly and humanely. Important among them is <a href="?bref=Deut.15.7-11">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>, which, while recognizing the inevitable existence of poverty, commands Israel to take alleviating action. Thus, every seventh year all fields and gardens were to remain unharvested for the benefit of the poor and disadvantaged (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.10-11">Ex 23:10-11</a>). Every third year one-tenth of all produce had to be given to the Levites (a Hebrew tribe that had no property), the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.28-29">Dt 14:28-29</a>). Forgotten sheaves and the gleanings from grain fields at each harvest were left for the needy and the stranger (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.9">Lv 19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.22">23:22</a>); from every vineyard and olive grove, any fallen fruit and the imperfect and topmost clusters were reserved for them (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.10">Lv 19:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.20-21">Dt 24:20-21</a>). Likewise, festival pilgrims were expected to share food with those in need (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.11-14">Dt 16:11-14</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="JesusViewOnAlmsgiving"/>
<p>The OT prophets continued to champion the theme of benevolent treatment for the poor. The strongest expressions of the social justice theme are found in Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.23">1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.15">3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.1-2">10:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.4-5">11:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.5-10">58:5-10</a>) and Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-8">2:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.11">5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.4">8:4</a>). Similarly, the Psalms and “Wisdom Literature” (Jb; Prv; Eccl) depict the plight of the poor, holding out hope to the afflicted and appealing to others to take up their cause or to improve their condition. The appeals were based on the conviction that all human beings are created by the one God, who had commanded Israel to deal with the unfortunate in their midst with a compassion that went beyond charity to justice.</p>
<p>During the intertestamental period the giving of alms acquired more importance. The general command to show loving-kindness (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18</a>) became defined as specific individual acts believed to contribute to personal merit and security. Thus, “almsgiving atones for sin” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.3.30">Ecclus 3:30</a>) and “delivers from death” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.4.10">Tb 4:10</a>). Along with prayer and fasting, almsgiving was elevated as one of the most important expressions of Jewish piety (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.12.8-9">Tb 12:8-9</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ALTAR</p>
<p class="fl">The platform upon which offerings are made to the deity. This may include a ritual sacrifice of animals or a burning of incense before God (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.1-10">Ex 30:1-10</a>). The Hebrew word for altar and the verb “to slaughter” both derive from the same root word; they are terms used in connection with the ritual of sacrificing animals to God as a covering for sin. The Greek terms also point to sacrificing animals. The practice was not peculiar to Israel but was widely known in the ancient Middle East. Israel’s immediate neighbors, the Canaanites, had their own altars and rituals. The altar was always a raised-up place.</p>
<p>The Bible refers to several altars built by the patriarchs. Noah offered burnt offerings (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20">Gn 8:20</a>). Abraham built an altar at Shechem (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.7">Gn 12:7</a>), another at Bethel (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.8">Gn 12:8</a>), and one on Mt Moriah (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.9">Gn 22:9</a>). Isaac built an altar at Beersheba (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.25">Gn 26:25</a>), and Jacob at Shechem (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.20">Gn 33:20</a>) and Bethel (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.7">Gn 35:7</a>). Moses built one at Rephidim (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.15">Ex 17:15</a>) and another at Horeb (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">Ex 24:4</a>). In each case the altar was erected to commemorate an event in which God had helped the offerer.</p>
<p>Two altars were used in the tabernacle. One, measuring 5 by 5 by 3 cubits (7.5 by 7.5 by 4.5 feet; 2.3 by 2.3 by 1.4 meters), was made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze and used for burnt offerings (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.1-8">Ex 27:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.1-7">38:1-7</a>). The other, smaller one, the golden altar, was about 18 inches (45 centimeters) square and 3 feet (90 centimeters) high, and was used to burn incense before the veil (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.1-10">Ex 30:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.40.5">40:5</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Exod.20.24-26">Exodus 20:24-26</a>, instructions were given to Israel to make an altar of earth or of unhewn stones, upon which burnt offerings and peace offerings were to be made in every place where God caused his name to dwell. This very general prescription seems to have allowed various individuals to erect an altar from time to time. Joshua built an altar on Mt Ebal (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-31">Jos 8:30-31</a>); the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built one in Transjordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.10-16">Jos 22:10-16</a>); Gideon built one in Ophrah (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.24">Jgs 6:24</a>); the family of David in Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.6,29">1 Sm 20:6, 29</a>); David at the threshing floor of Araunah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.25">2 Sm 24:25</a>); and Elijah on Mt Carmel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.30">1 Kgs 18:30</a>). Apart from Elijah’s altar these all predated Solomon’s temple.</p>
<p>There were two altars in Solomon’s temple. One was 20 cubits square (about 25 feet; 7.6 meters) and 10 cubits high (about 12.5 feet; 3.8 meters). It was made of bronze and used for burnt offerings. It remained the center of temple worship until the temple was destroyed, although in the days of King Ahaz it was removed from its place to the northern side of the temple at the command of the Assyrian ruler Tiglath-pileser (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.14">2 Kgs 16:14</a>). It was later restored to its proper place by Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.18">2 Chr 29:18</a>). The second, the incense altar, stood in front of the veil. It was made of cedar and overlaid with gold (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.20-22">1 Kgs 6:20-22</a>).</p>
<p>During the exile, when the temple lay in ruins, Ezekiel had a vision of the restored temple in Jerusalem. There was an elaborate altar of burnt offering, rising in three terraces to a height of 10 cubits (17.5 feet; 5.3 meters) and resting on a base about 20 cubits (35 feet; 10.6 meters) square. Although the altar was visionary, it emphasized the need for atonement in Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.13-17">Ez 43:13-17</a>). No reference is made to an incense altar.</p>
<p>Zerubbabel built an altar of burnt offerings (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2">Ezr 3:2</a>) that Antiochus Epiphanes desecrated with a “desolating sacrilege,” probably an image of Zeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.54">1 Macc 1:54</a>). There was also an altar of incense. Antiochus Epiphanes carried off the golden altar (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.21">1 Macc 1:21</a>) in 169 <span class="era">BC</span>. Both were later restored by Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.44-49">1 Macc 4:44-49</a>).</p>

<p>In Christian worship no altar was required, since in the death of Jesus Christ the final sacrifice for sin had been made. There are numerous references to both the altar of burnt offering in the temple (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.23-24">Mt 5:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.18-20,35">23:18-20, 35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.51">Lk 11:51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.13">1 Cor 9:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.18">10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.13">Heb 7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.1">Rv 11:1</a>) and the altar of incense, both in the earthly temple (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.11">Lk 1:11</a>) and in the heavenly temple (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.9">Rv 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.5">8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.13">9:13</a>).</p>

  <title>Amalek, Amalekites</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AMALEK, AMALEKITES</p>
<p class="fl">Amalek was the son of Eliphaz (Esau’s son) by his concubine, Timna (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.12">Gn 36:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.36">1 Chr 1:36</a>). Descendants of this tribal chief of Edom were known as Amalekites. They settled in the Negev Desert and became allies of the Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, Ishmaelites, and Midianites. The Amalekites were notable enemies of Israel. Amalek inherited the fraternal feud that had begun with his grandfather Esau’s antagonism toward Jacob. Since Jacob was one of the progenitors of Israel, the conflict between Amalek and Israel had both a theological and political basis.</p>
<p>The territory of the nomadic Amalekites in the Negev ranged at times from south of Beersheba to the southeast as far as Elath and Ezion-geber. They undoubtedly raided westward into the coastal plain, eastward into the Arabah wastelands, and possibly over into Arabia. In the Negev they blocked the path of the Israelites during the exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">Ex 17:8-16</a>).</p>
<p>Israel’s first encounter with the warriors of Amalek came at Rephidim near Sinai. Moses stood on top of a hill and held up the rod of God until Israel won the battle, then built an altar and named it “The Lord Is My Banner” (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1,8-16">Ex 17:1, 8-16</a>). The Amalekites attacked stragglers during Israel’s desert wanderings (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.17-18">Dt 25:17-18</a>). After reaching the boundary of the Promised Land but rejecting Caleb and Joshua’s report of it, the unbelieving and disheartened Israelites attacked the Amalekites and were defeated (<a href="?bref=Num.14.39-45">Nm 14:39-45</a>).</p>
<p>When Balaam was summoned by King Balak of Moab to curse Israel, he turned his curse upon Moab and in his last oracle predicted the end of Amalek’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.24.20">Nm 24:20</a>). Moses, in his farewell speech, reminded the children of Israel that they had been harassed by Amalek’s descendants and should blot out all remembrance of the name Amalek (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.17-19">Dt 25:17-19</a>).</p>
<p>During the period of the judges Amalekites continued to occupy their traditional area and became associated with the Kenites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.5-6">1 Sm 15:5-6</a>), descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, who settled in the Negev south of Arad (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>). The Amalekites, still associated with other nomadic tribes (Moabites, Ammonites, Midianites), were rallied by Eglon, king of Moab, to defeat Israel and seize Jericho (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-14">Jgs 3:12-14</a>). The Song of Deborah cites Amalek as one of a coalition of tribes against Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.14">Jgs 5:14</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The name is omitted in a number of modern translations, and in others translated as “into the valley” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). However, Amalekite harassment is referred to in other passages of the time of Deborah and Barak (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.3,33">Jgs 6:3, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.7.12">7:12</a>). Gideon defeated the coalition (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.12-25">Jgs 7:12-25</a>), but there is no evidence that the Amalekites were driven out of the Negev.</p>
<p>According to 1 Samuel, Saul sent his armies out against the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47-48">14:47-48</a>) and received a command from God to destroy them and all their possessions (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.1-3">15:1-3</a>). He did attack their city (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.4-7">15:4-7</a>) but did not kill their king, Agag (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.8">15:8</a>). Saul distributed the choicest Amalekite livestock to his men (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.9">15:9</a>), for which the Lord condemned him and sent Samuel to tell him that his kingship was ended because of his sin (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.10-31">15:10-31</a>). Samuel then slaughtered Agag (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.32-35">15:32-35</a>). A remnant of Amalekites must have escaped, since they appeared again as David’s foes while he was still a young warrior (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.8">27:8</a>). He rescued his two wives carried off by Amalekites and killed most of the raiding party (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-20">30:1-20</a>). The Amalekites were Israel’s sworn enemies throughout King David’s reign (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.1">2 Sm 1:1</a>). They are listed among the enemies of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.12">2 Sm 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.11">1 Chr 18:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.83.7">Ps 83:7</a>). Destruction of the few surviving Amalekites came several hundred years after David during the reign of Hezekiah of the southern kingdom of Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.41-43">1 Chr 4:41-43</a>).</p>

  <title>Amarna Tablets*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AMARNA TABLETS*</p>
<p class="fl">Clay tablets, mostly letters from royal archives, the only cuneiform records ever found in Egypt. The 379 Amarna tablets were recovered from ruins located on a plain on the east bank of the Nile about 190 miles (305.7 kilometers) south of Cairo. The region is named after a tribe that settled there in modern times, the Beni Amran or Amarna tribe. The site of the ruins is mistakenly called Tell el-Amarna; <span class="ital">tell</span> is an Arabic word meaning “hill” or “mound,” but this site lies on a plain. A village in the area bears the name “el-Till,” and its name came to be annexed to the name el-Amarna.</p>
<p>The cuneiform script in which the tablets are written is a system that employs nail or wedge-shaped marks impressed into the writing material, usually clay, in many specific patterns. Each one of the patterns (called a “sign”) represents a sound or, sometimes, a word. Cuneiform script could be used to represent a number of different languages, just as Latin script can be used to represent English, French, German, etc. The language of the Amarna tablets, with only three exceptions, is a certain dialect of Akkadian. Although its homeland was the general area of Mesopotamia, that Semitic language came to be the language of international correspondence and diplomacy in the Near East during the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine of the tablets contain what appear to be copybook exercises for student scribes: lists of cuneiform signs, vocabulary lists, practice copies of sections of Mesopotamian mythological narratives. The other 350 texts are letters from the diplomatic correspondence of Amenophis III and Amenophis IV. The letters span a period of about 30 years, dating from sometime during the reign of Amenophis III to shortly after the death of Amenophis IV. They are mostly messages received from various local rulers and princes in Syria and Palestine, but there are also letters from monarchs of more powerful nations to the far north and east.</p>
<p>The letters show varying relationships between the Egyptian pharaoh and the writers. Some writers were considered as more or less equals of the pharaoh, the others as inferiors. Diplomatic relationships between the correspondents were often established by treaties and confirmed by marriages. Kings who were regarded as inferiors in their diplomatic relationship with the pharaoh referred to themselves as “your servant” and to the pharaoh as “my lord,” “my sun,” or sometimes as “my god.” Modern-day researchers call such underling rulers “vassals” and their domains, “vassal states”; the pharaoh in such a relationship is referred to as a suzerain. Rulers regarded as relative equals of the pharaoh referred to themselves as “your brother” and to the pharaoh as “my brother,” a relationship now described as a parity relationship.</p>
<p>The messages received by the pharaohs from their equals discuss such matters as exchange of gifts, negotiations for marriages, continuation of diplomatic ties, and promotion of commercial transactions. They also contain inventories of gifts sent or received and request presents, gold, or other goods. Such correspondence was received from rulers of the kingdoms of Babylonia, Mitanni, Assyria, Hatti (the Hittite kingdom), and Alashiya (Cyprus).</p>
<p>Of special interest are some letters from the Palestine area containing appeals for military assistance and references to military activity. Their mention of the “Habiru” was immediately connected with the word “Hebrew.” The Habiru were said to be at several locations in Palestine and to be “plundering all the lands of the king.” By fastening together several pieces of information, a conclusion was initially drawn that the Amarna letters came from the general period of the Hebrew exodus from Egypt and later invasion of Palestine under Joshua. Thus, some of the letters were taken to be firsthand reports of the invasion from the point of view of the inhabitants of Palestine.</p>
<p>However, reconsideration of the Amarna letters, along with other available information, soon showed that conclusion to be mistaken. The Habiru were not the invading Hebrews. The word “Habiru” is a dialect spelling of the word “Apiru.” This term, in both the Amarna letters and other texts, describes a class of people that may be called “outlaws” or “renegades.” People of various nationalities could be labeled “Apiru.” A person was not born an Apiru; rather he could join the Apiru or, because of his actions, become an Apiru. The Apiru ranged throughout Syria and Palestine and had no special homesite. At times groups of them hired themselves out as mercenary troops; at other times they acted as brigands. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Inscriptions_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Inscriptions</a>; <a href="?item=EgyptEgyptian_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Egypt, Egyptian</a>.</p>

  <title>Amaziah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AMAZIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Ninth king of Judah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>), who at age 25 succeeded his father, King Joash, when Joash was assassinated after a 40-year reign (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.19-21">2 Kgs 12:19-21</a>). Amaziah’s mother was Jehoaddin. He ruled Judah for 29 years before he too was killed by assassins (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.18-20">14:18-20</a>). When Amaziah began his reign, another Joash was ruling the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.1-2">14:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Amaziah was not like his ancestor David (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.3">2 Kgs 14:3</a>). Like his father, Amaziah did things that pleased God, but he failed to remove the pagan shrines that were corrupting the nation’s religious life. He himself was respectful of the law of Moses, at least at the beginning (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.4-6">14:4-6</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Amaziah was unwise in his dealings with the rival kingdom of Israel. To go to war against the Edomites, he hired 100,000 mercenaries from Israel. Warned by a prophet not to use them in battle, Amaziah discharged them. On their way out of Judah the angry soldiers raided cities and killed 3,000 people. Nevertheless, Amaziah’s troops were victorious against the Edomites. At the Valley of Salt they killed 10,000 of the enemy in battle and executed another 10,000 prisoners (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.5-13">2 Chr 25:5-13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Foolishly, Amaziah brought Edomite idols back with him after his conquest and was soon worshiping them. The Lord sent a prophet to announce Amaziah’s doom for such spiritual rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.14-16">2 Chr 25:14-16</a>). Proud of his conquest of Edom, Amaziah soon declared war on King Joash of Israel. Joash warned him in a parable that Judah would be crushed like a thistle. Amaziah refused to back down, and the two armies met at Beth-shemesh in Judah. Amaziah’s army was routed. Jerusalem was captured and the temple and palace looted. Amaziah was taken prisoner but was evidently left in Jerusalem. He outlived Joash of Israel by 15 years (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.17-26">2 Chr 25:17-26</a>). Amaziah was murdered in Lachish, to which he had fled when he heard about a plot against him in Jerusalem.

  <title>Amen</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AMEN</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word meaning “so it is” or “let it be,” derived from a verb meaning “to be firm or sure.” Some translations of the Bible always retain the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">amen</span> in the text. Others translate it by an expression such as “truly” or “I tell you the truth,” or sometimes omit it altogether. Because of its use in the OT, “amen” was also used in Christian worship and religious writings, including the Greek NT.</p>
<p>“Amen” has much more significance than merely being the last word in a prayer. In fact, that practice is not evidenced in the Bible and was not especially frequent in ancient times. In the nearly 30 times it is used in the OT, “amen” almost always occurs as a response to what has preceded. The significance of the response is that with it the people adopted what had just been said as if it were their own. For example, in <a href="?bref=Deut.27.15-26">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a> (where “amen” appears 12 times) the people responded with “amen” after each statement of a curse directed toward those who disobey God. Similarly, “amen” is used as a response after statements of promise (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.5">Jer 11:5</a>) or of praise and thanksgiving (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.36">1 Chr 16:36</a>), and as a conclusion to the first four of the five “books” of Psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.41.13">Pss 41:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.72.19">72:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.52">89:52</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.48">106:48</a>). The only exceptions in the OT are two occurrences in <a href="?bref=Isa.65.16">Isaiah 65:16</a>. There, the phrase “the God of amen” (or “the God of truth”) stresses that God is the one who is “firm”; that is, he is completely trustworthy and faithfully fulfills his promises.</p>
<p>The use of “amen” as a response to a preceding statement is continued in the NT epistles and book of Revelation. It appears after doxologies (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.21">Eph 3:21</a>), benedictions (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.18">Gal 6:18</a>), the giving of thanks (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.16">1 Cor 14:16</a>), prophecy (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.7">Rv 1:7</a>), and statements of praise (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.12">Rv 7:12</a>). From <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.16">1 Corinthians 14:16</a> it is clear that a response of “amen” after a statement of thanks was a means for worshipers to participate by showing agreement with what had been said.</p>

  <title>Ammi</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AMMI</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word meaning “my people.” The expression “people of God” is the most common designation for the nation of Israel in the OT. It originated in God’s promise to Moses before the exodus: “I will make you my own special people <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">‘ammi</span><span class="ital">),</span> and I will be your God” (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.7">Ex 6:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). For Israel to be called “my people” emphasized the unique personal nature of their religion in contrast with the idolatry of neighboring nations. The word represented God’s love for them and his faithfulness to the promises he had made to their forefathers (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.37">Dt 4:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.8">7:8</a>). In return for the privileges the name implied, God required faithfulness and obedience from Israel. Yet repeatedly the people of Israel failed, and repeatedly the prophets reminded them of their responsibility to God.</p>
<p>An example of such prophetic warning is found in the writings of Hosea. The prophet saw in his own marriage to an adulterous wife a picture of God’s relationship to his people: God had joined himself to a people who had forsaken him for other gods. The names Hosea gave his children reflected God’s attitude toward his unfaithful people. The first child was named Jezreel (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.4">Hos 1:4</a>), a name with a double meaning. As the name of the place where King Ahab murdered Naboth (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-16">1 Kgs 21:1-16</a>), it recalled a terrible experience in Israel’s history. But the name also means “God sows,” and expressed Hosea’s hope that the people of Israel, despite all their failures, would soon return to God. A second child was named Lo-ruhamah (“Not pitied,” <a href="?bref=Hos.1.6">Hos 1:6</a>). That name expressed God’s hatred for disobedience and his inclination to turn from an unrepentant people. Hosea’s third child was named Lo-ammi (“Not my people,” <a href="?bref=Hos.1.9">Hos 1:9</a>). That name represented ultimate tragedy for Israel: dissolution of God’s covenant relationship with them. God was saying to Israel, “Name him Lo-ammi—‘Not my people’—for Israel is not my people, and I am not their God” (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.9">Hos 1:9</a>). Although all seemed lost, Hosea’s prophecy did not end on a note of doom. Rather, he foresaw that Israel would repent. In response, God would restore his covenant relationship with them: “And to those I called ‘Not my people,’ I will say, ‘Now you are my people.’ Then they will reply, ‘You are our God!’” (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.23">Hos 2:23</a>).</p>

  <title>Ammon, Ammonites</title>

<p class="h1">AMMON, AMMONITES</p>
<p class="fl">A Semitic people who occupied a fertile area northeast of Moab in Transjordan between the Arnon and Jabbok Rivers and extending eastward to the Syrian Desert. The chief city was Rabbah (Rabbath-ammon), modern Amman, capital of Jordan.</p>
<p>The Ammonites traced their ancestry to the younger daughter of Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.38">Gn 19:38</a>). Their name in Hebrew originally meant “son of my paternal clan,” preserving the remembrance of an actual clan and personal name, and suggesting a kinship between the Ammonites and Israelites. The name occurred frequently in the ancient Near East from the middle of the second millennium on. One form was found in Assyrian inscriptions; other forms are seen in Ugaritic texts of the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>, in the Mari texts, in the Amarna tablets, and in the Alalakh tablets.</p>
<p>The Ammonites originated in the southern Transjordan region about the beginning of the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Though these people were of mixed ancestry, the languages they spoke were closely related to Hebrew. Ammonite was written in the old Canaanite-Phoenician script, which could probably be read and understood by Israelites. Ammonites intermarried with Hebrews (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.21,31">1 Kgs 14:21, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.13">2 Chr 12:13</a>), and their personal names reflected early Arabic influences.</p>
<p>In language, ethnic background, and physical characteristics the Ammonites were difficult to distinguish from Amorites and were probably closely related. Both may have entered the land at about the same time, for when Joshua led the Israelites into Canaan, both the Ammonite kingdom and the Amorite kingdom of Heshbon were already well established.</p>
<p>The OT states that the territory of Ammon was once occupied by a race of giants called Rephaim or Zamzummim, about whom almost nothing is known (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.20-21">Dt 2:20-21</a>; “Zuzim,” <a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>). The Genesis Apocryphon found among the Dead Sea Scrolls mentions them as one of the people defeated by the alliance of four kings (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1,5">Gn 14:1, 5</a>). The expedition of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Gn 14</a>), broke the power of those giants and probably made the occupation of the land by Esau, Ammon, and Moab much easier. King Og was “of the remnant of the Rephaim” known to the Ammonites (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">Dt 3:11</a>). His bed was evidently an object of veneration because of its unusual size.</p>
<p>When the Israelites arrived at Kadesh, they encountered the well-organized kingdom of Edom but were refused permission to pass through Edomite territory (<a href="?bref=Num.20.14-21">Nm 20:14-21</a>). They journeyed northward to Ammonite country, which was then occupied by the Amorite king Sihon. He also refused them permission to pass through his land, but the Israelites defeated him in battle and occupied his country (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-24">Nm 21:21-24</a>). They were instructed by God through Moses not to try to occupy Ammonite territory, as it had already been given to the descendants of Lot (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.19,37">Dt 2:19, 37</a>).</p>
<p>Continuing northward, the Israelites defeated King Og of Bashan (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.1-11">Dt 3:1-11</a>), then went down to the Jordan Valley, where they camped on the plains of Moab. There Balak, king of Moab, hired a soothsayer, Balaam, to pronounce a curse on the Israelites, but Balaam pronounced a blessing each time instead (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Nm 22–24</a>). For supporting the Moabites in their actions, the Ammonites were excluded from the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.3">Dt 23:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1-2">Neh 13:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelite tribes of Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh were attracted to the fertile Transjordan region that had belonged to the Amorites and Bashan and decided to settle there on the Ammonite frontier (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.16">Dt 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.8-32">Jos 13:8-32</a>). Subsequently they built an altar at the Jordan River, which the other tribes at first interpreted as an act of rebellion in that they appeared to be establishing a rival place of worship (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.10-34">Jos 22:10-34</a>).</p>
<p>Before the Israelite conquest of Canaan, the Ammonites evidently had not attained the same level of political organization and settled life as the neighboring Moabites and Edomites. Even as late as the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span> the nation was essentially nomadic. Shortly after Israel settled in Canaan, the Ammonites allied with the Moabites and Amalekites when King Eglon of Moab tried to regain former Moabite territory at the north end of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-13">Jgs 3:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>By the end of the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span> the Israelites, then securely established in the land of Canaan, angered God by their worship of the deities of the Syrians, Sidonians, Moabites, Ammonites, and Philistines (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.6">Jgs 10:6</a>). The Ammonites, in their first recorded political expansion, launched an attack against Israel and were able to establish themselves in Gilead (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.7-8">Jgs 10:7-8</a>). They then crossed the Jordan and attacked the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.9">Jgs 10:9</a>). In desperation the elders of Gilead turned for help to Jephthah, a social outcast but an able military leader (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.1-11">Jgs 11:1-11</a>). He defeated the Ammonites so decisively that it was unnecessary for him to wage further campaigns against Ammonite settlements west of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.12-33">Jgs 11:12-33</a>).</p>
<p>Near the end of the 11th century an Ammonite king named Nahash came to power, determined to reestablish Ammonite dominion over Israelite settlements in Transjordan. He launched an aggressive military campaign around 1020 <span class="era">BC</span> that took him as far north as Jabesh-gilead. The inhabitants of the town were willing to surrender to him but delayed their surrender to appeal for help from Saul, the recently consecrated Israelite king. Saul quickly organized an army and decisively defeated the Ammonites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-11">1 Sm 11:1-11</a>). The victory ensured freedom from Ammonite domination in the Jordan Valley for several centuries, although later in his reign Saul was forced to fight further battles with the enemies of Israel, including Ammonites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47-48">1 Sm 14:47-48</a>).</p>
<p>When David became king, he took silver and gold from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites, either as spoils or as tribute (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.11-12">2 Sm 8:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.11">1 Chr 18:11</a>). Soon thereafter, David sent Joab at the head of a strong army to devastate the Ammonite countryside and besiege the capital city of Rabbah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1">2 Sm 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.2">1 Chr 20:2</a>). The siege lasted many months, but Joab weakened the city and David then completed its capture (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.26-29">2 Sm 12:26-29</a>). In a ceremony of capitulation the Ammonite king’s massive golden crown was placed on David’s head (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.30">2 Sm 12:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.1">1 Chr 20:1</a>). The conquered city was plundered, and its inhabitants were enslaved. Other Ammonite cities were taken, and the nation was added to the growing number of vassal states of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.31">2 Sm 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.3">1 Chr 20:3</a>). David appointed a governor over the Ammonites from the Ammonite royal family. Shobi, another son of Nahash (and therefore Hanun’s brother), became ruler of the Ammonites and aided David during his flight from Absalom’s rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.27">2 Sm 17:27</a>). One of David’s best warriors was an Ammonite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.37">2 Sm 23:37</a>).</p>
<p>Ammonite relations with Israel remained generally peaceful during the reign of Solomon, David’s successor, with the Ammonites undoubtedly sharing in the prosperity and wealth of that period. After the death of Solomon, the kingdom split apart under Rehoboam and was further weakened by a campaign of Shishak, king of Egypt, that swept through Palestine and also through Ammonite territory. Taking advantage of the situation, the Ammonites declared their independence from Israel and Judah. The Ammonites joined the Moabites and Meunites to make war against King Jehoshaphat of Judah (reigning 871–848 <span class="era">BC</span>). In fear, Jehoshaphat sought help from God in prayer (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.1-12">2 Chr 20:1-12</a>). The Ammonites and their allies began fighting among themselves and destroyed each other, leaving behind great spoils for Jehoshaphat and his people—which took three days to be carried away (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.22-25">2 Chr 20:22-25</a>). Eventually the Ammonites recovered, so that by the end of the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>, Ammon had again become completely independent and was the dominant state of south Transjordan. Ammonite independence was short, however, for in 599 <span class="era">BC</span>, according to the Babylonian Chronicle, Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar led his troops into Syria and began raiding southern Palestine. In 593 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Ammonites met in Jerusalem with King Zedekiah of Judah and representatives from Edom, Moab, Tyre, and Sidon in a conspiracy to rebel against Babylon (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-3">Jer 27:1-3</a>). The prophet Jeremiah warned them that God would cause their plan to fail (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.4-22">Jer 27:4-22</a>). Nebuchadnezzar sent an army to crush the rebellion and attacked Jerusalem, which he destroyed after a lengthy and bitter siege (586 <span class="era">BC</span>), deporting many Jews to Babylonia. Ammon was not immediately invaded, however, and many Judeans sought refuge there (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.11">Jer 40:11</a>), including a man named Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.13-16">Jer 40:13-16</a>). Ishmael plotted with Baalis, king of Ammon, to assassinate Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had appointed governor over Judea, now reduced to a province of Babylonia. After carrying out the assassination, Ishmael escaped to Ammon (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.1-15">Jer 41:1-15</a>). Nebuchadnezzar then sent troops that sacked Rabbah and took captive many of the Ammonites. Though the city was not destroyed, the destruction of the countryside was thorough. In the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, Arab invaders poured in and destroyed the remaining organized political structure, thus marking the end of Ammon as a semi-independent state.</p>

  <title>Amorites</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AMORITES</p>
<p class="fl">Semitic people found throughout the Fertile Crescent of the Near East at the beginning of the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Amorites are first mentioned in the Bible as descendants of Canaan in a list of ancient peoples (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.16">Gn 10:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.13-16">1 Chr 1:13-16</a>). Some of these nomadic people seem to have migrated from the Syrian Desert into Mesopotamia, others into Palestine.</p>
<p>Akkadian cuneiform inscriptions mention a relatively uncivilized people called <span class="ital">Amurru</span> (translation of the Sumerian <span class="ital">Mar-tu</span>), perhaps named for a storm god. They overran the Sumerians and eventually most of Mesopotamia. The city of Mari, on the upper Euphrates River, fell to them about 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>; Eshunna a short time later; Babylon by 1830 <span class="era">BC</span>; and finally Assur around 1750 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Farther to the west, Amorites had been in Palestine and Syria as early as the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Egyptian texts of the early part of the 19th century <span class="era">BC</span> show that additional waves of Amorite nomads were entering Canaan at that time. Many of their names are similar to the Amorite names from upper Mesopotamia. In fact, many names from the Mari tablets are identical with or similar to names in the patriarchal accounts in Genesis. People named Jacob, Abraham, Levi, and Ishmael were known at Mari, and names similar to Gad and Dan have been found there. Benjamin was known as the name of a tribe. Nahor was found to be the name of a city near Haran. According to Genesis, Abraham lived in Haran many years before going to Canaan. Jacob spent 20 years there and married two women from Haran.</p>
<p>Amorites appear prominently in the OT as major obstacles to the occupation of Canaan (the Promised Land) by the Israelites after the exodus. Calling Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt, the Lord spoke of Canaan, then occupied by Amorites and others, as a good land (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.8,17">Ex 3:8, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.5">13:5</a>). When the Israelites were in the wilderness, God promised to destroy those nations (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.23">Ex 23:23</a>) and drive them out of the land (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.2">Ex 33:2</a>). The Hebrew people were warned not to make covenants with any of them, to intermarry with them, or to tolerate their idol worship (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.11-17">Ex 34:11-17</a>).</p>
<p>Spies sent into the land found Amalekites in the south; Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites in the northern mountains and to the west of the Jordan River; and Canaanites by the sea and along the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.25-29">Nm 13:25-29</a>). At that time there were Amorites east of the Jordan as well (<a href="?bref=Num.21.13">Nm 21:13</a>).</p>
<p>God had instructed Israel to go up from Horeb and conquer the mountain Amorites on the west side of the Jordan all the way to the Mediterranean Sea (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.7">Dt 1:7</a>). When they arrived at Kadesh-barnea they were at the foot of those mountains (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.19-20">Dt 1:19-20</a>). But the people murmured and complained that God had brought them from Egypt only to be slaughtered by the Amorites. From the spies’ reports, they pictured the Amorites as an awesome people, greater and taller than the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.26-28">Dt 1:26-28</a>). At first they refused to trust God enough to go in, so God told them to turn around and head back into the wilderness. Then they changed their minds, stubbornly attacked the Amorites against God’s command, and were badly beaten (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.34-44">Dt 1:34-44</a>). Finally, after 38 additional years in the wilderness, the Israelites once again faced the Amorites, but this time on the east side of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Num.21.13">Nm 21:13</a>). The Amorite king, Sihon, refused to let them pass through his land. The Israelites were drawn up at the Arnon River, which flows into the Dead Sea about two-thirds of the way up its eastern shore.</p>
<p>Transjordan was controlled by two Amorite kings, Sihon and Og. Israel had to face Sihon first. His city, Heshbon, lay due east of the north end of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-26">Nm 21:21-26</a>). Sihon himself had taken this land from the Moabites. Moses knew of Sihon’s reputation and quoted a poem that boasted of Sihon’s victory over Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.21.27-30">Nm 21:27-30</a>). Nevertheless, the Israelites defeated Sihon and devastated his kingdom from Dibon, four miles (6.4 kilometers) north of the Arnon, to Medeba, seven miles (11.2 kilometers) south of Heshbon. King Og, farther to the north, received the same treatment (<a href="?bref=Num.21.31-35">Nm 21:31-35</a>). King Balak of Moab heard of the Israelite victories and was terrified (<a href="?bref=Num.22.2-3">Nm 22:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>Moses reminded the people that by relying on God’s promises they had taken all of the land of the Amorites east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.24-3.10">Dt 2:24–3:10</a>). The conquered territory was given to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Num.32.33">Nm 32:33</a>). Then, 40 years after the exodus began, Israel was standing on the east side of the Jordan, having dispossessed the two great Amorite nations there (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.1-4">Dt 1:1-4</a>). But there were other Amorite kingdoms in the hills west of the Jordan, along with other nations (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-2">Dt 7:1-2</a>). They were to be destroyed in the same way Sihon and Og had been defeated (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.3-6">Dt 31:3-6</a>).</p>
<p>So famous was the victory of Israel east of the Jordan that Rahab and others in Jericho, west of the Jordan, knew of it and were frightened (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.8-11">Jos 2:8-11</a>). The Israelites crossed the Jordan and took Jericho but were defeated at the smaller city of Ai in the hill country west of Jericho. They immediately assumed that they would be wiped out by the Amorites in those hills (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.7">Jos 7:7</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelites regained God’s favor, however, and defeated Ai. Their victory made an impression on the other kingdoms west of the Jordan in the hills, valleys, and coastlands up to Lebanon, who allied to fight Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-2">Jos 9:1-2</a>). Gibeon, an Amorite city seven miles (11.2 kilometers) southwest of Ai, made peace with Israel, putting more fear in the hearts of the remaining kings (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-2">Jos 10:1-2</a>). Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, was evidently the leader of the Amorite kings west of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.3">Jos 10:3</a>). Jerusalem was only eight miles (12.8 kilometers) southeast of Gibeon. Adoni-zedek called together the kings of Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, all within 50 miles (80.4 kilometers) of Jerusalem, to fight against Gibeon and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.3-5">Jos 10:3-5</a>).</p>
<p>Joshua came to Gibeon’s defense and routed the Amorites, chasing them to the northwest and southwest. The Lord fought for Israel, raining hailstones on the Amorites at Azekah, southwest of Gibeon, and causing the sun to stand still in order to provide a longer battle day (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.6-14">Jos 10:6-14</a>).</p>
<p>In the far north, Jabin, king of Hazor, rallied the Canaanites and remaining Amorites all the way north to Mt Hermon (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-5">Jos 11:1-5</a>). But they too were overcome (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.10-23">Jos 11:10-23</a>). Toward the end of Joshua’s career, he reminded the people that it was the Lord who had given them the land of the Amorites (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.1-18">Jos 24:1-18</a>).</p>
<p>After the occupation of Canaan by Israel, Amorites still present in the land chased Dan’s tribe into the mountains and continued to live near Aijalon, 17 miles (27.4 kilometers) west of Jerusalem. They still held the slopes toward the south end of the Dead Sea as well (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.34-36">Jgs 1:34-36</a>). In the period of the judges, the Amorites and their gods posed a constant threat to Israel’s well-being (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.10">Jgs 6:10</a>).</p>
<p>At the end of the period of the judges, relations between Israel and the Amorites improved (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.14">1 Sm 7:14</a>). David continued to honor Joshua’s treaty with the Amorite remnant of Gibeon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.2-6">2 Sm 21:2-6</a>). Solomon conscripted his labor forces from the Amorites and other peoples still surviving from Israelite conquest (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-22">1 Kgs 9:20-22</a>).</p>
<p>The OT treats the deliverance of the Amorites and their land into the hands of Israel as a great event comparable with the exodus itself, a victory to be remembered and celebrated (<a href="?bref=Ps.135.9-12">Pss 135:9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.13-26">136:13-26</a>). If the people forgot, the Lord reminded them through his prophets (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.9-10">Am 2:9-10</a>). Long after Sihon and Og had been defeated, the area east of the Jordan was still remembered as the land of “Sihon king of the Amorites” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.19">1 Kgs 4:19</a>). When the kings of Israel and Judah began to fail God, the memory of the Amorites provided a standard of comparison of evil. The Jews’ continuing fascination with idolatry led God to address Jerusalem, representing the Jewish people, through the prophet Ezekiel: “Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.45">Ez 16:45</a>). In the biblical view, the Amorites stood for everything that is abominable in the sight of God.</p>

While the <span class="sc">kjv</span> uses “mount,” most modern translations use “hill country” because the phrase does not denote a single mountain but the range running north and south through Judah and Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.7,19-20">Dt 1:7, 19-20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">AMOS (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew prophet of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Nothing is known about Amos apart from the book that bears his name. He was a shepherd living in Tekoa, a village about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of Jerusalem, when God spoke to him in a vision (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1-2">Am 1:1-2</a>). The kingdom was then divided, with Uzziah king of Judah in the south and Jeroboam II king of Israel in the north. In Amos’s vision, the Lord was like a lion roaring out judgment on injustice and idolatry, especially among God’s own people. The short biographical section of his writings shows Amos preaching only at Bethel, in Israel, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Jerusalem and just over the border. Bethel had been made the royal religious sanctuary of Israel by Jeroboam I to rival Jerusalem in Judah. Amos prophesied that Israel would be overrun and its king killed. The priest of Bethel, Amaziah, called Amos a traitor and told him to go back to Judah and do his prophesying there. Amos replied, “I’m not one of your professional prophets. I certainly never trained to be one. I’m just a shepherd, and I take care of fig trees.” But the Lord told him, “Go and prophesy to my people in Israel” (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-15">Am 7:10-15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Amos was evidently a God-fearing man who deeply felt the mistreatment of the poor by the privileged classes. He did not want to be identified with an elite group of professional prophets, who may have lost their original fervor. His writings reflect the earthy background of a shepherd (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.12">3:12</a>). But he spoke with authority the message given him by the Lord God of Hosts: “I want to see a mighty flood of justice, a river of righteous living that will never run dry” (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.24">5:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The message of Amos was a call to repentance of personal and social sins and a return to the worship of the one true God and to the covenantal standards that made the Jewish people a nation. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=AmosBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Amos, Book of</a>; <a href="?item=ProphetProphetess_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Prophet, Prophetess</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Writings of the prophet Amos, one of the 12 minor prophets of the Hebrew OT. The book of Amos is called minor only because it is relatively short. Its message is as important as that of any of the major prophets. Indeed, Amos has one of the most powerful statements in the Bible of God’s judgment against injustice, oppression, and hypocrisy. The book consists primarily of prophetic sermons preached by Amos at Bethel, royal sanctuary of the northern kingdom of Israel in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="fl">The preacher of the sermons (or oracles) in the book was undoubtedly Amos, a herdsman and a dresser (farmer) of fig trees, from the village of Tekoa, south of Jerusalem. He received from God a vision of judgment on Israel and went north to Bethel, just across the border between Judah and Israel, to deliver his sermons. All we know about the prophet is contained in the superscription (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>) and a biographical section (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-14">7:10-14</a>) of the book of Amos, plus what can be learned about him from the style and content of the rest of the book.</p>
<p>Did Amos write down his prophecies himself? Although scholars have raised many questions about the authorship of Amos, there is no convincing reason to regard the book as the work of anyone else. Some have suggested that the sermons were passed on by word of mouth for a long time before they were written down in final form. The Hebrew text, however, is in much better shape than would be expected (had it come through prolonged oral transmission). The many first-person references and vigor of expression imply strongly that Amos himself put much of his prophecy into writing soon after delivering it at Bethel.</p>
<p>Another speculative proposal is that the visions described in the book (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.1-9">7:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.1-3">8:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.1-4">9:1-4</a>) were compiled by Amos before he began his ministry to the northern kingdom, and the oracles (chs <a href="?bref=Amos.1.1-6.14">1–6</a>) were composed after that time. The two sections could have been joined into one book much later, during or after the Babylonian exile, with some sections inserted at that time. Other prophecies, however, such as Ezekiel and Jeremiah, contain both oracle and vision sections that scholars have not attempted to divide, and the internal evidence does not make such a division necessary with Amos. Both sections contain similar concerns; in both the visions (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.1-3">7:1-3</a>) and the oracles (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.1-7">5:1-7</a>), Amos appears in the role of intercessor on behalf of Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">According to the superscription, Amos prophesied during the reigns of Uzziah, king of Judah, and Jeroboam II, king of Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">1:1</a>), or between 792 and 740 <span class="era">BC</span>. The content of his message fits what is known about the situation in Israel in that period. It is difficult to be more exact about the beginning and ending of Amos’s prophetic ministry within that time span. The vision came to him “two years before the earthquake” (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">1:1</a>), but another biblical reference to presumably the same earthquake places it during the days of King Uzziah of Judah (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.5">Zec 14:5</a>). Archaeological excavations at Hazor seem to have yielded evidence for an earthquake, which has been dated at approximately 760 <span class="era">BC</span>. Amos also contains a prophetic reference to a solar eclipse (<a href="?bref=Amos.8.9">8:9</a>); such an eclipse has been calculated to have occurred about 763 <span class="era">BC</span>. After King Uzziah was stricken with leprosy, he lived in isolation while Judah was under a co-regency (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.21">2 Chr 26:21</a>). Therefore, Amos’s mention of Uzziah as king (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">1:1</a>) probably sets 760 <span class="era">BC</span> as the latest possible date for Amos’s ministry.</p>
<p>The doom that came upon Israel after Amos’s prophecy was the conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>). Although Amos referred to impending captivity, he never mentioned Assyria as the captor, although he did say that captivity would take Israel to a land east of Damascus (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.27">5:27</a>). Probably Amos was not thinking specifically of the rising power of Assyria but only of the inevitable consequences of Israel’s idolatry and hypocrisy. When all the evidence is taken into consideration, it seems reasonable to date the beginning of Amos’s prophecies at Bethel to about 760 <span class="era">BC</span>, or approximately the middle of the period during which both Uzziah and Jeroboam II were on their thrones. We do not know how long his ministry lasted; it may have been only a few months.</p>
<p>Amos had been caring for his flocks in the Judean hills south of Jerusalem when God told him, “Go and prophesy to my people in Israel” (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.15">7:15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). He may have been familiar with the more urban north from earlier trips there to sell wool or fruit, or the pagan worship and social wrongs there may have made a sudden impact on him after his call to prophesy. At any rate, his writings reveal not only his rural Judean background but also a firsthand knowledge of conditions in the northern kingdom of Israel. Although his prophecies were directed primarily to Israel, he also denounced the sin of Judah, predicting that its capital, Jerusalem, would be burned (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.4-5">2:4-5</a>). Several passages are directed at inhabitants of Samaria, capital of Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.1,11">4:1, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.1">6:1</a>), with which Amos was obviously familiar. He could have traveled on to Samaria from Bethel, or he could have learned of its splendors from the boasts of its citizens. He could have addressed them directly as they came from the capital city to worship at Bethel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> was a critical time in Jewish history. Both kingdoms of the divided nation had risen to heights of economic affluence that had not been experienced since the days of Solomon. Yet internal religious decay was sapping the strength of both kingdoms, and their social fabric was being destroyed. A new wealthy class was benefiting from the affluence of the time, growing ever richer while poor people became poorer than ever.</p>
<p>In 803 <span class="era">BC</span>, the conquest of Syrian Damascus by the Assyrian king Adad-nirari III had silenced one of Israel’s major enemies. With the Syrians out of the picture, the kingdom of Israel was able to expand its borders under King Joash (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.25">2 Kgs 13:25</a>), and for a time even the thrust of Assyrian power westward was diminished. Israel and Judah entered a period of rest from constant warfare and turned their attention to internal affairs.</p>
<p>Joash’s son, Jeroboam II, became king of Israel in 793 and reigned until 753 <span class="era">BC</span>. Uzziah was on the throne of Judah from 792 to 740 <span class="era">BC</span>. Under these two kings, Judah and Israel controlled a territory that was almost as large as Solomon’s empire had been. Their wealth had grown both from expansion of trade and from the booty of conquered territories.</p>
<p>Archaeology has yielded information about industrial activity within the nations, such as an impressive dyeing industry at Debir. Excavations at Samaria have produced large numbers of ivory inlays that confirm Amos’s description of the wealthy in the capital city (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">6:4</a>). The city of Samaria was protected by a huge double wall of unusual thickness. A palace, probably Jeroboam’s, dominated the city with a massive tower.</p>
<p>The splendor and prosperity of the time, however, was masking the spread of internal decay. Oppression of the poor by many in the wealthy classes not only threatened the unity of the nation but also meant that God’s laws were being violated. In his denunciations of the cruel treatment of the poor (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.11-13">5:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.4-10">8:4-10</a>), Amos warned of the inevitable punishment for disobeying God’s laws.</p>
<p>The nation of Israel was guilty of more than social sins against the covenant. It was also adopting pagan religious practices. Canaanite religious influence intruded into the fabric of the nation of Israel. Excavation of a palace storehouse in Samaria uncovered many <span class="ital">ostraca</span> (pieces of broken pottery used for writing short messages such as letters, receipts, etc.) containing Hebrew names compounded with “Baal,” a chief god of the Canaanite religion.</p>
<p>In spite of the gradual deterioration, false optimism seems to have prevailed. Amos found people desiring the Day of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.18">5:18</a>) and sought to correct their misunderstanding: the Day of the Lord prophesied in the Scriptures would be a time of judgment on all sinners. A more immediate judgment was to come, however. Assyria began to strengthen its position in the world and to resume its expansionist policies. Under the leadership of Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>), Assyria regained a position of world dominance. Eventually, Israel was attacked by Shalmaneser V of Assyria. Soon afterward, in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, Samaria was occupied. No doubt when the Assyrians were sweeping into Israel, many of the people who had ignored the message of Amos then realized that a prophet of God had been among them.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Superscription (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">1:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophet introduces himself as a shepherd, perhaps implying that it is more than sheep he wants to keep from straying.</p>
<p class="h3">Prophetic Oracles (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.2-6.14">1:2–6:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section begins with a picture of the great power of God, who acts in history to judge the nations (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.2">1:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Judgment on Surrounding Nations (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2.3">1:3–2:3</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophet first speaks against Damascus, then moves on, pronouncing doom on various peoples in ever closer concentric circles, “homing in” on Israel. One may imagine the citizens of Israel applauding God’s judgment on other nations until, with shocking effect, Amos accuses Israel of similar sins.</p>
<p>Damascus was the capital of Syria, northeast of Israel, and the center of Syrian influence. Syria had mistreated Israel during Hazael’s reign in Damascus (842–806 <span class="era">BC</span>). Hazael “whittled down” Israel in a number of campaigns (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32-33">2 Kgs 10:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.3-5,22-24">13:3-5, 22-24</a>). In their campaign into the territory of Gilead, the Syrians destroyed most of Israel’s army as though they were dust on a threshing floor (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.7">2 Kgs 13:7</a>). Hence, Amos denounces Syria for threshing Gilead as grain is threshed with iron rods (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3">Am 1:3</a>). He predicts that Syria will be destroyed and its people deported to Kir, which Amos understood to be their place of origin (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">9:7</a>). (For the fulfillment of this prophecy, see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.9">2 Kgs 16:9</a>.)</p>
<p>Amos next turned to Gaza, a Philistine city in southwest Palestine. Gaza probably represents the Philistines as a whole, since three other of their five major cities are also mentioned (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.8">1:8</a>). The fifth, Gath, had already been conquered by Hazael (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.17">2 Kgs 12:17</a>). Amos denounced the Philistines for what must have been a border raid on Israel in which many were carried off into slavery (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.6">1:6</a>).</p>
<p>The Phoenician city of Tyre is cited next. Tyre was on the Mediterranean, north of Israel and southwest of Damascus. Destruction of Tyre, like that of the Philistine cities, is predicted as punishment for making slaves of conquered Israelites.</p>
<p>Edom is next, south of the Dead Sea. Edom had perennially harassed the Israelites and is referred to in a negative light many times in the OT. Edom is said to have been pitiless toward Israel, his brother (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.11">1:11</a>).</p>
<p>Ammon, just to the southeast of Israel, is also judged. The particularly violent incident referred to (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.13">1:13</a>) evidently occurred in one of their many attempts to push northward into the Israelite territory of Gilead.</p>
<p>Moab is the last of the surrounding nations to be denounced, with reference to what may have been a well-known incident of desecration of the dead (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.1-3">2:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Oracles against Israel and Judah (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.4-16">2:4-16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Although Judah and Israel were at peace at the time, their enmity had continued after dissolution of the united kingdom. Amos accuses Judah of rejecting “the law of the Lord” and predicts the burning of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The oracle against Israel is longer than the others. Amos carefully specifies the social nature of Israel’s sin, making the point that Israel is no better than the surrounding nations. Israel deserves the same punishment. Just as some of the nations were guilty of taking people into slavery, Israel is selling her own poor who cannot repay their debts (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.6">2:6</a>). Under Mosaic law it was illegal to keep overnight a garment pledged as security for a loan, since it might be the only source of warmth the debtor had (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.26-27">Ex 22:26-27</a>). Rich people in Israel were attending religious feasts in such clothing “stolen” from the poor (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.8">2:8</a>).</p>
<p>Amos reminds Israel of all the good things God has done for them (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.9-11">2:9-11</a>). But because Israel has chosen to continue in disobedience, the nation will not escape impending judgment (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.12-16">2:12-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Denunciation of and Warning against Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.1-6.14">3:1–6:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Amos substantiates his prophetic authority with a lesson on cause and effect (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.1-8">3:1-8</a>). A lion roars when it has prey, and people fear when a trumpet sounds an alarm. If calamity comes to a city, God has allowed it. God, who reveals his secrets to his prophets, has spoken Israel’s doom, and Amos must proclaim it.</p>
<p>In a dramatic statement, Amos calls on Egypt and Assyria, great centers of oppression and cruelty, to witness Israel’s crimes, as though even they will be amazed at what they see (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.9-10">3:9-10</a>). Only a ragged remnant will survive the punishment to come (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.11-12">3:11-12</a>). Judgment will fall on objects that symbolize Israel’s religious disobedience (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.14">3:14</a>) as well as on symbols of the wealth that led Israel away from the Lord (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.15">3:15</a>).</p>
<p>Amos uses strong language to denounce luxurious and indolent living bought at the expense of the poor (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>). Rich women whose love for luxuries drives their husbands to squeeze the needy still more are called “fat cows” who will someday be treated like cattle. Then Amos mocks those who worship at Bethel for going through the motions in the wrong spirit (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.4-5">4:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>In the rest of the fourth chapter, Amos recalls incidents from Israel’s history that were meant to call the people back to God: famine, drought, plagues, the destruction of some of their cities. Still they do not repent. “Prepare to meet your God!” warns the prophet, following his warning with a hymn to the mighty power of God (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.6-13">4:6-13</a>).</p>
<p>The fifth chapter begins in the form of a funeral dirge, as though Israel were as good as dead already (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>). There is no one to help Israel, whose own armies will be decimated when the disaster strikes (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.3">5:3</a>). Of course, God is there to help: “Seek me and live” (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.4-6">5:4-6</a>). The possibility of rescue, of “life,” stands in sharp contrast to the nation’s “death” pictured just before. Idols, as always, are a false hope (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.5">5:5</a>). The call to seek the Lord is again followed by a hymn to his power (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.8-9">5:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>In spite of the hope offered to Israel, Amos has to present a gloomy picture of what he sees (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.10-13">5:10-13</a>). The judicial system is corrupt; taxes and high interest charges (usury) grind down the poor. Those injustices could be corrected if the people would “hate evil and love good” (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.15">5:15</a>), but judgment is already on the way (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.16-17">5:16-17</a>).</p>
<p>The people are full of hypocrisy, claiming to look forward to the Day of the Lord. That day will be a day of judgment on their sins, Amos says. Instead of empty gestures of offerings and praise, God wants to let justice roll down like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-24">5:18-24</a>). Their disobedient spirit goes back to the time of the exodus from Egypt, when God’s own people were attracted to pagan gods. The Lord God of Hosts will send those false gods into captivity with the people who looked to them (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.25-27">5:25-27</a>).</p>
<p>The self-satisfaction felt by the upper classes in Israel had evidently spread to Judah, since Jerusalem as well as Samaria receives some harsh words (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.1">6:1</a>). Amos tells those who are lounging in luxury to take a look at three neighboring kingdoms on which judgment has already fallen: Calneh, Hamath, and Gath. Does Israel think it will escape, since they did not? When the Day of Judgment comes, the rich, who have gone “first-class,” will be the first to go (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.2-7">6:2-7</a>). The destruction will leave few survivors, but they will know that punishment came from God (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.8-11">6:8-11</a>). Israel is behaving stupidly to be proud of themselves when they are actually so utterly self-deceived (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.12-14">6:12-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Prophetic Visions (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.1-9.10">7:1–9:10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">By describing three visions God gave him, Amos then dramatically communicates God’s revelation.</p>
<p class="h4">Israel’s Destruction (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.1-9">7:1-9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first vision is in three parts. In the first, Amos pictures the threat of a locust plague in which his prayer of intercession causes God to relent and withdraw the threat (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.1-3">7:1-3</a>). Then he sees an all-consuming fire, and again his prayer averts a catastrophe (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.4-6">7:4-6</a>). In the third part of the vision, Amos sees the Lord standing by a wall and holding a plumb line, implying that he has a standard for his people to live up to, an element missing from the two earlier images. This time, because the people have failed to measure up, the catastrophe cannot be averted (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.7-9">7:7-9</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Historical Interlude (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-17">7:10-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">At this point, Amos encounters Amaziah, priest of Bethel, because he has said that the vision of the plumb line means destruction of the idol altars and temples of Israel and of the house of Jeroboam with the sword. Amaziah sends word to Jeroboam that Amos is a traitor and tells Amos to go back to Judah. Amos disclaims any relationship with professional prophets, then specifically includes Amaziah’s family in another prediction of Israel’s disaster.</p>
<p class="h4">The Ripe Fruit (<a href="?bref=Amos.8.1-14">8:1-14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the second vision, Amos is shown a basket of ripe (or summer) fruit. The Hebrew word for summer fruit is almost the same as the word for “end,” so the play on words communicates that the nation is “ripe for punishment.” Their ripeness is really moral rottenness. Greedy merchants can hardly wait for religious holidays to end so they can cheat the poor some more by using false weights, selling inferior goods, and foreclosing on debtors. When the captivity comes, their festivities will turn into funerals. A famine, not just of bread and water but of the words of the Lord, is coming upon them, causing even the strongest young people to drop to the ground.</p>
<p class="h4">Destruction of the Temple (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.1-10">9:1-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The third vision is of the Lord destroying the shrine at Bethel when it is thronged with people engaging in their empty worship. The place where they hoped to find security is where they find destruction. Those who are not inside will be destroyed, too, no matter where they try to flee. They won’t be able to hide from God in Sheol or on the heights of Carmel or in the depths of the sea (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.1-4">9:1-4</a>). Another hymn to God’s power follows the vision (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.5-6">9:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>The final words of denunciation in the book of Amos are found in <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7-10">9:7-10</a>, but they are a prelude to a message of hope. Amos shows that Israel is no better than any other nation in the eyes of God. Did he not bring Israel out of Egypt? Yes, but he also brought the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir. The religious significance of the exodus has been lost because of Israel’s sin, so all but a faithful remnant will be lost.</p>
<p>The concept of the remnant was important in the prophetic preaching of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.6.12-13">Is 6:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.7-9">Mi 6:7-9</a>). It recalled God’s promise to maintain the nation of Israel for the sake of the covenant given to the patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.44-45">Lv 26:44-45</a>). In Amos’s prophecy, Israel is to be sifted by other nations like grain in a sieve; the ungodly “chaff” will be scattered across the world, but the true “grain” will be preserved.</p>
<p class="h3">Israel’s Hope (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.11-15">9:11-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The expression of hope is expanded in the last section of the book in a series of startling and beautiful metaphors.</p>
<p class="h4">Restoration of the City of David (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.11-12">9:11-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first metaphor is of the city (literally “house”) of David, a house fallen into disrepair. The monarchy, which had crumbled from internal decay and external threats, is envisioned as being restored to its former glory. Further, an expansion of the Davidic kingdom will include all nations that belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>In the NT, this passage was quoted by James to support the inclusion of Gentiles in the promise (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.16-18">Acts 15:16-18</a>). The wording in Acts is slightly different from that of Amos because it was based on an early Greek translation of the OT (called the Septuagint). Those called by God’s name or belonging to God include not only geographical entities such as nations but also individuals in any nation who have a close relationship to God. James saw that Amos was predicting inclusion of Gentiles in the kingdom of God, a kingdom far greater than the early monarchy. This prophecy has been fulfilled in part in the Christian church.</p>
<p class="h4">Restoration of Israel’s Fortunes (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.13-15">9:13-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">A series of pastoral metaphors closes the book of Amos. They depict the abundance of blessing in the coming kingdom. Israel’s fortunes are to be restored, far beyond the dismal events of the century in which Amos is speaking. Theologians differ in their understanding of the application of this prophecy. If it refers to the present age of the Christian church, it pictures the blessings of the church now as “spiritual Israel.” If it refers to the future, to the millennial reign of Christ, it depicts what will happen on earth at that time.</p>
<p>The concept of a rejuvenated earth is found elsewhere in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.20-22">Rom 8:20-22</a>). Micah uses language somewhat similar to that of Amos to describe restoration of what seems to be the literal city of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.12-4.4">Mi 3:12–4:4</a>). It may be best to apply the prophetic finale of Amos to the restoration to be effected at the ultimate return of Christ. Whatever the correct application, the remnant must include the followers of Jesus Christ, and the blessings should be seen as intended for all who belong to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Significance">Significance</p>
<p class="fl">The major purpose of Amos in his prophecies was to denounce Israel’s disobedience to the covenant. Although the covenant promise given to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.15-18">Gn 22:15-18</a>) and reiterated throughout the OT is not mentioned explicitly in Amos, it is implicit in the total message of the book. Amos upheld the spiritual nature of the covenant and emphasized that its blessing was mediated through obedience.</p>
<p>Looking around him, Amos saw not only disobedience but hypocrisy. A basic aspect of his ethical teaching was insistence that outward adherence to religious ceremonies without a heart response to the will of God (as expressed in the law) was wrong. The law contained many injunctions that sought to engender love of God and fellow human beings (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.1-13">Ex 23:1-13</a>). In Amos’s time, those social aspects of the law were being willfully disobeyed by the rich, who nevertheless clung to religious ritual. Amos saw what was in their hearts and condemned it. To him, religious obligations not observed in the proper spirit of responsibility to God could actually become sin (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.4">4:4</a>). Religion could degenerate to the place where it becomes a curse, a mockery of the will of a holy God.</p>
<p>Amos saw the disobedience and hypocrisy of Israel as culminating in national disaster. Thus his prophecy served as a warning of impending doom to the nation. He saw that other nations besides Israel and Judah were held accountable to God because of their mistreatment of others (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2.3">1:3–2:3</a>). Their social sins were punished by God in history. Amos thus saw an aspect of the law extending beyond Israel and Judah to other nations. They were responsible to God under what might be called a universal moral law, and they were judged for their crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>The prophetic concept of the Day of the Lord, regarded by the people of Amos’s day as a time of vindication for their nation, was seen by Amos as a time of punishment for all sinners. Such punishment would not exclude the nation of Israel.</p>
<p>Yet denunciation was not the sole purpose of Amos’s prophetic activity. He proclaimed a future of hope for Israel in the reestablishment of the Davidic monarchy, evidently under Messiah, in a time that would be characterized by peace (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.8-15">9:8-15</a>). The relationship of the Davidic kingdom to the messianic kingdom goes back to the promise given to David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.8-16">2 Sm 7:8-16</a>). Just as those in other nations participated by extension in the demands of the law and in judgment, so would those in other nations who belonged to God participate in the blessings of the promise (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.12">9:12</a>).</p>
<p>The concepts of God drawn most sharply in the book of Amos are God’s sovereignty and God’s righteousness. He is sovereign over all the nations of the world, typified by those surrounding Israel, and he brings them to judgment (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2.3">1:3–2:3</a>). He is also sovereign over nature, as recognized in his control of the universe (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.13">4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.8">5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.13-14">9:13-14</a>). His righteousness demands that he cannot allow his law to continue to be violated without retribution. But his righteousness is also the guarantee of hope for the believing remnant of Israel. It binds him to keep his promise to preserve Israel as a nation (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.44-45">Lv 26:44-45</a>).</p>
<p>Amos held out the possibility of averting the national catastrophe looming on the horizon of world events. However, from his gloomy description of social conditions and of the hardness of people’s hearts at the time, it seems likely that he did not foresee any escape.</p>
<p>His message was presented in bold metaphors and vivid pictures that stick in the mind. That message is still relevant, for many of the sins that characterized the people of the prophet’s day are still prevalent in modern society and in the lives of individuals. Mistreatment of fellow human beings is as much a feature of the 21st century <span class="era">AD</span> as it was of the 8th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Today’s reader of the book of Amos should note the prophet’s insistence on the consequences of sin; his emphasis on the responsibility that always accompanies privilege; his presentation of God’s faithfulness; and his message of hope, expressed in part today through the church.</p>
<p>If the book seems to be gloomy in its outlook, it should be remembered that the prophet faced a gloomy picture. He was watching a nation crumble because of its unfaithfulness to God. But beyond the dismal prospect that faced Israel, Amos saw a new kingdom emerging. It was a kingdom of peace in which the people of God would realize the fulfillment of God’s promises. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Prophecy_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Prophecy</a>; <a href="?item=ProphetProphetess_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Prophet, Prophetess</a>; <a href="?item=IsraelHistoryof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Israel, History of</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Small object worn by an individual, usually around the neck, as a charm or means of protection against evil, witchcraft, disease, or other physical and spiritual threats. The word is probably derived from either a Latin or Arabic term meaning “to carry.” Amulets (also known as talismans) have been made of various substances and occur in many forms. Pieces of metal or strips of parchment with portions of sacred writings (even Scriptures), as well as herbs and animal preparations, have been used. Semiprecious gems were often inscribed with a magical formula.</p>
<p>No Hebrew or Greek word in the Bible is translated “amulet” with certainty. The practice of wearing amulets, however, is sometimes implied—generally with disapproval. The gold earrings worn by the Israelites escaping from Egypt, from which Aaron fashioned a golden calf, have been considered amulets (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.2-4">Ex 32:2-4</a>). The prophet Isaiah condemned the ornaments worn by the women of his day (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.16-23">Is 3:16-23</a>). Most scholars regard the phylacteries and mezuzahs used by the Jews as forms of amulets. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Phylactery_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Phylactery</a>; <a href="?item=Magic_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Magic</a>; <a href="?item=Frontlet_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Frontlet</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">ANAK, ANAKIM*, ANAKITES</p>
<p class="fl">Ancestor of a race of giants in old Canaan. When Israel first reached Canaan, the Anakim were well established in Hebron. Ten of the 12 spies Moses sent into Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.17-22">Nm 13:17-22</a>) were terrified by the size of the Anakim (<a href="?bref=Num.13.31">Nm 13:31</a>). Their terror led to a rebellion at Kadesh-barnea (<a href="?bref=Num.14.39-45">Nm 14:39-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.19-46">Dt 1:19-46</a>) and another 38 years of wandering. When the Israelites were finally ready to enter Canaan, God promised his help against the famed Anak giants (<a href="?bref=Deut.9.1-3">Dt 9:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>The two spies who were not afraid of the Anakim were both involved in their defeat. Joshua defeated the Anakim living in Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the region of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.21-23">Jos 11:21-23</a>). Those who survived were left only in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. The other spy, Caleb, was responsible for the defeat of the Anakim chiefs Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai at Hebron; Caleb’s nephew Othniel was the hero of Debir (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.14-17">Jos 15:14-17</a>). Hebron had earlier been called Kiriath-arba for Anak’s father Arba, a great hero of the Anakim (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.15">Jos 14:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.11">21:11</a>). The fact that the Anakim survived in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod leads to the supposition that Goliath of Gath may have been a descendant of these giants (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.4-7">1 Sm 17:4-7</a>).</p>

<p class="list">2. Early convert to Christianity who was living in Damascus when Saul of Tarsus (Paul) arrived there supposedly to arrest Christians.

Ananias told Paul the meaning of his unusual encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.12-16">Acts 22:12-16</a>) and probably introduced him to the church there as a new Christian brother rather than a persecutor.

  <body>
<p class="h1">ANCHOR</p>
<p class="fl">Object used to keep a ship or boat stationary in the water. An anchor is attached to a ship by a cable or chain, and when thrown overboard, its weight and/or ability to dig into the sea bottom keeps the vessel from drifting. Anchors were used many centuries before the time of Christ, beginning as simple stone weights and evolving into wooden hooks weighted with lead or stone. Not long after the time of Christ, iron anchors of the familiar modern shape were used. Anchors are mentioned in Luke’s account of the apostle Paul’s voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.13,29-30,40">Acts 27:13, 29-30, 40</a>). <a href="?bref=Heb.6.19">Hebrews 6:19</a> uses “anchor” in a figurative sense to indicate the stability of God’s promise of salvation to those who believe in him.</p>

  <title>Andrew, the Apostle</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANDREW, T<span class="lc">he</span> A<span class="lc">postle</span></p>
<p class="fl">One of Christ’s 12 apostles. Andrew first appears in the NT as a disciple of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=John.1.35,40">Jn 1:35, 40</a>). After hearing John say, “Look, there is the Lamb of God!” (<a href="?bref=John.1.36">Jn 1:36</a>), referring to Jesus, Andrew and another unnamed disciple followed Jesus and stayed with him for a day (<a href="?bref=John.1.36-39">Jn 1:36-39</a>). Andrew then told his brother, Simon Peter, that he had found the Messiah and brought Peter to Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.1.40-42">Jn 1:40-42</a>). From then on Andrew faded into the background, and his brother came into prominence. Whenever the relationship of the two is mentioned, Andrew is always described as the brother of Simon Peter and never the other way around (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18">Mt 4:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16">Mk 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.40">Jn 1:40</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.8">6:8</a>), although Andrew is also mentioned without reference to his relationship to Peter (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.29">Mk 1:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.3">13:3</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.22">Jn 12:22</a>). Andrew’s father was John (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Mt 16:17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.42">Jn 1:42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.15-17">21:15-17</a>), and his hometown was Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=John.1.44">Jn 1:44</a>), a village on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John mentions disciples being with Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.2">4:2</a>), and it is likely that Andrew was one of that early group. Evidently, however, he returned to his activity as a fisherman on the Sea of Galilee, where he shared a house with Peter and his family in Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-20">Mt 4:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-18,29-33">Mk 1:16-18, 29-33</a>). While they were fishing, Andrew and Peter received a definite call to follow Jesus and become those who fish for people. From among the disciples of Jesus a group of 12 were later specially chosen as apostles. Andrew is always listed among the first four named, along with Peter and two other brothers, John and James (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2-4">Mt 10:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.13-16">Lk 6:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>).</p>
<p>Andrew is named in only three other contexts in the Gospels. At the feeding of the 5,000 he called attention to the boy who had five barley loaves and two fish (<a href="?bref=John.6.8-9">Jn 6:8-9</a>). When certain Greeks came to Philip, asking to see Jesus, Philip told Andrew and then the two of them told Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.12.20-22">Jn 12:20-22</a>). Finally, Andrew is listed among those who were questioning Jesus privately on the Mt of Olives (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.3-4">Mk 13:3-4</a>). The last NT mention of Andrew is in the list of apostles waiting in the upper room in Jerusalem for the promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.12-14">Acts 1:12-14</a>).</p>
<p>Various documents associated with Andrew, such as the Acts of Andrew mentioned by the early church historian Eusebius, are of doubtful value. Some traditions indicate that Andrew ministered in Scythia. According to the Muratorian Canon, Andrew received a revelation at night that the apostle John should write the fourth Gospel. Tradition is rather uniform that Andrew died at Patrae in Achaia. A story developed that he was martyred on an X-shaped cross (a “decussate” or “saltire” cross), which has become known as St Andrew’s Cross. Another tradition is that an arm of the dead Andrew was taken into Scotland as a relic by Regulus, and thus Andrew became known as a patron saint of Scotland. On the calendar of saints of the Roman and Greek churches, Andrew’s date is set as November 30. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Apocrypha_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Apocrypha (Specific Titles of Apocryphal Writings): Andrew, Acts of</a>; Andrew, Story of; Andrew and Matthias, Acts of; Andrew and Paul, Acts of.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">ANGEL</p>
<p class="fl">Messenger of God or supernatural being, either good or evil, with powers greater than humans possess.</p>
<p>The first kind of angels mentioned in the Bible are cherubim (plural of “cherub,” a Hebrew word). They were celestial beings sent by God to guard the tree of life in the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.24">Gn 3:24</a>). They were represented symbolically on the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.18-22">Ex 25:18-22</a>), in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.31">Ex 26:31</a>) and temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.3.7">2 Chr 3:7</a>), and seen by the prophet Ezekiel in a vision of the restored Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezek.41.18-20">Ez 41:18-20</a>). Two angels, Gabriel and the chief, or archangel, Michael, are named in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.16">Dn 8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.21">9:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.13">10:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.19,26">Lk 1:19, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.9">Jude 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.7-9">Rv 12:7-9</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AngelOfTheLord"/>
<p>In the Bible, angels are spiritual beings who serve primarily as messengers. The English word “angel” comes directly from a Greek word for messenger. In <a href="?bref=Luke.9.52">Luke 9:52</a>, Jesus sent “messengers” ahead of him. Usually the same word is translated “angel” and is understood to mean a spiritual messenger from God. In the OT also, one Hebrew word can refer either to a human messenger or to a spiritual being. It is not always immediately clear which is meant, especially since angels sometimes appeared in human form. In certain passages, “the angel of God” or a similar phrase may refer to God delivering his own message (see <a href="?bref=Gen.18.2-15">Gn 18:2-15</a>).</p>
<p>Angels appeared to many of God’s people in the Bible to announce good news (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.3">Jgs 13:3</a>), warn of danger (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.15">Gn 19:15</a>), guard from evil (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.28">Dn 3:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.6.22">6:22</a>), guide and protect (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.19">Ex 14:19</a>), nourish (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.14-20">Gn 21:14-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.4-7">1 Kgs 19:4-7</a>), or instruct (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.38">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.19">Gal 3:19</a>). When Christ came to earth as the Savior, angels heralded his birth (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.8-15">Lk 2:8-15</a>), guided and warned his parents (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13">Mt 2:13</a>), strengthened him when he was tempted (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.11">Mt 4:11</a>) and in his last distress (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.43-44">Lk 22:43-44</a> in some manuscripts), and observed his resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-6">Mt 28:1-6</a>). Jesus spoke about the guardian angels of little children (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.10">Mt 18:10</a>). Philip was guided by an angel (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.26">Acts 8:26</a>). Apostles were rescued from prison by an angel (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.19">Acts 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.7-11">12:7-11</a>). In a frightening situation, the apostle Paul was encouraged by an angel (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.21-25">Acts 27:21-25</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AngelsOfTheSevenChurches"/>
<p>The physical appearance of angels in biblical encounters was often unusual enough to distinguish them from ordinary people. The angel who moved the stone from the entrance to Jesus’ tomb had an appearance like lightning and raiment white as snow (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.3">Mt 28:3</a>). Many passages about angels are descriptions of dreams or visions. “Jacob’s ladder” with angels ascending and descending (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.12">Gn 28:12</a>) is an example. In another dream an angel spoke to Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.11">Gn 31:11</a>). An angel appeared to Cornelius in a vision (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-3">Acts 10:1-3</a>). Major passages of this type include <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Isaiah 6</a> (the seraphim), much of the book of Ezekiel (the cherubim), and much of Daniel and Zechariah. In the NT, over a third of the references to angels are in the book of Revelation. In most cases there, the angelic beings are glorious or grotesque figures seen in visions and are not to be confused with human persons. The language describing such visions is appropriately mystical, or at least metaphorical and difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>Angelology, or the doctrine of angels, is not a major theme in Christian theology in spite of the many references to angels in the Bible. Angels are included in descriptions of all that God created (<a href="?bref=Ps.148.2">Ps 148:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.16">Col 1:16</a>). There are hints that they witnessed the creation of the world (<a href="?bref=Job.38.7">Jb 38:7</a>). No matter how close to God angels may be, they share with humankind the status of creatures. But as wholly spiritual creatures they are free from many human limitations, such as death (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.36">Lk 20:36</a>). They do not marry (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.30">Mt 22:30</a>), so they could be regarded as sexless. In all their appearances, angels in human form were taken to be men, never women or children. Their ability to communicate in human language and to affect human life in other ways is basic to their role in the Bible. Their power and awesome appearance (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.2-4">Mt 28:2-4</a>) sometimes tempted people to fear or worship them, but the NT does not condone the worship of angels (<a href="?bref=Col.2.18">Col 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.8-9">Rv 22:8-9</a>). Though angels are stronger and wiser than human beings, their power and knowledge are also limited by God (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.20">Ps 103:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.36">Mt 24:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11-12">1 Pt 1:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.11">2 Pt 2:11</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=CherubCherubim_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Cherub, Cherubim</a>; <a href="?item=SeraphSeraphim_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Seraph, Seraphim</a>; <a href="?item=Demon_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Demon</a>; <a href="?item=DemonPossession_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Demon-possession</a>; <a href="?item=Satan_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Satan</a>.</p>

  <title>Anger</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANGER</p>
<p class="fl">The word normally used in the Bible to refer to rage, fury, and indignation. In most instances, anger is considered to be wrong. <a href="?bref=Ps.37.8">Psalm 37:8</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>), for example, commands: “Stop your anger! Turn from your rage!” Jesus paralleled anger with murder when he said, “If you are angry with someone, you are subject to judgment!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22">Mt 5:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>)—just as if the person had actually committed the murder he felt in his angry heart. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.31">Ephesians 4:31</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.3.8">Colossians 3:8</a> both list anger, along with bitterness, wrath, malice, and slander, as attitudes that Christians must rid themselves of once and for all. In his list of attributes for a bishop or pastor of a church, the apostle Paul said that a Christian leader should not be prone to anger, that is, easily provoked (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.7">Ti 1:7</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible recognizes that humans get angry; it does not condemn the anger in and of itself but what often happens as the result. Humans have a habit of letting their anger get the best of them, causing them to sin. That is why the apostle Paul said, “Don’t sin by letting anger gain control over you” (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.26">Eph 4:26</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The longer a person allows anger to continue, the greater the danger that it will develop sinful qualities, giving Satan a foothold (see <a href="?bref=Eph.4.27">Eph 4:27</a>).</p>
<p>Anger of a good sort is also spoken of in the Bible. “Righteous indignation” refers to the extreme displeasure of a holy heart unable to tolerate sin of any kind. The anger of God contains this element: man should be good, yet he sins—and God is angry “because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they had not known and whom he had not allotted to them” (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.25-26">Dt 29:25-26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). It was in that sense also that Moses’ anger burned on Mt Sinai and caused him to smash the tablets of the covenant on the ground when he saw the golden calf and Israel’s idolatry (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.19">Ex 32:19</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, Mark says that Jesus looked with anger at the Pharisees, who were hoping to catch him breaking their law (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.5">Mk 3:5</a>). Jesus’ anger was also shown in his cleansing of the temple (<a href="?bref=John.2.13-22">Jn 2:13-22</a>); it should have been a place of prayer but was being used as a place of business. So Jesus “entered the Temple and began to drive out the merchants and their customers. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the stalls of those selling doves” (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12">Mt 21:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). His holy indignation was neither a weakness nor a sin. Such anger is an appropriate response to iniquity and injustice, especially when they are apparently unpunished.</p>

  <title>Animals</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANIMALS</p>
<p class="fl">In biblical usage, all members of the animal kingdom. Animals are mentioned throughout the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Animals figured in many important biblical events, including the Creation, the fall of man, the Flood, the ten plagues in Egypt, the Hebrew worship system, and the life of Jesus Christ. The people of both OT and NT times lived close to the land and were well acquainted with various animals so that the scriptural writers and Jesus himself frequently used animals as object lessons.</p>
<p>The biblical approach to classification of animals is somewhat different from the system of classification used by biologists today. The present system of classification, which traces back to Carolus Linnaeus (an 18th-century Swedish botanist), is based on structure, both internal and external. The biblical basis of classification is habitat. Thus <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> speaks of aquatic organisms (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.20">20</a>); aerial organisms (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.21">21</a>); animals that crawl on the ground (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.24">24</a>); cattle or domesticated animals (animals that live in association with humans) (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.24">24</a>); and wild animals (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.24">24</a>). The same system of classification is followed in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">Leviticus 11</a> and throughout Scripture.</p>
<p>Because of the divergence between systems of classification, the various animals of the Bible will be listed here in alphabetical order—including reptiles, fish, and even invertebrates such as insects, spiders, worms, and sponges. Birds are discussed in a separate article.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Adder">Adder</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 20 poisonous snakes found in Israel and surrounding countries, also referred to as cockatrice and viper. True vipers (genus <span class="ital">Cerastes, Echis colorata,</span> and <span class="ital">Vipera palestina</span>) also exist there, poisonous snakes with curved fangs that spring into position when the snake strikes. The horned viper <span class="ital">(Cerastes hasselquistii)</span> may attack horses. It is 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 centimeters) long and often lies in ambush in the sand with only its eyes and the hornlike protrusions on its head visible.</p>
<p>Both Jesus and John the Baptist referred to the viper several times (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.7">Mt 3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.34">12:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.33">23:33</a>). The reference in <a href="?bref=Acts.28.3">Acts 28:3</a> is probably to a small viper <span class="ital">(Vipera aspis)</span> that strikes rapidly and is very pugnacious. It is found in southern Europe and hisses each time it inhales and exhales. The poison of vipers attacks the respiratory system and disintegrates red blood cells.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Snake">Snake (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Ant">Ant</p>
<p class="fl">Mentioned only twice in the Bible, both times in the book of Proverbs. For many years Solomon was charged with a biological error when he referred to the ant as providing her meat in the summer and gathering her food in the harvest (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.8">Prv 6:8</a>). Critics of the Bible were quick to point out that, so far as was then known, ants do not store up food. They assumed that Solomon had probably kicked open an ant hill and mistaken the pupal cases (pods in which immature ants grow to maturity) for grain or had observed ants carrying bits of grain, leaves, and other matter to their nests.</p>
<p>At least three species of grain-storing ants are now known—two occur in Israel and the other in Mediterranean countries. The particular species referred to by Solomon (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.6-8">Prv 6:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.24-25">30:24-25</a>) is probably the harvester ant <span class="ital">(Messor semirufus).</span> Its granaries are flat chambers connected by galleries irregularly scattered over an area about six feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and about a foot (.3 meter) deep in the ground. Seeds are collected from the ground or picked from plants. The head, or radicle, which is the softest part of the kernel, is bitten off to prevent germination, and the chaff and empty capsules are discarded on kitchen middens (refuse piles) outside the nest. Individual granaries may be 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) in diameter and a half inch (1.2 centimeters) high. Some nests are known to be 40 feet (12 meters) in diameter and 6 to 7 feet (approx. 2 meters) deep with several entrances.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Antelope">Antelope</p>
<p class="fl">Several antelope-like creatures are referred to in the Scriptures. One seems to be the white oryx <span class="ital">(Oryx leucoryx),</span> referred to in <a href="?bref=Deut.14.5">Deuteronomy 14:5</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “wild ox”; <span class="sc">rsv</span> “antelope”) and <a href="?bref=Isa.51.20">Isaiah 51:20</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “wild bull”; <span class="sc">RSV </span>“antelope”). The oryx was probably the antelope, commonly used for food because its long horns made it relatively easy to catch.</p>
<p>Another antelope mentioned in the Bible is the addax <span class="ital">(Addax nasomaculatus),</span> probably the “pygarg” of <a href="?bref=Deut.14.5">Deuteronomy 14:5</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). It is a native of North Africa with grayish white hinder parts, a white patch on the forehead, and twisted and ringed horns. The word “pygarg” comes from a Greek word meaning “white rump.” The addax is about the size of a donkey. Its body is closely covered with short hair. It has a short mane on the underside of its neck that makes the head look somewhat like that of a goat. The hooves are broad and flat, and the tail resembles that of a donkey. It is common in Africa and in Arabia, where Arabs hunt it with falcons and dogs.</p>
<p>Antelopes are very graceful and run with their heads held high. Both sexes have long, permanent, hollow horns. With the oryx the horns go straight back; addax horns are twisted and ringed. Antelope are alert, wary, and keen sighted. They are usually found in herds of from two to a dozen. If injured or brought to bay, an antelope attacks with its head lowered so that the sharp horns point forward. Antelopes feed on grasses and shrubs, drinking from streams and water holes. When water is scarce, they eat melons and succulent bulbs. Both addax and oryx were ceremonially clean in Jewish law.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Ape">Ape</p>
<p class="fl">Primate not native to Palestine. The two references to apes in the OT (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.22">1 Kgs 10:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.21">2 Chr 9:21</a>) refer to their importation by King Solomon with other treasures on board the ships of his mercantile fleet. There is some question concerning the origin of those primates. Some believe that the mention of “ivory” in the same verses suggests they came from East Africa and that they were indeed apes, that is, tailless primates. Others, believing they came from India or Ceylon, suggest that they were actually monkeys. There the baboon (genus Papeio), a large monkey, was considered sacred to the god Thoth. Males of that genus were kept in temples, and the more docile females were often kept as house pets. Such baboons frequently had some of their teeth removed or ground down to lessen the danger of their biting. A number of mummified baboons have been found in Egypt, indicating the high regard in which they were held.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Asp">Asp</p>
<p class="fl">Poisonous snake. Most biblical references to the asp (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.33">Dt 32:33</a>) seem to be to the Egyptian cobra <span class="ital">(Naja haje),</span> which conceals itself in holes, walls, and rocks and has the ability to expand its neck by raising its anterior ribs so as to enlarge the front of its breast into the shape of a flat disc. Its potent poison can cause death in 30 minutes. It attains a length of about 80 inches (2 meters). The fangs are permanently erect, not movable as in the vipers (the common poisonous snakes of North America; only the coral snake in America has permanently erect fangs). Cobra poison attacks the nervous system, causing muscular paralysis. The Egyptians looked upon it as a sacred creature; they regarded it as a protector since it fed on the rodents that ate their crops. The “fiery serpents” (<a href="?bref=Num.21.6">Nm 21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.8.15">Dt 8:15</a>, both <span class="sc">rsv</span>) may have been cobras; “fiery” probably refers to the burning fever caused by their venom. <a href="?bref=Isa.14.29">Isaiah 14:29</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.30.6">30:6</a> (“flying serpent”) may refer to the hood of the cobra.</p>

<p class="fl"><span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Donkey_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Donkey (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Badger">Badger</p>
<p class="fl">Small hoofed mammal. What the <span class="sc">kjv</span> calls a “coney,” modern translations name “rock badger” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.5">Lv 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.7">Dt 14:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.18">Ps 104:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.26">Prv 30:26</a>). The rock badger spoken of in the Bible is probably the Syrian rock hyrax <span class="ital">(Hyrax syriaca),</span> the only species of hyrax found outside Africa. This small ungulate (having hooflike toenails) lives among rocks from the Dead Sea valley to Mt Hermon. It is strictly a herbivorous (plant-eating) animal about the size of a rabbit. It resembles a guinea pig more than a rabbit, having quite inconspicuous ears and a very small tail. It has broad nails with four toes on its forelegs and three on its hind legs, the toes being connected with skin almost like a web. Pads acting as sucking discs under its feet enable it to keep its footing on slippery rocks. With its yellow and brown fur, it is sometimes called the bear rat because of its resemblance to a tailless rat. It is also equipped with black whiskers that may be seven inches (17.8 centimeters) long.</p>
<p>These rock badgers, or hyraxes, live together in colonies of from 6 to 50 animals, often sunning themselves on rocks. They are difficult to catch. Guards are posted, and if approaching danger is sighted, the whole group will scurry for cover, warned by the sharp whistles of the guards. Thus they are commended for taking refuge in the rocks (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.18">Ps 104:18</a>) and are called wise for making “their houses in the rocks” (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.24,26">Prv 30:24, 26</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The badger is not a ruminant (does not chew its cud), but the motion of its jaws may suggest that it chews its cud. That is probably why it was included with other cud-chewing animals in the Jewish food laws (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.5">Lv 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.7">Dt 14:7</a>). It was forbidden to the Jews as food because it did not have cloven hooves. Some Arabs eat and even prize its meat.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Bat">Bat</p>
<p class="fl">Flying mammals according to modern classification. They have hair and provide milk for their young. The Bible classifies them with other aerial creatures. Bats take shelter in caves, crevices, tree cavities, buildings, and also in exposed places on trees. In colder areas they hibernate or migrate. The normal resting position for a bat is hanging head downward. Bats “swim” through the air rather than fly because they move with their legs as well as with their wings.</p>
<p>The bat’s thumb is free and terminates in a single hook claw used for climbing and hanging. The hind feet have five toes, all pointing the same way. The large chest accommodates the powerful muscles needed for flying. Because they orient themselves by echo location, the sense of hearing is very well developed.</p>
<p>Most bats are insect eaters, seizing insects in flight. Many insectivorous bats also eat some fruit. Other bats feed exclusively, usually in groups, on fruit and green vegetation. Fruit-eating bats generally live in the tropics where fruit is constantly ripening, although some have been found in the Holy Land. These bats tend to be larger than the insectivores, having a wingspread of up to five feet (1.5 meters).</p>
<p>A third group includes flower-eating bats that feed on pollen and nectar. These small bats with long pointed heads and long tongues are found only in tropical and semitropical regions. Three species of vampire bats, which do not occur in the Holy Land, eat blood by making a small incision and lapping it up. Carnivorous (meat-eating) bats prey on birds, lizards, and frogs. Fish-eating bats catch fish at or near the water surface.</p>
<p>Eight varieties of bats are known in the Holy Land. One of them, the little brown bat (genus <span class="ital">Myotis</span>), is worldwide in its distribution. It is insectivorous and probably has the widest distribution of any nonhuman terrestrial mammal. Brown bats are mostly cave dwellers. The females form maternity colonies that may number in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Two species of mouse-tailed bats (genus <span class="ital">Rhinopoma</span>) are found in the Holy Land. Their tails are nearly as long as the head and body combined. They are colonial, roosting in caves, rock clefts, wells, pyramids, palaces, and houses. Like the brown bat, they are insectivorous. The slit-faced or hollow-faced bats (genus <span class="ital">Nycteris</span>) are also found in the Holy Land. They are insectivorous and roost in groups from 6 to 20.</p>
<p>The bats found in the Holy Land vary in size from that of a mouse to the size of a rat; the largest species measures more than 20 inches (51 centimeters) across the wings. The bat was unclean to the Jews (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.19">Lv 11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.18">Dt 14:18</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Bear">Bear</p>
<p class="fl">Large, heavy, big-headed mammal with short, powerful limbs, a short tail, and small eyes and ears. Bears have a “plantigrade” walk: they walk on both the sole and heel as humans do. The Palestinian bear is a Syrian version of the brown bear <span class="ital">(Ursus arctos syriacus).</span> It can grow to a height of 6 feet (1.8 meters) and may weigh as much as 500 pounds (227 kilograms).</p>
<p>Bears have an excellent sense of smell but less developed senses of sight and hearing. They are omnivorous (eating any kind of food); they subsist largely on vegetation, fruits, insects, and fish.</p>
<p>Bears are usually peaceful and inoffensive, but if they think they must defend themselves (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.10">Lam 3:10</a>) or their young (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.8">2 Sm 17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.17.12">Prv 17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.8">Hos 13:8</a>), they may be formidable and dangerous adversaries. David boasted of his role as a bear killer (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.34-37">1 Sm 17:34-37</a>). Since a blow from a bear’s paw can be fatal, David’s courage and strength as a young shepherd in running after a bear and wrenching one of his father’s sheep from its jaws were noteworthy.</p>
<p>Some biblical passages seem to imply that bears attacked for no apparent reason (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.28.15">Prv 28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.19">Am 5:19</a>). At other times they were God’s instruments of punishment, as in the story of Elisha and the two she-bears (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.24">2 Kgs 2:24</a>). The bear and the lion, often mentioned together in the Bible (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.37">1 Sm 17:37</a>), were the two largest and strongest beasts of prey in the Holy Land. Thus they symbolized both strength and terror (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.19">Am 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>In biblical times bears seem to have roamed all over Palestine. Today they are found only in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountains, and even there they are rare.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Bee">Bee</p>
<p class="fl">One of two domesticated insects <span class="ital">(Apis mellifica),</span> the other being the silkworm. Bees gather nectar from flowers, transferring pollen from one flower to another in the process. It is believed that they convey the location of sources of nectar to other bees through a bee “dance,” which may indicate both distance and direction. Bees are sensitive to four colors: blue-green, yellow-green, blue-violet, and ultra-violet (invisible to humans).</p>
<p>The wild bees of the Holy Land are especially noted for their ferocity in attack. Only the female “worker” bees sting people and animals, the virulence of their venom increasing in warm weather. A number of biblical passages allude to the irritable, vindictive nature of bees and to the painful stings they inflict (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.44">Dt 1:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.118.12">Ps 118:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.18">Is 7:18</a>).</p>
<p>One reference calls attention to the fact that in semidesert regions a dead animal’s carcass, stripped to the bone by jackals or vultures and dried in the sun, can provide wild bees an excellent place to start a new colony (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.5-9">Jgs 14:5-9</a>).</p>
<p>The Egyptians considered the bee sacred. In ancient Greece candles were made from beeswax. In the Holy Land, beekeeping was probably not practiced until the Hellenistic period (second century <span class="era">BC</span>), although <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.17">Ezekiel 27:17</a> suggests that it may have been practiced earlier. If domestic honey was not available to the Hebrews, wild honey certainly was, and travelers would be on the lookout for caches of honey in rocky clefts and other likely places. The Philistines and the Hittites practiced beekeeping in their cities.</p>
<p>The Bible contains many references to bees and bee products. A bee swarm was a valuable asset, though the price of honey itself was low. Honey was sometimes eaten with the honeycomb (<a href="?bref=Song.5.1">Sg 5:1</a>). Honey also had uses other than food, e.g., in embalming.</p>
<p>The land of Israel was described as a land flowing with milk and honey. Honey was a major source of sweetening in the ancient Near East—hence, its importance (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.14.8-9">Jgs 14:8-9</a>). Actually the Hebrew word for “honey” may include not only bee honey but also the sweet syrup extracted from such fruits as figs, dates, and grapes. Thus “a land flowing with milk and honey” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.8">Ex 3:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) does not necessarily stand for a land of bees but for a land rich in sweetness.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Camel">Camel</p>
<p class="fl">Large beast of burden. Unintelligent, ill-natured, and quarrelsome, the camel <span class="ital">(Camelus dromedarius)</span> is nevertheless a blessing to people living in the desert and on its borders because it is especially adapted to that habitat. It has been called the ship of the desert. Having thick elastic pads of fibrous tissue on its feet, it can walk on hot desert sands. It can go without water for long periods and can subsist on vegetation growing on the saline soils. The camel’s nostrils are pinched together and can be closed at will to prevent penetration of sand during violent sandstorms.</p>
<p>Camels are used for transporting both goods and people. A person riding a camel can cover from 60 to 75 miles (96.5 to 121 kilometers) in a day. A camel can carry a load weighing 600 pounds (272 kilograms) or more. Camels were used heavily in the spice trade (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Gn 37:25</a>) and traveled regularly in camel trains between Arabia, Egypt, and Assyria. They were also ridden in time of war (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.5">Jgs 6:5</a>). A camel can even be hitched to a plow in areas where the land is cultivated.</p>
<p>The hair shed by camels during the early spring is preserved and used in weaving cloth and making tents. As much as 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of hair can be obtained from one camel. A rough cloak of camel’s hair, as worn by John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.4">Mt 3:4</a>), is still worn by Bedouins today. A camel’s hair garment was also the sign of the prophetic office (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.4">Zec 13:4</a>).</p>
<p>Two varieties of camel occur within the one-humped species, the slow burden-bearing camel referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Genesis 37:25</a> and the fast dromedary of <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.17">1 Samuel 30:17</a>. The dromedary can stand seven feet (2.1 meters) tall and measure as much as nine feet (2.7 meters) from the muzzle to the tip of the tail. With its three-chambered stomach, which can hold from 15 to 30 quarts (14.2 to 28.4 liters) of liquid, it can go for as long as 5 days during the summer or 25 days in winter without drinking. The camel’s hump is a reserve store of fat, making it possible for the animal to subsist on very little food during a desert journey.</p>
<p>Another species of camel, the Bactrian camel <span class="ital">(Camelus bactrianus),</span> is also resident in the Holy Land. It has two humps. It is heavier, bigger, and has longer hair than the one-humped camel and is slower than the swift dromedary. <a href="?bref=Isa.21.7">Isaiah 21:7</a> may refer to the Bactrian camel; both kinds of camel are referred to in <a href="?bref=Esth.8.10">Esther 8:10</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). Camels ranked in importance with sheep, cattle, and asses in OT times. A third of the 66 biblical references to the camel lists it with other animals.</p>
<p>Camels are ruminants (cud-chewing mammals) but do not have cloven hooves. Thus, they were included in the list of unclean beasts, forbidden by the Israelites as food (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.4">Lv 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.7">Dt 14:7</a>). They are eaten by Arabs, however, who also drink their milk (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.32.15">Gn 32:15</a>).</p>
<p>Abraham had camels in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.16">Gn 12:16</a>). At first Job had 3,000 camels (<a href="?bref=Job.1.3">Jb 1:3</a>) and after his recovery, 6,000 (<a href="?bref=Job.42.12">Jb 42:12</a>). Although wide use of camels does not seem to have begun until shortly before 1000 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.5">Jgs 6:5</a>), Sumerian texts from the Old Babylonian period list camels and indicate that they had been domesticated. Camel bones and figurines have been found at various eastern archaeological sites dating from well before 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Caterpillar">Caterpillar</p>
<p class="fl">Larval stage of insects characterized by complete metamorphosis. Such insects pass through four stages: egg, larva or caterpillar, pupa, and adult. Bees, flies, moths, and butterflies all pass through a larval or caterpillar stage.</p>
<p>The word “caterpillar” occurs three times in the <span class="sc">nlt</span> (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.37">1 Kgs 8:37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.28">2 Chr 6:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.46">Ps 78:46</a>). In the book of Joel that same Hebrew word is translated “locust” (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.4">1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.25">2:25</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The locust and grasshopper to which the Hebrew word refers have an incomplete type of metamorphosis with only three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The nymph is a miniature adult in which the wings are not fully developed, though their outline may be present. There are several nymph stages known as instars. The reference is to one of the last instars, in which the wing structures are still folded together and enclosed in a sac but are nevertheless clearly recognizable. That form of the insect is about an inch (2.5 centimeters) long.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Locust">Locust (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cattle">Cattle</p>
<p class="fl">Domestic animals of the bovine species <span class="ital">(Bos primigenius).</span> The OT often emphasized the beauty of cattle. Egypt was rich in cattle, especially in the Nile River delta area (Goshen), where the Hebrews settled under Joseph.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe that milk rather than meat was the foremost consideration in the domestication of cattle and that in early civilizations meat supplies came chiefly from wild game. Cattle also supplied strong hides that supplanted wood in the manufacture of shields. Their dung was a source of fuel when wood was scarce (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.15">Ez 4:15</a>). They were used as beasts of burden and for plowing. Development of wheeled transportation was associated more closely with cattle than with any other animal.</p>
<p>The biblical term “cattle” often refers to all domesticated animals or livestock (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.24">Gn 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.2.20">2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.7.23">7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.47.6,16-17">47:6, 16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.3-7">Ex 9:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.41,45">Nm 3:41, 45</a>). Occasionally, the term was used to refer to all large domestic animals (<a href="?bref=Num.31.9">Nm 31:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.32.26">32:26</a>), although sometimes the word as used in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> refers only to sheep and goats (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.32,39,43">Gn 30:32, 39, 43</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.31.8,10">31:8, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.25">Is 7:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.23">43:23</a>).</p>
<p>Probably several kinds of cattle were domesticated in the Holy Land. Small, short-legged, black or brown shorthorn cattle were found in the southern part of Judah; that type submitted easily to the yoke and was prominent in agricultural operations. Along the coast a larger variety was found, and the wild districts east of the Jordan River were populated with a breed of huge black cattle.</p>
<p>Cattle breeding was widely practiced by the patriarchs (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.32.15">Gn 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.21.10">Jb 21:10</a>). Strict laws in Mesopotamia, as well as in Israel, penalized the owner of a bull that gored a man or other cattle (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.28-36">Ex 21:28-36</a>). Bulls were sometimes employed figuratively as pictures of strength or violence (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.17">Dt 33:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.12">Pss 22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.30">68:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.13">Is 10:13</a>). For breeding purposes one bull is normally adequate for about 30 cows, but many more were kept since bulls were widely used in Israel for sacrifices. They might be used as a general sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.23">Lv 22:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.23.1">Nm 23:1</a>) or for special sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.25">Jgs 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.24">1 Sm 1:24</a>). Particular sacrifices were offered at the consecration of priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.1">Ex 29:1</a>), consecration of an altar (<a href="?bref=Num.7.1-89">Nm 7</a>), purification of the Levites (<a href="?bref=Num.8.1-26">Nm 8</a>), sin offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lv 16</a>), day of the new moon (<a href="?bref=Num.28.11-14">Nm 28:11-14</a>), Passover (<a href="?bref=Num.28.19">Nm 28:19</a>), Feast of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Num.28.27">Nm 28:27</a>), Feast of Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Num.29.1-2">Nm 29:1-2</a>), Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Num.29.7-9">Nm 29:7-9</a>), and the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=Num.29.12-38">Nm 29:12-38</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles required the largest number of bulls for burnt offerings of all the annual feasts, with a total of 71 being slaughtered during the course of eight days.</p>
<p>Calves were sometimes referred to as “sons of the herd” in the original Hebrew (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.8">Gn 18:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.7">1 Sm 6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.32">14:32</a>). The calf, a symbol of peacefulness (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.6">Is 11:6</a>), was also used figuratively to refer to the weak (<a href="?bref=Ps.68.30">Ps 68:30</a>). A calf’s head decorated the back of Solomon’s throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.19">1 Kgs 10:19</a>). Calves were sometimes fattened in stalls to keep them from running off weight in the field (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.2">Mal 4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.23">Lk 15:23</a>) or were kept around the house; the witch of Endor kept a calf in her house that she killed and served to Saul and his men (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.24-25">1 Sm 28:24-25</a>). Calves supplied veal (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.7">Gn 18:7</a>), considered a delicacy by the wealthy; Amos referred to stall-fattened calves in a denunciation of luxurious and careless living (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>). Calves also supplied meat for all Saul’s armies at the great slaughter of the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.32">1 Sm 14:32</a>). The “fatted calf” served roasted or boiled was gourmet fare, suitable for the finest banquet (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.7">Gn 18:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.4">Mt 22:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.23">Lk 15:23</a>).</p>
<p>Cattle were subject to the law of firstlings (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.12">Ex 13:12</a>). They were a mark of wealth (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.2">Gn 13:2</a>) and were considered proper booty of war (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.2">Jos 8:2</a>). Aaron, the first high priest, made a golden calf as a rival to the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Ex 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.9.16,21">Dt 9:16, 21</a>). Even though he represented the calf as an image of the invisible God, it was especially offensive because the calf was a fertility symbol related to Egyptian and Canaanite practices. Two calves were later made by Jeroboam I of Israel (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>) for his shrines at Bethel and Dan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.28-33">1 Kgs 12:28-33</a>). Hosea’s prophetic denunciations of calf worship were directed at those shrines (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.5-6">Hos 8:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.2">13:2</a>).</p>
<p>An ox is an adult castrated bull. A steer is a young ox. Oxen were used to do work (<a href="?bref=Num.7.3">Nm 7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.10">Dt 22:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.25.4">25:4</a>), though for moving heavy objects, cows were typically favored over bulls because of their more docile nature. Oxen were also used as pack animals (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.40">1 Chr 12:40</a>, although they did not have the endurance of the ass, camel, or mule. They usually fed on grass (<a href="?bref=Num.22.4">Nm 22:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.20">Ps 106:20</a>), but they also ate straw (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.7">Is 11:7</a>) and salted fodder (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.24">Is 30:24</a>) and could be kept in a stable (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.15">Lk 13:15</a>). Oxen could not be offered as sacrifices because they had been castrated (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.24">Lv 22:24</a>). They could be used for food but were rarely eaten. Possession of an ox and an ass was regarded as the bare minimum for existence in the ancient Palestinian agriculture economy (<a href="?bref=Job.24.3">Jb 24:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Chameleon">Chameleon</p>
<p class="fl">Lizard characterized by its ability to change color according to its surroundings <span class="ital">(Chameleon vulgaris).</span> To the Israelites the chameleon was ritually unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.30">Lv 11:30</a>). The Hebrew word for chameleon is derived from a word meaning “to pant.” A lizard’s lungs are very large, and in ancient times lizards were believed to live on air. A chameleon’s eyes move independently of each other; so at times one eye may be turned upward and the other downward. Chameleons live in trees and bushes, clinging to branches with their long tails.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Lizard">Lizard (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Coral">Coral</p>
<p class="fl">Calcareous (lime-containing) skeletons of relatively simple marine organisms <span class="ital">(Corallium rubrum).</span> Red coral from the Mediterranean and Red Seas is widely used for jewelry and for medicinal purposes. While the animal is alive, the coral is green in color and shrublike in appearance, looking rather like an underwater plant since the coral animals are immobil. When the coral is removed from the water, it becomes hard and red in color.</p>
<p>In ancient times coral was sometimes used as money, along with precious stones, pearls, and gold. Some believe the biblical reference in <a href="?bref=Lam.4.7">Lamentations 4:7</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) is to pearls rather than to coral, but it is probable that the references in <a href="?bref=Job.28.18">Job 28:18</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.16">Ezekiel 27:16</a> are to the red coral (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cricket">Cricket</p>
<p class="fl">Insect of the order Orthptera related to grasshoppers and locusts. According to <a href="?bref=Lev.11.22">Leviticus 11:22</a>, the cricket was edible. The reference may be to one of the growth stages of the locust.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates the Hebrew word as “beetle.” Beetles are insects with chewing mouth parts and two pairs of wings, the fore pair being hard and sheathlike and the hind pair being membranous and folded under the fore pair. Some beetles are carnivorous, others are chiefly herbivorous. Some are aquatic, some produce a secretion that blisters the skin, some damage fabrics, some damage crops, and some feed on other insects that are harmful to humans. In ancient Egypt the beetle, or sacred scarab, was a symbol of the sun god Ra. Scarab seals and amulets were extremely popular in Egypt.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Crocodile">Crocodile</p>
<p class="fl">Largest of all existing reptiles <span class="ital">(Crocodilus vulgaris),</span> attaining a length of well over 20 feet (6 meters). Crocodiles are characterized by large lizardlike bodies supported by short legs. The head terminates in a flattened snout armed with strong conical teeth, each of which is implanted in a distinct socket. New teeth growing from beneath continually replace those in use. The toes are webbed. The back and tail are protected by quadrangular horny shields of varying sizes arranged in regular rows and in contact with one another at the edges. The eyes are covered with movable lids that can be closed when the animal enters the water.</p>
<p>The crocodile spends most of its time in the water where it feeds mainly on fish but also on aquatic birds and even small animals that come down to the water’s edge to drink. It is surprisingly fast and agile on dry land, even though its legs are so short that its belly and tail drag across the earth leaving a distinct path.</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the 20th century, the crocodile was found in the marshes and small coastal rivers of western Palestine. A first-century Roman writer, Pliny, referred to a place in the Holy Land called Crocodeilopolis (“crocodile city”) to the south of Mt Carmel, and visitors to the Holy Land as late as the 19th century reported seeing crocodiles in that general region.</p>
<p>The description of “Leviathan” in <a href="?bref=Job.41.1-34">Job 41</a> seems to be based on the crocodile (thus the translation of the <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The “dragon” of <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.3">Ezekiel 29:3</a>, used figuratively of the Egyptian pharaoh, may be a reference to the crocodile.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Deer">Deer</p>
<p class="fl">Large ruminant (cud-chewing) animals. Only the males have antlers (branching horns). Deer antlers grow annually and are solid, in contrast to those of the antelope and the gazelle. Fully developed antlers are devoid of any covering of skin or horn and, for all practical purposes, may be regarded as a mass of dead bone carried for a certain time by the living animal.</p>
<p>The end of the deer’s muzzle is naked in all species. The stomach is divided into a series of compartments, some of which are used to store partly chewed food. The food is later regurgitated, rechewed, and finally swallowed into a section of the stomach where true digestion takes place.</p>
<p>Three species of deer were known in Palestine: the red deer <span class="ital">(Cervus elaphus),</span> the Persian fallow deer <span class="ital">(Dama mesopotamica),</span> and the roe deer <span class="ital">(Capreolus capreolus).</span> All are now extinct there. The last deer were hunted in the Holy Land in 1914. The red deer referred to in the Bible as “hart” (male), “stag” (male), or “hind” (female) stood about four feet (1.2 meters) high at the shoulder. It was gregarious (living in herds or flocks), each group remaining in a definite territory. Red deer grazed and browsed during the morning and late afternoon (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.6">Lam 1:6</a>). The sexes remained in separate herds. The red deer was known for its leaping (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.6">Is 35:6</a>) and sure-footedness in the mountains (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.33">Ps 18:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.2.8-9,17">Sg 2:8-9, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.8.14">8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.3.19">Hb 3:19</a>).</p>
<p>The antlers of the Persian fallow deer (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kgs 4:23</a>) were large, flattened, and palmated (shaped like an open palm with fingers extended), and its coat was a yellowbrown. It traveled in small groups, feeding mainly on grass in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>The roe deer (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.5">Dt 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kgs 4:23</a>) was a small, graceful animal, dark reddish brown in summer and yellowish gray in winter. Its antlers were about a foot (30.5 centimeters) long and had three points. The roe deer preferred sparsely wooded valleys and the lower slopes of mountains, grazing in open grasslands. It usually associated in family groups made up of the doe and her offspring. They were shy, yet very curious. The roe deer barked like a dog when disturbed, and they were excellent swimmers.</p>
<p>There is some question as to whether the roe deer is actually referred to in such passages as <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kings 4:23</a>; references may be to the fallow deer, although that animal does not seem to have lived in the southern part of Palestine around the Sinai Desert because of its need for ample amounts of food and water. Fallow deer were found in northern Palestine.</p>
<p>The hart (the male red deer) was listed among the clean beasts that Jewish law permitted as food (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.15,22">Dt 12:15, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.5">14:5</a>), but deer were not listed among the animals appropriate for sacrifice. The hind (female red deer) normally gave birth to one calf at a time, though twins were born with some degree of regularity (<a href="?bref=Job.39.1">Jb 39:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.9">Ps 29:9</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.5">Jer 14:5</a>). The gestation period was about 40 weeks. When it was about to give birth, the hind looked for a secure hiding place, preferably in the dense undergrowth of the forest where it could find natural protection for the tiny calf. During the first few days after birth, the mother never went far from her young. The fawn was able to stand on its own legs a few hours after birth. The solicitous care by the hind for her calf during the first days of its life is hinted at in a touching way in <a href="?bref=Jer.14.4-5">Jeremiah 14:4-5</a>, where only a severe drought is said to drive the hind from her calf. <a href="?bref=Job.39.1-4">Job 39:1-4</a> describes the calving of the hinds. The hind illustrated grace and charm (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.21">Gn 49:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.5.19">Prv 5:19</a>), and its dark, gentle eyes and graceful limbs were used to describe the beauty of a woman (<a href="?bref=Pr.5.18-19">Prv 5:18-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Dog">Dog</p>
<p class="fl">Probably the earliest domesticated animal <span class="ital">(Canis familiaris),</span> used very early in hunting. The modern dog is believed to have come from the Indian wolf <span class="ital">(Canis lupus pallipes).</span> The dogs of biblical times probably looked like a modern German shepherd, with short pointed ears, a pointed nose, and a long tail.</p>
<p>The dog was generally looked down upon in biblical times (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.11">Prv 26:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.22">2 Pt 2:22</a>). The biblical writers did not share modern sentiments about dogs being man’s best friends. The dog was pictured as a scavenger, haunting streets and dumps (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.31">Ex 22:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.38">1 Kgs 22:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.26">Mt 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.21">Lk 16:21</a>). Human corpses could become the spoil of dogs (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.35-36">2 Kgs 9:35-36</a>). In general, dogs served the same function as vultures and other birds of prey. Most of the 41 references in the Scriptures to dogs show strong disfavor. Dogs were considered cowardly, filthy creatures.</p>
<p>Dogs used in hunting occur in paintings in Egyptian tombs, and there is a reference to dogs herding sheep in <a href="?bref=Job.30.1">Job 30:1</a>. One good quality of dogs highly esteemed by the Israelites was watchfulness (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.10">Is 56:10</a>). In general, however, in biblical times “dog” was a term of contempt (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.43">1 Sm 17:43</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.9">2 Sm 16:9</a>) and was used of overly submissive persons (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.8">2 Sm 9:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.13">2 Kgs 8:13</a>) and of evil persons (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.10-11">Is 56:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.7.6">Mt 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.2">Phil 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.15">Rv 22:15</a>).</p>
<p>Dogs, like pigs, were voracious and omnivorous (eating any kind of food). In response to a Gentile woman’s request that he heal her daughter, Jesus used the metaphor of throwing household food scraps to dogs (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.22-28">Mt 15:22-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.25-30">Mk 7:25-30</a>). At the time of Jesus, the word “dog” was a standard Jewish term of contempt for Gentiles who, like dogs, were considered unclean, although the diminutive form of the word, used by Jesus, softened this considerably. Seeing her faith, Jesus granted the woman’s request, giving a non-Jew some of “the children’s bread.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Donkey">Donkey</p>
<p class="fl">Beast of burden. The donkey of the Holy Land <span class="ital">(Equus asinus)</span> was quite different from the European donkey of today, which is usually a small, stubborn animal. In biblical times the donkey was a beautiful, stately, friendly animal. Its color was usually reddish brown. Three wild races have been described, all from Africa. The race from northwest Africa is extinct; the one from northeast Africa, if not extinct, is close to extinction; the Somalian race, which survives, did not play an important part in domestication. The northeast African race, the Nubian donkey, was evidently domesticated in the Nile River region in early historic times. The donkey was used as a mount from the time of domestication on. It is first mentioned in the Bible among the animals that Abraham acquired in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.16">Gn 12:16</a>). The donkey was primarily a beast of burden, driven but not bridled. From the time of the Middle Kingdom on (c. 2040 <span class="era">BC</span>), it was used for riding in Egypt, but only the Jews and Nubians rode donkeys regularly. The donkey was also used for threshing grain and for pulling the plow. In Arab countries today peasants plow with a donkey and a cow or camel hitched together. In Israel the law forbade plowing with a donkey and an ox hitched together (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.10">Dt 22:10</a>). Until the time of Solomon (960 <span class="era">BC</span>), horses were not used in Palestine. From that time on, the horse was ridden by warriors; the donkey was used by those who were traveling peaceably.</p>
<p>The donkey was held in high regard by the Jews and was considered an economic asset. An individual had to have a donkey for minimum existence (<a href="?bref=Job.24.3">Jb 24:3</a>), and wealth was frequently counted by the number of donkeys one possessed (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.16">Gn 12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.24.35">24:35</a>). The donkey was considered an acceptable gift (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.13-15">Gn 32:13-15</a>). It was allowed to rest on the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.14">Dt 5:14</a>). Women in biblical times often used the donkey as a riding animal (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.18">Jos 15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.23">1 Sm 25:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.24">2 Kgs 4:24</a>); often a special driver would help a woman guide the animal, running along at its side. If a married couple possessed only one donkey, the husband usually walked alongside while the wife rode (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.20">Ex 4:20</a>).</p>
<p>The people of Israel returning from Babylon had ten times as many donkeys as horses and camels (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.66-67">Ezr 2:66-67</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.68-69">Neh 7:68-69</a>). Job’s wealth was indicated by the fact that he had 500 she-donkeys before catastrophe hit him (<a href="?bref=Job.1.3">Jb 1:3</a>); after his recovery he had 1,000 donkeys (<a href="?bref=Job.42.12">Jb 42:12</a>). Joseph’s brothers used donkeys to transport the grain they purchased in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.26">Gn 42:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.24">43:24</a>). Abigail transported food on donkeys to David and his troops during their conflict with Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.18">1 Sm 25:18</a>). David assigned one of the 12 managers of his royal estates to look after his donkeys exclusively (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.30">1 Chr 27:30</a>).</p>
<p>The onager, or Syrian wild donkey <span class="ital">(Equus hemionus hemihippus)</span>, is an intermediate between the true horse and the true donkey. Its ears are longer than those of a horse but shorter than those of a donkey. The front hooves are narrow; there are chestnuts (callouslike spots on the inside of the knees) on the front legs only, and the tail is short haired for a long distance from its root so that it appears to be tufted.</p>
<p>The Sumerians (ancient Mesopotamians) were able to domesticate the onager, which was eventually replaced by the horse. It was used to draw chariots in Ur; a number of onagers were buried with their vehicles in a royal grave that dates from about 2500 <span class="era">BC</span>. Later the wild onager was a favorite hunter’s prize for Babylonian and Assyrian kings.</p>
<p>The onager was very common in the steppe lands near Israel, where it was described as a freedom-loving desert animal (<a href="?bref=Job.24.5">Jb 24:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.39.5-8">39:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.11">Ps 104:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.32.14">Is 32:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.24">Jer 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.9">Hos 8:9</a>). Ishmael was described as “free and untamed as a wild donkey” (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.12">Gn 16:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>)—that is, one who could not adjust to domestic life. Drought seems to have been responsible for the population decline of the onager in biblical times (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.6">Jer 14:6</a>). The modern onager <span class="ital">(Equus hemionus onager)</span> is slightly larger than the Syrian wild donkey that is extinct.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Dragon">Dragon</p>
<p class="fl">Any one of a number of monstrous land and sea creatures. In biblical usage, “dragon” does not refer to the huge, fire-breathing, winged reptile of European folklore. The translators of the <span class="sc">kjv</span> used the term to translate two Hebrew words that are usually rendered more precisely in modern translations. One word referred to desert animals; most scholars agree with the <span class="sc">niv</span> that “jackals” is its proper meaning (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.19">Ps 44:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.13.22">Is 13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.11">Jer 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.1.3">Mal 1:3</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Jackal_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jackal (below)</a>.</p>
<p>The other Hebrew word translated “dragon” is harder to define. It was frequently used in reference to serpents (so translated in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>: <a href="?bref=Exod.7.9-12">Ex 7:9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.33">Dt 32:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.91.13">Ps 91:13</a>). In other <span class="sc">rsv</span> passages it is translated “sea monster” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.21">Gn 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.7.12">Jb 7:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.148.7">Ps 148:7</a>). The exact identity of such sea monsters is not known. Several <span class="sc">rsv</span> passages retain the English “dragon.” In two of them (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.13">Ps 74:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.1">Is 27:1</a>), the context indicates that sea monsters are meant. In three others (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.9">Is 51:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.3">Ez 29:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.2">32:2</a>) “dragon” seems to refer to the crocodile, a figurative reference to the Egyptian pharaoh at the time of the exodus. <a href="?bref=Jer.51.34">Jeremiah 51:34</a> (translated “monster” in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>) may also refer to a voracious creature such as a crocodile. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Crocodile_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Crocodile (above)</a>.</p>
<p>Babylonian myths described monsters and dragons in primordial conflict with the god Marduk; they represented the principle of evil. In its figurative usages in Scripture, “dragon” has a similar significance, especially in the prophetic books. In the book of Revelation it is a symbol of Satan, the archenemy of God and his people (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.3-17">Rv 12:3-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.2,4,11">13:2, 4, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.13">16:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.2">20:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Fish">Fish</p>
<p class="fl">Aquatic animals frequently mentioned in the Bible without names or descriptions that enable us to identify the particular species. Since time immemorial, fish have constituted one of the staple foods of humanity, and they still serve as the chief source of protein in many parts of the world. The trade in fish was highly developed in biblical times. For example, one of the gates in Jerusalem was called the Fish Gate (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.3">Neh 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.10">Zep 1:10</a>). The law in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.9-12">Leviticus 11:9-12</a> permitted the Jews to eat fish, but only those having both fins and scales. Scaleless fish such as catfish were forbidden, even though they had fins.</p>
<p>Egyptian paintings depict various methods of fishing, and the Philistines fished in the Mediterranean Sea. Since the people of Israel were not a seafaring nation, it is safe to assume that most of their fish came from freshwater lakes and rivers, especially the Sea of Galilee. Some 36 species of fish have been identified in that lake, including varieties of perch, carp, barbel, “sardine,” and catfish.</p>
<p>The method of fishing characteristic of NT times was the dragnet. After a boat had put out into the deep (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.4">Lk 5:4</a>), a large net would be thrown out from it and then dragged toward shore by the rowers in the boat, possibly with the help of a crew in another boat. The catch was sorted out on shore (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.47-48">Mt 13:47-48</a>). Fishing was usually carried out at night when the coolness of the water brought fish closer to the surface and when they could not see the approaching nets.</p>
<p>The Jews also fished by hook and line (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.27">Mt 17:27</a>), a few by spear (<a href="?bref=Job.41.7">Jb 41:7</a>), and some by the throw net (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.10">Ez 47:10</a>). Habakkuk refers to hook-and-line fishing, netting, and seining (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.15">1:15</a>).</p>
<p>Very early in the history of the Christian church the fish became a symbol for Christ and the faith. It was scratched on the walls of Roman catacombs and may be seen today decorating walls, altars, pews, and vestments. The symbol came into use because the Greek word for “fish” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">ichthus</span><span class="ital">)</span> is composed of the first letter of each word in the Greek phrase “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior.” <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Whale_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Whale (below)</a>. </p>
<p class="h2" id="Flea">Flea</p>
<p class="fl">Tiny, irritating insect (<a href="?bref=1Sam.24.14">1 Sm 24:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.20">26:20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Many species of fleas occur in Palestine, the most common being <span class="ital">Pulex irritans.</span> About a thousand species are known around the world. Fleas are wingless parasites that have sharp jaws and suck out blood from the bodies of humans and animals. The body is wedge shaped, enabling the flea to burrow into folds of skin and hide there. The eggs, laid by the female in dust heaps in the corners of rooms, hatch into small, white larvae that pupate (a nonfeeding stage) in a cocoon. Soon adult fleas appear that immediately attach themselves to the body of a host. The female requires blood for the development of her eggs.</p>
<p>A flea bite is painful and causes some swelling and itching. Fleas are attracted by warmth. With favorable moisture and temperature, adult fleas can live a year or longer without food, but they are voracious feeders. The most dangerous fleas are those of the rat that transmit the organism responsible for bubonic plague. There were 41 recorded epidemics of bubonic plague before the Christian era.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Fly">Fly</p>
<p class="fl">Insects of the order Diptera, which have one pair of wings. Many winged insects of other orders, however, are also called flies, such as the dragonfly or butterfly.</p>
<p>As in almost all parts of the world, flies are abundant in Palestine. One of the most numerous is the common housefly <span class="ital">(Musca domestica),</span> found chiefly around dung heaps and garbage. The female lays her eggs, out of which emerge white maggots that feed on refuse. After a few days the maggot develops into a cocoon out of which emerges the adult housefly. In the summer the whole cycle lasts about 12 days, so that a fly can breed about 20 generations a year.</p>
<p>Another fly common to Palestine is the botfly (family Oestridae). It causes much discomfort among livestock by irritating them and spreading diseases. Tabanid flies (family Tabanidae), including the horsefly (genus <span class="ital">Tabanus</span>) and related species, are also found in Palestine. Both the botfly and horsefly are known as gadflies because of the persistent distress they inflict. Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar is spoken of as a gadfly in view of his invasion of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.20">Jer 46:20</a>).</p>
<p>The fourth plague in Egypt just before the exodus featured “swarms of flies” (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.21-31">Ex 8:21-31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.78.45">Pss 78:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.31">105:31</a>). Those swarms may have been made up of any or all the flies mentioned above. The maggots mentioned in <a href="?bref=Job.25.6">Job 25:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.14.11">Isaiah 14:11</a> and the worms in <a href="?bref=Exod.16.24">Exodus 16:24</a> and <a href="?bref=Job.7.5">Job 7:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Job.17.14">17:14</a> were probably fly larvae.</p>
<p>A proverb quoted in <a href="?bref=Eccl.10.1">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a> probably refers to the housefly, which would be attracted to an open, perfumed ointment bottle. Once inside it would drown and eventually decay, causing the ointment to spoil and stink. The fly is also referred to in <a href="?bref=Isa.7.18">Isaiah 7:18</a> where it symbolizes Egypt. Isaiah may have had in mind a horsefly <span class="ital">(Tabanus arenivagus)</span> that attacks both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Philistine inhabitants of the city of Ekron worshiped a god named Baal-zebul, meaning “Lord of the high places.” The Hebrews mockingly spoke of Baal-zebub, meaning “Lord of the flies” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.2">2 Kgs 1:2</a>). The NT form is Beelzebub (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.10.25">Mt 10:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.24,27">12:24, 27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Fox">Fox</p>
<p class="fl">Small, doglike carnivore with a bushy tail that is about half its body length. The red fox of the Holy Land <span class="ital">(Vulpes palaetinae)</span> is similar to the North American red fox; it is smaller than a wolf and is normally a nocturnal solitary animal. The omnivorous fox eats almost any kind of food—fruits, plants, mice, beetles, and birds—but seldom touches carrion. It loves the sweet juice of grapes, but it also burrows underground tunnels that can destroy the vines (<a href="?bref=Song.2.15">Sg 2:15</a>). The fox is intelligent and known for its slyness (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.32">Lk 13:32</a>). It has considerable endurance and can run at speeds up to 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour. The Jews rebuilding Jerusalem’s wall were taunted by the wisecrack that even a fox jumping on their wall would knock it over (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.3">Neh 4:3</a>).</p>
<p>The Egyptian fox <span class="ital">(Vulpes niloticus)</span> is found in the central and southern parts of the Holy Land. It is somewhat smaller than the common red fox. Its back is rust colored and its belly light. The Syrian fox <span class="ital">(Vulpes flavescens)</span> that lives in the northern part of the Holy Land is shiny gold in color.</p>
<p>Some OT references such as <a href="?bref=Ps.63.10">Psalm 63:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Lam.5.18">Lamentations 5:18</a> are translated “fox” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> but probably refer to jackals. Jackals, not foxes, hunt in packs and tend to act as scavengers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Frog">Frog</p>
<p class="fl">Amphibian (genus <span class="ital">Rana</span>), living part of its life in the water and part on land.</p>
<p>Frogs and toads are covered with soft, hairless skin and lack a tail in the adult stage. The hind legs are much longer and more powerfully developed than the forelegs so that the animals are able to jump large distances. It has been suggested that the frog referred to in Scripture is an edible one, <span class="ital">Rana ridibunda,</span> one of the aquatic frogs found in Egypt and in the stagnant waters of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The female frog lays her eggs in the water; after about a week the eggs hatch into tadpoles. Gradually through metamorphosis the tail is lost and limbs are acquired. Frogs must maintain a moist skin since they take oxygen through the skin as well as through their lungs; thus they must always remain close to water. They feed on insects and worms.</p>
<p>Frogs are found throughout the Palestinian lowlands, where their croaking is heard in the spring and on summer evenings. The Israelites seem to have associated frogs primarily with sliminess and foulness. They fell into the category of creeping or swarming creatures, which in general were ritually unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.29-31">Lv 11:29-31</a>). Since the frog was not specifically listed, however, rabbis did not consider it one of the animals that defiled human beings through contact.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rev.16.13">Revelation 16:13</a> certain foul spirits are said to look like frogs. The ancient Egyptians made the frog a symbol of life and birth and an image of Heqet, the patron goddess of birth. She is depicted with a frog’s head giving life to the newborn. Thus that deity was discredited when the power of God afflicted Egypt in the second of the ten plagues on the Egyptians with the very animal that was her symbol (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.1-14">Ex 8:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.45">Pss 78:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.30">105:30</a>). The frog in question may have been the spotted frog of Egypt <span class="ital">(Rana punctata,</span> or <span class="ital">Rana ridibunda).</span></p>

<p class="h2" id="Gazelle">Gazelle</p>
<p class="fl">Small, dainty, graceful antelope with hollow recurved horns on both sexes. Two varieties exist in the Holy Land, the dorcas gazelle <span class="ital">(Gazella dorcas),</span> which is pale fawn in color and up to 22 inches (56 centimeters) tall, and the Arabian gazelle <span class="ital">(Gazella arabica),</span> which is a dark smoky color and up to 25 inches (63.5 centimeters) tall.</p>
<p>Gazelles are still quite common throughout the desert and steppe areas of the Holy Land, especially in the Negev Desert. Herds usually consist of from 5 to 10 animals, but some varieties assemble in large migratory herds in the fall to relocate to lower elevations and new feeding grounds. Gazelles are herbivorous (plant eating). They are very shy and post guards to warn the herd of approaching danger.</p>
<p>In biblical times the gazelle was probably the game animal most hunted by the Jews (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.5">Prv 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.13.14">Is 13:14</a>). Pharaoh Tutankhamen hunted gazelles and ostriches. The gazelle is said to have graced Solomon’s table (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kgs 4:23</a>). Gazelles were not easy to catch because of their great speed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.18">2 Sm 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.8">1 Chr 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.5">Prv 6:5</a>); they surpass the deer in swiftness. They were trapped in various ways—encircled with nets, driven into enclosures with pitfalls, or forced into narrow valleys and shot with arrows. The Bedouin hunt gazelle with falcons and dogs; the falcon annoys the gazelle, striking it on the head and injuring it so that the dogs can overtake it.</p>
<p>The gazelle is referred to in <a href="?bref=Song.2.9,17">Song of Songs 2:9, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.5">4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.7.3">7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.8.14">8:14</a>, where it is an image of feminine beauty.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Gecko">Gecko</p>
<p class="fl">Reptile of the family Gekkonidae, referred to in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.30">Leviticus 11:30</a>. In Jewish food law it was a ritually unclean lizard. There are seven species of geckos in the Holy Land (including <span class="ital">Hemidactylus turcicus</span> and <span class="ital">Ptyodactylus hasselquistii,</span> all insectivorous—insect eating). The gecko makes a low mourning sound by vibrating its tongue rapidly against the roof of its mouth. In legend the gecko was said to cause leprosy by crawling across a person’s body.</p>
<p>Another name for the gecko is the wall lizard, so named because it can walk upside down on ceilings with the aid of the suction discs on its toes—but it often plops down into the middle of the home. Since it was considered unclean, such an intrusion would have been a disgusting nuisance to Jewish households (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.31-38">Lv 11:31-38</a>).</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Lizard">Lizard (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Gnat">Gnat</p>
<p class="fl">Any very small fly, in common and biblical usage. According to the <span class="sc">nlt</span>, the third plague in Egypt before the exodus consisted of gnats (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.16-18">Ex 8:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.31">Ps 105:31</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates the Hebrew word there as “lice,” but the breeding pattern described in <a href="?bref=Exod.8.1-32">Exodus 8</a>—insects rising from the dust—seems to fit gnats better than lice. Since “gnat” is a general term, the small flies of that plague may have included several small species such as mosquitos, harvester gnats, midges, or sand flies.</p>
<p>The sand fly inflicts a far more painful bite than the mosquito. Further, it does not betray itself by a buzzing noise in flight and is so small that it penetrates most mosquito netting.</p>
<p>Gnats were drawn to wine while it was fermenting. The Pharisees in particular would strain their wine to avoid consuming unclean insects (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.24">Mt 23:24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Goat">Goat</p>
<p class="fl">Cloven-hooved mammals (genus <span class="ital">Capra</span>) with large eyes and big, floppy ears that constantly twitch. Both males and females have backward arching horns. The Palestinian goat is a ruminant (cud-chewing animal) of lighter build than the sheep.</p>
<p>The goat was probably the earliest ruminant to be domesticated. Its wild ancestor seems to have been the Gezoar goat <span class="ital">(Capra aegagrus).</span> Wild goats are believed to have been domesticated very early in Palestine. The goat of Bible times was probably the Syrian or Mamber variety <span class="ital">(Capra hircus mambrica).</span> Domesticated goats may have as many as four kids in a litter, whereas wild goats bear only one or two.</p>
<p>The Palestinian goat was commonly black. Speckled and spotted goats were a rarity, and for that reason Jacob’s request for those goats in <a href="?bref=Gen.30.32">Genesis 30:32</a> appeared very modest. There may also have been red goats (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.12">1 Sm 16:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.13">19:13</a>, where goat’s hair was used to imitate David’s hair, which was “ruddy” or auburn).</p>
<p>Almost every part of the goat was used by the Israelites. The whole goat was used for sacrifice. Its flesh served as meat (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.23">Lv 7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.4">Dt 14:4</a>), and it was the principal source of milk (<a href="?bref=Pr.27.27">Prv 27:27</a>). Goats were sheared in the late spring, and the goat hair was used for weaving tent cloth and for various domestic purposes (<a href="?bref=Exod.36.14">Ex 36:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.19.13,16">1 Sm 19:13, 16</a>). The tabernacle at Mt Sinai was made of goat’s hair blankets (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.7">Ex 26:7</a>).</p>
<p>Adult male goats were generally not eaten because of their strong flavor and toughness and also because they were necessary to insure the flock’s increase. Young kids, however, were usually the chief meat for a feast and were offered to visitors as a symbol of hospitality. Goat milk is richer than the milk of cows and sheep and evidently had broader uses. A good goat gives three quarts of milk a day, from which a rich butter and buttermilk can be made. The average Hebrew family could have lived almost entirely on a single goat’s production.</p>
<p>Goatskin was tanned as leather, and the whole hide was turned into a skin bottle by sewing shut leg and neck apertures (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.14">Gn 21:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.4">Jos 9:4</a>). Goatskin had many uses, including the construction of Hebrew musical instruments. The nebal, a large harp, was made with goatskin for its base sound. Drums had goatskin coverings.</p>
<p>Goats were herded with sheep in biblical times, but each group remained separate following its own bell-laden leader. Jesus was evidently referring to their common herding in his description of the Last Judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Mt 25:31-46</a>).</p>
<p>Because of their wool, sheep are valued more than goats. However, where pasture and water are scarce and thorny shrubs dominate over grass, sheep are difficult to keep and goats become important. They can live under conditions that suit neither cows nor sheep, producing large quantities of milk. The goat does not supply fat as the sheep does, and since its hair is coarse its wool is rather scarce. Goat-hair cloth called cilicium was used to make tents.</p>
<p>Goats have voracious appetites. They also were responsible for much damage done to the land of Palestine, breaking down terraces, destroying forests, and bringing about soil erosion by eating off all cover.</p>
<p>The goat was recognized as a form of wealth, subject to the law of firstlings (<a href="?bref=Num.18.17">Nm 18:17</a>). It had to be eight days old before it could be offered as a sacrifice. A year-old male goat was one of the animals offered at the Passover (<a href="?bref=Num.28.22">28:22</a>), and two goats were offered on the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.7-10">Lv 16:7-10</a>). The goat was also used for other specific sacrifices.</p>
<p>The ibex, a type of wild goat <span class="ital">(Capra ibex nubiana),</span> still lives in small numbers on the cliffs close to the Dead Sea. That it was known in ancient times is evident from rock carvings. It is distinguished from the true wild goat by having a more compact rump and horns that are slender and curved back. Its slender legs and sharp cloven hooves enable it to cling to narrow rock ledges, to jump between them, and to climb steep cliffs.</p>
<p>Usually the ibex is found in rugged mountain country among rocky crags and meadows just below the snow line (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.18">Ps 104:18</a>). In <a href="?bref=Job.39.1">Job 39:1</a> they are referred to as “mountain goats.” They frequently gather in herds of 5 to 20. They graze and browse, being active in the afternoon and sometimes feeding through the night. The large horn of the ibex was at one period made into the shofar that was blown in the second Jerusalem temple to announce the new year and the jubilee year.</p>
<p>The goat was often used in a figurative and symbolic sense by the writers of the Bible: in <a href="?bref=Song.4.1">Song of Songs 4:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Song.6.5">6:5</a> for the bride’s black hair; in <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Matthew 25:31-46</a> for the wicked; and in <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.17">Ezekiel 34:17</a> and <a href="?bref=Dan.8.5-8">Daniel 8:5-8</a> for various human leaders.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Grasshopper">Grasshopper</p>
<p class="fl">Large insects of the Orthoptera order. They have chewing or biting mouth parts and two pairs of wings, the front pair of which is narrow and somewhat thickened and the hind pair membranous and used for flying. When not in use the flight wings are folded beneath the protective front wings like a fan against the body. By rubbing their wings together, male grasshoppers produce sounds that both males and females can detect. Grasshoppers pass through a partial metamorphosis; the egg hatches into a juvenile nymph that looks like an adult except for its smaller size and undeveloped wings. After several months the nymph becomes a winged adult.</p>
<p>The terms “grasshopper” and “locust” are often used interchangeably. Actually the locust is a kind of grasshopper. Also confusing is the fact that other insects such as cicadas are sometimes called locusts. The difference between grasshoppers and locusts depends more on behavior than appearance. Grasshoppers are individual insects that lead solitary lives and do not migrate. The same insects when migrating in a swarm are called migratory grasshoppers or locusts. Elimination of their food supply by drought, flood, or fire may lead to migration. Climatic factors such as a warm dry winter also stimulate migrations.</p>
<p>Grasshoppers and locusts have been a staple food in the Middle East and also among the Indians of the American Southwest. To the Israelites the grasshopper was considered ritually clean and could be eaten (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.22">Lv 11:22</a>).</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Locust">Locust (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Hare">Hare</p>
<p class="fl">Animal of the genus and species <span class="ital">Lepus europaeus judaeus, Lepus capensis,</span> and <span class="ital">Lepus arabicus.</span> It is found in open country, often near or on cultivated lands, and in woods, usually deciduous rather than evergreen. It is an herbivorous rodent and is different from the rabbit, which is not found in Palestine. Although it is not a true ruminant according to modern classification (because it does not have a four-chambered stomach), the hare does rechew its food. It has a process of partial regurgitation of material too hard for the cells in the stomach to absorb initially; thus, the hare actually chews food previously swallowed.</p>
<p>Near Eastern hares have very long ears and large hind feet; their feet are well furred. They are similar to American jackrabbits, which are true hares. Hares do not dig or occupy burrows the way rabbits do. Hares are mainly nocturnal and spend their inactive hours hiding in vegetation. They eat grasses and herbaceous matter as well as twigs and young bark of woody plants. Hares breed with great rapidity—the young attaining sexual maturity at six months after birth.</p>
<p>The hare was ceremonially unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.6">Lv 11:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.7">Dt 14:7</a>), evidently because although it appeared to chew its cud, it did not have cloven hooves. Consumption of hares has also been forbidden among the Arabs, Chinese, and Lapps, but the hare was widely hunted by other people in ancient and modern times. Its great speed, prolific breeding, timidity, and caution have saved it from extermination by its many enemies.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Hippopotamus">Hippopotamus</p>
<p class="fl">Large beast of problematic interpretation. Some early interpreters thought it referred to the elephant, others to the wild ox, the mammoth, or any large animal. It was called “behemoth” by the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translators. Today it is generally agreed that the reference is to the hippopotamus <span class="ital">(Hippopotamus amphibius),</span> a large, thick-skinned, amphibious mammal, an ungulate (having hooflike toenails) with a large head, a bulky, hairless body, and short legs.</p>
<p>The description in <a href="?bref=Job.40.15-24">Job 40:15-24</a> fits closely the modern hippopotamus (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>), except for the depiction of the tail. At present the hippopotamus is found only in the rivers of Africa, but there is fossil evidence that it has existed in the Holy Land, perhaps in the swamps of northern Galilee and the Jordan Valley.</p>
<p>The hippopotamus has highly developed sense organs, placed in such a way that it can see, hear, and smell almost without being seen; its eyes, ears, and nostrils can reach above water while the rest of the animal lies submerged. It has a large mouth, large tusks, and a short, heavy throat. The strong legs are so short that the belly almost reaches the ground when the animal is on the land. The hippopotamus lives on plants and herbs growing in rivers, but if food is scarce there, it forages on land, usually at night. In spite of its heavy body it is surprisingly agile on land.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Horse">Horse</p>
<p class="fl">Przewalski’s horse (<span class="ital">Equus przewalskii,</span> an eastern race that roamed about Mongolia until modern firearms destroyed most of them after World War I) and the tarpan (a western race of southern Russia that became extinct in the Ukraine in 1851). The domesticated horse <span class="ital">(Equus caballus)</span> seems to have been derived from the tarpan. The original site of domestication is believed to have been Turkestan, a region north of Afghanistan and India, now in Russia. The horse differs from the donkey in that it has shorter ears, a longer mane with a forelock, a long hairy tail, and a soft, sensitive muzzle.</p>
<p>Horses were used in war not only for riding but also for pulling the heavy, springless war chariots. Two kinds of horses were needed for these different purposes, and the Hebrews distinguished between chariot horses and cavalry horses.</p>

<p class="fl">The Lord warned the early Israelites against unnecessarily amassing military strength in the form of horses and thereby following the oppressive tactics of the powerful Egyptians (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-16">Dt 17:14-16</a>), but the demands of war caused both David and Solomon to import horses from Egypt into their kingdoms and to breed them. Solomon greatly increased the number of horses in the Jewish kingdom and maintained large stables at various cities (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.26">1 Kgs 10:26</a>) such as the regional defense centers of Megiddo, Hazor, and Gezer (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15-19">1 Kgs 9:15-19</a>). Ahab’s horses are mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.5">1 Kings 18:5</a>, and records of Shalmaneser III state that Ahab furnished 2,000 chariots to a coalition against Assyria.</p>
<p>In early Israel, the horse was opposed as a symbol of pagan luxury and of dependence on physical power for defense (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.16">Dt 17:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.8.11">1 Sm 8:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.20.7">Ps 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.31.1">Is 31:1</a>). Horse trading, mentioned as early as <a href="?bref=Gen.47.17">Genesis 47:17</a>, was carried on by Solomon between Egypt and the Syro-Hittite principalities (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.28-29">1 Kgs 10:28-29</a>). Most biblical references to horses refer to their use in war, but horses were also used for transportation. Riding seems to have been less popular than the use of chariots. Cavalry units were not introduced until the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span> by the Medes. Joseph rode in Pharaoh’s second horse-drawn chariot (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.43">Gn 41:43</a>), and Absalom made a display by riding a horse-drawn chariot (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1">2 Sm 15:1</a>). Naaman traveled by horse and chariot (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.9">2 Kgs 5:9</a>). Later, horses were so common in Jerusalem that the royal palace had a special horse gate (<a href="?bref=2Chr.23.15">2 Chr 23:15</a>), and a gate of the city itself was known as the Horse Gate (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.28">Neh 3:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.40">Jer 31:40</a>). Mordecai rode a royal horse of King Xerxes as a sign of honor (<a href="?bref=Esth.6.8-11">Est 6:8-11</a>). Horses are often spoken of figuratively (<a href="?bref=Ps.32.9">Ps 32:9</a>; “mare,” <a href="?bref=Song.1.9">Sg 1:9</a>; “stallions,” <a href="?bref=Jer.5.8">Jer 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.5">12:5</a>), especially in the context of judgment (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.8">Hb 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.8">Zec 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.2-8">Rv 6:2-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.17">9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-16">19:11-16</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Hyena">Hyena</p>
<p class="fl">Stocky carnivore <span class="ital">(Hyaena hyaena)</span> with coarse hair, an erect mane, and long hairs along the neck and back. Hyenas live in holes among rocks and banks. They are mainly nocturnal but are ordinarily neither noisy nor aggressive. Their cry, however, is a disagreeable, unearthly sound. Hyenas usually feed on carrion, crushing bones with their powerful jaws. If the carrion supply is inadequate, they will kill sheep, goats, or other small animals. When threatened, hyenas growl and erect their mane, but they rarely fight. They are massively built with forelegs longer than the hind legs.</p>
<p>Known as scavengers in Africa, hyenas eat domestic refuse in the villages. In Palestine the striped hyena is a common predator, preferring rocky territory and even rock tombs. Since hyenas were notorious for raiding the graves of the dead, all Israelites who could afford it arranged for burial in tombs protected by massive stone doors. Absalom, King David’s son who was killed by Joab in the wild, was buried under a huge pile of stones to protect his corpse from molestation by hyenas (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.17">2 Sm 18:17</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Jackal">Jackal</p>
<p class="fl">Carnivore <span class="ital">(Canis aureus)</span> smaller than the true wolf and with a shorter tail. It is similar to the fox but has a broader head, shorter ears, and longer legs. The fox is solitary; the jackal tends to be gregarious. Its tail can be drooping or erect, compared with the long horizontal tail of the fox. Jackals usually prowl at night, either singly, in pairs, or in packs through open savannah country. They eat small mammals, poultry, fruit, vegetables, and carrion. They spend their days in thickets and clumps of vegetation. Often they obtain scraps from kills by larger carnivores. Jackals can run at speeds of about 33 miles (53 kilometers) per hour.</p>
<p>The jackal can reach a height of about 20 inches (51 centimeters), roughly the size of a German shepherd dog. Its back is pale yellow with dark, almost black, flanks. Its lips are black and its ears white on the inside. The howl of the jackal sounds like the crying of a child or the heartrending wail of the bereaved (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.8">Mi 1:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Job.30.29">Jb 30:29</a>). To other jackals the howl is merely an invitation calling the pack together for its nocturnal hunting.</p>
<p>OT references are chiefly to jackals prowling around ruined cities and wilderness areas (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.13">Neh 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.19">Ps 44:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.13.22">Is 13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.13">34:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.7">35:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.11">Jer 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.14.6">14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.33">49:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.37">51:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.3">Lam 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.5.18">5:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.1.3">Mal 1:3</a>). Many such references are translated “dragon” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, but “jackal” is more appropriate.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Leech">Leech</p>
<p class="fl">Segmented worm (class Hirundinea) up to five inches (12.7 centimeters) long with a flat body equipped with suction pads at each end. The mouth, located at the bottom of the front suction pad, has three teeth that the leech uses to pierce the skin of its host. The leech feeds on blood, and its glands secrete an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting. The ordinary medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis) is abundant in springs and ponds from the Negev Desert to Galilee. It adheres to the bodies of human beings and animals that submerge themselves in water, injects its anticoagulant, and sucks their blood.</p>
<p>The reference in <a href="?bref=Pr.30.15">Proverbs 30:15</a> is uncertain (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>) but may be to the parasitic and greedy nature of the horse leech (genus <span class="ital">Haemopis</span>). The small horse leech enters its host’s mouth and nostrils from water while the animal is drinking. A leech weighing one-half ounce (14.2 grams) has been known to gorge itself with two and a half ounces (71 grams) of concentrated blood and then to exist for 15 months with no more to eat.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Leopard">Leopard</p>
<p class="fl">Called <span class="ital">Panthera pardus tulliana,</span> it is the most widespread of all the large wildcats. In rocky areas it lives in caves, but in forested regions it lives in thick vegetation. In OT times many lived in the vicinity of Mt Hermon (<a href="?bref=Song.4.8">Sg 4:8</a>).</p>
<p>The leopard is somewhat smaller than the tiger, measuring up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) in length with a tail of about 30 inches (.8 meter). Its body is better proportioned than that of the tiger. The leopard takes its victim by surprise from a silent ambush, often concealing itself near villages or watering places and waiting for its prey, remaining in one spot for long spans of time. The leopard is swift on the ground (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.8">Hb 1:8</a>), agile in trees, and very graceful in its movements. Its color is yellowish speckled with black spots (<a href="?bref=Jer.13.23">Jer 13:23</a>). Daniel and John saw visions in which leopards were symbols of world powers (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.6">Dn 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.2">Rv 13:2</a>).</p>
<p>The leopard is a wary and cunning animal, formidable and ferocious (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.6">Jer 5:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.7">Hos 13:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.11.6">Is 11:6</a>). The leopard is dangerous not only to domestic animals but also to humans. With its natural camouflage it can hide on the forest floor, blending into the changing light and shadows. The Israelites were terrified of the leopard because it constantly ravaged their sheep and goats. Several biblical place names suggest that they were known for the leopards in their vicinity: Nimrah, Beth-nimrah, and Nimrim, a district northeast of the Dead Sea. It has survived in the Holy Land into the present century; a few leopards still exist in remote areas near Mt Tabor and Mt Carmel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Leviathan">Leviathan</p>
<p class="fl">Sea monster mentioned several times in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.14">Pss 74:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.26">104:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.1">Is 27:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). It may refer to any of the larger marine animals such as large jellyfish, whales, or sharks, or to a large reptile like the crocodile. Some scholars think “Leviathan” may refer to animals now extinct, such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs (marine reptiles similar to dinosaurs). The scriptural term might also refer to certain dinosaurs that spent part of their lives half-submerged in shallow lakes and oceans. Other scholars believe that most of the references are to the crocodile.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Crocodile">Crocodile (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Lion">Lion</p>
<p class="fl">Large, tawny-colored carnivore <span class="ital">(Panthera leo)</span> that preys chiefly on hoofed mammals and charges by a series of leaps and bounds. Within historic times the lion ranged in Africa, Europe, and the Holy Land. In ancient times the territories of the African and Persian lions met in the Middle East. The lion of the Holy Land was the Asiatic or Persian lion <span class="ital">(Panthera leo persica).</span></p>
<p>The males have heavy manes that stop at the shoulders but cover much of the chest. The Persian lion cannot climb and is mainly nocturnal, returning to its lair or a thicket by day (<a href="?bref=Jer.4.7">Jer 4:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.38">25:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.2.11-12">Na 2:11-12</a>). This lion is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long with a tasseled tail 30 inches (.8 meter) or so long; its shoulders may reach a height of 35 inches (.9 meter). It is one of the smallest of the lion breeds.</p>
<p>Lions are usually found in pairs, though sometimes in larger numbers. A small group is known as a pride. They generally prefer open country but in Palestine evidently prowled the subtropical vegetation of the Jordan River valley. Lions, which usually hunt at dusk, kill smaller animals by a blow of the paw, larger ones by a bite in the throat. A lion does not remain in the same place for more than a few days. The animal is in its prime at about seven years of age, when it weighs from 400 to 600 pounds (181.6 to 272.4 kilograms).</p>
<p>The lion does not characteristically attack humans, though like other great cats it may become a man-eater (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.24-28">1 Kgs 13:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.36">20:36</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.25-26">2 Kgs 17:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.4">Ps 57:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.6.7-27">Dn 6:7-27</a>). Ordinarily, it attacks only out of great hunger or in self-defense. A very young lion that attacks humans can become dangerous if it develops a taste for human flesh. A very old lion, expelled from the pride because it can no longer keep up in the pursuit of antelope or gazelles, may choose humans as a relatively slow-moving prey.</p>
<p>A lion generally roars only on a full stomach—that is, after it has consumed its prey (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.13">Ps 22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.25">Ez 22:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.3.4">Am 3:4</a>). Nevertheless, its roaring arouses fear (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.8">Am 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8">1 Pt 5:8</a>). The lion is a bold (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.10">2 Sm 17:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.28.1">Prv 28:1</a>), destructive animal (<a href="?bref=Ps.7.2">Ps 7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.30">Jer 2:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.14">Hos 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.8">Mi 5:8</a>), and the enemy of flocks (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.12">Am 3:12</a>).</p>
<p>Lions were common in biblical times in all parts of the Holy Land. Hebrew has at least seven words for lion and young lion. The lion is referred to about 130 times in the OT—more than any other wild animal. Lions were evidently much less common in NT times. After gradually declining, they became extinct in Palestine shortly after <span class="era">AD</span> 1300. The lion was present in Mesopotamia, however, until the end of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Lions played an important part in the political and religious symbolism of the Near East (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.19-20">1 Kgs 10:19-20</a>). In Assyria and Babylonia the lion was regarded as a royal beast (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.4">Dn 7:4</a>). Oriental monarchs maintained artificial lion pits as places of execution (<a href="?bref=Ezek.19.1-9">Ez 19:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.6.7-16">Dn 6:7-16</a>). Animals for these were captured in camouflaged nets or pits. To the Jews, the lion was the mightiest of beasts (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.29-31">Prv 30:29-31</a>). Thus, it symbolized leadership (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.9-10">Gn 49:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.9">Nm 24:9</a>) and hence eventually became a title for Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">Rv 5:5</a>). It was also the ensign of Judah’s tribe and was used by King Solomon in the decoration of his house and the temple.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Lizard">Lizard</p>
<p class="fl">Reptiles of the suborder Lacertilia. Their skin is covered with scales. The lizard is a useful creature because it captures harmful insects and worms. Like other reptiles, it lays eggs with shells softer than those of a bird and with no clear division between the yolk and the white. Lizards are “cold-blooded” organisms without a temperature-maintenance mechanism; hence, they become inactive in cold weather.</p>
<p>Lizards can survive in barren parched countryside. In the Near East they are encountered in great numbers in the Arabian Desert, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Judean wilderness. There may be as many as 44 different species of lizards in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The Dabb lizard (genus <span class="ital">Uromastyx</span>), which attains a length of about 24 inches (61 centimeters), is found in the Negev Desert. It is omnivorous, an unusual trait since most lizards are insectivorous. It has a hard, rough skin, green with brown spots; a short, rounded head; and a powerful tail encircled with a row of strong spines that it uses as a weapon of defense.</p>
<p>Lizards are listed as ceremonially unclean in Jewish law (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.29-31">Lv 11:29-31</a>). The fact that lizards crawl on their bellies made them unclean. Contact with a lizard’s carcass defiled a law-abiding Jew (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.32-36">Lv 11:32-36</a>). The <span class="sc">nlt</span> translates the “lizards” of <a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">Leviticus 11</a> as “great lizard,” “gecko,” “monitor lizard,” “sand lizard,” and “chameleon.” The monitor lizard is a large lizard that lives in the deserts of southern Palestine, Sinai, and Egypt. It is up to 55 inches (1.4 meters) long with a long snout and sharp teeth. Other translators and commentators render the original Hebrew in a wide variety of ways, including “tortoise,” “ferret,” “lizard,” “snail,” “mole,” and even “water hen.” The fact that most of the original Hebrew words occur only once in Scripture makes it very difficult to be certain about their appropriate translation.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Gecko">Gecko (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Locust">Locust</p>
<p class="fl">An insect of the family <span class="ital">Acridiidae.</span> It is referred to by at least 12 different names in Scripture. The various Hebrew words may refer to different stages of its development from larva to adult or to the type of damage that it causes. Locusts are characterized by swarming and mass migration. In modern times they have caused extensive and disastrous destruction to vegetation. Grasshoppers do not swarm or migrate en masse, differentiating them from the true locusts.</p>
<p>The OT mentions several different species of locusts. <a href="?bref=Lev.11.22">Leviticus 11:22</a> seems to refer to the slant-faced (bald) locust and also to the katydid, or long-horned grasshopper. The reference in <a href="?bref=Deut.28.42">Deuteronomy 28:42</a> may be to the mole cricket. In <a href="?bref=Joel.1.4">Joel 1:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Joel.2.25">2:25</a> and in <a href="?bref=Nah.3.16-17">Nahum 3:16-17</a>, successive stages of the insect’s development are described. The cutting locust (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “palmerworm”) of Joel is probably the first instar (stage of development), the swarming locusts (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “locust”) are middle stages, and the hopping locusts (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “cankerworm”) later instars but not yet fully matured insects. In the adult stage, called destroying locusts (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “caterpillar”), the color of the locust is reddish brown, which turns to yellow with a brownish network on the wings.</p>
<p>Only three of the hundreds of varieties of locusts found in Bible lands are capable of multiplying into great swarms, and only the desert locust <span class="ital">(Schistocerca gergaria)</span> can be considered widespread in all the Bible lands. The desert locust is native to the Sudan (Africa). It is a little over two inches (5 centimeters) long and has a wingspread of some five inches (12.7 centimeters). It shows two phases, a solitary phase and a gregarious phase, with a possible third phase known as transiens. There are differences in the immature and adult forms of the phases in color and physiology.</p>
<p>The quantity and distribution of rains are important factors in the extent of swarming. Moist soil is needed for depositing the eggs and permitting them to develop. Each female deposits from one to six egg pods, containing 28 to 146 eggs each. The larvae emerge in 15 to 43 days.</p>
<p>In the gregarious phase (from the second stage of metamorphosis onward), the locust is driven by a strong wandering instinct. Masses of them form a random procession of overflowing locust bodies that ignore any obstruction. They swarm over everything (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.4-9">Jl 2:4-9</a>). The only regulator of their activities is temperature; they are immobilized by high or low temperatures. Taking to wing they may move 1,200 miles (1,930.8 kilometers) from their native home. They fly in compact formations large enough to blot out the light of the sun. Their movement seems to be controlled by hormones, but the direction is influenced by the wind. The swarms consume almost every plant in their path, sparing only the carob, sycamore, castor tree, and oleander bush.</p>
<p>A locust plague was one of the most severe evils to come upon the ancient world (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.38">Dt 28:38</a>). <a href="?bref=Joel.2.1-11">Joel 2:1-11</a> describes a locust plague in graphic terms, using it as a symbol of God’s destroying judgment. Special days of prayer, fasting, and trumpet blowing were prescribed to remove locust plagues (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.37-38">1 Kgs 8:37-38</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.28-29">2 Chr 6:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.12-17">Jl 2:12-17</a>). Locusts symbolized powerful and merciless enemies that completely destroyed the earnings of human toil (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.5">Jgs 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.4">Is 33:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.23">Jer 46:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.27">51:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.3.15">Na 3:15</a>).</p>
<p>Bedouins eat locusts raw, roasted, or boiled, preserving them by drying and threading. They are also crushed and ground, and the grist used in cooking or eaten with bread, sometimes mixed with honey and dates. Such was the diet of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>). The Greeks ground locusts in stone mortars to make flour of them.</p>
<p>The ancients considered the two large hind legs, or jumping legs, as separate limbs and had a special name for them. Hence locusts were described as having four legs, a reference to the four smaller walking legs. “Going on all fours” thus referred to creeping or walking as opposed to jumping and did not mean that the unclean insects had only four legs in all. Because of its two hind jumping legs, the locust was exempted from the prohibition against unclean insects (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.20-23">Lv 11:20-23</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Mole">Mole</p>
<p class="fl">Rodent <span class="ital">(Spalax ehrenbergi)</span> from six to nine inches (15 to 23 centimeters) long, which burrows in any area where the soil is suitable for digging; it should be called a mole rat. Common in the Holy Land, large numbers are found in the vicinity of Jerusalem. <a href="?bref=Isa.2.20">Isaiah 2:20</a> refers to the mole, as does <a href="?bref=Lev.11.29-30">Leviticus 11:29-30</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The mole rat has no tail and is molelike in appearance, but neither true moles nor shrews have ever been found in the Holy Land. The mole rat’s teeth are strong and protruding like those of a squirrel. The neck is short and thick with a plump body shaped like a sausage. The short legs have broad paws with claws adapted for burrowing. The fur is soft, thick, and ashen gray. Its ears and almost sightless eyes, which are no larger than poppyseeds, are hidden in the fur. Folklore taught that touching a mole rat would result in blindness.</p>
<p>In the wet winter season the mole rat builds breeding mounds resembling those of pocket gophers. It builds less complex resting mounds in the summer, although both have rather elaborate tunnel systems. The mole rat feeds on roots, bulbs, tubers, and various other subterranean plant parts, often doing extensive damage to agriculture.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Moth">Moth</p>
<p class="fl">Insect of the genus <span class="ital">Tineola</span> that lays its eggs on wool or furs, its larvae feeding on those materials. The destructive qualities of moths are referred to in several biblical passages (<a href="?bref=Job.13.28">Jb 13:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.39.11">Ps 39:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.9">Is 50:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.12">Hos 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.19-20">Mt 6:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.33">Lk 12:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.2">Jas 5:2</a>). In <a href="?bref=Isa.51.8">Isaiah 51:8</a> “worm” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>) refers specifically to the larva of the clothes moth. The moth symbolizes disintegration, decay, and weakening. It is only the larvae that do the damage. The adult is quite harmless and feeds mainly on the nectar of flowers. It is easily crushed (<a href="?bref=Job.4.19">Jb 4:19</a>). The clothes moth reproduces in May or June. It enters human dwellings in the evening. A week after the eggs are laid the larvae appear and immediately begin their work of destruction, eating anything within reach made of animal fibers.</p>
<p>The moth’s destructive activity is done in secret without any sound and without any dramatic appearance, such as a swarm that blots out the sun. In an age when wealth was counted more in possessions than in money, and when among those possessions wool clothing was highly valued, moths could literally cause economic disaster; hence the words of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.19-20">Mt 6:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of species of moths other than the clothes moth in the Holy Land; they are harmless to leaves, flowers, fruit, trees, and seeds. As with the clothes moth, the larvae inflict the damage.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mouse">Mouse</p>
<p class="fl">Rodent of the family Muridae, especially genus <span class="ital">Mus.</span> The mouse was regarded as unclean because, being short legged, it was considered one of the creeping creatures (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.29">Lv 11:29</a>). Mice known as commensals live in dwellings and tend to have longer tails and to be darker in color than wild mice, which are active chiefly at night. Mice are good climbers and even good swimmers. Wild mice eat many kinds of vegetation, including seeds, fleshy roots, leaves, and stems. At times they store food.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for “mouse” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.29">Lv 11:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.4-5">1 Sm 6:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.17">Is 66:17</a>) is probably a general term for various rats and mice. The root meaning of the Hebrew word “mouse” is “destruction of corn,” a reference to the damage mice do to field crops. At least 23 varieties of mouselike rodents are known in the Holy Land. They cause food spoilage, damage household articles, and transport the host fleas that spread typhus, spotted fever, and bubonic plague. Plague bacteria may have caused the tumors or swellings among the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.5">1 Sm 6:5</a>). <a href="?bref=Isa.66.17">Isaiah 66:17</a> refers to a pre-exilic Canaanite cultic practice in which mice were eaten; the reference may actually be to the hamster. A number of rodents are eaten by Arabs of the Near East; the gerbil is considered a special delicacy. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Mole_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Mole (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Mule">Mule</p>
<p class="fl">Hybrid offspring of a male ass and a female horse <span class="ital">(Equus asinus mulus),</span> ordinarily sterile. The offspring of a female donkey and a stallion (male horse) is known as a hinny and is of little value because of its inferior size.</p>
<p>Because crossbreeding was forbidden in the law (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.19">Lv 19:19</a>), the Israelites procured mules from the Gentiles, perhaps from the Phoenicians, since Tyre (a Phoenician seaport in what is now southern Lebanon) imported horses and mules (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.14">Ez 27:14</a>). Mules did not appear in Israel until David’s reign (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.29">2 Sm 13:29</a>), possibly because of the rarity of horses among the Hebrews. Mules were used chiefly by members of the royal court and by other nobles. King David rode on a mule, and Solomon rode to his inaugaration on King David’s mule (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.33">1 Kgs 1:33</a>). Absalom met his death riding on a mule (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.9">2 Sm 18:9</a>). Mules were less common than horses, camels, and asses in the postexilic community (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.66">Ezr 2:66</a>). In antiquity Asia Minor was especially noted for breeding fine mules.</p>
<p>Mules have long enjoyed a reputation for obstinacy, but that trait is not mentioned in the Bible. The mule is prized for riding and for carrying heavy burdens, especially in warm mountainous regions. They are sure-footed and thrive best in hot, dry climates. The mule has the frugality, endurance, and steady gait of an ass along with the size, strength, swiftness, and courage of a horse. Mules are almost never sick. They live longer than horses. They can carry a load of up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms) as far as 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) a day.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Pig">Pig</p>
<p class="fl">Most properly, newborn swine. “Swine” is technically the better name for the species, but it is rarely used in common speech today. The domestic pigs of the Middle East derived from the wild pig <span class="ital">(Sus scrofa).</span> The pig is the most prolific and abundant supplier of meat and fat for food. A thick layer of fat just under the skin is especially pronounced in domestic breeds. Pigs cannot be driven, so they are of value only to the settled farmer. The Hebrews were originally a nomadic people; therefore, they had little use for an animal closely associated with settled life. An Egyptian prince of about 1500 <span class="era">BC</span>, however, is recorded as owning a herd of 1,500 swine.</p>
<p>The pig is clumsily built, yet lively and able to move with agility and speed. The most conspicuous characteristic of the pig is a truncated, mobile snout terminating in a disc-shaped surface on which the nostrils are located. Most pigs have large tusks in both jaws which grow continuously in life. The tusks of the upper jaw are unique in that they curve upward instead of pointing downward as in most animals. The excrement of a pig has an almost unbearable odor, which clings not only to the pig itself but also to swineherds, who can be identified a long way off.</p>
<p>Pigs were never raised in the Holy Land by Jews. The great herd into which Jesus drove the unclean spirits was encountered in the land of the Gadarenes, a non-Jewish area east of the Jordan. The Gadarene demons took refuge in a herd of pigs feeding on a bluff overlooking the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.28-32">Mt 8:28-32</a>).</p>
<p>Wild pigs were found in the Holy Land as in many countries today. <a href="?bref=Ps.80.13">Psalm 80:13</a> refers to the destructiveness of a wild boar (the male, or hog) attacking growing crops. A party of wild boars can destroy an entire vineyard or a field of crops in a single night. They devour, trample, and ravage everything within reach.</p>
<p>Boar hunts were common in ancient Mesopotamia. Wild boars do not attack unless molested, but they are dangerous when aroused. They travel in bands of from 6 to 50 and are most active in the evening and early morning hours. The body is covered with stiff bristles and usually some finer hair, but the body covering is often quite scanty. Wild pigs are mainly vegetarian, feeding on roots, nuts, grains, and plant stems. Wild boars were particularly abundant in the mountainous regions of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, in the Jordan River valley, and in wooded sections such as Mt Tabor.</p>
<p>Strict Jews would not even mention swine by name but would always substitute the term “the abomination.” Israelites considered themselves polluted if they were even touched by a swine’s bristle. To the Jews, the pig symbolized filth and ugliness. Pigs will eat fecal material, vermin, rodents, carrion, and the like (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.22">2 Pt 2:22</a>). <a href="?bref=Pr.11.22">Proverbs 11:22</a> refers to the incongruity of a golden ring in the nose of an animal showing such characteristics. A similar metaphor occurs in Jesus’ statement about casting pearls before swine (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.6">Mt 7:6</a>). The prodigal son’s degeneration was shown by his being forced in his poverty to feed pigs and eat their food (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.15-16">Lk 15:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>Eating the flesh of pigs was forbidden to the Jews (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.7">Lv 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.8">Dt 14:8</a>). The Canaanites in the Holy Land killed and ate pigs freely. In intertestamental times Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), a Syrian king whose territories included Israel, used the pig to “Hellenize” the Jews. He first tested their loyalty to the Jewish faith by requiring the consumption of pork, considered a delicacy by the Greeks (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.18">2 Macc 6:18</a>). The act of desecration that drove the Jews to rebellion, however, was the sprinkling of pig blood on the temple altar in a sacrifice to Zeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.47">1 Macc 1:47</a>).</p>
<p>Pigs were frequently used in pagan worship (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.4">Is 65:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.3,17">66:3, 17</a>), which may account for their being forbidden to the Jews as food. Evidence in the Holy Land shows that pigs were sacrificed long before Hellenistic times. Pig bones were found in a grotto below the rock-cut place of sacrifice at Gezer. A similar underground chamber with vessels containing piglet bones at Tirzah dates to the middle Bronze Age (about 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Alabaster fragments of a statuette of a pig ready to be sacrificed have been unearthed. Swine were sacrificed to Aphrodite (Venus) in Greece and Asia Minor. In addition, pigs were sacrificed in connection with oaths and treaties; in the <span class="ital">Iliad,</span> Agamemnon sacrificed a boar to Zeus and Helios. So it is not surprising that among the Jews the pig became a symbol of filthiness and paganism.</p>
<p>It is possible that eating pork was forbidden primarily because the pig may carry many worm parasites such as trichina, though that is also true of some “clean” animals. Another reason for forbidding their consumption may have been that pigs eat carrion. Some people are allergic to pork in hot weather—another suggested reason behind the Jewish taboo. The same taboo exists among the Muslims and existed in certain social strata in Egypt.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Porcupine">Porcupine</p>
<p class="fl">Rodent, <span class="ital">Hystrix cristata,</span> which lives in forested areas, rocky hills, ravines, and valleys. The porcupine is still found in the Holy Land today. It has long quills that can be raised to give the appearance of a crest. It is almost entirely nocturnal. It burrows by day into a natural cavity or crevice. The Old World porcupine rarely climbed trees, although the New World porcupine frequently does. A porcupine may weigh as much as 60 pounds (27.2 kilograms). It eats fruit, bark, roots, and other vegetation, and carrion as well. Although its flesh is edible, the porcupine was not classed among the clean animals for the Israelites. The reference in <a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Isaiah 34:11</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) is probably to the porcupine, as is <a href="?bref=Isa.14.23">Isaiah 14:23</a> in the <span class="sc">nlt</span>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Hedgehog_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Hedgehog</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Scorpion">Scorpion</p>
<p class="fl">Arthropod of the same group as spiders (arachnids). A dozen species of scorpions (order Scorpionida) are found in the Holy Land, but 90 percent of the scorpions are yellow scorpions, usually three to five inches (7.6 to 12.7 centimeters) long. The rock scorpion, also common to the Holy Land, is as thick as a man’s finger and from five to seven inches (12.7 to 17.8 centimeters) in length. Scorpions are slow, nocturnal invertebrates that rest beneath stones by day and prey on insects and other arachnids by night. At the end of its long tail the scorpion carries a poisonous sting that is fatal to most prey and extremely painful to humans (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.3,5,10">Rv 9:3, 5, 10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.11,14">1 Kgs 12:11, 14</a>). Scorpions symbolize Ezekiel’s evil countrymen (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.6">Ez 2:6</a>) and the demonic forces of Satan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.19">Lk 10:19</a>). The scorpion is referred to as frequenting the Sinai Desert (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.15">Dt 8:15</a>).</p>
<p>A scorpion has from six to eight eyes. It has eight legs like a spider and two lobsterlike claws with which it catches and holds its prey. It feeds particularly on locusts and beetles. In many species the female scorpion eats the male after mating. Scorpions lay eggs that hatch very shortly after laying. Scorpions prefer warmer climates, and because of their desire for warmth, enter houses, especially at night, hiding in beds, blankets, footwear, and clothing.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Sheep">Sheep</p>
<p class="fl">Domestic animal, <span class="ital">Ovis orientalis,</span> referred to directly or by some term such as ewe, lamb, ram, or by some fact concerning them over 700 times in Scripture.</p>
<p>Sheep represented the chief wealth and total livelihood of pastoral peoples, providing food to eat, milk to drink, wool for the making of cloth, and hides and bones for other uses. In addition, the sheep was a medium of exchange and a sacrificial animal. The number of sheep raised in ancient times was prodigious. Mesha, king of Moab, paid a tribute annually of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4">2 Kgs 3:4</a>). The Israelites took 250,000 sheep from the Hagrites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.21">1 Chr 5:21</a>).</p>
<p>Sheep shearing was often done for festivals (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23">2 Sm 13:23</a>). The sheep was held down on its side and its legs were tied together; then it lay docilely while its wool was clipped (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.7">Is 53:7</a>). Sheep reserved for burnt offerings were not shorn; nothing could be held back from a sacrifice to the Lord.</p>
<p>Wool had to be processed before it could be used for clothing. First it was washed, sometimes while still on the sheep, then carded and perhaps weighed for the market. The spinning of wool was regarded as a woman’s work (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.19">Prv 31:19</a>), but weaving the spun thread into cloth on a loom was primarily a man’s occupation.</p>
<p>The Bible reports that Abel kept sheep (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.2">Gn 4:2</a>). The first sheep to be domesticated was probably the argali <span class="ital">(Ovis ammon),</span> a variety of the urial <span class="ital">(Ovis vignei),</span> a mountainous species still existing in Turkestan and Mongolia. Five breeds had reached Mesopotamia by 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>; all were of the urial stock.</p>
<p>The sheep known in Israel was the broad-tailed sheep <span class="ital">(Ovis orientalis vignei</span> or <span class="ital">laticaudata),</span> of which the tail weighs from 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kilograms) and has always been considered a delicacy. Thus the Lord asked for this choice part as a sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.22-25">Ex 29:22-25</a>).</p>
<p>Only the ram of the broad-tailed sheep has horns, but in other varieties of sheep in the Holy Land the ewe also has horns. The horns, two to three inches (5 to 8 centimeters) in diameter, can be potent weapons. Rams’ horns could be used as trumpets (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.4">Jos 6:4</a>) or as oil containers (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1">1 Sm 16:1</a>).</p>
<p>Although the sheep is very similar to the goat, it is differentiated by a lower forehead, its angulated spiral horns marked with transverse wrinkles and curved slightly outward, its covering of wool, and its lack of a “goatee.” Most sheep are white (<a href="?bref=Ps.147.16">Ps 147:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.9">Dn 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.14">Rv 1:14</a>).</p>
<p>The flesh of sheep was a luxury in the biblical culture. King Solomon required a daily provision of 100 sheep for his table (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kgs 4:23</a>), but the common people ate lamb or mutton only on festive occasions. A young ram was usually chosen because the ewes were more important to the future prospects of the herd. The meat was boiled in large caldrons. The milk of the sheep is extremely rich; in biblical times it was usually allowed to curdle before drinking. Possibly some Israelites kept lambs in their houses as pets (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.3-4">2 Sm 12:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>To protect the flock at night against predatory attacks, the shepherd tried to provide a fold. In meadows near villages, folds were built and watchmen were hired to relieve the shepherds. The shepherds of the nativity story were out in the field (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.8">Lk 2:8</a>); they had no fold but probably had set up a tent for shelter, consisting simply of goat-hair blankets spread across sapling supports. The scarcity of springs in the Holy Land made the watering of the flock a crucial problem for the shepherd (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.8-11">Gn 13:8-11</a>).</p>
<p>Wild mountain sheep, varieties of <span class="ital">Ovis orientalis,</span> are known in the Mediterranean area (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.5">Dt 14:5</a>). The Deuteronomy passage (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “chamois”) might also refer to <span class="ital">Ovis traelaphus,</span> a sheep about five feet high (1.5 meters) with long, curved horns. Another possibility is the Barbary sheep that lives in small flocks in rugged mountain areas in Barbary, Egypt, and Mt Sinai. The true chamois is unknown in Palestine.</p>
<p>The sheep is also used figuratively in Scripture. The ram represented great strength and fittingly symbolized Medo-Persia in Daniel’s vision (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.3">Dn 8:3</a>). It is the nature of sheep to be gentle and submissive (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.7">Is 53:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.19">Jer 11:19</a>), defenseless (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.8">Mi 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.16">Mt 10:16</a>), and in constant need of guidance and care (<a href="?bref=Num.27.17">Nm 27:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.36">Mt 9:36</a>). Such qualities are regarded as desirable in the lives of believers in Christ; hence the many figurative references to sheep in the NT and to Jesus as shepherd (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.34">Mk 6:34</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.1-30">Jn 10:1-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.35-37">Rom 8:35-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20-21">Heb 13:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">1 Pt 2:25</a>). The resurrected Christ told the apostle Peter to “feed my lambs” and “tend my sheep” (<a href="?bref=John.21.15-17">Jn 21:15-17</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Snail">Snail</p>
<p class="fl">Invertebrate gastropods (mollusks). Land snails are very numerous in the Near East. Some freshwater forms serve as hosts for the schistosome worm, the fluke parasite causing the dread disease bilharzia (schistosomiasis).</p>
<p>Purple dyes of all shades were highly valued in the ancient world. A royal purple dye was obtained from secretions of a sea snail <span class="ital">(Murex trunculus</span> and <span class="ital">Murex brandaris).</span> Evidently, that process was developed by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Assyrians as early as 1500 <span class="era">BC</span>. The “purple” fishermen had their own guild during the time of the Roman Empire. The snails were harvested during the fall and winter seasons; in the spring, when egg laying took place, little dye was available. The snails tended to remain concealed in the summer. They inhabited the waters off Crete and Phoenicia. Tyrian purple, produced in the Phoenician city of Tyre, the center of the purple-dye industry, was obtained by a double dyeing. Large deposits of murex shells from dyeing operations have been found along the Mediterranean shoreline. The Israelites had to import purple goods (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.16">Ez 27:16</a>). Lydia was a “seller of purple” or of cloth so dyed (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14">Acts 16:14</a>). Purple was a sign of distinction, royalty, and wealth (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.25.4">Ex 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.28.5-6,15">28:5-6, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.38">Nm 15:38</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.7">2 Chr 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.8.15">Est 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.31.22">Prv 31:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.3.10">Sg 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.7">Ez 27:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.7">Dn 5:7</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Exod.30.34-35">Exodus 30:34-35</a> refers to “onycha,” which was an important ingredient of incense. Onycha is the horny, clawlike operculum (the plate that closes off the opening of its shell when a snail is retracted) of a Near Eastern member of the molluskan family Strombidae. The operculum is sometimes used for offense or locomotion as well as for defense. When burned, the operculum gives off a sharp, strong scent, and when mixed with more fragrant but less powerful substances is even more potent. The name “onycha” is derived from a Greek word <span class="ital">(onyx)</span> for a fingernail or a claw.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Snake">Snake</p>
<p class="fl">Various species of snake, suborder Ophidia (Serpentes). In the Bible nine Hebrew words and four Greek ones refer to snakes. The most common Hebrew word is onomatopoeic—that is, it is an imitation of a snake hissing or of the sound it produces as it scrapes its scales along the ground (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.46.22">Jer 46:22</a>). Many types of snakes lay eggs (<a href="?bref=Isa.59.5">Is 59:5</a>), although some retain the eggs in the body until ready to hatch.</p>
<p>Snakes are among the most widespread reptiles and are found on all continents except Antarctica; they decrease in numbers and species toward the poles but increase as one approaches the equator. Thirty-three species of snakes are known in Palestine and neighboring countries, 20 of which are poisonous. Two dangerous characteristics of the snake noted by biblical writers are its inconspicuous way of moving and the ease with which it hides itself.</p>
<p>Many snakes are able to swallow animals several times their own diameter because of their unusually flexible jaw mechanism. They lack not only legs but also movable eyelids. Snakes periodically shed their skins. The tongue is actually a hearing apparatus sensitive to airborne vibrations and probably to heat waves.</p>
<p>The venom of poisonous species is a clear, thin secretion, transmitted to the victim’s bloodstream by means of fangs. Two types of venom are known: that of the vipers, which affects respiration and disintegrates red blood cells, and that of the cobras, which paralyzes the nervous system.</p>
<p>The “asp” referred to in the Bible is probably the cobra; the “adder” is the viper. The “cockatrice” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is probably the adder. Serpents were associated with worship in Canaanite religion and symbolized evil deities among many other peoples. Steles (upright stones bearing inscriptions) have been unearthed at several sites in the Holy Land and Syria depicting a god or worshiper with a snake winding about the legs or body. Because the Israelites were burning incense in pagan worship of Moses’ bronze serpent (<a href="?bref=Num.21.8-9">Nm 21:8-9</a>), King Hezekiah destroyed it in his religious reform (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kgs 18:4</a>).</p>
<p>Although snakes have been an object of veneration in some religions, in the Judeo-Christian tradition snakes represent evil and, more specifically, the devil. That association began in the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-15">Gn 3:1-15</a>) and is also found in the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.9">12:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.2-3">20:2-3</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Spider">Spider</p>
<p class="fl">Animal of the order Araneida. Between 600 and 700 different species inhabit the Holy Land. Spiders are different from insects in that, like scorpions, they have four pairs of legs instead of three. Spiders are equipped with poison glands—the effectiveness varying from species to species. A few can kill only insects, but others can also kill birds and mice.</p>
<p>Most spiders have a pair of spinnerets attached to silk glands on the underside of the abdomen; from them a web is extruded. In the Bible the spider’s web is referred to as a symbol of frailty and insecurity (<a href="?bref=Job.8.14">Jb 8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.5-6">Is 59:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Sponge">Sponge</p>
<p class="fl">Simple marine animals, phylum Porifera. The term “sponge” also refers to those animals’ skeletal remains. The sponge has a porous body composed of tubules and cells.</p>
<p>Sponge fishing was well known in the Mediterranean area in ancient times. It was practiced particularly along the Anatolian and Syrian coasts. Sponges were harvested by divers. The use of sponges in absorbing liquids is referred to in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.48">Mt 27:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.36">Mk 15:36</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Insects of the family Vespidae. Hornets are social wasps that build large aerial apartment houses in which 1,000 or more individuals may live. In the Bible the hornet is used as a metaphor for God’s use of military forces (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.28">Ex 23:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.20">Dt 7:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.12">Jos 24:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Whale">Whale</p>
<p class="fl">Largest of all living creatures, including those that have become extinct. Whales are air-breathing mammals of the order Cetacea.</p>
<p>Two varieties of whales visit the shores of the Holy Land at times. The finback whale <span class="ital">(Balaenoptera physalus)</span> weighs about 200 tons (181 metric tons) and lives mainly in the Arctic region but sometimes passes through the Straits of Gibraltar to reach the eastern Mediterranean Sea. It feeds on small marine organisms that it strains through its whale bone; it does not have teeth. The finback whale’s esophagus is narrow.</p>
<p>The sperm whale <span class="ital">(Physeter catodon),</span> about 60 feet (18.3 meters) long, has a curiously shaped head that looks like a battering ram. The teeth in the lower jaw of the male sperm whale are about seven inches (17.8 centimeters) long. It feeds on big fish, even on sharks. It has a large throat opening.</p>
<p>Whales are referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.21">Genesis 1:21</a> and <a href="?bref=Job.7.12">Job 7:12</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> only). The “great fish” of <a href="?bref=Jon.2.1">Jonah 2:1</a> need not have been a whale but could have been a large shark, such as the whale shark <span class="ital">(Rhineodon),</span> which grows 70 feet (21.3 meters) long and lacks the terrible teeth of other sharks. Whatever the actual marine organism, Jonah’s deliverance was miraculous. The Greek word for “whale” is sometimes used as a general term for “sea monster” or huge fish and may be used in that sense in <a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">Matthew 12:40</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WildOx">Wild Ox</p>
<p class="fl">Large, fierce, fleet, intractable animal <span class="ital">(Bos primigenius).</span> It had a long, lean rump with a straight back and a long, narrow head. The animal described in <a href="?bref=Job.39.9-12">Job 39:9-12</a> is clearly the wild ox. The two horns (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.17">Dt 33:17</a>), its outstanding characteristic, were straight and as long as the head (<a href="?bref=Num.23.22">Nm 23:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.8">24:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.21">Ps 22:21</a>). Kings often symbolized their dominion by wearing a helmet with two wild ox horns (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.92.10">Pss 92:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.17-18">132:17-18</a>). The horns were often used as drinking vessels by the Israelites; some were large enough to hold four gallons (15 liters).</p>
<p>Hunting the wild ox was a favorite sport of Assyrian kings. Tiglath-pileser I hunted it in the Lebanon Mountains about 1100 <span class="era">BC</span> (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.29.6">Ps 29:6</a>). At one time the animal referred to in <a href="?bref=Job.39.9-12">Job 39:9-12</a> was thought to be the oryx or antelope because of the similarity between the Hebrew word in Job and the Arabian name for oryx. The translators of the <span class="sc">kjv</span> called the wild ox a “unicorn” because of representations found on Babylonian mosaics and Egyptian drawings. Those representations showed it in strict profile, showing only one horn—hence, “unicorn.” Jerome’s Vulgate, a Latin Bible translation (fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>) and Martin Luther’s German version translated it similarly.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Wolf">Wolf</p>
<p class="fl">Large doglike mammal <span class="ital">(Canis lupus)</span> that travels in bands of up to 30 animals. From the nose to the rump, the wolf measures about 3 feet (.9 meter); its drooping tail is about 18 inches (.5 meter) long. It looks much like a skinny German shepherd dog. The grayish yellow pelt is coarse and short haired.</p>
<p>Wolves hunt singly or in relays, usually at night (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.6">Jer 5:6</a>). Wolves have acute hearing and sight but rely chiefly on scent and usually catch their prey in a swift, open chase. The wolf has a reputation for boldness, fierceness, and voracity (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.27">Gn 49:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.1.8">Hb 1:8</a>). It commonly kills more than it can eat or drag away and thus is known for its greediness.</p>
<p>The wolf is a restless animal, always on the move; hunger drives it from one place to another in constant search of new hunting grounds. During spring and fall, wolves usually roam singly or in pairs, whereas in summer they may travel in family groups. In winter, several such groups may join to form a large pack. Wolves are intelligent, social creatures, faithful to their own kind. They mate for life. Individually, the wolf is a rather timid animal; it would much rather avoid human beings. But collectively wolves can be among the most dangerous animals alive.</p>
<p>In Egypt, Rome, and Greece the wolf was considered sacred. Wolves were well known in the Holy Land and are still found there and also in many places in Asia Minor. Shepherds continually battled with wolves that plundered their flocks (<a href="?bref=John.10.12">Jn 10:12</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible refers to wolves in a literal sense in only three places (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.6">Is 11:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.65.25">65:25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.12">Jn 10:12</a>), all other references being figurative. Usually the wolf is a symbol of enemies or the wicked (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.27">Ez 22:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.3">Zep 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.29">Acts 20:29</a>). Both the wolf’s courage and its cruelty were probably in the mind of the patriarch Jacob when he predicted the fate of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.27">Gn 49:27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Worm">Worm</p>
<p class="fl">Actually insect larvae in most biblical references, usually maggots, the larvae of flies (see <a href="#Fly">Fly</a>, above). For example, maggots are evidently referred to in accounts of worms feeding on spoiled manna (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.19-20">Ex 16:19-20</a>), corpses (<a href="?bref=Job.21.26">Jb 21:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.11">Is 14:11</a>), or open wounds (<a href="?bref=Job.7.5">Jb 7:5</a>). <a href="?bref=Mark.9.48">Mark 9:48</a> refers to a maggot that eats dead flesh. In <a href="?bref=Acts.12.23">Acts 12:23</a> a fatal, worm-induced abdominal disease of King Herod is mentioned. In other cases, the reference is to the larvae of other insects (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.8">Is 51:8</a>). In <a href="?bref=Deut.28.39">Deuteronomy 28:39</a> and <a href="?bref=Jon.4.7">Jonah 4:7</a> the vine weevil <span class="ital">(Cochylis ambiguella)</span> is probably referred to; it destroys vines by boring into their stems. Comparing a man to a worm is a metaphor for abasement (<a href="?bref=Job.25.6">Jb 25:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.6">Ps 22:6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ANNAS</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish high priest from <span class="era">AD</span> 7 to 15. Appointed by Quirinius, Roman governor of Syria, Annas was put out of office by Valerius Gratus, procurator of Judea. Annas was succeeded by three minor figures before the post was assumed by his son-in-law Caiaphas (<a href="?bref=John.18.13,24">Jn 18:13, 24</a>). The tenure of Caiaphas extended from <span class="era">AD</span> 18 to 36; thus, he was high priest at the time of Jesus’ public ministry.</p>
<p>Evidently Annas’s power and influence remained considerable even after his removal from that office. Like an American Supreme Court justice, the high priest held a lifetime appointment. Deposition of a high priest by the pagan Romans would have been strongly resented by the Jews. Consequently, Annas may still have been referred to as high priest among the populace, as a sort of high priest emeritus. Such a practice, evidenced in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus, tends to clear up those references in the NT to Annas as high priest during the same chronological period as Caiaphas (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.2">Lk 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.19,22-24">Jn 18:19, 22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>). The fact that Annas conducted a private inquiry of Jesus after he was arrested (<a href="?bref=John.18.13,19-24">Jn 18:13, 19-24</a>) but before he was taken to Caiaphas, is a strong indication that Annas was still a person of considerable stature among the Jewish religious leaders.</p>
<p>Annas is also mentioned in the NT account of an investigation of the apostles Peter and John. Interestingly, the penalty imposed on the apostles was far less severe than the one Jesus suffered (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.6-21">Acts 4:6-21</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ANNUNCIATION*</p>
<p class="fl">The angel Gabriel’s announcement to Mary that she would bear a son by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-38">Lk 1:26-38</a>).</p>
<p>In spite of the misunderstanding and hardship Mary would have to endure because of her premarital pregnancy, Gabriel greeted her as one “highly favored” or “richly blessed” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.28">Lk 1:28</a>). With fear characteristic of a human being confronted by a heavenly being, Mary “considered . . . what sort of greeting this might be” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.29">Lk 1:29</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Reassuring her, Gabriel said the Lord had chosen her to bring forth a son to be named Jesus.</p>
<p>“Jesus” is the Greek form of the Hebrew name “Joshua,” which means “the Lord is salvation.” Matthew described an angel’s appearance to Joseph also to announce that Mary was pregnant with a child conceived by the Holy Spirit, who would be called Jesus, “for he will save his people from their sins” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-21">Mt 1:18-21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Using figures of speech drawn from the OT, Gabriel prophesied concerning the child that Mary would bear (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32-33">Lk 1:32-33</a>). Like John the Baptist, Jesus would be great, but Jesus’ greatness would be of a different kind, for John was to be “great in the sight of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.15">Lk 1:15</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>), but Jesus would be great and be “called the Son of the Most High” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32">Lk 1:32</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Jesus would be given the throne of his father David (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32">Lk 1:32</a>). He would receive the sovereignty promised in the OT to the Messiah-King of David’s line, but unlike David, Jesus would reign forever (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.12-16">2 Sm 7:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Pss 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.26-29">89:26-29</a>).</p>
<p>Mary’s question, “How can this be, since I have no husband?” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.34">Lk 1:34</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) did not express doubt, but curiosity as to the manner in which the event should take place. Gabriel explained that “the power of the Most High,” the Holy Spirit, would “overshadow” Mary, and her child would be conceived by God’s power, like no child before it. Gabriel’s observation to Mary, “For with God nothing will be impossible” echoes the Lord’s word to Sarah when he announced Isaac’s birth (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.10-14">Gn 18:10-14</a>). Because Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, he would be called “holy” and would be recognized as “the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">Lk 1:35</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>It required courage for Mary to reply to Gabriel, “I am the Lord’s servant, and I am willing to accept whatever he wants” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.38">Lk 1:38</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). As a handmaid, or slave, Mary could not but do the will of her master. However, as an unmarried pregnant woman, she faced the possibility of disgrace (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.19">Mt 1:19</a>) and even the death penalty (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.20-24">Dt 22:20-24</a>; see <a href="?bref=John.8.3-5">Jn 8:3-5</a>). Still Mary realized that because of the mighty thing God would do in her, “generation after generation will call me blessed” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.48">Lk 1:48</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Since December 25 is celebrated as the traditional date of Christ’s birth, liturgical churches celebrate the Feast of the Annunciation (Incarnation) nine months earlier, on March 25.</p>

  <title>Anoint</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANOINT</p>
<p class="fl">To pour oil or ointment onto a person or object in a ritualistic fashion.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for anoint first appears in <a href="?bref=Gen.31.13">Genesis 31:13</a>, where it refers to Jacob pouring oil on the stone of Bethel (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.18-19">Gn 28:18-19</a>). At a later time the ceremony was repeated (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.9-15">Gn 35:9-15</a>). The ceremony was clearly religious, signifying induction into sacred use. As a religious act, the anointing was meant to endow the anointed one with the quality of the deity involved. From ancient times the Hebrews inaugurated officers of their national community by pouring special oil on the head of the person designated for office. The same practice was used to set objects apart for special divine use. </p>
<p>Scripture supplies few details of the ceremonial anointings of official things and persons. Jacob simply poured oil on a rock with an accompanying pronouncement. When anointing Israel’s first king, the prophet-judge Samuel took Saul aside for instruction (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.25-27">1 Sm 9:25-27</a>), then “took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, ‘Has not the Lord anointed you to be prince over his people Israel’” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">1 Sm 10:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). For anointing the tabernacle and its priests, a special oil was compounded and used only for that sacred purpose. Skilled perfume makers blended the choicest spices (myrrh, cinnamon, sweet cane, cassia) in olive oil (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.22-25">Ex 30:22-25</a>). The Lord specified that everything set apart for God—the tabernacle, the ark, the table and its instruments, the lampstand and utensils, the incense altar and main altar, the washbasin—was to be anointed. Aaron the high priest and his sons the priests were also to be anointed (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.26-32">Ex 30:26-32</a>). The result was a holy place with holy furnishings, holy implements of worship, and holy ministers.</p>
<p>The offices of prophet, priest, and king were those associated with anointing in the nation of Israel. Prophets were sometimes, but not invariably, inducted by official anointing (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16">1 Kgs 19:16</a>). They could be referred to as God’s anointed ones (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.22">1 Chr 16:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.15">Ps 105:15</a>). At the institution of the levitical priesthood, all the priests were anointed to their offices, the sons of Aaron as well as Aaron himself (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.12-15">Ex 40:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.3">Nm 3:3</a>). Afterward, anointing was not repeated at the consecration of ordinary priests, but was especially reserved for the high priest (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.29">Ex 29:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.16.32">Lv 16:32</a>).</p>
<p>Before they had a king of their own, the Israelites were aware of anointing as a mode of inaugurating kings (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.8">Jgs 9:8</a>,15). Anointing became a divinely ordained rite accompanying induction of all the kings of Judah and Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-6">2 Kgs 9:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.12">11:12</a>) from Saul onward (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">1 Sm 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.39">1 Kgs 1:39</a>). David’s anointing took place in three stages (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.1,13">1 Sm 16:1, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.4">2 Sm 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>). “The Lord’s anointed” or some similar phrase became a common designation for Hebrew kings (<a href="?bref=1Sam.12.3-5">1 Sm 12:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.14-16">2 Sm 1:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.38,51">Ps 89:38, 51</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.20">Lam 4:20</a>).</p>
<p>Anointing, however, had more than religious or ritualistic significance. Both the Egyptians and the Syrians practiced anointing for medical and cosmetic reasons, and the Scriptures indicate that such nonreligious practice was also a part of Israelite customs (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.20">2 Sm 12:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.3.3">Ru 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.15">Mi 6:15</a>). In fact, failure to anoint or perfume oneself indicated mourning or distress (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.2">2 Sm 14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.3">Dn 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.17">Mt 6:17</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, anointing of the sick accompanied by prayer for healing by local church elders is recommended when requested by a sick person (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.14-16">Jas 5:14-16</a>). Anointing with oil was also a part of the apostles’ healing ministry (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.12-13">Mk 6:12-13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ANOINTED ONE, ANOINTED ONES</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT, Jesus Christ is portrayed as fulfilling the three offices of prophet, priest, and king. He is, supremely, God’s Anointed One. “Messiah” is the term for “anointed one” derived directly from the Hebrew word for anointed; “Christ” is the same title derived from the Greek word for “anointee.” The true anointing of Messiah (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.2">Ps 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.25-26">Dn 9:25-26</a>) is spiritual; that is, it is done by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Is 61:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1,18-19">Lk 4:1, 18-19</a>). That Jesus of Nazareth was indeed the Anointed One (Messiah) of OT prophecy was evidenced in his anointing by the Holy Spirit and by the miracles that followed (<a href="?bref=John.1.32-51">Jn 1:32-51</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.33-37">Lk 4:33-37</a>). By extension, Christians also are said to be anointed by the Holy Spirit, enabling them to understand their faith and to live godly lives (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.21-22">2 Cor 1:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.20,27">1 Jn 2:20, 27</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ANTICHRIST</p>
<p class="fl">According to 1 John, anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ, that he is the unique Son of God, or that he has come in the flesh. The biblical term, however, principally refers to a particular person in whom that denial reaches its consummate expression and who will play a key role in the final stage of history.</p>
<p>The word “antichrist” occurs only four times, all in John’s epistles (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18,22">1 Jn 2:18, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>). <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18">First John 2:18</a> refers also to “many antichrists.” John assumed that his Christian readers knew about the Antichrist and had been taught to expect his coming (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18-27">1 Jn 2:18-27</a>). The presence of many antichrists, in fact, indicated that the end times had arrived. But John warned that a final Antichrist who, like the others, would deny that Jesus is the Christ, would yet make an appearance.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="OtherNamesForTheAntichrist"/>
<p>John further described any person or message that did not “confess Jesus” as being of the spirit of the antichrist (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">1 Jn 4:3</a>). In his brief Second Epistle, John referred to “many deceivers” who would not acknowledge the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh (<a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>). Such a person, he wrote, was “the deceiver and the antichrist.”</p>

  <title>Antigonus*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANTIGONUS*</p>
<p class="fl">Name of three Greek kings and two Hasmonean (Jewish) kings in the intertestamental period.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Antigonus I, also called Cyclops, the “one-eyed” (in Greek, <span class="ital">Monophthalmus</span>). Born in 382 <span class="era">BC</span>, he served under Alexander the Great and became provincial governor of Phrygia in 333 <span class="era">BC</span>. After Alexander’s death in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antigonus spent most of his life battling various coalitions of the four generals who inherited Alexander’s empire (cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.8.8">Dn 8:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.3-4">11:3-4</a>). Antigonus dreamed of uniting what had been the Alexandrian Empire, but Cassander (who ruled Macedonia), Lysimachus (who ruled Thrace and Asia Minor), Seleucus (who ruled Syria), and Ptolemy (who ruled Egypt) had the same aspirations. Antigonus was a brilliant military strategist and amassed considerable territory including much of Cassander’s inheritance and the island of Cyprus. He lived to be 80 years old and was the founder of the Antigonid dynasty, to which the next two Antigonuses belonged.</p>
<p class="list">2. Antigonus II (Gonatas). Born in 319 <span class="era">BC</span>, he was a son of Demetrius I Poliorcetes and grandson of Antigonus I. His major achievement was to rout the Seleucid ruler Antiochus I from Syria and so eliminate any threat to his own rule over Macedonia (northern Greece). This Antigonus also lived to be 80.</p>
<p class="list">3. Antigonus III, born to Demetrius the Fair in 263 <span class="era">BC</span> and thus a half nephew of Antigonus II. He maintained the Antigonid dynasty and held Greece together through the Hellenic League (224 <span class="era">BC</span>) against various efforts to dissolve its united parts.</p>
<p class="list">4. Antigonus (135–104 <span class="era">BC</span>), son of John Hyrcanus. His grandfather was Simeon and his great-grandfather Mattathias; therefore he was a grandnephew of the famous Jewish military leader Judas Maccabeus. The glory of the Hasmonean dynasty had faded before this Antigonus came on the scene. The dynasty deteriorated rapidly, virtually destroying itself with internal strife and mutual suspicion.</p>
<p class="list">5. Antigonus II (Mattathias), last of the Hasmoneans, and a nephew of the above. Son of Aristobulus II, this Antigonus spent a good part of his life in Rome trying to convince Julius Caesar that he (Antigonus) rather than Antipater II should rule Judea. After Caesar’s assassination in 44 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antigonus made his way eastward and in the year 40 <span class="era">BC</span> established a precarious and short-lived rule in Jerusalem. The routed King Herod eventually gathered enough Roman support to retake what Antigonus had conquered, and three years later Antigonus was beheaded by Mark Antony, the new Roman emperor.</p>

<p class="h1">ANTIOCHIANS</p>
<p class="fl">“Turncoat” Jews of the intertestamental period who had largely abandoned their Judaism for Greek ideas and practices. During the reign of the Syrian king Antiochus Epiphanes (second century <span class="era">BC</span>), Palestine was subjected to an intensive “Hellenizing” program. Many citizens of Jerusalem compromised or disregarded their religious heritage under the strong social and economic pressure to “be Greek” in every possible way. Jason supplanted his brother Onias as high priest (through a bribe) and worked hand in hand with Antiochus Epiphanes to create a community of Greek-thinking people within Jerusalem. Jason established a gymnasium (school) to further his indoctrination program and introduced new customs contrary to the Jewish practice. Many Jews corrupted themselves at his prodding and left the faith of their fathers. Even the priests neglected the sacrificial system to sample the worldly pleasures offered by Jason and his cohorts, “putting the highest value on Greek forms of prestige” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.15">2 Macc 4:15</a>). In <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.9">2 Maccabees 4:9</a>, this group of turncoat Jews was referred to as “citizens of Antioch” (the Syrian capital). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MaccabeanPeriod_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Maccabean Period</a>; <a href="?item=Hasmonean_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Hasmonean</a>.</p>

  <title>Antioch of Pisidia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANTIOCH OF PISIDIA</p>
<p class="fl">City in Asia Minor between the districts of Phrygia and Pisidia to which the apostle Paul traveled to introduce the gospel. Paul was invited by the elders of the synagogue in Antioch to deliver any message of exhortation he might have at their Sabbath meeting (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.14-15">Acts 13:14-15</a>). According to the record in Acts, many begged to hear more (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.42">13:42</a>), but certain Jewish leaders envied Paul’s popularity and began to revile him (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.45">13:45</a>). Paul then turned to gentile listeners (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.46-48">13:46-48</a>) until Jewish persecutors forced him to leave the city (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.50">13:50</a>). The same Jews from Antioch continued harassing Paul as he traveled to Lystra (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.19">Acts 14:19</a>). Paul passed through Antioch a second time while en route to Perga and Attalia (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.21">14:21</a>).</p>
<p>The city of Antioch was founded around 300 <span class="era">BC</span> by Seleucus Nicator and was named for his son, Antiochus I. As a result of the Roman conquest in 188 <span class="era">BC</span>, the area was declared free from the rule of the Seleucid kings, and deliberate steps toward Romanization followed. In about 36 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antony made Antioch part of the domain of the Galatian king, Amyntas. Upon the death of Amyntas 11 years later, the city was elevated to colony status and became Caesarea Antiochela, capital of southern Galatia.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="AntiochofSyria">
  <title>Antioch of Syria</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANTIOCH OF SYRIA</p>
<p class="fl">Principal city among 16 others of the same name built about 300 <span class="era">BC</span> by the Syrian emperor Seleucus I in honor of his father Antiochus. This Antioch (modern Antakya, Turkey) occupies a fertile plain in a western bend of the Orontes River that terminates in the Mediterranean Sea. In ancient times the population numbered half a million. Because of its location on navigable waters reaching to a Mediterranean port 15 miles (24 kilometers) away and because of its ready access through passes in the Taurus Mountains eastward to the interior, Antioch was a busy, cosmopolitan center of trade, religious ferment, and high levels of intellectual and political life. Under Roman authority Antioch received lavish attention in the form of beautiful public works, harbor improvements, and special trade advantages.</p>
<p>Side by side with a truly high culture were the degrading institutions of strange fertility religions, brutalizing sports spectacles, and a variety of mystery religions. Two other major influences were the large community of fully franchised Jews who flourished there and the community of government functionaries. The Jewish community supplied a number of Christian proselytes to the early church in Antioch. The government officials provided police protection, stability, and order, alternating with seemingly insatiable appetites for lavish dissipations in gambling, chariot races, brothels, exotic banquets, and the like.</p>
<p>Antioch of Syria played an important role in the book of Acts. A certain Nicholas from Antioch became one of the first deacons in the early church (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">Acts 6:5</a>). Jerusalem Christians fled to Antioch from fierce persecution (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19">11:19</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.11.1-30">Acts 11</a> gives details of Barnabas and Paul’s teaching in the Antioch church and of the benevolent gift of the believers there to suffering Christians in Jerusalem. The term “Christians” was first used in Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">11:26</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-52">Acts 13</a> records that the first missionaries were sent from there. The Jerusalem church council’s statement on requirements for gentile believers was in part a result of the work in Antioch among Gentiles (see <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> and <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Gal 2</a>).</p>
<p>From the third century to about the eighth century, Antioch was an important center for the development of Christian theology. The approach to Scripture and to the nature of Christ taken in Antioch tended to be historical and rational, in contrast to an overly spiritualized, allegorical approach taken in Alexandria (Egypt) by such theologians as Origen and Clement.</p>

  <title>Antiochus Iv</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ANTIOCHUS IV</p>
<p class="fl">Hellenistic king called Epiphanes meaning the “illustrious” or “god manifest”; he was the eighth in the Seleucid dynasty (c. 215–164 <span class="era">BC</span>). The year 189 <span class="era">BC</span> found this younger son of Antiochus III the Great hostage in Rome after the Battle of Magnesia. There he was educated. Later, he seized the Syrian throne in Antioch after the murder of his brother Seleucus IV and ruled from 175 to 164 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Antiochus Epiphanes is the most important of all the Seleucid rulers as far as the biblical literature is concerned and is known as one of the cruelest tyrants of all time. He was an enthusiastic believer in the Olympian god Zeus and hoped to unify his territories by spreading Hellenistic culture, law, and religion. In so doing he came into violent conflict with the Jews in Judah. At the beginning of his reign Antiochus IV meddled in the appointment of Jewish high priests. From 171 to 168 <span class="era">BC</span>, he waged war against Egypt, defeating Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VII. He then captured Jerusalem, prohibited Judaism with cruel persecution, looted the temple, and tried to establish the worship of Greek gods by building an altar to Zeus over the altar of burnt offering (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.10-62">1 Macc 1:10-62</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.7-42">2 Macc 4:7-42</a>). This altar is probably the “abomination that makes desolate” of <a href="?bref=Dan.11.31">Daniel 11:31</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). In fact, Antiochus IV plays a major role in the book of Daniel. He is probably the “little horn” of <a href="?bref=Dan.7.8">7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.8.9-14,23-25">8:9-14, 23-25</a> and the oppressor of the “saints of the Most High” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.25">7:25</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>By Antiochus’s edict, Judaism was made illegal under pain of death and Jews were forced to participate in heathen festivals. Open rebellion broke out in 167 <span class="era">BC</span> under the leadership of the Jewish priest Mattathias. This occurred when a representative of the king was enforcing compliance in a village named Modine near Jerusalem and was slain by Mattathias who fled to the surrounding hills. Although great slaughter fell upon the priest’s followers, Mattathias was eventually joined by large numbers of the Hasidim, and guerrilla warfare commenced.</p>
<p>After his death in 166 <span class="era">BC</span>, Mattathias was succeeded by his son Judas Maccabeus who escalated the war and enjoyed repeated victories over the Syrian generals. Antiochus was unable to personally lead the suppression of the Jewish revolt because of serious rebellions in Parthia and Armenia. He assigned this task to his regent Lysias who was empowered to depopulate Judah, enslave the Jews, and leave the land desolate. But this did not happen. Judas routed Gorgias at Emmaus, and the Syrians fled from Judah. Then Lysias personally led a larger army against the Maccabees but was severely defeated at Beth-zur. In 164 <span class="era">BC</span>, Judas restored the temple and reintroduced the daily sacrifices. By 160 <span class="era">BC</span> every vestige of the power of Antiochus IV had been erased from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Antiochus Epiphanes was known to be frenetic and rash to the point of madness, and the success of Judas Maccabeus combined with the Syrian king’s inability to personally suppress the Jewish revolt helped drive Antiochus to further madness. After these events he withdrew to Persia where it is said he died insane.</p>

<p class="h1">APOCALYPTIC*</p>
<p class="fl">Term derived from a Greek word meaning “revelation” and used to refer to a pattern of thought and to a form of literature, both dealing with future judgment (eschatology).</p>
<p>The literature designated “apocalyptic” consists of compositions that either are or purport to be divine revelations received by their authors. The revelations were usually received in the form of visions. They were recounted in detail and accompanied by an interpretation. The second half of Daniel (chs <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-12.13">7–12</a>) is filled with such visions, as is the whole of Revelation. Although revelatory visions also occurred frequently in OT prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Is 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.1-9.15">Am 7–9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-6.15">Zec 1–6</a>), they were particularly prominent in apocalyptic literature and determined the basic literary form and structure of such writings. Sometimes (as in Daniel) the revelatory message was received through a dream by the apocalyptic seer. In another form of vision (as in Revelation), the apocalyptist was caught up to the heavenly world, where he saw and heard things to be transmitted to the world of men (cf. Paul’s experience, <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.1-4">2 Cor 12:1-4</a>). Frequently, the apocalyptist was unable to understand the meaning of the visions he received. In such instances an “interpreting angel” clarified the meaning of the vision (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.15-26">Dn 8:15-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.20-27">9:20-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.18-12.4">10:18–12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.13-17">Rv 7:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.7-18">17:7-18</a>).</p>
<p>Two primary patterns of eschatological thought are found in the Bible, both centered in the conviction that God will act in the near future to save his people and punish those who oppress them. In prophetic eschatology, the dominant form in the OT, God is expected to act within history to restore man and nature to the perfect condition that existed prior to man’s fall. Apocalyptic eschatology, on the other hand, expects God to destroy the old imperfect order before restoring the world to paradise.</p>
<p>In Israel, apocalyptic eschatology evidently flourished under foreign domination. From the early sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, prophetic eschatology began to decline and apocalyptic eschatology became increasingly popular. The book of Daniel, written during the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, is the earliest example of apocalyptic literature in existence. The prophetic book of Malachi, written sometime during the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, was the last Israelite prophetic book. Thereafter, the prophetic voice became silent in Israel until the rise of Christianity. With the exception of Daniel, all the surviving Jewish apocalyptic literature was written from the third century <span class="era">BC</span> to the early second century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>In apocalyptic literature, antagonism between God and Satan was sharply emphasized. All people, nations, and supernatural beings (angels, demons) were seen as allies of God or of Satan. Although Satan had always been thought of as the adversary of God and humanity (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-19">Gn 3:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.1.6-12">Jb 1:6-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.1-8">2:1-8</a>), his power was restrained as long as Israel remained faithful to the covenant law of God. When Israel began to experience the long national nightmare of subjugation by foreign enemies, the reality of Satan’s temporary domination of the world was brought home with great force. Though apocalyptic writers dealt with particular nations dominating Israel during one or another epoch in its history, those nations were seen as servants of Satan whose opposition to God (and God’s people) would inevitably spell their downfall.</p>
<p>Apocalyptic thought was dominated by the conviction that, no matter how bad circumstances might be at any given moment, God and his people would ultimately triumph over their enemies. Apocalyptic determinism was not a fatalistic conviction that everything happened by a kind of mindless necessity; rather, it clung to hope in a sovereign God who would cause his people to experience ultimate victory over all temporal and spiritual enemies. Many apocalypses contained predictions of the future historical experience of Israel (or of the Christian church), culminating in a final and decisive victory of God and his people. In Nebuchadnezzar’s dream interpreted by Daniel, for example, a series of foreign empires was referred to under the symbolism of various parts of a gigantic image constructed of various materials; the image was destroyed by the kingdom of God, symbolized by a stone cut without hands from a mountain (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.31-45">Dn 2:31-45</a>).</p>
<p>A major difference between apocalyptic eschatology and prophetic eschatology was that apocalypticism nearly always envisaged a cosmic catastrophe prior to the final, decisive victory of God. In some apocalypses, such as the book of Daniel, God was expected to intervene decisively in the course of history, subdue evil, and introduce the kingdom of God. In others, such as the Revelation of John, God would first destroy the old world before creating a wholly new one (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rv 21:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10">2 Pt 3:10</a>). The general view was that things would get much worse before they got better. During the golden age of Israelite independence (10th through 7th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>), the notion of future catastrophe was understandably not given much emphasis. However, after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, apocalyptists thought the Jews’ problems could be reversed only by decisive and climactic intervention of God into the affairs of men and of nations.</p>
<p>A common apocalyptic notion based on both dualism and pessimism was the concept of two “ages.” “This age,” which is present and evil, was dominated by Satan and his minions, but “the age to come” would bring the blessings of the kingdom of God. A constellation of eschatological events would serve to bring the old age to a close and inaugurate the new age. When Paul spoke of the “god of this evil world” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4">2 Cor 4:4</a>), he was actually referring to Satan’s domination of “this age.”</p>
<p>Another characteristic of apocalypticism was its frequent expression of intense longing for God to shorten the present evil days and quickly usher in the kingdom of God. Just as Daniel could ask, “How long shall it be till the end of these wonders?” (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.6">Dn 12:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), so John could exclaim, “Come, Lord Jesus!” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.20">Rv 22:20</a>). The desire for God’s speedy intervention and victory made it possible to maintain hope in thoroughly adverse circumstances and encouraged God’s people to conduct their lives in a manner worthy of the coming kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.11-13">2 Pt 3:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.5-8">Rv 21:5-8</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Daniel is the only apocalypse in the OT canon of Scripture, and the book of Revelation the only apocalypse within the NT canon. Many noncanonical Jewish and Christian apocalypses survive, however. The Jewish apocalypses were written between the late third century <span class="era">BC</span> and the early second century <span class="era">AD</span>; the existing Christian apocalypses, from the second through the fourth centuries <span class="era">AD</span>. Further, many apocalyptic literary patterns and structures are found outside the formal category of apocalyptic literature. The Olivet discourse of Jesus, for example (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-51">Mt 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.1-38">Lk 21</a>), has frequently been called a little apocalypse by biblical scholars. In general, most of the features enumerated below must be present for a literary work to be considered “an apocalypse.”</p>
<p>With the exception of Daniel and Revelation, most of the surviving apocalypses are pseudonymous, that is, they were written under a false name. This characteristic is such a constant feature that apocalyptic literature has been commonly referred to as “pseudepigrapha” (“false writings”). A composite apocalypse (1 Enoch) written by several unknown authors from the second century <span class="era">BC</span> to probably the first century <span class="era">AD</span> claimed to have been written by the Enoch who was an early descendant of Adam (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.21-24">Gn 5:21-24</a>). Other Jewish apocalypses were attributed to such important OT characters as Adam and Eve, Moses, Isaiah, Baruch, Solomon, and Ezra. Since all were written after the close of the OT canon, their real authors probably thought that identification with some important OT personage was necessary for favorable reception. Early Christian apocalypses often bore the names of such important figures as Peter, Paul, and Thomas.</p>

<p class="fl">The writings of the Old and New Testaments tended to attract certain additional compositions in the form of books, parts of books, letters, “gospels,” apocalypses, and so on. Most of the authors wrote anonymously, but some presented their writings to the public under the name of a familiar OT figure or member of the Christian church. Several of these compositions formed a small but important part of the great body of Jewish literature that emerged during the period between the Old and New Testaments. Much of it was the result of religious and political ferment, for the Jews felt their faith and their very existence threatened, first by the pagan influences of Hellenistic Greek culture, then by the oppression of invading Roman forces.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheGospelOfThomas"/>
<p>Most of the apocryphal books are also pseudepigrapha—that is, they are books ascribed to a pseudonymous author. In other words, the main characteristic of these writings is the fictitious claim that the author of the book was a biblical person (Enoch, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Bartholomew, Thomas, etc.) or that the revelation contained in the book was originally given to a biblical character (Adam and Eve, Isaiah). Generally, the pseudepigrapha show a strong interest in the apocalyptic: the creation of the world, the future of Israel and the nations, the glory of God and his angels, the messianic kingdom, and life after death. Many of the pseudepigrapha are Jewish writings that were never accepted by the Jewish or Christian communities. They were written about the time of the Apocrypha (c. 200 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 110), but by the nature of the contents of the pseudepigrapha, they were only recognized by certain groups. Since some of these books approximated counterparts in the canonical Scriptures, there is no doubt that in some circles their authority and inspiration were regarded as similar to that of the scriptural compositions venerated by the Jews and later by Christians.</p>
<p>Other religious writings from that period made no claim to be scriptural. Such compositions preserved the familiar traditions of both Judaism and primitive Christianity, although on occasion they enriched or embellished them by means of legends and unhistorical narratives. Because very few books of any kind were in circulation at that time, the Palestinians tended to read whatever literary material came into their possession. Although the Torah, or law of Moses, had always been recognized as the standard of theological orthodoxy for the Jews, narratives of endurance under persecution or accounts of the way that the enemies of God’s people received their just reward had an obvious attraction for those under the pressures of a pagan society.</p>
<p>In the same way, although the Gospels and Epistles—along with the OT—comprised the basic canon or approved list of Scriptures for Christians, many additional narratives claimed the attention of Christ’s early followers. Those compositions often dealt with the supposed activities of Jesus and his followers, as well as with martyrdoms, revelations, and spiritual teachings. Some works contained material that was not only unhistorical but downright bizarre, but others reflected the spirit of Christ and the apostolic teachings to a certain extent. For the early Christians, as also for the Jews, the establishment of a formal canon of scriptural writings must have been prompted in part by a necessity to separate the record of revealed truth from other written forms of religious tradition as well as from actual heresy.</p>
<p>Writings that failed to gain acceptance into the OT and NT canons were described in the writings of some early Christian scholars by the term “apocrypha.” The Greek word means “hidden things,” and when applied to books it described those works that religious authorities wished to be concealed from the reading public. The reason was that such books were thought to contain mysterious or secret lore, meaningful only to the initiate and therefore unsuitable for the ordinary reader. But the word “apocrypha” was also applied in a less complimentary sense to works that deserved to be concealed. Such works contained harmful doctrines or false teachings calculated to unsettle or pervert rather than edify those who read them. The suppression of undesirable writings was comparatively easy at a time when only a few copies of any book were in circulation at a given time.</p>
<p>By the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, a clear distinction was being made in Jewish circles between writings that were suitable for use by the general public and esoteric works that were to be restricted to the knowledgeable and the initiated. Thus in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.14.1-6">2 Esdras 14:1-6</a>, the writer tells how Ezra was supposedly instructed by God to publish openly certain writings (among them the Torah), and keep others secret (that is, apocalyptic traditions dealing with the coming end of the age). In <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.14.42-46">2 Esdras 14:42-46</a> reference is made to 70 books, evidently noncanonical material, written after the 24 books of the Hebrew Canon.</p>
<p>Use of the term “apocrypha” to mean “noncanonical” goes back to the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>, when Jerome urged that the books found in the Septuagint and in the Latin Bibles that did not occur in the canon of the Hebrew OT writings should be treated as apocryphal. They were not to be disregarded entirely, since they were part of the great contemporary outpouring of Jewish national literature. At the same time, they should not be used as sources for Christian doctrine but at best for supplementary reading of an uplifting or inspirational nature.</p>
<p>Protestant theologians generally have followed the tradition established by Jerome, regarding the OT apocrypha as the excess of the Septuagint canon over the Hebrew Scriptures. When the Hebrew Bible began to be translated into Greek in Egypt during the reign of Ptolemy II (285–246 <span class="era">BC</span>), the scholars concerned included a number of books that, while remaining outside the generally accepted list of Hebrew canonical writings, still had a bearing upon Jewish history and society. That procedure reflected contemporary attitudes in Palestine, where many people did not attempt to separate canonical writings from other forms of religious literature. The decision made by Jewish authorities about what to regard as canonical Scripture naturally had a bearing on what would constitute OT apocrypha.</p>
<p>Textual evidence represented by certain manuscripts and fragments from the Dead Sea caves makes it reasonably certain that the last of the canonical Hebrew writings had been completed several decades before the time Alexander the Great (356–323 <span class="era">BC</span>) began his conquests in the Near East. The process by which those compositions came to be accepted as canonical was more protracted, however. Only when they had been circulated, read, and assessed favorably by comparison with the spirituality of the Torah were they accorded general canonicity. Hence the distinction between the canonical and apocryphal writings came as much through usage and general consent on the part of orthodox Judaism as through any other manner. Earlier scholars suggested that the so-called Council of Jamnia, held in Palestine about <span class="era">AD</span> 100, was responsible for drawing up a list of OT books suitable for use by the faithful. However, subsequent studies have thrown considerable doubt upon the historicity of such a council, at the same time showing that the Jewish authorities of that period considered their noncanonical writings to be more of an obstacle than a help to devotion.</p>
<p>The books the Jews regarded as being specifically outside the Canon, and therefore apocryphal, are as follows: 1 Esdras; 2 Esdras; Tobit; Judith; the additions to Esther; the Wisdom of Solomon; Ecclesiasticus; Baruch; the Letter of Jeremiah; the additions to the book of Daniel (the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon); the Prayer of Manasseh; 1 Maccabees; and 2 Maccabees. Several Septuagint manuscripts included some pseudohistorical material under the titles of 3 and 4 Maccabees. Therefore, even the Apocrypha varied somewhat in content, depending upon the manuscript tradition being followed. Among early Christian scholars there was also some difference of opinion about the precise limits of canonical Hebrew Scripture, and hence of apocryphal material. A serious break with Hebrew and rabbinic tradition came with the writings of Augustine, who advanced the view that the books of the Apocrypha were of equal authority with the other writings of the canonical Hebrew and Christian Scriptures. A few dissenting voices were raised in support of Jerome’s position, but the views of Augustine were embraced by the Council of Trent (1546) and became official Roman Catholic teaching.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church includes the following works as part of the Deuterocanonical Scriptures: Tobit; Judith; the additions to Esther; the Wisdom of Solomon; Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach; Baruch; the additions to the book of Daniel (the Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon); 1 Maccabees; and 2 Maccabees. (Articles on each of these are interspersed throughout this dictionary.)</p>
<p>Christians of the NT period were already familiar with Jewish apocryphal works, including the apocalyptic speculations found in 2 Esdras. Therefore, it was hardly surprising that a similar body of literature should grow up around their own Scriptures when they began to be composed and circulated. NT apocrypha, however, like its OT counterpart, could be considered only in relationship to an established canon of scriptural writings. Since the earliest catalog of NT writings, the Muratorian Canon, was not compiled until about <span class="era">AD</span> 200, a considerable period of time elapsed before an official church statement could appear on what was to be considered NT apocrypha. In the meantime, a large assortment of materials of a predominantly religious nature appeared, purporting to be orthodox in nature and dealing with various aspects of historic Christianity. As events turned out, this apocryphal literature defeated the purposes it was intended to serve.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ApocryphalGospels">Apocryphal Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">One major class of apocrypha are the apocryphal gospels. These writings preserved stories about Christ and some teachings, but being mostly fanciful in nature they never became canonical. There are three broad classes:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. A type similar to the synoptic Gospels, represented by the Gospel of Peter and the Gospel of the Egyptians, as well as papyrus fragments including Oxyrhynchus 840 and Papyrus Egerton 2. Other papyrus collections of sayings show affinities with the canonical Gospels.</p>
<p class="list">2. Gospels that disseminated Gnosticism, a second-century <span class="era">AD</span> heresy stressing philosophical knowledge <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">gnosis</span><span class="ital">)</span> of the cosmos and man. They are often in the form of dialogues between Jesus and his disciples, such as the Coptic Gospel of Thomas, the Apocryphon of John, the Wisdom of Jesus Christ, and the Dialogue of the Redeemer. In this category also come those “gospels” attributed to the Twelve as a group, such as the Memoirs of the Apostles.</p>
<p class="list">3. Infancy gospels, purporting to supply otherwise unknown information of a legendary nature about Christ’s earliest years. Passion gospels also come into this category. These narratives were written to satisfy curiosity about Christ’s birth and childhood or to embellish the canonical accounts of his crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p class="list-text">Because of the scarcity of information about such matters as the childhood, adolescence, and early manhood of Jesus, the “infancy” gospels purport to supply the reader with what was meant to pass for historical fact. Much of the material, however, was entirely within the realm of fantasy and could never have been accepted as fact by any intelligent reader. For example, in the Gospel of Thomas the five-year-old Jesus is accused of breaking the Sabbath by making sparrows of clay beside a stream. When his father Joseph investigates the situation, Jesus claps his hands and the clay birds come to life and fly away chirping.</p>
<p class="list-text">“Passion” gospels were written to embellish the canonical accounts of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection. As supplements to Christian teaching, many of the apocryphal writings seemed to be proclaiming ideas that were actually outside the scope of NT doctrine. Attempts to fill in the “hidden years” of Christ’s life had no foundation whatever in the traditions of the Gospels. Works dealing with the last state of unbelievers were embellished in a manner that went far beyond anything stated in the NT. In some notable instances, as in the writings of various Gnostic sects, the authors set out deliberately to propagate heretical teachings they had accepted under the authority of some apostolic figure. The Gospel of Thomas, recovered around 1945 from Nag Hammadi (Chenoboskion) near the Nile River, is an example of an attempt to perpetuate curious sayings and dogmas by attributing them to Jesus, so that they would receive wide currency and acceptance.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ApocryphalActs">Apocryphal Acts</p>
<p class="fl">There are also some apocryphal acts, which are purported to be accounts of apostolic achievements not recorded in Scripture. Such “acts” are the source of much tradition, such as Peter’s being crucified upside down and Thomas’s mission to India. The reliability of the traditions is questionable because the writings contain clearly unorthodox material. Yet small fragments of accurate information may be embedded in this mass of largely fictitious literature.</p>
<p>Because of their often heretical character, the church consistently reacted against such books, sometimes even demanding that they be burned (for example, at the Nicene Council of 787). The Acts of John pictured Jesus talking to John on the Mt of Olives during the crucifixion, explaining that it was only a spectacle. In the Acts of Thomas, Jesus appeared in the form of Thomas, exhorting a newly married couple to dedicate themselves to virginity. Sexual abstinence was a dominant theme, reflecting Platonic ideas, which disparaged the physical body.</p>
<p>Many scholars date the earliest work, the Acts of John, before <span class="era">AD</span> 150. The major Acts (of John, Paul, Peter, Andrew, and Thomas) were probably written during the second and third centuries. These gave rise to other “acts” that were primarily miracle stories, written more to entertain than to teach.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ApocryphalEpistles">Apocryphal Epistles</p>
<p class="fl">A host of apocryphal works are classified as epistles. These generally pseudonymous works originated from many widely separated periods of time. Many other apocryphal works are apocalyptic in nature. These works are supplemented by material such as the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons. Added to these are the Gnostic compositions found at Nag Hammadi, which include works purporting to represent the teachings of Christ as well as “secret” instructions compiled by the Gnostic writers and a few apocryphal compositions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ApocalypticApocrypha">Apocalyptic Apocrypha</p>
<p class="fl">Another group could be called apocalyptic apocrypha. The term “apocalypse” means “disclosure” or “revelation,” a term that was generally applied to Christian literature that resembled the Revelation of John, which designates itself an apocalypse in <a href="?bref=Rev.1.1">Revelation 1:1</a>. The practice of writing under the name of an illustrious figure of the past, or pseudonymity, was a characteristic device used by most unknown authors of Jewish and Christian apocalypses (the Revelation of John is a striking exception). Jewish apocalypses were attributed to such ancient worthies as Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Moses, Ezra, and others. Similarly, Christian apocalypses written in the second century <span class="era">AD</span> and later were ascribed to such important early Christian figures as Peter, Thomas, James and others.</p>
<p>In NT times there emerged in Judaism certain circles that developed an apocalyptic view of history. They provided such writings as the five parts of 1 Enoch, the Assumption of Moses, 2 Esdras, and the Apocalypse of Baruch. These books are of importance to NT study, for they provide a bridge between the OT and the NT concepts of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The apocalypses were written to answer the problems of theodicy (the justice of God). After the days of Ezra, the law assumed a more important role in the life of the people than before. In prophetic times Israel again and again apostatized from the law and worshiped foreign gods. The primary message of the prophets was to challenge Israel to get right with God and to turn in repentance to keep the law. After Ezra and throughout NT times, Israel was obedient to the law as never before. The Jews abhorred idolatry and faithfully worshiped God. Still the kingdom did not come. Instead came the fearful persecution in the Maccabean times by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the worldly rule of the Hasmoneans, Pompey and Roman hegemony, and in <span class="era">AD</span> 66–70, the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Where was God? Why did he not deliver his faithful people? Why did the kingdom not come? The apocalypses were written to answer questions like these.</p>
<p>One of the most important elements in apocalyptic religion is an explicit dualism, expressed as “this age” and “the age to come.” The prophets contrasted the present time with the future when the kingdom of God would be established. The apocalyptists radicalized this contrast. Twice we find fragments of this idiom in 1 Enoch. We meet the fully developed idiom in 2 Esdras and the Apocalypse of Baruch (late first century <span class="era">AD</span>). “The Most High has made not one age but two” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.7.50">2 Esd 7:50</a>); “the day of judgment shall be the end of this age and the beginning of the immortal age that is to come” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.7.113">2 Esd 7:113</a>); “this age the Most High has made for many but the age to come for few” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.8.1">2 Esd 8:1</a>; see also Apoc Bar 14:13; 15:7; <span class="ital">Pirke Aboth</span> 4:1, 21-22; 6:4-7). Furthermore, the transition from this age to the age to come can be accomplished only by a cosmic act of God. In the apocryphal Assumption of Moses there is no messianic personage; it is God alone who comes to redeem Israel. In the Similitudes of Enoch the transition is accomplished with the coming of a heavenly, preexistent Son of Man. In 2 Esdras we find a conflation of the concepts of Davidic Messiah and the Son of Man.</p>
<p>Apocalyptic differs from OT prophetic religion in that it is pessimistic about the present age. It would be wrong to describe the apocalypses as ultimately pessimistic, for their basic message is that in due time God will intervene and save his people. But for the present, as long as this age lasts, he has removed himself from intervening in Israel’s affairs. The present age is under the power of evil angelic and demonic forces and is irretrievably evil. God has abandoned this age to evil; salvation can be expected only in the age to come.</p>
<p>The apocalyptists lost completely the tension between history and eschatology. They no longer expected any deliverance in this age. God had, in fact, become the God of the future, not of the present.</p>
<p>In the dream-visions of Enoch (1 Enoch 83–90), God faithfully guided Israel throughout its history. Then God withdrew his personal leadership, forsook the temple, and surrendered his people to be torn and devoured. God “remained unmoved, though he saw it, and rejoiced that they were devoured and swallowed and robbed, and left them to be devoured in the hand of all the beasts” (1 Enoch 89:58). After the Babylonian captivity God was conceived to be inactive in history. History was surrendered to evil. All salvation was thrust into the future.</p>
<p>Comparative studies have shown that the NT apocryphal writings preserve at best a series of debased traditions about the founder and teachings of early Christianity. At worst, the narratives are entirely devoid of historical value and in some respects are totally alien to NT spirituality. Even where they seem to support a tradition current in some part of the early church, the evidence they present is inferior to what can often be had from other sources. Sometimes the compositions are so trivial and inconsequential that it is difficult to account for their survival. Certain apocryphal writings did in fact become lost and are now known only in the form of quotations in larger works.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the NT apocryphal compositions are important in indicating what was attractive to the ordinary people of the day. For them an element of the romantic seemed necessary to supplement the body of received spiritual truth. Certain of the stories recounted were vivid and imaginative, and others, such as the apocalypses, provided a form of escapism from harsh temporal realities. No matter what their nature, the NT apocryphal writings exerted an influence out of all proportion to their fundamental worth.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SpecificTitlesofApocryphalWritings">Specific Titles of Apocryphal Writings</p>
<p class="h3" id="AbdiasApostolicHistoryof">Abdias, Apostolic History of</p>
<p class="fl">Collection of material drawn from canonical and apocryphal writings concerning the lives of the apostles, including Paul. Abdias, an early bishop of Babylon, was supposedly the author of this history that more probably was collated from a variety of sources in the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span> in France. This apocryphal “acts,” divided into 10 books, originally circulated in Greek as individual volumes that were collected into one when a Latin version was made. The content is generally regarded as folklore or legend but is of some value where no other source is available.</p>
<p>Abdias, a contemporary of the apostles, may have seen Christ and supposedly traveled extensively with Simon and Jude. There is no historical basis for considering Abdias as the author of the Hebrew text, or for believing that his disciple Eutropius translated it into Greek or that Africanus translated the Greek into Latin—although the preface to the Latin version makes those claims.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AbgarusLettersofChristand">Abgarus, Letters of Christ and</p>
<p class="fl">Apocryphal work comprising two short letters, one supposedly written by the Syrian king Abgar (Abgarus), the other supposedly a reply from Jesus. Eusebius claimed to have found the material in the archives of Abgar at Edessa and translated it from Syrian to Greek together with an account of the exploits of the disciple Thaddaeus.</p>
<p>According to the legend, Abgar, suffering from a severe disease, hears of the miracles of Jesus and sends a messenger with a letter asking Jesus to come heal him. At the same time he offers Jesus sanctuary from the dangerous opposition of the Jews in Jerusalem. In a written reply (later altered to an oral one to comply with the tradition that no writings of Jesus existed), Jesus declines the offer of sanctuary but promises that after his ascension he will comply with Abgar’s request for healing by sending a disciple to him. Thaddaeus, one of the Twelve, is dispatched to Edessa, the king is healed, and the community converts to Christianity. In a slightly different version in the Doctrina Addaei (about <span class="era">AD</span> 400), an oral reply is given, and the messenger returns with a portrait of Jesus that is displayed prominently in Abgar’s palace.</p>
<p>The legend is essentially similar to that described in the Greek Acts of Thaddaeus (fifth or sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>), except that in the latter Ananias returns with a handkerchief on which is a miraculous imprint of the face of Christ.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AbrahamApocalypseof">Abraham, Apocalypse of</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish document existing in old Slavonic texts that go back through Greek to a Hebrew or Aramaic original.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Abraham begins with Abraham turning from idolatry. Incorporating old rabbinical traditions of Abraham’s youth, it describes his awakening to the call of God and his awareness that God was one and was holy. An angel named Jahoel, whose functions and powers are lifted from rabbinical lore, takes Abraham to the seventh heaven where he is shown things past and things yet to be. He sees the temptation of Adam and Eve through sexual sin, and the murder of Cain. Azazel, an evil being, plays Satan’s role. These details probably reflect a tradition that Abraham was the author of the first documents of the Bible. The revelation then turns to the future and shows the destruction of the temple, plagues upon the heathen, and the coming of the Messiah. It is probable that the composite document took final form in the last generation of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>True to his character as revealed in Genesis, Abraham raises the question of evil and why God tolerates the rebellious Azazel. He receives the answer that evil has its origin in the free will of man. This apocalypse shows how faithful Jews struggled to understand the problem of evil during a time of great suffering in Judaism. It also illustrates the curious “doctrine of angels” of that period. Both Gnostic and Christian editing of the text has been noted by some scholars.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AbrahamTestamentof">Abraham, Testament of</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish apocryphal writing describing the death of Abraham. In the testament, when the angel Michael comes to take Abraham’s soul, Abraham refuses to die. Reluctant to insist on the old man’s death, Michael accedes to his request to see all creation before he dies. The angel transports Abraham by chariot into the heavens so that he can observe mankind. Abraham is so shocked at the perfidy of humanity that he curses the sinners, who die immediately. He then observes the judgment of a soul, and although angels take part in the trial he notes that the presiding judge is Abel. The merits and demerits of the soul seem equally balanced, but because of the intervention of Abraham, the judgment is favorable. Abraham then realizes the severity of his cursing of sinners, but the angel informs him that the premature death of those whom he had cursed was the means of atonement for their sins.</p>
<p>After his return to earth, Abraham again refuses to die. Death appears in all his horror and kills 7,000 servants of Abraham (who are subsequently raised to life), but the aged saint still will not die. Finally, Death grasps Abraham’s hand and the angels lift his spirit to the heavens.</p>
<p>The account is found in several Greek manuscripts, the oldest perhaps dating from the 13th century <span class="era">AD</span>, as well as in Slavonic, Romanian, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Coptic. The original language was probably Hebrew, from the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, with the work possibly translated into Greek by a Christian. The testament also exists in a shorter version in which God comes to lift up the soul of Abraham during a dream. There is no attempt in the work to make a theological statement, but the portrayal of the angel Michael and of Death are typical of Jewish thought of the first century.</p>

<p class="h3" id="AdamApocalypseof">Adam, Apocalypse of</p>
<p class="fl">One of the best examples of Gnostic apocalyptic literature. In 1946, a farm worker discovered a number of ancient texts in a cave about 6 miles (10 kilometers) north of the Egyptian city of Nag Hammadi. The discovery included 13 codexes (predecessors of bound books) of Christian and non-Christian origin. The discovery was not immediately disclosed, so it was not until 1958 that a French scholar, Jean Doresse, revealed the existence of the Apocalypse of Adam to the public. The apocalypse is written in Coptic and stands as the last of five works in Codex V.</p>
<p>Although the author’s true identity is unknown, the subtitle spuriously attributes the book to Adam or Seth: “An Apocalypse that Adam revealed to his son Seth in the seven hundredth year.” Seth was often cast in the role of transmitter of truth by the writers of Gnostic literature (for example, the Gospel of the Egyptians, the Paraphrase of Shem).</p>
<p>The earliest existing copy of the Apocalypse of Adam is dated around <span class="era">AD</span> 300 to 350, although it may have been written long before. Its frequent Gnostic references, its dependence on Jewish history, and its allusions to baptism have led some scholars to postulate an origin in the Jewish baptist sects of the first and second centuries. Parallels also exist between this work and third-century Manichean (a brand of Gnosticism) literature.</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Adam is of great importance to students of Christian origins. For many years scholars have debated whether the Gnostic religion was a heretical outgrowth of Christianity or whether it was a movement of independent origins. Some scholars have argued that the Apocalypse of Adam is an example of an early, independent Gnosticism. If this proves to be the case the debate will certainly be simplified.</p>
<p>In addition to its introduction and conclusion, the Apocalypse of Adam may be divided into three parts: Adam’s summary of significant past events, predictions of attempts to eliminate mankind by the evil creator-god, and predictions about the coming of the Enlightener who will show his people the way to the true God.</p>
<p>The apocalypse opens with Adam, supposedly on his deathbed, revealing the future secrets of the Gnostic people to Seth. These have been mystically communicated to him by three angelic beings. Adam bemoans his condition of perpetual slavery to the evil creator-god, brought about by the fall and mankind’s subsequent loss of <span class="greek">gnosis</span> (knowledge). Typical of Gnostic literature, a sharp distinction is drawn between the evil creator-god who rules the earth and the true God of the universe, knowledge of whom brings authentic life. Adam predicts that the creator-god will jealously attempt to destroy mankind by a flood (the story of Noah) and by fire (the story of Sodom and Gomorrah) and thus keep mankind from knowledge of the true God. These attempts, however, will be foiled by the intervention of angelic beings sent from the God of truth. Finally, the true God will send the Enlightener who will teach <span class="greek">gnosis</span> to mankind so that they might know him. The creator-god will try to defeat the Enlightener but will be able to harm only his physical body. With the message of the Enlightener prevailing, mankind will turn from the creator-god and seek the true God through <span class="greek">gnosis</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>

<p class="h3" id="AdamApocryphalBooksof">Adam, Apocryphal Books of</p>
<p class="fl">Account of the life and death of Adam and Eve recorded in Latin, and in a Greek version known as the Apocalypse of Moses. Other minor versions of early Christian origin also exist. Like other apocryphal writings, the work is fanciful and of unknown authorship.</p>
<p>According to the Latin account, after their expulsion from Paradise Adam and Eve are hungry and unable to find food for seven days. In desperation a penitent Eve, assuming responsibility for tasting the forbidden fruit, suggests that Adam kill her. He refuses, and after a search they survive by eating animals’ food. Adam suggests that as a penance they should stand fasting in the river up to their necks for 40 days, he in the Tigris, she in the Jordan. After 18 days Satan comes to Eve in the guise of an angel, tells her that the Lord has accepted her penance, and persuades her to leave the river. Coming to the Tigris where Adam is, Eve realizes that it was Satan who had spoken to her. Satan then explains that the reason for his fall was his refusal to worship man, a lower being.</p>
<p>The archangel Michael is then sent to Adam with seeds so that he can learn to till the land. In a dream Eve sees Cain kill Abel, and in an attempt to prevent the murder by separating the brothers, Cain is made a farmer and Abel a shepherd. Subsequently a third son, Seth, is born. Adam receives a message from God that he is to die because he has obeyed the word of his wife rather than the instructions of God. When Adam is later in pain and close to death, he explains to Seth that Satan had tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and that she in turn had persuaded him to taste it. Seth and Eve journey to the gates of Paradise to plead with God for Adam’s life. On the way Seth is attacked and bitten by a snake. At Paradise, Michael explains to them that Adam must die. Seth observes the burial of Adam and Abel.</p>
<p>Before Eve’s death the following week, she asks Seth to make a record of the lives of his parents on tablets of stone and clay, so that if the Lord shows his anger with the world by water, the clay will be dissolved and the stone remain; if by fire, the stone will be broken up and the clay baked hard. Eve also warns Seth to mourn for six days only and not on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>The text of the Greek version is similar to that of the Latin, except that the Greek version includes a description of Adam’s resurrection (added later to the Latin) and a detailed account by Eve of her temptation and fall. The burial of Adam and the initial refusal of the earth to accept the body of the slain Abel are also elaborately described in the Greek account. Both versions are probably derived from Hebrew originals dating from the first century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AhikarBookof">Ahikar, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Near Eastern folktale from the sixth or seventh century <span class="era">BC</span> showing the reward of ingratitude. According to the story, Ahikar, secretary of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was renowned for his wisdom. Childless even though he had 60 wives, Ahikar adopted his sister’s son, Nadan, and reared him to be his successor in Sennacherib’s court. Ahikar diligently educated his adopted son, who nevertheless turned out to be bad and even forged documents to have his benefactor condemned to death. Ahikar was spared through his friendship with the executioner and was concealed until the wrath of the king cooled. Later, when Sennacherib had occasion to wish for his wisdom, Ahikar was brought on the scene, long-haired, disheveled, and with fingernails like eagles’ claws. Once again in the king’s favor, Ahikar sternly rebuked his unscrupulous nephew. In response to Ahikar’s rebuke, Nadan’s body swelled up and his stomach burst open.</p>
<p>Ahikar’s story has interesting parallels with OT wisdom books and also with some of the parables of Jesus. References to Ahikar occur in the apocryphal book of Tobit, in the Greek philosopher Democritus, in the apocalyptic Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, as well as in the Koran. The story, originally in Aramaic, also survives in Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Ethiopic, and Greek, though with considerable variations in the versions.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AkhmimFragment">Akhmim Fragment</p>

<p class="h3" id="AllogenesSupreme">Allogenes Supreme</p>
<p class="fl">Gnostic work (“The Most High Stranger”), discovered in 1946 in an urn near Nag Hammadi (Egypt). The Neoplatonist historian Porphyry, as well as later Syriac Christian writings against heresy, mentioned the works of Allogenes (whose name means “foreigner” or “stranger”). Allogenes Supreme, a Gnostic “apocalypse” written in Coptic, contains an account of the creation of the higher world, exalting Barbelo, the celestial mother. The existing copy was made during the fourth century, but the original may date back to the second century.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AndrewActsof">Andrew, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">Apocryphal work describing purported miracles and the martyrdom in Greece of the apostle Andrew, Peter’s brother. Its theme is the virtue of turning away from materialism and the transitory values of the world to an asceticism associated with dedication of life to God. The earliest fragment available is in the Vatican. The original probably dated from the second century <span class="era">AD</span> and was probably long, verbose, and tedious. Feeling that it had merit, Gregory of Tours in the sixth century wrote a concise account of the miracles of Andrew from an original, now lost. The account of the martyrdom of Andrew probably circulated separately.</p>
<p>Among the many miracles Gregory recorded was one concerning Exoos, a noble youth from Thessalonica, who, having heard of Andrew’s preaching and miracles, comes to him at Philippi, is converted, and remains with him. Finding bribery useless and refusing to listen to Andrew, the youth’s parents set fire to the house where the Christians are staying. As the flames roar, Exoos prays that the Lord will extinguish the fire and sprinkles it with water. Thereupon the flames die out. The parents and the crowd, claiming that the youth is now a sorcerer, climb ladders to enter the house and kill the inhabitants, but God blinds the intruders. Although it is night, a light shines out from the house, sight is restored to those who have been blinded, and all except the youth’s parents are converted. The parents die soon afterward, and Exoos remains with Andrew, spending his inheritance on the poor. Returning to Thessalonica, Exoos heals a man who has been paralyzed for 23 years, and subsequently Exoos and Andrew perform further miracles and preach to the people.</p>
<p>In Patrae the maidservant of Maximilla, wife of the proconsul Aegeates, comes to Andrew and implores him to heal her mistress, whose fever is so severe that her husband is standing at her bedside threatening to kill himself with a sword the moment she dies. Telling the proconsul to put up his sword, Andrew takes Maximilla’s hand and the fever leaves her. Ordering food for her, Andrew then refuses Aegeates’ offer of 100 pieces of silver. After performing many miracles in the city, Andrew receives a message from Maximilla to come and heal the slave of the proconsul’s brother, Stratocles. The apostle restores the boy to health, and his master believes.</p>
<p>Maximilla, to the fury of her husband, spends considerable time listening to the preaching of Andrew and is also converted. She then refuses to sleep with her husband and one night even substitutes a servant for herself. Details of subsequent events are found in the account of the martyrdom. Aegeates, in anger, holds Andrew responsible for his wife’s alienation and has him arrested. After preaching from prison, Andrew is taken to be crucified by the seashore. When the Christian Stratocles sees Andrew being manhandled by the soldiers, he fights his way through, and he and Andrew walk together to the place of crucifixion. Aegeates, fearing his brother, orders the soldiers not to interfere. At the seashore the soldiers follow the proconsul’s command that Andrew be tied, not nailed, to the cross so that his death will be lingering and he will be eaten by dogs. After two days he is still speaking to people from the cross, and many come to Aegeates demanding Andrew’s release. Arriving at the scene, the proconsul sees that Andrew is indeed alive, and Aegeates approaches the apostle to release him. Andrew demands that he be allowed to die and meet his Lord. As they watch, Andrew dies and the onlookers weep as Maximilla and Stratocles take down his body from the cross. Maximilla remains apart from her husband and continues as a Christian.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AndrewStoryof">Andrew, Story of</p>
<p class="fl">Legendary fragment existing only in the Coptic language. In the legend coming from the late second century <span class="era">AD</span>, a woman kills her child in the desert and gives the remains to a dog. She flees when the apostle Andrew and Philemon approach, but the dog tells what happened. Andrew prays and the child, being vomited forth, is restored to life and laughs and cries.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AndrewandMatthiasActsof">Andrew and Matthias, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">Lengthy document of highly questionable authenticity, probably dating from the late second century <span class="era">AD</span>. This book was one of many apocryphal “acts” intended to supplement the NT book of Acts by providing more information about the apostles. The fourth-century church historian Eusebius described this work and others like it as heretical, absurd, and spurious.</p>
<p>In this story, the apostles cast lots to determine where each should go. Matthias (Matthew in some versions) is sent to the country of the man-eaters, where he soon requires rescue from a cannibal feast. The Lord then sends Andrew to save him. Andrew arrives in time to do so, and Matthias is then carried off by a cloud. Now alone, Andrew is arrested and tortured, being dragged through the city that he nearly destroys by calling forth water from a statue. Eventually, impressed by Andrew’s miracles, the people repent and release him. Andrew next draws a plan for a church, has it built, baptizes the people, and gives them the ordinances of the Lord.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AndrewandPaulActsof">Andrew and Paul, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">Fragmentary apocryphal story, existing only in Coptic fragments, about the arrival of the apostles Andrew and Paul by sea at a city. In the story, Paul, instructing Andrew to rescue him, visits the underworld. There he meets Judas, who explains that he worshiped Satan after Jesus had pardoned him for the betrayal. Andrew rescues Paul, who returns carrying a piece of wood. Although Andrew is asked to heal a child, some Jews are skeptical and the city gates remain closed to the apostles. Paul strikes the gates with his piece of wood, and the gates are swallowed up into the earth. Astonished at the miracle, 27,000 Jews are converted.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ApostlesEpistleofthe">Apostles, Epistle of the</p>
<p class="fl">Letter purporting to come from the 11 apostles to the churches “of the east and the west, of the north and the south, declaring and imparting to you that which concerns our Lord Jesus Christ.” Some believe that the epistle was written in Asia Minor about <span class="era">AD</span> 160; others think that it originated in Egypt. It is probably to be dated near the middle of the second century. In existence are a mutilated Coptic manuscript of the fourth or fifth century, a complete version in Ethiopic, and a fragment in Latin. The epistle was unknown until the discovery in 1895 of the Coptic manuscript.</p>
<p>After an introduction there is a declaration that “our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ is God the Son of God who was sent of God the Lord of the whole world.” Then follows a summary of a number of incidents from the Gospels, including a negative statement of the Golden Rule: “Love your enemies, and what you would not that man do to you, that do to no man.” Chapter 24 introduces the subject of the resurrection followed by a series of questions by the disciples with answers by Jesus. A prophecy of the conversion of Paul appears in chapter 31. In chapter 43 the five wise virgins are identified as “Faith and Love and Grace and Peace and Hope”; the names of the foolish are “Knowledge, Understanding (Perception), Obedience, Patience, and Compassion.” The question-and-answer format of a substantial part of the work is reminiscent of the style of some of the texts found in the Gnostic library at Nag Hammadi, especially the Apocryphon of John. However, warnings that Cerinthus and Simon (ch 7) are “enemies of our Lord Jesus Christ” make it clear that this is not a Gnostic document. The epistle contains numerous evidences of orthodox influence, along with clear indications of a departure from apostolic Christianity.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ApostlesGospeloftheTwelve">Apostles, Gospel of the Twelve</p>
<p class="fl">One of a large number of heretical “gospels” circulating in the earliest centuries of the Christian church along with the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The Gospel of the Twelve Apostles was first mentioned by name in comments on <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1">Luke 1:1</a> by the Christian theologian Origen (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 185–254). Some scholars think it may have been the same as the Gospel of the Ebionites, quoted in a few early Christian writings. Nothing is known directly of the Gospel of the Twelve Apostles.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ArabicGospeloftheInfancy">Arabic Gospel of the Infancy</p>
<p class="fl">One of several “gospels of the infancy” found in the apocryphal NT. This one from about the fifth century contains an account of the birth of Jesus, including the visits of the shepherds and the magi, the flight into Egypt, and miracles performed by Jesus as a boy. Details of the early period of Jesus’ life are given, about which the canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) say nothing. An interesting facet of the miracle stories is the role in many of them of Mary, the mother of Jesus, in contrast to the record of the miracles in the canonical Gospels. The Arabic Gospel may have been written in Syriac and translated into Arabic. Some of its stories are also found in the Koran and other Islamic writings. Study of this apocryphal gospel reveals its sharp contrast with the canonical accounts, but it also indicates how much this and similar writings had to do with the growing veneration of the virgin Mary.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ArabicHistoryofJosephtheCarpenter">Arabic History of Joseph the Carpenter</p>
<p class="fl">Fourth-century <span class="era">AD</span> account of the life and death of Joseph—with information supposedly supplied by Jesus. According to this account, Joseph the carpenter becomes a widower after fathering four sons and two daughters (ch 2). He is entrusted with the care of Mary in his 90th year (ch 14). Thus, according to this account, the brothers and sisters of Jesus are Joseph’s children by a previous marriage. Joseph is said to have died at the age of 111 years. The document, which exists in both Arabic and Coptic versions, contains the statement that Mary “must look for the same end of life as other mortals” (ch 18). Hence, it has been dated as earlier than the fifth century, when the idea of the “assumption of Mary into heaven” was being promoted.</p>
<p class="h3" id="AristeasLetterof">Aristeas, Letter of</p>
<p class="fl">Early account of the relationships between Judaism and Hellenism in Egypt during the period when the Hebrew OT was translated into Greek (the Septuagint). The author, Aristeas, who identifies himself as an Alexandrian court attendant under Ptolemy Philadelphus II (ruled 283–247 <span class="era">BC</span>), purports to give information about the translation procedures. The most probable date for the Letter of Aristeas (estimates vary from 200 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 50) is the end of the second century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>As part of his massive library project, King Ptolemy shows interest in the Jewish law. Aristeas uses the occasion to request the emancipation with remuneration of all Jewish slaves in the kingdom and King Ptolemy accedes to the request. The king asks that the high priest in Jerusalem select translators for the project. There follows a lengthy description of gifts sent to Eleazar, the high priest, with special emphasis upon an exquisite table. And then Aristeas describes the temple, the priests, the vestments of the high priest, and the defense system for the temple, followed by a brief description of Palestine and its environs.</p>
<p>In the next section, the high priest talks with Aristeas and the translators before their departure to Alexandria. A summary of his speech includes a careful defense of the law from a philosophical viewpoint. The king gives a lavish banquet for the 72 translators (6 from each tribe) when they arrive in Alexandria. Each translator gives a brilliant answer to the king’s specific questions at the seven successive nights of celebration. The name of each translator and his question and answer are recorded. Then the work is completed on the island of Pharos in 72 days and is praised by the Alexandrian Jews and the king. The translators are dismissed with lavish gifts.</p>
<p>In the epilogue, the author claims to have been an eyewitness to the events and maintains that his report is accurate. This is not believed by modern scholars. Its embellished and legendary quality was recognized in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Aristeas’s discussion of the translation procedure was obviously a convenient literary frame on which to hang a defense of Judaism to the heathen world. Religious liberalism and loyalty to basic Jewish beliefs were skillfully combined to plead for political toleration for the Jews. Many specifics of the Letter of Aristeas are questionable, but its basic picture of how the Septuagint translation came to be made is credible. <span class="ital">See</span> the discussion of the Septuagint in <a href="?item=BibleVersionsoftheAncient_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bible, Versions of the (Ancient)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ArmenianGospeloftheInfancy">Armenian Gospel of the Infancy</p>
<p class="fl">Legendary account of the infancy and boyhood of Jesus Christ, one of many apocryphal gospels intended to supplement the four NT Gospels by providing more details about Jesus’ early life. It was probably translated into Armenian from a Syriac original. Nestorian missionaries reportedly brought an “infancy gospel” into Armenia about <span class="era">AD</span> 590, but evidently not the Armenian Gospel in its present form.</p>
<p>Sources for the Armenian Gospel included two books containing legendary material about Christ’s infancy, the Protevangelium of James and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. The Armenian Gospel amplifies the material of these two texts considerably, making many novel additions to the life of Jesus. For example, Joseph searches for a midwife and meets Eve, who has come to witness the fulfillment of the promised Redeemer-seed (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>). Later the magi bring the testament Adam gave to Seth. Jesus, accused of causing a child’s death, is cleared when the child is raised from the dead.</p>

<p class="h3" id="AsenathPrayerof">Asenath, Prayer of</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish story about the wife of Joseph when he was in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.45">Gn 41:45</a>) and known by several titles—The Life and Confession of Asenath, The Book of Joseph and Asenath, and variations of the above. It was apparently very popular in the early and medieval Christian church. Latin, Syriac, Slavonic, Rumanian, and Ethiopic versions, in addition to 40 Armenian copies, have been found.</p>
<p>Modern scholars tend to see the source of the novel in the Hellenistic Judaism prevalent in Egypt from 100 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 100. Asenath seems to serve as a model for any proselyte to Judaism. If that understanding is correct, the story gives valuable insight into the less legalistic attitudes of a sector of pre-Christian Judaism. Repentant realization of the hopelessness of one’s sinful condition and casting oneself upon the mercies of God play a large part in the story.</p>
<p>The original was probably written in Greek and is divided into two major parts. Part I deals with Asenath’s pampered life prior to meeting Joseph, his initial rejection of her because of her idolatry, and her consequent repentance in ashes. Asenath calls upon God in prayer, and he sends an angel to her to announce her forgiveness and to say that her name is now written in the Book of Life. Joseph returns and marvels at Asenath’s new beauty, rejoicing at her conversion. With Pharaoh’s blessing they are married the next day.</p>
<p>Part II describes the period when Joseph’s father, Jacob, and his family have come to Egypt. Desiring Asenath, the elder son of Pharaoh tempts Joseph’s brothers Dan and Gad to help him kidnap her. The plan is foiled by Joseph’s other brothers, who then wish to kill Dan and Gad, but Asenath pleads successfully for their lives. Pharaoh leaves the crown to Joseph, who rules 40 years and then returns the reign to Pharaoh’s younger son.</p>

<p class="h3" id="BarnabasActsof">Barnabas, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">Document of one of several distinct cycles of tradition about Barnabas, the apostle Paul’s companion, this one linking him with Cyprus. This work, whose full title is The Journeyings and Martyrdom of Saint Barnabas the Apostle, was probably composed in Cyprus at the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>The book purports to be a first-person account written by John Mark. He claims to have left the apostles in Perga (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">Acts 13:13</a>) so he could sail to the West but was prevented. When he tried to rejoin them in Antioch, Paul prohibited him. Consequently, after some dispute, John Mark and Barnabas sailed for Cyprus. After preaching and healing many people, Barnabas encountered his old adversary, Bar-Jesus, who finally stirred up the Jews to capture him. Leading Barnabas out of the city of Salamis, they circled around him and burned him alive. John Mark and some other believers escaped with his ashes and buried them in a cave along with scriptures Barnabas had received from Matthew. John Mark then left for Alexandria to minister there.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BarnabasEpistleof">Barnabas, Epistle of</p>
<p class="fl">This anonymous letter addresses a question commonly asked throughout the early church: What should Christianity’s relationship be to Judaism? Clement of Alexandria quoted from this document frequently and ascribed it to “Barnabas, who himself also preached with the apostle [Paul].” Jerome believed the same. But the writer does not claim to be Barnabas, and the earliest claims of authorship come only from Alexandrian church leaders. The literary and interpretive style is entirely Alexandrian, so it is assumed that the epistle was written in Alexandria.</p>
<p>The author of this epistle unequivocally denies any connection between Judaism and the gospel of Jesus Christ. At the same time, he does not say that the OT opposes the NT; rather, he sees Christianity everywhere in the Law and the Prophets. He holds that all the Judaistic rites and ceremonies are mystical pointers to Christ and that an evil angel has blinded the Jews from understanding this.</p>
<p>The epistle mentions the destruction of Jerusalem, so it was not written before <span class="era">AD</span> 70. There was a second devastation of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 132 that ended the revolt of Bar-Kochba. This defeat would have served the author’s purposes so well that he would surely have referred to it if he were writing after the event. Many scholars suggest that the letter was composed around 130, since this was a period of strong Jewish nationalism. This nationalism would have pressured many Jewish Christians to return to Judaism, and so the author of the Epistle of Barnabas wrote to defend Christianity against Judaism.</p>
<p>The Epistle of Barnabas is composed of two parts. The first section (chs 1–17) contains allegorical interpretations of the OT. These highly spiritual and mystical interpretations are intended to oppose Jewish legalism and explain how the OT prophesied of Jesus Christ. The author concedes that righteous people, such as Moses, David, and the prophets, understood the true meaning of Mosaic law, but he contends that the rest of the nation of Israel had misconstrued God’s covenant. Therefore, the Jews lost their claim to the covenant’s blessings, which were transferred to the Christians instead. This allegorical style of interpretation was very popular among Alexandrian church leaders. The NT epistle of Hebrews also makes use of this type of interpretation. The author of the Epistle of Barnabas often quotes from the Septuagint, though the quotes are somewhat loosely recited.</p>
<p>A Latin version of the first section was all that was known of the Epistle of Barnabas until the discovery of Codex Sinaiticus in 1859. This codex contained the first known Greek version of the Epistle of Barnabas, which was appended to the books of the NT along with The Shepherd and the Didache. The Greek version contains a second section that begins, “Now let us pass on to quite a different sort of instruction.” This section contains moral precepts that contrast the way of darkness with the way of light, much of which seems to be transcribed from the “Two Ways” of the Didache. It has little connection with the first section. This has led many scholars to conclude that the second section was added by another writer at some later date.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BarnabasGospelof">Barnabas, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">Long Italian work actually written in the fourth century by a proselyte to Islam. He probably sought to capitalize on the mysterious mention of such a gospel in the Gelasian Decree, written not later than the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>. To date, no other evidence of an authentic gospel by Barnabas has been uncovered, a fact that has led many scholars to doubt whether it ever existed.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BartholomewActsof">Bartholomew, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">Early Christian novel purporting to describe the last days and death of the apostle Bartholomew. The work is also known as The Martyrdom of the Holy and Glorious Apostle Bartholomew. It may date back to the fifth or sixth century <span class="era">AD</span> and was evidently well received, for copies exist in Latin, Greek, Armenian, and Ethiopic.</p>
<p>In the Acts, Bartholomew goes to India, takes up residence in a pagan temple, and causes its false oracle to cease. Bartholomew then heals a demoniac, thus drawing the attention of King Polymius. Bartholomew also heals the king’s demon-possessed daughter. Next, he casts the false god out of the temple. After this display of power, many believe the gospel. The king’s brother, however, is enraged and has Bartholomew beaten and beheaded. His rash action is soon punished, for he is strangled to death by a demon. The good King Polymius becomes bishop and serves 20 years.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BartholomewApocalypseof">Bartholomew, Apocalypse of</p>
<p class="fl">Fragmentary Coptic texts that have some similarities to the apocryphal Gospel of Bartholomew. A few scholars have felt that two works were represented in these fragments, a gospel and also an apocalypse. Though this hypothesis has been generally abandoned, references to the debatable Apocalypse of Bartholomew still appear.</p>

<p class="h3" id="BartholomewBookoftheResurrectionofChristby">Bartholomew, Book of the Resurrection of Christ by</p>
<p class="fl">Apocryphal work existing only in Coptic and probably dating from the fifth or sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>. Like many similar writings of doubtful authenticity, it claims to supplement the accounts of Jesus found in the biblical Gospels. The book was supposedly addressed by Bartholomew to his son, Thaddaeus, who was warned in it not to let this book “come into the hand of any man who is an unbeliever and a heretic.” The book can hardly be regarded as a narrative; its aim is obviously the glorification of Bartholomew, who sees things that are hidden from others. The text contains many breaks; contradictions abound and a disregard of history is evident. Two different persons bury the body of Jesus: Joseph and Philogenes, father of a boy healed by Jesus. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is confused with Mary Magdalene. In the account of the Last Supper the author goes far beyond biblical statements about the bread and wine: “His Body was on the Table about which they were assembled; and they divided it. They saw the blood of Jesus pouring out as living blood down into the cup.” Imaginative details also embellish the account of the resurrection. Christ, for example, brings Adam back with him from hades. The story of doubting Thomas has been greatly amplified.</p>
<p>The most complete text of the Book of the Resurrection is in the British Museum in London. Several other fragments exist, probably from an earlier version.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BartholomewGospelOf">Bartholomew, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">One of many apocryphal gospels appearing after the second century under the name of some illustrious figure. The early church was aware not only of the existence of these writings but also of their fictitious character. In the fourth century the church historian Eusebius described them as heretical, spurious, absurd, and impious. Later a Gospel of Bartholomew was mentioned by name, along with several other Gnostic gospels, in the prologue of Jerome’s commentary on Matthew’s Gospel. However, there is no evidence that Jerome had seen such a book or that it actually existed.</p>
<p>A work called Questions of Bartholomew does exist in Greek, Latin, and Slavonic texts—the Greek dating possibly from the fifth or sixth century. Its text has Bartholomew asking Jesus where he went after the Crucifixion and Jesus telling him that he went into hades. Later Bartholomew is pictured as asking Mary to tell how she conceived the incomprehensible or bore him that cannot be carried. Mary warns him that if she began to tell them, fire would come forth from her mouth and consume all the world, but the apostle persists. As she tells the story of the angelic visitation and the Annunciation, fire comes from her mouth. The world is about to come to an end, but Jesus intervenes and places his hand over Mary’s mouth. The apostles also ask to see the bottomless pit and “the things which are in the heavens.” Bartholomew is shown the adversary of men, Beliar, restrained by 660 angels and bound with fiery chains. When Bartholomew treads upon his neck, Beliar explains that he had first been called Satanael and later Satan, describes the creation of the angels, and tells how he fell and how he was able to deceive Eve. Finally, Bartholomew is said to have asked Jesus about the greatest sin. Jesus replies that to say anything evil against a faithful worshiper of God is to sin against the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BaruchApocalypseof">Baruch, Apocalypse of</p>
<p class="fl">Two different pseudepigraphal works.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Pseudepigraphal Jewish document of 87 chapters, written in Hebrew and translated into Greek and from Greek into Syriac. Only a few lines of the Hebrew original still exist, quoted in rabbinic writings. The Syriac manuscript dates from the sixth or seventh century AD and is the only complete text. It shows evidence of multiple authorship and dependence on the book of 2 Esdras in the Apocrypha. Similarity of many expressions to those in the NT suggests that the original may have been composed in the last half of the first century or the first half of the second century.</p>
<p class="list-text">The text is in seven sections of unequal length containing both prose and poetic material. The subjects dealt with are the Messiah and his future kingdom, Israel’s past woes, and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. Theological questions such as sin and suffering, free will, the number of people to be saved by the Messiah, and the resurrection of the righteous are not always treated consistently within the text. Some passages paint an optimistic picture of Israel’s future; others are deeply pessimistic. In general the world is a scene of corruption for which no remedy exists. A new and spiritual world is at hand: “Whatever is now is nothing, but that which shall be is very great. For everything that is corruptible shall pass away, and everything that dies shall depart and all the present time, which is defiled with evils.” The alternating optimism and pessimism may reflect the changing fortunes of Judaism in the first and second centuries <span class="era">AD</span> or simply the outlook of the different authors. The message of hope is directed to those who keep the law of Moses: “For the righteous justly hope for the end, and without fear depart from this habitation, because they have with Thee a store of works preserved in treasuries.”</p>
<p class="list-text">The final section of the book is identified as “the epistle which Baruch, the son of Neriah, sent to the nine and a half tribes.” It was sent by being “bound to the neck of the eagle,” probably meaning that it was intended for the Jews scattered outside Palestine (the Diaspora).</p>
<p class="list-text">Baruch was the prophet Jeremiah’s companion and secretary (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.4-8">Jer 36:4-8</a>). His name was attached to a number of apocryphal and pseudepigraphal writings composed long after his death. The Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch is also called 2 Baruch to distinguish it clearly from the book of Baruch (1 Baruch) in the Apocrypha.</p>
<p class="list">2. Pseudepigraphal document of 17 chapters, also called the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch or 3 Baruch. It is preserved in Greek, Ethiopic, Armenian, and Slavonic manuscripts. It was first published in Venice in 1609 and then in 1868, although its existence was suggested by the early Christian theologian Origen. Like 2 Baruch, this apocalypse seems to be a composite document of the second century <span class="era">AD</span> but in contrast is a Christian document intended to warn unconverted Jews and to encourage Christians to be patient in dealing with them.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BasilidesGospelof">Basilides, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">Polemic commentary on the Gospels by a second-century Gnostic. Basilides’s writings remain only as allusions and fragments in later works by several church fathers. Basilides taught in Alexandria during the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian (<span class="era">AD</span> 117–138). His teacher, Glaucias, claimed to be a firsthand interpreter of the apostle Peter. Basilides asserted that his Gnostic scheme emerged from Peter’s views on the relationship between God and Christ. He described God paradoxically as a nonexistent Being who “generated” three Sonships. Through successive ascents and enlightenments, the gospel of the supreme God (the Gospel of Light) eventually descended upon Jesus.</p>
<p>Origen stated that “Basilides dared to write a gospel According to Basilides.” Clement of Alexandria and the writer of a fourth-century fragment, Acta Archelai, thought that Origen referred to an apocryphal gospel, the teaching of which was deduced from Irenaeus’s account. Today, more in line with Hippolytus’s understanding of Basilides, this work is regarded as merely a commentary on the Gospels. Basilides was probably not responsible for the magical rites and libertinism of the Basilidians, a Gnostic sect led by his son Isidore and continuing in Egypt to the end of the century.</p>

<p class="h3" id="BirthofMary">Birth of Mary</p>
<p class="fl">An early Gnostic writing. “The Gnostics have a book which they call the Birth (or Descent) of Mary, in which are horrible and deadly things.” So said the fourth-century bishop Ephiphanius in describing the Birth of Mary, a work that has not survived. The Birth of Mary claimed to reveal what Zechariah, father of John the Baptist, saw in the temple—namely, the Jewish god in the form of an ass. That Jews and Christians worshiped an ass-god was commonly held by their critics in those days. This blasphemous work should not be confused with the Gospel of the Birth of Mary, a fanciful but relatively harmless account of Mary’s birth, early life, and marriage to Joseph.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="GospelOfMary"/>
<p class="h3" id="BirthofMaryGospelofthe">Birth of Mary, Gospel of the</p>
<p class="fl">Collection of legends purporting to tell Mary’s story from birth to King Herod’s slaughter of the children in Bethlehem. The earliest such manuscript is called Book of the Nativity of Mary or Gospel of James because it claimed to be written by James, half brother of Jesus. It was written by <span class="era">AD</span> 150, since Justin, an early Christian writer, named it in his <span class="ital">Dialogues</span> (165). It was rediscovered for the West by Postel, who translated it from Greek into Latin (<span class="ital">Protevangelium Jacobi,</span> 1552). Before it was lost, two major Latin revisions of it had been produced: Pseudo-Matthew and the Gospel of the Nativity of Mary, compiled around the sixth and ninth centuries respectively. These revisions amplified the Book of the Nativity of Mary with more fanciful legends and were the basis for the Golden Legends of James of Voragine (1230–1298), which in turn became instrumental in fostering veneration of Mary.</p>
<p>According to the Book of the Nativity of Mary, Mary is born to rich, barren parents (Joachim and Anna) through angelic response to their prayers. They dedicate Mary to the Lord. At six months Mary walks seven steps, so Anna makes her bedroom a sanctuary, allowing nothing unclean to enter, and vows that Mary will walk again only in the temple. At age three Mary is placed in the temple and receives food from an angel. On Mary’s twelfth birthday the high priest asks God what to do and is told to marry her to a widower. Elderly Joseph is chosen when a dove springs from his rod. Months later, Mary “gives birth” to Jesus in Bethlehem’s cave, through a light so bright that none can see; the light gradually withdraws and the Child appears at Mary’s breast. The Book of the Nativity of Mary closes with the magi and Herod’s slaughter of infants. Mary saves Jesus by wrapping him in swaddling clothes and laying him in a manger.</p>
<p>Recently another Greek fragment, this one from the Gospel of Mary, was found (see photo). The fragment is too little to tell us much about the content of this gospel.</p>
<p class="h3" id="BookoftheCock">Book of the Cock</p>
<p class="fl">Apocryphal story preserved by the church of Ethiopia and still read there on the Thursday before Easter. According to the Book of the Cock, on the night of the Last Supper, Akrosina, wife of Simon the Pharisee, presents Jesus with a nicely prepared cock for dinner. After Judas leaves the room, Jesus touches the cock and it comes to life. He instructs it to follow Judas and to report his dealings. The cock returns and tells about the forthcoming betrayal, mentioning Paul of Tarsus as one of those involved. The disciples weep. Jesus sends the cock to the sky for a thousand years.</p>
<p>A similar story exists as a fragment in Sahidic Coptic. In the Coptic version the resurrection of the cock is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ.</p>

<p class="h3" id="CorinthiansThird">Corinthians, Third</p>
<p class="fl">Apocryphal correspondence purporting to be between the apostle Paul and the Corinthian church. Written during the second century and known as 3 Corinthians, the work consists of three parts: an epistle allegedly from Stephanus of Corinth to Paul concerning two false apostles, Simon and Cleobius; a brief narrative telling of its delivery; and Paul’s reply and refutation of the false doctrine. The sequence of letters was originally part of the Acts of Paul, a longer apocryphal document, but circulated on its own as well—it even found its way into the text of the Armenian Bible. It pretends to explain the reference in <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.4">2 Corinthians 2:4</a> to a letter written in great distress.</p>
<p>According to an early church father, Tertullian <span class="ital">(On Baptism),</span> the author of 3 Corinthians was a presbyter (church leader) of Asia who forged it out of love for Paul shortly after <span class="era">AD</span> 160.

The Doctrina Addaei tells a story about the contacts between Abgar (Abgarus), king of Edessa, and Jesus Christ. King Abgar, suffering from an unspecified ailment, is said to have sent a messenger to Jesus bearing the king’s written request for healing along with an offer of sanctuary for Jesus in his kingdom. Jesus responds orally, promising to send one of his followers to Abgar after his own ascension to heaven. Abgar’s envoy also takes back a self-portrait of Jesus that becomes the pride of Edessa.

<p class="fl">Gospel quoted by one early Christian writer, Epiphanius (fourth century), in a work against heresies. The Gospel of the Ebionites is possibly the same as the apocryphal Gospel of the Hebrews, although some scholars associate it with the Gospel of the Nazarenes. The Ebionites were vegetarians; Epiphanius’s citations stress the vegetarian diets of John the Baptist and Jesus.</p>
<p class="h3" id="EgyptiansGospelofthe">Egyptians, Gospel of the</p>
<p class="fl">Two apocryphal works with the same name.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Apocryphal second-century <span class="era">AD</span> Greek writing, mentioned by the early church writers, Clement and Origen. Used in Egypt, the composition seems to have contained and propagated Gnostic teachings, especially those advocated in Syria by Simon and Menander. According to these Gnostics, marriage, eating meat, and procreation were evil. Clement may have quoted from this writing to refute the beliefs of the Encratites, who broadly agreed with the Syrian Gnostics on those matters. The Gnostics’ depreciation of women was reflected in the quotations Clement used.</p>
<p class="list">2. Composition discovered in 1946 at Chenoboskion (Egypt) in the Nag Hammadi collection of Gnostic writing. The principal title of the work, described in the colophon as “Gospel of the Egyptians” was “Sacred Book of the Great Invisible Spirit.” This work dealt with emanations from “the primal spirit of the cosmos” and perhaps was a product of the Barbelo Gnostic sect.</p>
<p class="h3" id="EldadandMedadBookof">Eldad and Medad, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Pre-Christian pseudepigraphic composition containing the alleged prophecies of Eldad and Medad, two persons appointed as elders by Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.11.26">Nm 11:26</a>). Since the nature of their prophecy was not specified, it gave rise to a lost work that is quoted in the Shepherd of Hermas as follows: “The Lord is near to them who return to Him, as it is written in Eldad and Medad who prophesied to the people in the wilderness” (Vision II, ch 3). That is the only source of information concerning the lost book.</p>
<p class="h3" id="EugnostosLetterof">Eugnostos, Letter of</p>
<p class="fl">Gnostic work. Found near the modern city of Nag Hammadi, the Letter of Eugnostos was written in Coptic by a teacher to his disciple. Both author and date of composition are unknown. An early example of non-Christian Gnostic writing, it perhaps served as the basis for a Christian Gnostic composition, “The Wisdom of Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>The Letter of Eugnostos attempts to prove the existence of an invisible spiritual realm. It also stresses God’s remoteness from humanity.</p>
<p class="h3" id="EveGospelof">Eve, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">Gnostic and apocalyptic writings, known solely through a citation by Epiphanius, a late fourth-century metropolitan of Cyprus. Epiphanius quoted the Gospel of Eve in a biting refutation of Gnostic and Origenistic teachings. Evidently a cult had formed around Eve as if her name implied revelation because the serpent had spoken to her in the Garden of Eden. Epiphanius’s quotation from the Gospel of Eve roughly translates: “I stood on a high mountain and saw a giant and a feeble man, and I heard a voice like thunder. ‘Come near me and listen,’ and he spoke to me saying, ‘I am you and you are me. Wherever you are, there I am. I am spread through all things, and any place you are able to retire into or take shelter in me; and, taking shelter in me, you take shelter in yourself.’ ”</p>
<p class="h3" id="EzekielApocryphal">Ezekiel, Apocryphal</p>
<p class="fl">Noncanonical book of Ezekiel mentioned by Josephus, first-century Jewish historian. An apocryphal Ezekiel is cited in five early Christian writings and a recent archaeological discovery. Bishop Epiphanius (fourth century) cited an Ezekiel parable, in proof of the resurrection of the interdependent soul and body, about a blind man and a lame man collaborating to rob an orchard. Clement of Rome, writing to the Corinthians (AD 90?), and Clement of Alexandria in two of his writings (<span class="era">AD</span> 200?) have noncanonical Ezekiel quotations. An Ezekiel apocryphon is mentioned in the pseudo-Athanasian canon (purporting to list canonical books of the Bible) and is named in the stichometry (prose written in rhythmic phrases) of Nicephorus, Patriarch of Constantinople (<span class="era">AD</span> 806–815). In 1940 Campbell Bonner published Greek papyrus fragments that confirm the existence of an apocryphal Ezekiel.</p>

<p class="h3" id="GenesisApocryphon">Genesis Apocryphon</p>
<p class="fl">Name given to one of the seven large Dead Sea Scrolls recovered from the first Qumran cave in 1947. With three others it came into the possession of the Syrian archbishop of Jerusalem but could not be unrolled and photographed because it was badly preserved, having not been kept in an earthen jar like the others. Some small pieces were detached, however, and certain words on them indicated that it might be an apocryphal Aramaic work connected with the patriarch Enoch. Further scraps spoke of Lamech, however, thus the scroll was tentatively named for that ancient person.</p>
<p>Eventually it was unrolled and found to be not only damaged but incomplete; the beginning and the end were missing. The inner portion had been best preserved, but considerable damage had been done to the text by the ink it had been written with. The scroll not only dealt with Enoch and Lamech but with other persons mentioned in the book of Genesis. It proved to be an Aramaic form of parts of Genesis dealing with the patriarchs, but it included legends and other materials presented in memoir style, not found in the Hebrew Bible. That style was popular among pious Jews at the beginning of the Christian era, thus its original has been dated to the first century <span class="era">BC</span>. The Qumran copy was probably made between 50 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>The literary characteristics of the scroll have presented some classification problems. Free expansion and inclusion of nonbiblical material led certain scholars to call the scroll a “targum” or commentary-expansion of the Genesis text. Others have regarded it as a “midrash” or sermonic account of the Hebrew narrative. The scroll contains both elements and is best regarded as an independent recounting of certain Genesis stories, enriched by the inclusion of imaginative material such as a description of the beauty of the patriarch Abraham’s wife Sarah; dreams; and accounts of plagues and journeys.</p>
<p>The Aramaic Apocryphon somewhat antedates the one used in Palestine in the time of Christ. It contains some Hebraisms but is mostly written in good Aramaic, much of which parallels biblical Aramaic. The language of the scroll, however, is later than the period of old Aramaic (tenth to eighth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>) or official Aramaic (Assyrian and Persian periods), as the presence of certain grammatical forms indicate. Most scholars have described the language as middle Aramaic and have placed it between the Aramaic of Daniel and later western Aramaic. Those scholars generally assign a second-century <span class="era">BC</span> date to Daniel, but that conclusion needs to be modified because the Qumran material shows that no canonical work was composed later than about 350 <span class="era">BC</span>. On any evidence, the Aramaic of Daniel is earlier than that of the Apocryphon and seems to fit properly into the period when official Aramaic was the dominant form of the language. The Genesis Apocryphon presents no valid reasons for dating the Aramaic of Daniel or Ezra later than the sixth to fifth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="fl">Pseudepigraphal apocalyptic work widely known to the early Christians; also known as the Martyrdom of Isaiah, the Testament of Hezekiah, and the Vision of Isaiah. It was rediscovered when an Ethiopic version of part of the text was published in 1819. The full Ethiopic version is the only complete version in existence. A partial Latin text published in 1832 had actually been published in Venice over three centuries before. Slavonic and Coptic versions also exist. All may be traced back to two Greek versions of the third, fifth, and sixth centuries.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the original was a single composition or even whether the authorship was Christian or Jewish with later Christian editing. The final form may date from the latter part of the second century. It was known to Ambrose, Jerome, Origen, Tertullian, and possibly to Justyn Martyr. The contents fall under three heads:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The Martyrdom of Isaiah. This material consists of prophetic utterances, including the prophet’s prediction of his own death at the hands of King Manasseh of Judah. The document deals with the dark apostasy of the king, who, indwelt by Satan and following Beliar, leads his people into all manner of sin. Jerusalem, whose fall is prophesied, is called “Sodom” and its princes “Gomorrah.” In the form of a midrash (devotional sermon), this section dwells on Isaiah’s firm rejection of compromise or recantation. Isaiah’s martyrdom by being “sawn in two” is the portion with which the church fathers seem to have been familiar.</p>
<p class="list">2. The Testament of Hezekiah. This section is apocalyptic, a vision Isaiah passes on to his king. It speaks of the descent of “the Beloved,” a title used in this document for the Messiah. The vision covers the Messiah’s incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension, then turns to the early history of the church and the apostasy that precedes the second coming of the Lord. The Antichrist is revealed as Beliar or Satan, who assumes human form and kills his mother (no doubt directed at the Roman emperor Nero, who murdered his mother, Agrippina). The whole section is based on Daniel and the biblical Apocalypse and was also influenced by Gnosticism. The conclusion of the vision (the Beloved’s victory, the two resurrections, and the final judgment) very closely parallels the consummation of all things in the NT book of Revelation.</p>
<p class="list">3. The Vision of Isaiah. This section resembles #2 even linguistically but shows more Gnostic influence: Isaiah is lifted to the dwelling place of the Trinity, the seventh heaven, and shown many mysteries of Christ. Because of this vision Manasseh kills the prophet. Gnostic doctrine, as propagated by Cerinthus at the end of the first century, is evident. Jesus, earthly born, becomes the host of the Christ, who leaves his earthly tenement at the Crucifixion.</p>
<p class="sp">Historically, the value of the Ascension of Isaiah is to show the welter of conflicting opinion which, claiming authority and inspiration, besieged the minds of the early Christians.</p>

<p class="h3" id="JamesApocalypseof">James, Apocalypse of</p>
<p class="fl">There were two Gnostic apocalypses of James (designated “first” and “second”). The first, covering over 20 pages of text, purports to be a revelation given by the Lord, some of it before the Crucifixion and some after it, to James, his brother, who was also know as James the righteous. The two documents referred to as the Apocalypse of James are in Codex V of the Nag Hammadi literature discovered in 1945 in Egypt just west of the Nile River opposite the city of Chenoboskion and are distinct from the Apocryphon of James, which is included in NT apocryphal writings. The second apocalypse composed of 20 pages of Coptic text is purportedly a speech delivered by James the Just on the fifth step of the temple and contains many references to or echoes of canonical Scriptures. The work ends with the multitude casting James down from the temple and stoning him in a manner reminiscent of the martyrdom of Stephen.</p>
<p class="h3" id="JamesAscentsof">James, Ascents of</p>
<p class="fl">Lost book mentioned only by Epiphanius (bishop of the Greek island of Salamis) in his fourth-century work <span class="ital">Refutation of All the Heresies.</span> According to Epiphanius, the Ascents of James was used by the Ebionites, a rigidly ascetic sect of Jewish Christians. The book represented James, Jesus’ brother, as having spoken against the temple and sacrifices. It declared the apostle Paul to be a Greek who went to Jerusalem, sought to marry the high priest’s daughter, and to that end became a proselyte and was circumcised. When he did not win the young woman, he inveighed against the Sabbath, the Law, and circumcision.</p>
<p>In a commentary on Galatians (1865), J. B. Lightfoot suggested that the book’s title referred to James’s ascents up the temple steps, from which he addressed the people. Lightfoot also suggested that James’s death was the grand climax of the ascents. According to a quote from the early Christian writer Hegesippus (as recorded in Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span>), James was cast down to his death from the pinnacle of the temple.</p>
<p class="h3" id="JamesProtevangeliumof">James, Protevangelium of</p>
<p class="fl">This is an apocryphal “gospel” that tells of the token marriage and pregnancy of Mary and of Jesus’ birth, childhood, and adolescent years. This apocryphal writing was discovered in the 16th century by Guillaume Postel.</p>
<p class="h3" id="JobTestamentof">Job, Testament of</p>
<p class="fl">Apocalyptic literature bearing resemblance to the biblical book of Job. The book was probably written in Greek in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. Since it is devoid of Christian thought, it was likely written by a Jew.</p>
<p>In chapters 1–45, Job is the speaker. He comes to understand that a nearby temple has been desecrated by there having been offered in it sacrifices to Satan. When Job destroys it, Satan threatens him. Job’s friends come to console him but their speeches are greatly abbreviated. Elihu is represented as Satan’s mouthpiece and earns God’s displeasure. But Job sacrifices for all three friends. He remarries and has seven sons and three daughters, who inherit his wealth. Chapters 46–51, in which Job’s brother is the speaker, conclude the narrative.</p>
<p class="h3" id="JohntheBaptistLifeof">John the Baptist, Life of</p>
<p class="fl">A legendary account supposedly written by Serapion dealing with the early life of John the Baptist and especially with the death of his mother, Elizabeth. While Jesus was living with his parents in Egypt, Elizabeth dies on the same day as Herod the Great dies. John, who is but a small boy, does not know how to bury her. The clouds bring Jesus, Mary, and Salome who wash the body. The grave is dug by Michael and Gabriel, who also bring the souls of Zacharias and Simeon. John is then left to grow up in the desert under the care of the angels, while the clouds lift Jesus and Mary to Nazareth where they live.</p>
<p class="h3" id="JohntheEvangelistBookof">John the Evangelist, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">This writing was used most extensively by the Albigenses and was commonly regarded as stemming from the Bogomiles before them. It was written in the form of questions and answers propounded to have come from the apostle John while he leaned upon the breast of Jesus at the Last Supper. This pattern of questions and answers is found in other early Gnostic writings, especially the Gospel of Bartholomew.</p>
<p>The writing contains Gnostic theology. It portrays a world created by Satan and not by God. Christ was not born of Mary but was an angel sent forth to the earth. He “entered in by the ear and came forth by the ear” of Mary. John the Baptist was sent by Satan, and his disciples (the Roman Catholic Church) are not the disciples of Christ. Baptism and apparently the Lord’s Supper are valueless.</p>
<p>The writing is preserved only in Latin and in its present form is not earlier than the 12th century. A convenient English translation may be found in M. R. James, <span class="ital">The Apocryphal NT</span> (1924).</p>
<p class="h3" id="JosephPrayerof">Joseph, Prayer of</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish apocalyptic work. The Prayer of Joseph won the commendation of Origen, an early church scholar, as a document “not to be despised.” Origen’s quotations provide almost the only surviving information about the work, so that its total content and significance are unclear. An ancient list of OT apocryphal and canonical writings puts the Prayer of Joseph third and mentions its length as 1,100 verses. Origen’s quotations concern mainly Joseph’s father, Jacob. Jacob exists in the form of an angel, bearing Jacob’s given name Israel. He is the speaker in the quoted fragments and foretells the fate of humankind. He describes how he met Uriel on a journey to Mesopotamia and how Uriel wrestled with him, claiming to be the greatest of the angels. The apocalyptic poet had in mind the story of Jacob’s mysterious wrestling at Jabbok (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.22-29">Gn 32:22-29</a>) and passages such as <a href="?bref=Dan.10.13">Daniel 10:13</a>. Because Jacob claims to be “the first born of all living beings” and therefore the chief of all angels, Uriel challenges him.</p>

<p class="h3" id="JosephtheCarpenterHistoryof">Joseph the Carpenter, History of</p>
<p class="fl">Document glorifying Jesus’ earthly father and promoting a cult of Joseph. Words in chapter 18 of the History of Joseph support a fourth-century date for it. There Jesus tells his mother, “You, too, must look for the same end of life as other mortals.” By the fifth century the doctrine of the “Assumption of the Virgin” was widely held.</p>
<p>The document, derived from the Protevangelium of James, was contaminated by both Gnosticism and other religious beliefs of Egypt, the country in which it was written. It is extant in Coptic and Arabic and also in a fourth-century translation of the Coptic text.</p>
<p>The History of Joseph the Carpenter claims to give an account of Joseph’s life and his model death at the age of 111. The story is allegedly told by Jesus to his disciples on the Mt of Olives. Joseph, a carpenter (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>), is a widower well advanced in years when he marries Mary, who is only 12. (He had six children by an earlier marriage.) Joseph is buried according to the rites of the Egyptian Osiris cult after Jesus pronounces a eulogy.</p>
<p class="h3" id="JubileesBookof">Jubilees, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Jubilees is a pseudepigraphal work from the last half of the second century <span class="era">BC</span> during the Maccabean period. It is an invaluable source for understanding the environment in the age prior to the launching of the Christian church. Jubilees stands with the Book of Enoch and the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs as the most important Hebrew or Aramaic literature of the time. Like these it was translated into Greek and used by the church fathers. Most probably, Jubilees was written in Hebrew since it purported a Mosaic authorship and since its nationalistic Maccabean environment would demand it. Fragments of 10 manuscripts in Hebrew found at Qumran support the thesis that it was originally in that language.</p>
<p>The work is referred to by later Greek writers following Hebrew sources as “Jubilees” and “the little (lesser) Genesis.” It is also entitled “The Apocalypse of Moses” and the “Testament of Moses.” In revised forms it has been called “The Book of Adam’s Daughters” and “The Life of Adam.”</p>
<p>Complete, fifty-chapter manuscripts exist in six Ethiopian texts of which the texts of the fifth and sixth centuries are best. The Latin text is valuable but partial and only a few fragments of the Greek version remain. The Hebrew fragments found at Qumran are of special importance since they are from the period of original writing. The Bibliotheque Nationale has “Ethiopien 51” and “Ethiopien 160.” The British Museum has <span class="ital">Kufale,</span> or <span class="ital">Liber Jubilaeorum,</span> and <span class="ital">Enoch</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>The author of Jubilees claims a direct revelational source for the teaching that he espouses. God had spoken to Moses in the Pentateuch in the “lesser law” in this “little book of Genesis.” At Sinai God communicated to Moses by the “Angel of the Presence” saying to the angel, “Write for Moses from the beginning of creation until my sanctuary has been built among them for all eternity” (1:27). This is supplementary to the “first law” (6:22).</p>
<p>Following a brief introduction Jubilees follows the text of Genesis and Exodus to 14:31. This midrashic treatment of the Pentateuchal material attempts to show that the patriarchy adhered to the law even prior to Moses. The author’s aim is to strengthen classical Judaism in the face of the serious intrusions of Hellenistic culture among Jewish peoples. In doing this the author does not hesitate in adding and subtracting from Pentateuchal history. The patriarchs are adorned in every way. Anything that showed their weaknesses and sins was removed and legendary content inserted to glorify these fathers. The patriarchs are the fountainheads of culture. Enoch invented writing; Noah, medicine; Abraham, plowing.</p>
<p>Appealing to <a href="?bref=Lev.25.8-12">Leviticus 25:8-12</a>, the work emphasizes the importance of the number seven. History from Adam to Moses is arranged according to cycles of seven. This manner of compartmentalizing history into jubilee periods was revealed to Moses at Sinai and so has divine sanction and in fact is mandated. The philosophy of history that springs from this sees God acting sovereignly and uniquely in Israel in distinction to his relationship with the gentile world. The other nations are ruled by angels but not Israel, which is directly in God’s charge (Jubilees 15:31ff.).</p>
<p>The polemic that Jubilees mounts against the lunar calendar (6:36-38) and its acceptance of the solar calendar is but another facet of the drive for a deep reform that will cleanse Israel. Israel is to be separated to God in every way with no intermingling in marriage or sitting at the table with Gentiles. There is a surprising stringency demanded in Sabbath keeping (50:1-13). The penalty of death is levied against those who travel, buy or sell, draw water, bear burdens, snare creatures, or have marital relations on the Sabbath. These go far beyond the biblical requirements and belong to that milieu that produced the Qumran community and the Essenes.</p>
<p>The apocalyptic declaration of the Angel of Presence contains a clear but limited eschatological truth. Jubilees does contain the expectation of an immediate establishment of the messianic age. The entire emphasis, however, is such that ethical and cultural purposes are preeminent.</p>

<p class="h3" id="JudasIscariotGospelof">Judas Iscariot, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">Very old Gnostic writing probably produced by the Cainite sect. As it is not preserved for us today, we know it only through quotations in the writings of early Christians, especially Irenaeus. Thus, it must have been written before the middle of the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. It probably contained a body of secret doctrine purportedly revealed by Judas Iscariot, summarizing the truth of superior and perfect knowledge supposedly revealed to this sect of the Gnostics. The gospel sets forth the “mystery of the betrayal,” explaining how Judas through his treachery made the salvation of all mankind possible. This was accomplished by his forestalling the destruction of the truth proclaimed by Christ or by his thwarting the designs of the evil powers, the Archons, who wished to prevent the crucifixion of Christ because they knew it would destroy their evil power.</p>
<p class="h3" id="LentulusEpistleof">Lentulus, Epistle of</p>
<p class="fl">Lentulus, ostensibly a predecessor of Pontius Pilate, is said to have prepared a report to the Roman Senate known as the Letter (or Epistle) of Lentulus. In it he included a detailed description of Jesus: “tall and handsome, his countenance inspiring reverence along with love and fear, his hair dark, shining, curling, parted in the middle, his face with a delicate rudiness. . . .” The authenticity of the letter is extremely doubtful.</p>

<p class="h3" id="LivesofAdamandEve">Lives of Adam and Eve</p>
<p class="fl">A general title given to a noncanonical writing extant in Greek and Latin. The book is Jewish in nature, though there is a Christian flavor that causes most scholars to date the original work to the beginning of the Christian era. The content of the book is an expansion on the biblical story of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>The Greek version begins with the expulsion from Eden. In a dream, Eve sees the murder of Abel. After Adam had fallen ill Seth and Eve went to obtain oil from the tree of life. Michael the archangel met Seth and told him that Adam would die. Upon his death, he was ultimately taken to the third heaven. Seth witnessed how the angels interred his father and received instructions on how to bury his mother, who died a week after Adam.</p>
<p>The Latin version gives additional information. After the expulsion from the Garden, Eve asked Adam to kill her but instead of that he suggested they both do an act of penitence. Adam went to stand in the Jordan for 40 days and Eve went to stand in the water of the Euphrates for 37 days. While there, she was again tempted by Satan, who was disguised as an angel of light but was eventually exposed by Adam. Satan now explained the reason for his hostility toward them: when the angels were commanded to worship the Lord, he refused to do obeisance to God and was consequently cast out of heaven.</p>
<p class="h3" id="MatthewMartyrdomof">Matthew, Martyrdom of</p>
<p class="fl">Loosely organized tale of Matthew’s martyrdom that borrows heavily from the “Acts of Andrew and Matthias” and assumes that Matthias was in fact Matthew. The document represents the low literary and theological impulse of the later apocryphal texts.</p>
<p>The story begins when Matthew is commissioned by Jesus to plant a staff in Myrna, the city of man-eaters. Matthew does so, after exorcising the demon Asmodeus from the king’s wife and family. The staff becomes a tree overnight, Matthew preaches to the people, and they “become humanized.” But Asmodeus seeks revenge by directing the king to burn Matthew. The fire consumes golden idols and many soldiers, then turns into a dragon and chases the king, who begs Matthew for help. But Matthew dies.</p>
<p>A somewhat repentant but not yet converted king places the body of Matthew in an iron casket and sinks it secretly in the sea. The next day Matthew appears on the sea in the presence of two shining men and a “beautiful” child. The king is finally converted, baptized, and accepted into the church. Matthew appears to confer on the king his own name and to ordain him a priest and his family, deacons and deaconesses. Then Matthew ascends to heaven with two angels.</p>

<p class="h3" id="MosesAssumptionof">Moses, Assumption of</p>
<p class="fl">A Jewish legend that Moses was taken bodily into heaven without dying. Probably written between <span class="era">AD</span> 7 and 30, it may be a combination of two earlier works, and appears to borrow heavily from the book of Deuteronomy. The work was likely produced to provide a miraculous ending to Moses’ outstanding earthly life, attributing to him an experience similar to Elijah’s. But this Jewish legend is contrary to the OT account of Moses’ death (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.48-50">Dt 32:48-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.34.5-7">34:5-7</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Lost Assumption of Moses</p>
<p class="fl">Three facts indicate that there once was an apocryphal book that contained the legend of the assumption of Moses: (1) early lists of apocryphal works mention a work by this title; (2) several church fathers refer to it; and (3) a few fragments in Greek have survived.</p>
<p>The following items appeared in the work. God commissioned the archangel Michael to bury Moses’ body. Satan opposed Moses’ burial because he claimed authority over all matter and because Moses was a murderer. Michael countered Satan’s claims and charged him with tempting Eve in Eden. Joshua and Caleb then watched Moses’ assumption occur in a strange way. As they watched, they saw Moses’ dead body buried in the mountain, but they also saw Moses himself in the company of the angels. In effect Moses’ body died, but Moses himself did not.</p>
<p>Though often stated that Jude (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.9">9</a>) was quoted from the Assumption of Moses, this is impossible to prove, simply because the relevant portions of that work have not survived. The most one can say is that several church fathers, including Clement of Alexandria (d. <span class="era">AD</span> 215) and Origen (c. 185–254), suggested that the Assumption of Moses was the source for the account in <a href="?bref=Jude.1.9">Jude 1:9</a>. They had both works. We have only Jude, so we cannot check their conclusions. The matter is further complicated because there is another work (see next section) now called the Assumption of Moses. People often suppose that <a href="?bref=Jude.1.9">Jude 1:9</a> is a citation from that book. It is not.</p>
<p class="h4">The Extant Assumption of Moses</p>
<p class="fl">This work, perhaps written during Jesus’ lifetime, purports to be a description of Moses’ predictions to Joshua of the destiny of the nation of Israel. It is similar to other apocryphal, nonhistorical writings that were written under the names of great Jewish leaders.</p>
<p>It was discovered quite by chance in 1861, in the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy. The manuscript, dated to the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>, is a very poor copy of a Latin translation, perhaps derived from a Greek translation of a Hebrew original. The beginning and the ending are lost. There are numerous spelling mistakes, and there is no space between words. Not surprisingly, scholars have long disputed the reading, interpretation, and translation even of whole verses.</p>
<p>The opening three lines have not survived, so the original title has been lost. When discovered, the work was assumed to be the long-lost Assumption of Moses, but this identification is now widely doubted. Even though the book is still called by this title, it is far more likely to be either the Testament of Moses (which is also mentioned, along with the Assumption of Moses, in early lists of apocryphal works) or a composite work resulting from the combination of the Testament and the Assumption into one work.</p>
<p>There is only one reference to Moses’ assumption in the book, and it comes in connection with a mention of his death (10:12). Because the ending of the book is also lost, it is impossible to know the contents of the conclusion or to tell whether this one remaining reference to Moses’ assumption is original or whether it has been added by a scribe by mistake or by an editor combining two different works. It is clear, however, that the author of the surviving section believed that Moses expected to die (1:15; 10:12-14) and that Joshua assumed that he would (11:4-8).</p>
<p>The work begins midsentence (three lines are missing) and dates Moses’ following speech to 2,500 years after Creation (1:2-5). Expecting to die, Moses summons Joshua, encourages him, and tells him that God created the world for his people (the Israelites), who will repent before the consummation at the end of the days (1:6-18).</p>
<p>Then Moses foretells Israel’s future. The people will inherit the land (Canaan) and be ruled by local magistrates, chiefs (judges?), and kings (2:1-3). The kingdom will divide, and the people will turn to idolatry (2:4-9). A king from the east (Nebuchadnezzar) will take two tribes into captivity for about 77 years, where they will recall Moses’ warnings (3:1-14; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.25.11-12">Jer 25:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">Dt 28:15-68</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.15-20">30:15-20</a>). Someone (Daniel) will pray for deliverance (cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.9.4-19">Dn 9:4-19</a>), and God will persuade a king (Cyrus) to send the exiles home (4:1-6; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.45.1-6">Is 45:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezr 1:1-4</a>). Some exiles will return to their appointed place (Jerusalem) and rewall it but be unable to offer [proper] sacrifices (4:7-8; contrast <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.1-7">Ezr 3:1-7</a>). Others will remain in exile but will increase in population (4:9). This concludes the OT period and begins the intertestamental period (c. 400 to 1 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>The widespread apostasy of the Seleucid period (c. 201–267 <span class="era">BC</span>) is described, with special reference to priests and judges (4:1-6). The Maccabees, who gained and maintained political independence from Syria (in 164 <span class="era">BC</span>) are not mentioned. Instead, the focus is on the kings (the Hasmoneans) who made themselves high priests (6:1). Next will come an insolent king (Herod the Great, 37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>), who will rule ruthlessly (6:2-7). Then a powerful king of the West will conquer the people, take some captive, crucify others, and burn part of the temple (6:8-9).</p>
<p>From this point on, the author, having reached his own period, had to guess at the future, so the predictions that he put in Moses’ mouth are general or obscure and often unfulfilled. The next rulers (Sadducees?) would be impious, treacherous, gluttons, deceitful, and worried about ritual uncleanness while living in luxury at the expense of the poor (7:1-10). An unprecedented time of wrath would follow, when a great king would persecute the Jews, torturing, imprisoning, and even crucifying them for practicing circumcision (8:1-5). During this persecution, one man, Taxo, a Levite with seven sons, would remain faithful to God and die rather than adopt Greek customs (8:1-7).</p>
<p>The next section (10:1-10), an apocalyptic poem (ten stanzas, each with three lines), is the only apocalyptic section of the book. The Lord’s kingdom will appear, Satan will be no more, and the chief angel (Michael) will avenge Israel (10:1-2). “The Heavenly One will arise from His royal throne,” and there will be miraculous signs on the earth and in the sky; even the ocean will drain away (10:3-6). The Most High, the Eternal God, will appear and punish the Gentiles, destroying their idols (10:7). But Israel will be happy and exalted, rejoicing at seeing her enemies in Gehenna (hell) and thankfully praising her Creator (10:8-10). With Moses’ mention of his death and some consoling words for Joshua, the composition ends in an incomplete form.</p>
<p>The book must have been written after Herod died and Varus had subdued a rebellion in Judea (4 <span class="era">BC</span>) and before the temple was destroyed (<span class="era">AD</span> 70). The book predicts that Herod’s sons will not rule as long as Herod himself did (34 years, 37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>). This prediction may be based on the fact that one son, Archelaus, was deposed after a 10-year reign (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 6). If so, the book was written after <span class="era">AD</span> 6. But two other sons (Philip and Antipas) actually ruled longer than their father. For the author not to know this requires that the book must have been written within 34 years of Herod’s death—in other words, before <span class="era">AD</span> 30. Therefore, the book was probably written sometime between <span class="era">AD</span> 6 and 30. This also means that the book reflects Jewish thinking during Jesus’ lifetime.</p>
<p>The author was evidently a Palestinian Jew, but it is doubtful whether he was a member of any known major sect of the times. He hates Roman rule (8:1–10:10) without advocating revolt, as the Zealots and their predecessors did. His interest in the temple (2:8-9; 5:3; 6:9; 8:5) is not typical of an Essene. He condemns the Sadducean lifestyle (7:3-10). And his use of apocalyptic writing (10:1-10) is thought to have been unusual for a Pharisee.</p>

<p class="h3" id="PaulandTheclaActsof">Paul and Thecla, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">The Acts of Paul and Thecla is one section of an apocryphal work known as the Acts of Paul. It was apparently written in the latter half of the second century <span class="era">AD</span> by a church elder who lived in Asia. According to Tertullian (<span class="ital">On Baptism</span> 17.19-21), the motive for the writing was “love of Paul,” but the presbyter was removed from office for producing this document. It is not clear whether the reason for his deposition was that he made a false claim to apostolic authorship, or whether it was that the viewpoints expressed in the document were considered heretical.</p>
<p>The story reads like a folktale. Paul arrives in Iconium after fleeing from Antioch. He is met by Onesiphorus, who welcomes Paul into his home. A group of people gather there to hear Paul’s message. Beside the window of a neighboring house, Thecla is seated. She cannot see Paul, but she listens intently to his message. Her mother, Thecleia, exclaims, “My daughter, like a spider, is bound by his words to the window, seized by a new craving and a terrible passion.” Paul is teaching that in order to “see God,” a person must live a life of abstinence from sexual activity.</p>
<p>Thecla is engaged to be married, but she is so impressed with Paul’s teaching that she determines she will break her engagement to Thamyris. Thamyris, in distress, appeals to the governor of the city, who arrests and imprisons Paul. Thecla bribes the jailer with bracelets and a silver mirror and enters Paul’s cell. Again she is transfixed by his teaching. At the trial, Thecla is adamant in her refusal to marry Thamyris. Paul is banned from the city; Thecla is condemned to be burned to death. Miraculously her life is spared, and she is reunited with Paul and travels with him to Antioch.</p>
<p>In Antioch, Thecla rebuffs the advances of a nobleman, Alexander, and for a second time is condemned to death. But the wild beasts who are to devour her in the public arena instead lick her feet and protect her. When she throws herself into a water cistern to effect her baptism, she is again spared death—a lightning flash kills the fish lurking in the water, and they float lifeless to the surface. Queen Tryphaena, who has befriended Thecla, faints with shock as repeated attempts are made to take Thecla’s life. Seeing this, Alexander finally begs the governor to set Thecla free.</p>
<p>Free once more, Thecla seeks Paul. She disguises herself as a man by putting on male attire. Arriving in Myra, she finds Paul and announces to him that she is returning to Iconium. Paul commands her to “teach the word of God.” After teaching for a while in Iconium, Thecla travels on to Seleucia.</p>
<p>The remainder of Thecla’s life is not well documented. Some manuscripts record that Thecla, being afraid of the people of Seleucia, withdrew to a mountain and resided in a cave. There she lived an ascetic life, taught certain women who came to her, and carried out a ministry of healing. Later she departed to Rome, seeking Paul. Paul, however, was already dead. When Thecla herself died, at 90 years of age, she was buried not far from the tomb of her beloved master.</p>
<p>Although this work is considered apocryphal and is excluded from the NT canon, there are some early writers who held it in high regard. The Acts of Paul, of which this document forms a part, is mentioned by Origen and by Hippolytus with respect. Eusebius was of the opinion that the document was spurious, but he distinguished it from inferior heretical works. There are two instances where details of information have found their way from the Acts of Paul into early manuscripts of canonical books (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.11">2 Tm 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19">4:19</a>). It is probable that the viewpoints indicated in this document reflected popular religious traditions widely held in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>Tertullian, however, argues that the document is quite out of harmony with Paul’s attitudes as expressed in the canonical material. In particular, he objects to the role assumed by a woman in the Acts of Paul and Thecla. Paul, Tertullian says, would never have permitted a woman to teach and to baptize (<span class="ital">On Baptism</span> 17.21-23). The Acts of Paul and Thecla does differ from the Pauline stance, but not in the way indicated by Tertullian. The document depicts Paul as a proponent of the encratite viewpoint, teaching that celibacy is necessary for salvation. The canonical Paul taught that salvation is attained through faith alone, and that celibacy is a matter of special calling and certainly not the norm for every Christian (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1-7">1 Cor 7:1-7</a>). The Acts of Paul and Thecla suggests that a woman must assume male attire and must abstain from marriage if she is to exercise a leadership role. The canonical Paul instructed that a woman in a leadership position should dress as a woman (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.4-6">1 Cor 11:4-6</a>), and he affirmed the ministerial function of married women (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.3">Rom 16:3</a>). The Acts of Paul and Thecla emulates a woman whose motivating power was personal devotion to the apostle. The canonical writings suggest that Paul strongly discouraged such a show of personal allegiance to himself (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.12-17">1 Cor 1:12-17</a>). Christ alone was to be the motivating influence in Christian service.</p>
<p>The Acts of Paul and Thecla provides us with a unique description of the physical appearance of Paul: “a man small of stature, with a bald head and crooked legs, in good state of body, with eyebrows meeting and nose somewhat hooked, full of friendliness; for now he appeared like a man, and now he had the face of an angel.” This description is probably not reliable in any historical sense; more likely it pictures a typical Jew of the period. But because there is no other description preserved in early documents, this one has formed the basis for the many portraits of Paul that have come down through the centuries.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PaulApocalypseof">Paul, Apocalypse of</p>
<p class="fl">This document, which originated in the late fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>, pretends to be a written account of some of the experiences that the apostle Paul had when he was caught up to the third heaven, or paradise, according to <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.2-4">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</a>. The fact that Paul did not describe what he saw or heard during that revelatory vision excited the imagination of some unknown fourth-century Christian. Since the author describes with relish the tortures in hell experienced by a presbyter, bishop, and deacon (chs 34–36) and elsewhere approves of the devotion and piety of monks and nuns (chs 7–9) and of those who are virgins or chaste (ch 22), it is safe to conclude that he was a monk who disapproved of the insincere and hypocritical religiosity of his contemporaries, both laymen and clergy.</p>
<p>This book, originally written in Greek, survives in relatively complete form in Latin. A partial indication of the great popularity of this piece of religious fiction is the fact that it was translated into Ethiopic, Coptic, and Syriac as well as Latin.</p>
<p>The book is loosely structured in seven sections. The work begins with a short introductory section that attempts to explain why the book was unknown from the first to the fourth century (chs 1–2): during the consulate of (emperor) Theodosius Augustus the Younger and Cynegius (the document can thus be dated to <span class="era">AD</span> 388), a respectable but nameless person received a revelation through an angel. The man happened to be living in Tarsus in a house once occupied by St Paul himself. The angel told the man to break up the foundations and publish whatever he found. After being pummeled by the angel for disobedience, he finally broke the foundations only to discover a marble box that he immediately delivered to the emperor. The emperor opened the box and found the original version of the Apocalypse of Paul (which he copies) and a pair of shoes used by Paul on his missionary journeys. The substance of the mysterious document then follows.</p>
<p>In chapters 3–6, Paul is said to have received a message from God announcing how all creation is subject to God with the exception of man himself. Chapters 7–10 relate how the guardian angels of each man and woman report every morning and evening to God concerning the deeds of those in their charge. Some are very good, while others are exceedingly wicked. In chapters 11–18, Paul is taken up in the Holy Spirit to the third heaven and asks to see the souls of the righteous and sinners as they leave the world. The angel accompanying Paul shows him a righteous man leaving the world, an ungodly man, and the soul of one who thought himself righteous but in fact was not.</p>
<p>Chapters 19–30 describe Paul being lifted up to the third heaven (cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.2-4">2 Cor 12:2-4</a>), where he saw a golden gate flanked by golden pillars upon which were mounted golden tablets containing the names of the righteous. Upon entering paradise he was greeted by Enoch and Elijah and shown things that he could not reveal to others (ch 21; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.4">2 Cor 12:4</a>). From there he was taken to the second heaven and then to the firmament encircled by Ocean (ch 21). There he saw the milk white waters of Lake Acherusia where the city of Christ was located. He was brought to the city in a golden boat while 3,000 angels sang a hymn. At the river of honey he met Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and other prophets (ch 25); at the river of milk he saw the infants slain by Herod (ch 26); at the river of wine he met Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Lot, and Job (ch 27); at the river of oil he met those completely dedicated to God (ch 28). At the center of the city, by a great altar, David sang the hallelujah to God.</p>
<p>Paul’s tour of hell is described in chapters 31–44; it is a place of sorrow and distress in which flows a river boiling with fire. In the river, some of the damned were immersed to the knees, others to the navel or lips, depending on the severity of their sins (ch 31). Chapters 34–36 describe the tortures of a presbyter, bishop, and deacon. Throughout this section the most ghastly tortures imaginable are described in detail with great relish. Finally, in chapter 44, Christ decrees that for Paul’s sake there will be no torture on Sundays henceforth.</p>
<p>Paul’s angelic travel guide then escorts him to paradise (chs 45–51), where the righteous of all ages are anxious to meet him. He meets the Virgin Mary (ch 46), Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as well as the 12 sons of Jacob (ch 47), Moses, who weeps for the unconverted Jews (ch 48), Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, each of whom describes his martyrdom, Lot and Job (ch 49), Noah (ch 50), Elijah, Elisha, Zechariah and his son, John the Baptist, and Adam (ch 51). The document either ended here or, in alternate versions, with Paul’s miraculous trip to the Mt of Olives where he and the other disciples received the divine commission.</p>
<p>The document is filled with contradictions and inconsistencies and many of the translated versions do not agree with each other in all details. The chief importance of the document is in terms of its glimpses into the thinking of late fourth-century Christianity.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PaulPassionof">Paul, Passion of</p>
<p class="fl">A revised Latin version of the apocryphal Martyrdom of Paul, which was part of a larger body of texts called the Acts of Paul. The original Martyrdom is the story of Paul’s resuscitation of Patroclus, Nero’s cupbearer, who had fallen from a window and died during one of Paul’s sermons. Patroclus confesses his new loyalty to Christ before the stunned Nero, who moves quickly to round up all such “soldiers of the great king (Christ).” Paul is included in the purge. The Passion elaborates on the story to include a passage about Seneca’s admiration for Paul and his writings, portions of which Seneca allegedly read to Nero. Also, Paul on the way to his death borrows a kerchief from Plautilla, promising to return it. When the returning soldiers mock her, she shows them the bloodied kerchief.</p>

<p class="fl">This writing comes to us in two forms, both of which are considered to have been written by Marcellus and date from the fifth century. The first form is essentially like the Acts of Peter and Paul. It lays emphasis upon Paul’s journey to Rome. The second gives more attention to the men’s residence in Rome with emphasis upon their stay in the home of a relative of Pontius Pilate. Both emphasize the close relationship between Peter and Paul and their continued and successful opposition to Simon Magus, who claims to be the Christ. Their death sentences are included in the writings but with only a brief account of their martyrdoms.</p>

<p class="h3" id="PeterPreachingof">Peter, Preaching of</p>
<p class="fl">This document, which has survived only in fragments, appears to have been written early in the second century <span class="era">AD</span> in Egypt. While the title does not explicitly claim Petrine authorship, it was understood by Clement of Alexandria (late second century <span class="era">AD</span>) to have been an authentic composition by the apostle Peter (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 2.15.68). The majority of the fragments of the Preaching of Peter are preserved in the form of brief quotations in the writings of Clement of Alexandria.</p>
<p>The fourth-century church historian Eusebius of Caesarea observed that the Preaching of Peter had not been accepted by any ancient authorities (<span class="ital">Historia Ecclesiastica</span> 3.3.1-4), though he was probably not aware of its acceptance by Clement. Even though only fragments of the document have survived, they are important in that they reveal a transitional stage in the history of early Christian literature. During the first century, Christian literature, including all of the NT, was written for the consumption of other Christians. During the second century, Christian writers began to feel the need to defend their faith against the criticisms of their pagan and Jewish opponents. A new kind of Christian literature, the apology (meaning “defense”), began to appear in the early second century with the writings of the earliest Christian apologists Quadratus and Aristides. The Preaching of Peter represents a transition from the kind of apologetic writing found in the Acts of the Apostles, the sermons that that book contains, and the writings of the early apologists.</p>
<p>Since Clement quotes randomly from the Preaching of Peter, it is not possible to determine the order in which any of the quotations appeared in the original composition. Some of the major emphases of the document will appear from the following summaries of the quotations of Clement. Peter, according to Clement, called the Lord both “Law and Word” in the “Preaching” (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 1.29.182; 2.15.68). Mankind must recognize that <span class="ital">one</span> God created the beginning of all things and has the power to bring all things to an end (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 6.5.39-41). The pagans, whom the author of the Preaching of Peter opposed, held that the universe was uncreated and eternal. God, the author contends, is invisible, incomprehensible, needs nothing, is inconceivable, everlasting, imperishable, and uncreated. This God must not be worshiped in the manner of the Greeks, for they have foolishly fashioned images of ordinary materials and worship them as gods. Further, they take animals that should be used for food and sacrifice them to these idols. The worship of the Jews should not be emulated either, for they revere angels, archangels, months, and the moon. If any of the nation of Israel should repent, they will find forgiveness (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 6.5.43). In one place the Preaching of Peter narrates how the Lord sent disciples to preach the gospel throughout the world after the resurrection (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 6.6.48), though the precise connection between this narrative and the preceding apologetic statements is not clear. It may be that the document began with a special version of the great commission. Elsewhere the document states that the OT prophets speak of Christ, sometimes in parables and enigmas, yet at other times very clearly and directly (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 6.15.128). In fact, the major events of the life of Christ, his coming, torture, crucifixion, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven were predicted in detail by the prophets.</p>
<p>The importance of the surviving fragments of the Preaching of Peter lies in the way in which they reveal how early second-century Christianity turned from a defensive to an offensive position in its proclamation of the gospel.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PeterSlavonicActsof">Peter, Slavonic Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">An account of the later travels of Peter and his subsequent death in Rome preserved for us only in the Slavonic language. According to this account, a child (Jesus) comes to Peter and bids him to go to Rome. The angel Michael is captain of the ship taking them to Rome. After their arrival in Rome, Peter tells the child to catch some fish, whereupon he catches 12,000 in one hour. Then the child is sold to a Roman noble, Aravistus, for 50 pieces of gold. The child silences his teachers. After a vision of angels, the entire household is baptized. Nero arrests Peter, whereupon the child rebukes him. Many dead are raised, but the child sends them back to their graves to await the resurrection by Michael. Peter is crucified head downward. When the child reveals he is Jesus, the nails fall from Peter’s body, he prays for the forgiveness of his executioners, and then he dies. Such apocryphal versions of the acts of early church leaders are characteristically filled with fanciful acts of the apostles and their contact with the Christ.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PetersLettertoPhilip">Peter’s Letter to Philip</p>
<p class="fl">This letter is part of the Christian Gnostic material discovered in 1947 at Nag Hammadi. It probably dates from the late second or early third century. The letter takes its name from a segment at the beginning of the tractate in which Peter claims to have sent the material to Philip. The letter is written in a dialogue form common in Gnostic literature. The body of the writing consists of a series of questions that are asked by the apostles of the risen Lord and the answers given by him. The questions provide a basis for the exposition of Gnostic philosophy about the structure of the world revealed by the Divine Light. That Light is the Christ, who is the heavenly Redeemer.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PilateActsof">Pilate, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">This document is an apocryphal passion gospel that reached its present form by the middle of the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>. The first Christian writer to refer to the Acts of Pilate was Epiphanius, an ecclesiastical heresy hunter, who wrote a lengthy denunciation of various heresies in <span class="era">AD</span> 375, in which he definitely mentioned the Acts of Pilate (<span class="ital">Heresies</span> 50.1). Much earlier, Justin Martyr had referred to Pilate’s report to Tiberius regarding the trial of Jesus (<span class="ital">I Apology</span> 35; 48), but he does not seem to be referring to the Acts of Pilate. Toward the end of the second century <span class="era">AD</span>, a generation after Justin, Tertullian referred to an account sent from Pilate to the emperor Tiberius, yet this cannot be the Acts of Pilate, since Jesus supposedly performed many miracles before the procurator. Although it is not improbable that an earlier version of the Acts of Pilate antedated the fourth century, the present version must be dated to the middle of that century. The original language of the Acts of Pilate was Greek, and translations of it were made into Latin, Coptic, and Armenian. Eusebius, the fourth-century church historian and bishop of Caesarea, condemns what he regarded as a blasphemous account of Pilate, apparently a pagan document calculated to defame Christ (<span class="ital">Historia Ecclesiastica,</span> 1.9.3; 9.5.1). The Christian Acts of Pilate was probably composed to counter the pagan document.</p>
<p>The Acts of Pilate is a composite document consisting of two main parts. The first part (chs 1–16) purports to be a translation from Hebrew to Greek of an account written by Nicodemus about the events surrounding the passion of Jesus. The second part (chs 17–27), also called “Christ’s Descent into Hell,” vividly describes Christ’s descent into hades to liberate the righteous dead (an imaginative expansion of <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19">1 Pt 3:19</a> which was itself transformed in the Apostles’ Creed into the phrase “he descended into hell”). After the 14th century <span class="era">AD</span>, the whole composition was commonly designated as the Gospel of Nicodemus because of the prominent place that character played in the document.</p>
<p>In the prologue to the Acts of Pilate, a Roman soldier named Ananias claims to have found the Acts of Pilate in Hebrew and to have translated it into Greek in the 18th year of the reign of Emperor Flavius Theodosius (<span class="era">AD</span> 425). A quotation of the entire document follows: In the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar (<span class="era">AD</span> 29), Nicodemus wrote an account of the events that surrounded the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The Jewish high priests accused Jesus of various religious crimes to Pilate and asked that he be tried. Though unwilling, Pilate sent for Jesus anyway, though in a most gracious manner. When Jesus arrived, the Roman standards bowed to him of their own accords (ch 1). In chapter 2 the Jewish charges against Jesus included: (1) that he was born of fornication, (2) that his birth meant the death of the children of Bethlehem, and (3) that Joseph and Mary fled to Egypt because they counted for nothing among the people of Israel. The charge of fornication was immediately refuted by 12 pious Jews who had witnessed the betrothal of Mary and Joseph. An interview between Pilate and Jesus (modeled after <a href="?bref=John.18.33-38">Jn 18:33-38</a>) follows in chapter 3. The Jews charge Jesus with blaspheming God, and Pilate reluctantly turns Jesus over to them (ch 4). Nicodemus then stands up in the Jewish council and urges them to let Jesus go, for if he is not of God his movement will fail (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.5.38-39">Acts 5:38-39</a>), but the Jews oppose him (ch 5). Then three Jews healed by Jesus testify in his behalf (ch 6), followed by Bernice, the woman healed of the issue of blood (ch 7). The crowd proclaims Jesus a prophet (ch 8). When Pilate offers to release a prisoner, the Jews ask for Barabbas, and Pilate then washes his hands of the matter and has Jesus scourged and crucified with the two criminals, Dysmas and Gestas (ch 9). Jesus is mocked by the crowds, while one criminal (Gestas) is rebuked by the other (ch 10). Jesus’ death is accompanied by a darkening of the sun, which the Jews regard as a normal eclipse (ch 11). Joseph of Arimathea is then seized by the Jews and imprisoned; when they come to execute him he has vanished (ch 12). The guards report the appearance of the angel at the tomb, but are bribed by the Jews to keep silence (ch 12). Three Jews then come from Galilee: Phineas, a priest; Adas, a teacher; and Angaeus, a Levite. They report that they have witnessed the great commission and ascension of Jesus on Mt Malich (ch 14). Nicodemus suggests that the surrounding mountains be checked to see if some spirit has not taken Jesus up only to dash him on the rocks; the Jews find nothing except Joseph of Arimathea in his hometown (ch 15). Joseph is summoned to testify before the council and reveals how the risen Jesus had appeared to him when he was imprisoned and set him free (ch 15). The council decides, after hearing other witnesses, that if Jesus is still remembered after 50 years, the stories must be true (ch 16).</p>
<p>The second document begins with an account of Joseph speaking to the council. Two brothers, he claims, had been raised at the same time as Jesus. The council summons them to give their stories (ch 17). While in hades, the brothers claimed, a great light appeared and Abraham and Isaiah became overjoyed (ch 18). Satan thought that Jesus could be restrained in hades (ch 20); but when the King of Glory arrived, the gates were broken down. Satan was handed over to the angels to be bound (ch 22) and was rebuked by hades for causing the ruin of his kingdom (ch 23). The King of Glory (Christ) then led Adam and the rest of the righteous dead out of hades (ch 24) and to paradise (ch 25), where even the repentant criminal was seen (ch 26). The two brothers claim that they have been sent by the angel Michael to preach the resurrection of Jesus to all mankind.</p>
<p>The Acts of Pilate is a pastiche (collection) of quotations and allusions from the four canonical Gospels, mingled with imaginative and even fantastic additions. It is basically an apologetic document that attempts to defend the truth of the resurrection of Jesus against the counterclaims of pagan and Jewish adversaries. Unfortunately, it has an anti-Semitic tone that was to characterize Christian dramatizations of the events of Passion Week from the fourth century through the end of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PistisSophia">Pistis Sophia</p>
<p class="fl">A fourth-century Coptic manuscript (Codex Askewanus) that represents one of the chief Gnostic works extant today. The work, containing four chapters, derives its name from the heroine, Sophia, though only the first half of the work refers to her. This portion relates how Jesus, during the first 11 years after his resurrection, returned to teach his disciples the highest mystery of all: the Treasury of the Light. Jesus returned to the Mt of Olives where he is caught up through the aeons and on his journey comes to the thirteenth aeon where he finds Sophia. She is in sorrow because she has caught a glimpse of the Treasury of the Light but is deceived by Authades (the self-willed), who flashes a false brightness before her, causing her to fall into the hands of the powers of matter. She maintains her hope and faith, however, and after 12 prayers is delivered from Authades and chaos by Jesus who reinstates her at the lower limit of the thirteenth aeon.</p>
<p>The work is in dialogue form—with Jesus answering questions asked by his disciples. The theme is thoroughly Gnostic in its view of salvation that comes by a hidden doctrine that brings illumination.</p>

<p class="h3" id="SibyllineOracles">Sibylline Oracles</p>
<p class="fl">A pseudepigraphal writing comprising originally 15 books, 12 of which are extant in late Greek manuscripts. The word <span class="ital">sibyl</span> is of Greek origin. It claimed to be an oracle of the gods and generally contained a message of a coming catastrophic event. Some Jews adopted and used this mode of writing for propagation purposes.</p>
<p>The sibyls came from the beginning of the Maccabean period (165 <span class="era">BC</span>) and cover a period up to shortly after the destruction of the second temple (<span class="era">AD</span> 76). The authors, presumably writing in Alexandria, Egypt, stressed the unity and sovereignty of God. God controlled all events, whereas pagan deities were useless, unable to do anything. “But God is one, most exalted of all, who has made the heaven, the sun, the stars and the moon. . . . He has constituted man as the Divinely appointed ruler of all. You men . . . be ashamed of making gods” (book 2). God controls the history of the nations. The sibyls outline the history of 10 generations from the Assyrian kingdom to the destruction of the second temple and the great earthquake (book 4.47ff.). The third book also contains a section on the devastation and troubles to be experienced before the great judgment. It includes two messianic passages wherein the Messiah introduces an era of peace and prosperity for the faithful: “He will raise up his kingdom for all ages over men. . . . For nothing but peace shall come upon the land of the good” (lines 767, 780). The eternal state is to be reserved for the faithful who will be raised from the dead in a bodily form: “But all who are godly shall live again on earth, when God gives breath and life and grace to them the godly” (book 4.187-190), whereas the ungodly are to be thrown into hell, “And all who have sinned with deeds of impiety a heap of earth shall cover again, and murky Tartarus and the black recesses of hell” (lines 183-186).</p>
<p>The express purpose of the authors of the sibyls was to demonstrate the reasonableness of the Jewish faith by casting their message in the form of the sibyl, introduced by the Greeks and appreciated by the Romans. In their emphasis on the God of Israel and their opposition to paganism, they nevertheless stand in the stream of the apocalyptic, the unveiling of God’s secrets of past and future. The sibyl as divine oracle was, thus, used as a literary form in order to convey a message to the non-Jewish world.</p>

<p class="h3" id="SolomonPsalmsof">Solomon, Psalms of</p>
<p class="fl">The Psalms of Solomon are a collection of 18 songs attributed to Solomon. They are considered pseudepigrapha. The psalms were probably written by one author, who lived during the middle of the first century <span class="era">BC</span> and wrote in Hebrew. The theological perspective of the author is Pharisaic in its views of the law, judgment, and the future of Israel. The Psalms of Solomon are derived from the canonical book of Psalms in their form and phraseology. One of the similarities in the form and phraseology is the emphasis on the antithesis between the righteous and the wicked. The wicked are the Gentiles who defile the holy things of the Lord (2:3) and apostate Jews who have fallen into sin (3:11, 13).</p>
<p>The character of the sinner is that of the fool, as opposed to the wise man (cf. Wisdom Literature). The fool has no concern for the Lord (4:1); his speech and deeds betray his unrighteousness (4:2ff.). He is known by his lies, judgment of others, false oaths, his immorality, lawlessness, and selfish ambitions at the cost of others (cf. 12). The righteous are the wise, who fear the Lord (4:26). He is not dismayed by bad dreams or perilous times (6:4-5). He is provoked with zeal for the Lord’s righteousness, as he witnesses the desecration of the temple and the law (8:28). The Lord’s love of him is expressed in discipline, and he responds to the Lord’s rebuke with repentance for his sins. The author compares the righteous to the tree of life in Paradise. They are stable and will not be uprooted (14:2ff.). The wicked, on the other hand, will not be remembered in this life, and God will deal righteously with them by casting them into “Sheol and darkness and destruction” (14:6; 15:10).</p>
<p>The author views God as the King who mightily rules over the nations (2:34ff.) with readiness to judge his enemies and the enemies of the righteous (2:38ff.; 4:9) and to vindicate the righteous (2:39). As the Lord’s care is demonstrated in his sustenance of nature (5:11-12), in his raising up kings, rulers, and nations (5:13), the author assures the reader that his care extends particularly to the poor and those who call upon him (5:2-3, 13). He is the hope of the righteous (8:37).</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing belief in the righteous kingship of God and in his protection of the righteous, the psalms abound in the conviction that evil will be overcome by God’s intervention on behalf of the righteous. The particular context in which these psalms originated was Pompey’s entrance into Jerusalem and his desecration of the temple (63 <span class="era">BC</span>), and it was hoped that at the death of Pompey (48 <span class="era">BC</span>, cf. 2:30ff.) the messianic era might be introduced. Therefore, the author reminds God of the covenant made with David (17:5) and asks God’s forgiveness for Israel’s sins in the past. Israel has suffered gentile invasions and control as the result of God’s judgment (17:6). Since Pompey had died, the author prayed for the restoration of the theocracy under a Davidic king—“Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David. All the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant” (17:23). By means of the Davidic Messiah the land will be purged of sinners, godless nations, and the righteous will be sanctified. The messianic rule extends only over the righteous remnant, who when restored to the land, will be divided into the 12 tribes; the Davidic Messiah will rule over the tribes and the other nations “in the wisdom of his righteousness” (17:29-31). The sojourner and the gentile nations will not share in the glory of the kingdom. Rather, their position will be that of servitude.</p>
<p>The hope of the glorious future of Israel is the apocalyptic element in the psalms. They arose in a historical context, but they anticipate a radically new future. The psalmist pronounced a benediction on all those who would witness God’s judgment on the nations, the restoration of Israel, and the introduction of the messianic kingdom: “Blessed be they that shall be in those days, in that they shall see the good fortune of Israel which God shall bring to pass in the gathering together of the tribes. May the Lord hasten His mercy upon Israel! The Lord Himself is our king for ever and ever” (17:50-51).</p>
<p class="h3" id="SolomonTestamentof">Solomon, Testament of</p>
<p class="fl">The Testament of Solomon is a second-century <span class="era">BC</span> pseudepigraphal writing. The writing claims that Solomon was the writer of the testament. It is extant in Semitic manuscripts, and in some Greek texts.</p>
<p>The material is basically Christian with emphasis on the cross and the virgin birth but also contains Jewish material as well. The testament recounts how Solomon, by means of a ring given to him by the archangel Michael, is able to subdue and use the skills of demons to build his temple. After completing the temple, however, Solomon is led into idolatry on account of his lust for a Shunammite girl. His fall was taken by the author of the testament as an occasion to warn the readers of the power and shapes of the demons and the angels having power over them. The work is written in the form of a testament in order to let Solomon reflect (on his deathbed) how he succeeded and failed as a legacy to Israel.</p>
<p class="h3" id="TestamentsoftheTwelvePatriarchs">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</p>
<p class="fl">Part of the Jewish pseudepigrapha. This particular composition is called a “testament” because it represents the deathbed speeches of each of the sons of Jacob. The testaments start with Reuben’s speech to his sons and ends with Benjamin’s testament to his heirs. Each patriarch is represented as gathering his sons around him and relating the important events of his life. During the speech the patriarch warns against particular vices and attitudes and recommends certain virtues. The advice and warnings of each patriarch often include insight and predictions concerning sin and salvation for his children. The account of the patriarch’s life serves as a guide for the future of his descendants. At the end of the speech, each patriarch dies and is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p>It would appear that the concept of “testament” finds its orientation in <a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-24.33">Joshua 23–24</a>, where Joshua summons the elders, heads, judges, and officers of Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.2">Jos 23:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.1">24:1</a>) and gives them a charge before his death. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.1-12">First Kings 2:1-12</a> portrays David giving Solomon deathbed advice to walk in God’s ways. The speeches of the patriarchs find further scriptural reference in Genesis chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-33">49</a>, where Jacob calls his sons together to hear about their future. At the end of the speech Jacob dies (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.33">Gn 49:33</a>).</p>
<p>The present textual form (Slavonic, Armenian, and Greek versions) probably came about sometime during the second or third century <span class="era">AD</span>. However, much of the material would appear to go back to the second or third century <span class="era">BC</span>. The general scholarly consensus is that an original text in a Semitic language (either Hebrew or Aramaic) was composed by an author or authors sometime in the third or second century before the common era. At some later period, Christian sections were added to the original text. For examples of the Christian sections see Testament of Simeon 6:7; Testament of Levi 10:2; Testament of Dan 6:9; Testament of Naphtali 4:5; Testament of Asher 7:3-4; Testament of Joseph 19:11; Testament of Benjamin 3:8; 9:2-4. It would appear that the testaments may have been reworked by a Jewish writer(s) and by other Christian writers over the centuries. Thus we have a Jewish document from about the third century before the common era that has undergone both Jewish and Christian redactions over a long period of time. These testaments became quite popular in the tenth century, with special interest being displayed in the prophecies of the patriarchs and their secret knowledge.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of each of the testaments of the patriarchs. The excerpts are based on R. H. Charles’s <span class="ital">Pseudepigrapha,</span> pp 282-367.</p>
<p class="h4">Reuben</p>
<p class="fl">The testament of Reuben is very much influenced by an overwhelming memory of defiling his father’s bed. This refers to Reuben taking his father’s concubine Bilhah while she was in a drunken stupor. Reuben has very strong opinions regarding what he considers to be negative attributes of women, and he warns his sons to be guarded in their relationship with women. His comments on women probably reflect the ill feelings that existed between himself and Jacob in regard to Bilhah. Reuben predicts that in the future his sons would be jealous of the sons of Levi but they would not be able to overthrow them. He admonishes his descendants to have respect and love for one another and to do truth to their neighbors. Reuben is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Simeon</p>
<p class="fl">The patriarch Simeon is presented as a strong warrior type. Reflecting the biblical account of Joseph being sold into slavery (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-28">Gn 37:25-28</a>), Simeon testifies that he wanted to kill Joseph rather than sell him into slavery. As punishment for this attitude, God withered his right hand for seven days. Simeon warns his sons against envy, deceit, and fornication. He predicts that they will attempt to harm the sons of Levi but prophesies that the sons of Levi will remain superior. Simeon looked forward to a blissful era (6:4-7a), when the “Most High” would be blessed. Verse 7b is a Christian interpolation, “Because God has taken a body and eaten with men and saved men.” He admonishes his sons to obey the sons of Levi and Judah, for it would be from them that their salvation would be accomplished. He predicts that a high priest would come from Levi and a king would descend from the lines of Judah. Simeon concludes his testament by predicting that all Gentiles (an interpolation) and Israel would be saved.</p>
<p class="h4">Levi</p>
<p class="fl">Levi’s deathbed testament is in the form of dreams that he relates to his sons. He predicts that from his descendants and those of Judah the Lord would “appear among men” to save every race of men (2:11). The descendants of Levi would be “as the sun to all the seed of Israel” (4:3b) and in one dream it is shown that the blessings of the priesthood would come to his sons (8:2-3). Levi predicts that a king would arise in Judah; this king would establish a new priesthood that ministers to both Jews and Gentiles. The tenth chapter has a Christian interpolation that because of ungodliness and transgression, the sons of Levi would wrong “the Savior of the world, Christ” (10:2) and that for this they would be scattered throughout the world. Chapter 13 has a number of wisdom themes with emphasis on the need to follow and obey the law. Chapter 16 introduces an eschatological prediction that the sons of Levi would go astray for 70 weeks. The following chapter gives a detailed account of the 70 weeks in which there would be a priesthood for each jubilee. The first priesthood would be great, and the priest’s relationship to God would be such that God would be addressed as father. The second priesthood would “be conceived in the sorrow of beloved ones” (17:3), but this priesthood will be glorified by all. The following five priesthoods would be characterized by sorrow, pain, hatred, and darkness. However, a new priesthood would eventually arise and peace will be brought to all the earth (18:4); sin shall come to an end (18:9), for this new priesthood shall have a spirit of understanding and sanctification resting upon him. The testament closes with an admonition to choose either the law of the Lord or the work of Beliar (variant of Belial). The sons pledge themselves to the law, and following Levi’s death they bury him at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Judah</p>
<p class="fl">At the beginning of the testament by Judah he tells his descendants that he had been promised by his father that he would be king. “And it came to pass, when I became a man, that my father blessed me, saying, You shall be a king, prospering in all things” (1:6). Judah reminisces about his early youth and his ability to conquer wild animals. He obeyed the commandments and did not give in to lust. He predicted that his descendants would fall into wickedness because of the love of money and the enticement of beautiful women (ch 17). In chapter 21 Judah predicts that the Lord would give the kingship to his descendants and the priesthood to the sons of Levi. Chapter 24 includes a Christian messianic redaction. It is predicted that from the star of Jacob one will arise that will be without sin and from it a rod of righteousness will grow to the Gentiles (24:6). The testament concludes with eschatological hope for the future when “they who are poor for the Lord’s sake shall be made rich and they who are put to death for the Lord’s sake shall awake to life” (25:4). Judah dies and is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Issachar</p>
<p class="fl">The last words of this patriarch are somewhat unique in that Issachar is depicted as being “upright” and without transgression (unlike many of his brothers). He predicts that the priesthood will come from Levi and the kingship will arise from the lineage of Judah. In chapter 6 Issachar predicts that his children will “cleave” after Beliar. If they recognize the mercy of God and follow Issachar’s exemplary life, “every spirit of Beliar will flee from them.” His final request is that he be buried at Hebron with his fathers.</p>
<p class="h4">Zebulun</p>
<p class="fl">The patriarch Zebulun begins his testament by characterizing himself as a “good gift” to his parents. He, like Issachar, indicates that he is not conscious of sinning “except in thought” (and if he has any iniquity it is only the sin of ignorance). Zebulun claims that he did not support the actions taken against Joseph, and he would have told his father about Joseph’s plight except that the other brothers agreed that if “anyone should declare the secret, he should be slain” (1:6). In 1:7 he declares that if it were not for him the other brothers would have killed Joseph. The brothers were so suspicious of Zebulun that they watched him until Joseph was sold. Verse 5:3 has a familiar theme that is found in the NT and in the rabbis: “Have compassion in your hearts, my children, because even as a man does to his neighbor, even so will the Lord do to him.” Zebulun believes that this lesson is demonstrated in practical terms. The sons of the other brothers were sickened and died on account of the action taken against Joseph (“because they showed no mercy in their hearts,” 5:5). The sons of Zebulun were preserved without sickness. He continues his wisdom teaching (8:3) by declaring that in the degree that a man has compassion upon his neighbor the Lord in the same degree will have mercy on him. Zebulun predicts the division between the northern and southern kingdoms and the eventual conquest of these kingdoms by the Gentiles. However, the people will repent and the Lord will bring them back to “the land” and Jerusalem (9:8). In chapter 10 Zebulun predicts that after his death he will “arise as a ruler in the midst of his sons” (10:2), and he promises reward for those who keep the laws and punishment for the ungodly. Zebulun dies at the end of his testament and is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Dan</p>
<p class="fl">The patriarch Dan laments his jealousy of Joseph and indicates that he was controlled by the spirit of Beliar. He reveals that he wanted to kill Joseph so that he could have the love of his father. Dan warns against the spirits of lying and anger, and he exhorts his descendants to love truth and long-suffering. He admonishes them to keep the commandments and “love the Lord through all your life and one another with a true heart” (5:3). Dan predicts that his sons will “in the last days” depart from the Lord and thus provoke the anger of the sons of Levi. They also will fight against the sons of Judah. His sons will not win against the sons of Levi and Judah because an angel of the Lord will guide them. Dan is represented as having read in the book of Enoch (a favorite reference for the patriarchs) that Satan and all the spirits of wickedness and pride will cause the sons of Levi, Judah, and Dan to sin. They will be taken into captivity where they will receive the plagues of Egypt and all the evils of the Gentiles. However, when they return to the Lord they will receive mercy and be given peace. The prediction is such that there would be one who would arise from the tribe of Judah and Levi who is called “the salvation of the Lord.” It would appear that the “one arising” would make war against Beliar and execute an “everlasting vengeance” against their enemies (5:10). Dan’s final warning is to beware of Satan and his spirits and to draw near to God and the angel “that intercedes for you” (6:2). The last section admonishes Dan’s sons to pass on to their children all that they have heard so that “the savior of the Gentiles may receive” them. There follows a Christian polemic about the savior being true, long-suffering, meek, and lowly (6:9). When Dan dies, he is buried near Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p class="h4">Naphtali</p>
<p class="fl">Naphtali is said to be 130 years old when he gives his last words. He is depicted as being in good health, but the morning after a feast realizes that he is going to die. Thus he gathers his sons about him. Naphtali has a very strong sense of order that contributes to the makeup and actions of man as well as the universe. He views the “Gentile problem” as their forsaking the Lord and changing their order so that they obeyed the “stocks and stones.” The change of order was the problem at Sodom and it also caused the Flood.</p>
<p>Naphtali reads from the book of Enoch that his sons will depart from the Lord and walk “according to all lawlessness of the Gentiles” (4:1). He predicts that his descendants will be taken captive because of their sins and afterward a “few” will return to the Lord and he will bring them back to their land. After their return to the land, Naphtali predicts that his sons will forget the Lord and “become ungodly” with the result that they will be scattered all over the earth. They will remain in this state until the compassion of the Lord comes and a man working righteousness and mercy comes to them. Naphtali recounts two dreams that he had in his 40th year. In the first dream he saw the sun and moon stand still. Isaac told his grandsons to run and take hold of the sun and moon, each according to his strength. Levi took hold of the sun, and Judah seized the moon. Both of them were lifted up with the sun and moon. There appeared a bull in the dream with two great horns and eagle wings. The other sons attempted to seize this bull but could not. However, Joseph came and took hold of the bull and ascended “up with him on high” (5:7).</p>
<p>There follows a prediction that the 12 tribes of Israel would be taken into captivity by the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Chaldeans, and Syrians. The other dream saw a ship sailing on the sea of Jamnia without sailors or pilot. Written on the ship was the inscription “The ship of Jacob” (6:2). Jacob and his sons were on the ship, and when a storm arose Jacob departed from their presence. Eventually the ship breaks up from the pounding of the sea, and while Joseph sails off in a little boat the rest of the brothers are divided among nine planks with Levi and Judah sharing a plank. It would appear that by the prayers of Levi all the brothers eventually land safely on the shore. When Naphtali relates these dreams to his father, Jacob responds that all these things must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Naphtali admonished his sons to be united to Levi and Judah for through them “shall salvation arise to Israel” (8:2). Also through Levi and Judah the righteous of the Gentiles shall be gathered. Naphtali died and was buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Gad</p>
<p class="fl">The patriarch Gad is represented as hating Joseph because Joseph had told his father that Gad and some of the other brothers were eating from the best of the flocks while tending them. During his testament Gad confesses his sin of hatred to his sons and warns them against harboring hatred because it only brings anguish: “For as love would quicken even the dead and would call back them that are condemned to die, so hatred would slay the living and those that had sinned venially it would not suffer to live” (4:6).</p>
<p>Repentance is understood to give knowledge to the soul and leads the mind to salvation. Gad encourages his sons to honor the lineage of Levi and Judah, for therein is found the salvation of Israel. He predicts that his sons will walk in all wickedness and corruption and ends on a somewhat pessimistic note by asking to be buried near his fathers. Gad is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Asher</p>
<p class="fl">Asher is very conscious of good and evil spirits and the choice that man has to make between these two possibilities. Asher predicts that his descendants will act ungodly and not give heed to the law of God. Thus they will be delivered into the hands of their enemies and they will be scattered. They will exist in such a state until the “Most High” visits the earth “coming Himself [as man with men eating and drinking] . . . he shall save Israel and all the Gentiles” (7:3-4). This Christian interpolation is followed by a declaration that the Lord will gather them because of his mercy and for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. When Asher dies, he is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Joseph</p>
<p class="fl">Joseph calls himself the “beloved of Israel,” (1:2) and although he has seen envy and death, he did not go astray. During his testament he tells of his ordeal of being sold into slavery. The verses in chapter one are set in parallelism with the first half of the verse telling the plight of Joseph and the second half exalting the security of the Lord: “I was sold into slavery, and the Lord of all made me free: I was taken into captivity, and his strong hand succoured me. I was beset with hunger and the Lord himself nourished me” (1:5). Joseph details his experiences in Egypt with eight chapters being given to the temptations of the Egyptian woman. However, Joseph resisted her advances and the Lord rewarded him for his convictions. He admonishes his sons to have the fear of the Lord in all their works because whoever does the law of the Lord will be loved by him. This is the key to his success. Joseph encourages his children to do well to anyone who would do evil to them and pray for their enemies. He gives his attitude toward his brothers as an example of such a virtue.</p>
<p>Joseph admonishes his sons to observe the commandments of the Lord and honor Levi and Judah for “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world, who saves all the Gentiles and Israel” (19:11) shall arise from them. He predicts the enslavement in Egypt but also the eventual deliverance. He directs his sons to take his bones with them when they leave Egypt, and the testament indicates that Joseph was buried at Hebron.</p>
<p class="h4">Benjamin</p>
<p class="fl">The last patriarch gives his testament when he is 125 years old. He encourages his children to love the Lord and keep his commandments. He urges them to follow the goodness of Joseph, for he did not want his brothers’ actions against him to be counted as sin. Benjamin predicts that in Joseph shall the prophecy be fulfilled “concerning the Lamb of God and Savior of the world, and that a blameless one shall be delivered up for lawless men, and a sinless one shall die for ungodly men in the blood of the covenant, for the salvation of the Gentiles and of Israel and shall destroy Beliar and his servants” (3:8). One can immediately see how the Christian interpolation would find easy access for a polemic in this testament. Joseph is depicted as suffering in innocence and without remorse. Likewise the Christian messiah would suffer and die for ungodly men.</p>
<p>Benjamin believes that there are evildoers among his sons; from his reading of the book of Enoch he predicts that they will commit “fornication with the fornication of Sodom” and only a few will survive (9:1). There would appear to be a remnant from each tribe as the 12 tribes and the Gentiles will gather at the last temple. Their salvation will be a result of the “Most High” sending his only “begotten prophet” (9:2), and he will be lifted up upon a tree and the veil of the temple shall be rent and the Spirit of God shall be passed on to the Gentiles. Benjamin admonishes his sons that if they walk in holiness according to the commandments of the Lord, all of Israel will be gathered to the Lord. When Benjamin dies, he is buried at Hebron.</p>
<p>From the brief account of each patriarch, it is apparent that the testaments were subject to both Jewish and Christian redaction and go beyond mere interpolation. The text reflects such characteristics as two messiahs, a double love commandment, ethical and theological teachings, as well as universal salvation. However, it is most difficult to place these features within a particular time period or even religion.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ThaddeusActsof">Thaddeus, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">A sixth-century version and extension of the fifth-century Syriac Doctrina Addaei, or Legend of Abgar. The Legend contains a purported exchange of letters between Abgar, king of Edessa (<span class="era">AD</span> 9–46), and Jesus. This exchange results in the sending of Thaddeus, one of Jesus’ apostles, to Edessa. While there, he performs numerous miracles including the healing of Abgar. The Acts has Abgar healed when Ananias, his messenger, returns prior to the arrival of Thaddeus. The Acts focuses on the activity of Thaddeus in establishing the church in Edessa.</p>

<p class="h3" id="ThomasActsof">Thomas, Acts of</p>
<p class="fl">The Acts of Thomas is one of a cluster of acts of the apostles that have three common characteristics. They narrate the propagation of the gospel around the ancient world, promote the deeds and words of one of the apostles, and inevitably chronicle that apostle’s martyrdom. The oldest of these “acts narratives” are those of Paul, John, Andrew, Peter, and Thomas. Acts of Thomas, like the others, is a blend of Christian piety, the popular Hellenistic romances of the day, and Jewish haggadic-type moralistic teachings.</p>
<p>Scholarly study of the Acts of Thomas suggests that it was probably written at the beginning of the third century. It was definitely written in Syriac first and probably by someone with strong tendencies toward the Gnostic heresy. It proved broadly popular among Gnostics, Manichees, and orthodox churches, so much so that it was quickly translated from the original Syriac into Arabic, Armenian, and several Greek translations. From these varied Greek versions, Coptic, Latin, and Ethiopic translations were made. Significant portions of the Coptic version were in turn retranslated back into Arabic, Ethiopic, and Greek, thus creating a most confusing textual tradition. Only one full early Syriac text survives, and it is considered less reliable than some of the extant Greek translations.</p>
<p>In the critical English edition of the Acts of Thomas, that of A. F. J. Klijn published in 1962, the narrative is divided into the traditional acts (praxeis). There are 13 of these numbered in 170 sequential chapters that include the concluding martyrdom of the apostle. Various liturgical pieces, sermon fragments, and hymns are inserted, including two particularly famous hymns in the early church—that of the “Song of the Bride” in act 1 and that of the “Song of the Pearl” in act 9. The first six acts are not woven together by any particular theme, and they record that Thomas went on board ship to go to India (act 3), which would imply a south Indian ministry. Yet the text speaks of ministry to the north Indian king, Gundaphoro (act 4). However, acts 7 through 13 and the martyrdom are set in the south Indian kingdom of Mazdai and are obviously written by one hand. It is probable that the first six acts represent earlier materials placed into the whole by the writer of the last seven acts and the martyrdom. This document is the first-known mention of the traditions that Thomas ministered in India, was martyred there, and that his bones were returned to Edessa. Acts of Thomas is written, as are all the apocryphal acts of the apostles, on the assumption that the world was divided among the apostles for evangelization and that India fell to Thomas.</p>
<p>Thomas is called Judas Thomas throughout these acts after the Syrian style of referring to that apostle. Thomas is spoken of as the twin of Jesus (the Didymus of the NT), as recipient of special divine revelations, and as being Jesus incarnate in the flesh again—in chapters 10, 11, 39, 47, and 48 of the Acts. Many historians think these are clear indications of Gnostic thought. Others think such ideas are expressions of Jesus’ adaptation to human perception and identification with his apostles—features often found in early Christian literature. There seems to be no question but that Gnostic or Manichee tendencies were gradually edited out of Greek and Latin texts by orthodox copyists.</p>
<p>One quickly gets the feel for this narrative. The Acts of Thomas opens with Judas Thomas’s refusing to go to India. He is then sold as a slave—in parallel to Christ’s coming as a slave to redeem man. So Thomas reaches India as a carpenter (again the parallel with Jesus) and a builder of homes. He plays groomsman in a wedding at which miracles convince the flute player of Thomas’s role as apostle of God; so the king asks Thomas to pray for his daughter. Great stress is placed on purity in Thomas’s teaching, and this usually involves sexual abstinence as well. Finally, many are converted, including the king, and they form an assembly of believers in Sandaruk.</p>
<p>In the second act the king, Gundophor, gives Thomas a large sum of money to build a palace. After surprising the king by tracing the palace on the ground in winter, Thomas builds him a palace in heaven by giving the money to the poor. The king imprisons and decides to kill Thomas for the supposed deception; but the king’s brother, Gad, dies and goes to heaven where he sees the palace and desires to buy it. Gad is then reunited with his body and tries to buy the palace from Gundophor, whereupon Gundophor learns that he cannot sell it, releases Thomas from prison, and advises Gad to arrange to have his own palace built in heaven. Thomas gives a great doxology (ch 25 of act 2), and the two brothers who have come to believe through all of this want to be baptized.</p>
<p>In these miracle narratives and teachings, all the books of the NT seem to be echoed, though there are relatively few direct quotations. Favorite miracle passages such as Balaam’s talking donkey and Peter’s release from prison are reexperienced in Thomas’s life with vast embellishment. The talking ass enters a home and casts out a demon at Thomas’s command; Thomas causes great consternation by repeatedly passing in and out of the securely closed prison. Such miracles, sufferings, and conversions make up acts 3 through 13 and continue to the climax of Judas Thomas’s ministry. His martyrdom occurs (ch 168) at the hands of four soldiers with spears who have been ordered by the king of Mazdai to execute Thomas. He thereafter appears to his followers who have Thomas’s bones removed to Edessa. Meantime, the son of the king of Mazdai becomes sick unto death. Desperate, the king goes to Thomas’s tomb, thinking to get a relic to heal his son. Finding the body gone, he uses the very dust upon which Judas Thomas’s body rested, and his son is healed.

<p class="fl">A noncanonical and heretical gospel of Gnostic origin that probably dates from the second or third century <span class="era">AD</span>. It is one of a large number of similar writings that flourished among early religious sects such as the Marcosians (a second-century group that built an elaborate sacramental system around numbers) and the Manicheans (a third-century dualistic heresy based on the primeval conflict between light and darkness). In fact, Cyril of Jerusalem, who died in <span class="era">AD</span> 386 says the Gospel of Thomas was written by “one of those wicked disciples of Mani” (the founder of Manichaeism). Along with the Protevangelium of James, it is one of the oldest and most widely known of the more than 50 apocryphal gospels that circulated within the churches during the period of their early growth and expansion.</p>
<p>This Gospel of Thomas (sometimes referred to as an “infancy gospel”) should not be confused with the Coptic version that was unearthed in 1945 near Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt. The latter is a collection of 114 “sayings of Jesus,” which shed a great deal of light on the influence of Gnosticism on Egyptian Christianity. They claim to be the “secret words” of Jesus transmitted by “Didymos Judas Thomas.” The Gospel of Thomas, with which this article deals, is composed of a series of childhood miracles of Jesus and is preserved for us in four versions—two in Greek (one quite a bit longer than the other), one in Latin, and one in Syriac.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Thomas was apparently known as early as Hippolytus (<span class="era">AD</span> 155–235), who quotes it as saying, “He who seeks me will find me in children from seven years old; for there will I, who am hidden in the fourteenth aeon, be found.” Hippolytus claimed that it was used by the Naasenes (a Gnostic sect that worshiped the serpent) in support of their doctrine of the nature of the inward man. The quotation above is not found in the extant versions, but this is understandable because there is evidence from the Stichometry of Nicephorus (possibly fourth century) that an earlier version was over twice the length. The Gospel of Thomas was known both to Origen (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 185–254) and Eusebius (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 260–340). The latter classed it with the heretical writings and said it should be “rejected as altogether absurd and impious” (<span class="ital">Historia Ecclesiastica</span> 3.25).</p>
<p>The stories that make up the Gospel of Thomas emphasize the miraculous power and supernatural wisdom of the boy Jesus. Some scholars think they were originally fabricated by orthodox Christians in opposition to the Gnostic heresy that the “supernatural Christ” first came upon Jesus at the time of his baptism. It is much more likely, however, that they owe their origin to people’s curiosity about what the boy Jesus must have been like. Some of the tales may have come from pagan sources.</p>
<p>Apart from three or four miracles, which could be classed as beneficial, the supernatural feats said to be performed by the boy Jesus were destructive. For example, when a certain child spoiled some pools made by Jesus, he was cursed by Jesus and totally withered up. Another boy who provoked Jesus by running into him “immediately . . . fell down and died.” A teacher who struck Jesus on the head was straightway cursed and fell to the ground. The French writer Renan referred to the Jesus of the Gospel of Thomas as “a vicious little guttersnipe.”</p>
<p>Throughout the gospel Jesus is presented as infinitely wise. He ridicules his teacher Zacchaeus saying, “You hypocrite, first, if you know it, teach the Alpha, and then we will believe you concerning the Beta.” After Zacchaeus berates himself for being so inferior to the one he intended to take as a disciple, Jesus laughs and announces, “I am come from above that I may curse them.” The text continues, “And no man after that dared to provoke him, lest he should curse him, and he should be maimed.”</p>
<p>Other miracles include making 12 live sparrows out of clay, smiting his accusers with blindness, raising a child from the dead, healing a foot cut in two by an ax, carrying water in a cloth garment, reaping an enormous harvest from one kernal of wheat, stretching a piece of wood to its proper length, and healing his brother James who had been bitten by a viper while gathering fagots (sticks to use as firewood). More miracles may be found in the longer Latin version.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the orthodox church has always rejected from its canon of sacred scripture the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas. It is, however, quoted in other later gospels of the same sort. For example, the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew from chapter 18 on is based upon the Gospel of Thomas. Along with other apocryphal materials, it has exercised a significant influence on Christian art and literature, especially from the tenth century forward. For example, the account of Jesus making the 12 sparrows from clay shows up in the Koran.</p>
<p class="h3" id="TruthGospelof">Truth, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">Around 1945 a group of Egyptian peasant farmers near modern Nag Hammadi inadvertently dug into a grave of the ancient village known as Shenesit-Chenoboskion and unearthed a jar containing 13 books (9 of which were largely complete) and 15 fragments of works. This find was the library of an ancient Gnostic sect and contained all or parts of 51 different Gnostic writings—all but two of which had never come into modern scholars’ hands before. Now called the Nag Hammadi or Chenoboskion texts, these works were the first modern find of original Gnostic literature. All are Coptic translations of earlier Greek originals.</p>
<p>Codex I (titled the Jung Codex because it now is owned by the Jung Institute in Vienna) is unique among the 13 works because it is in Sub-Achimimic Coptic, while the rest of the works are in the more usual Sahidic Coptic. Codex I contains five works, two of which are the enormously controversial Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Truth.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Truth has no heading but rather draws its title from the incipit (first line of the text); it has no author; it contains no addressee. In fact, it is not a gospel at all, but rather a treatise expressive of Valentinian Gnosticism at its very earliest stage. Because the Gnosticism expressed in the Gospel of Truth is lacking all later-Valentinian mythological development and because it is stated simply and in almost orthodox Christian thought forms, the majority of modern scholars credit it to Valentinus himself, though no final proof of this has been discovered as yet. If Valentinus himself did not write this document, then it had to be someone in the immediate circle of his initial disciples.</p>
<p>Valentinus was born in Egypt around <span class="era">AD</span> 100 to 110. He received a thorough education at Alexandria, became a Christian, and taught first in Egypt before moving to Rome around <span class="era">AD</span> 136, where he stayed until 154 or 155. Tertullian, in his work against heresy, seems to imply that Valentinus was twice expelled from the Roman church; he states that Valentinus was a brilliant and eloquent man who had hopes of becoming a bishop in Rome at one time. Valentinus attracted able followers who later expanded his teachings almost beyond recognition. But when he left Rome sometime after 154 or 155, he had made a final break with orthodoxy and was teaching a form of Gnostic heresy the product of which was the Gospel of Truth, written by himself or someone of his immediate circle. There is a surviving statement that Valentinus taught subsequently in Cyprus, and then he vanishes into the mists of history.</p>
<p>Irenaeus said the Gospel of Truth is no gospel, for it is unlike the four Gospels (<span class="ital">Against Heresies</span> 3.2.9). Irenaeus was certainly correct, for the work is not a narrative. Nor does the Gospel of Truth contain any story about Jesus, any place name of any type, any date, or any mention of any person other than Jesus, who is only mentioned five times.</p>
<p>More than 60 times, this brief work uses the notions of knowledge or needing to know. This knowledge is born from within as the soul returns to itself, finding there what Deity deposited in it—or perhaps better, finding there the residue of Deity still entrapped within it. Thus whoever has Gnosis has simply taken what is his and can know where he or she comes from and for where he or she is bound. Christ’s role was to present the “Book of the Living” or the “Living Book.” “Book” is understood, not as the gospel proclamation of the life and teachings of Jesus, but rather as the primordial gospel or truth that existed before creation. It was error and ignorance that rebelled against the Savior and nailed him to the tree. Implied in this, though not explicitly stated, is the Gnostic understanding that it was also divine error and ignorance out of which matter emerged or was created. Salvation for living beings entrapped in this matter comes with return to unalloyed Deity. The path of this return is Gnosis (knowledge). The Pleroma, the fullness of the Deity, went out into the depths of matter in search of the elect among beings by way of Jesus and the cross.</p>
<p>While these traits of Gnosticism are clear, this gospel is much closer to orthodoxy than most Gnostic Chenoboskion writings because it mentions only one Son of God, not several emanations; it does not split Jesus into a physical Jesus and a divine Christ; and most strikingly, Sophia, the usual central character in the Gnostic cosmic drama, does not appear at all. It is for these reasons among others that the Gospel of Truth is placed very close to Valentinus’s break with orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Truth has assumed some degree of importance in NT studies beyond that warranted by its heretical content because it everywhere assumes our full NT canon. By some scholars’ counts, there are no less than 83 places where the Gospel of Truth echoes NT canonical books—in spite of the fact it does not cite a single saying of Jesus directly. Most particularly, it relies heavily on the book of Revelation and the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
<p class="h3" id="VirginAssumptionofthe">Virgin, Assumption of the</p>
<p class="fl">A widely circulated legend dealing with the death and translation of the Virgin Mary. None of the many versions is earlier than the fourth century. Most go back to Egypt. In the Coptic versions, Jesus himself appears to Mary before the apostles depart on their missionary labors; Jesus announces her coming death and translation. In the other form an angel makes the announcement. Mary requests the presence of all the apostles, who are miraculously brought on the clouds. Mary is transfigured, and many healings result from contact with her dead body. She is transported to heaven by Jesus shortly after her death.</p>
<p>This legend itself took on a new interest and importance when in 1950 “The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin” was made a part of official Roman Catholic dogma.</p>
<p class="h3" id="VirginLifeofthe">Virgin, Life of the</p>
<p class="fl">There are a number of accounts of the early life and existence of the Virgin Mary. Most of them come to us through Coptic texts. They tell of the birth of Mary to Joachim (also called Cleopas) and Anna, who had been taunted by friends for having no children. Mary was born after a vision of a white dove. In some accounts Mary was dedicated to the Lord and then committed to the care of a man, Joseph. While she was in the house weaving on the veil of the temple, angels would come to minister to her. The annunciation by Gabriel is given at great length. The birth of Jesus is described in detail while Joseph is searching for a midwife, Salome. Other accounts go on to describe tender scenes between Mary and the child Jesus. In some of these versions, there is a reckless identification of the Virgin Mary with all of the other Marys of the Gospels.</p>

  <title>Apollos</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">APOLLOS</p>
<p class="fl">Native of Alexandria (Egypt), a Christian Jew who was an eloquent preacher at the time of the apostle Paul’s missionary journeys. The chief biblical passage about Apollos is <a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-19.1">Acts 18:24–19:1</a>. From Alexandria, Apollos went to Ephesus in Asia Minor. Enthusiastic in spirit, learned and cultured in his ways, well versed in the OT Scriptures, and instructed in the way of the Lord, he began to speak boldly and openly in the synagogue there. Apollos knew and preached accurately about the coming of Jesus but knew of it only from the message of Jesus’ forerunner, John the Baptist. Priscilla and Aquila, Paul’s friends and former associates, heard Apollos speak in Ephesus and realized that he had not heard what had happened to Jesus. They took him aside privately and explained the way of God to him more accurately. Before that, he had been convinced of the value of John’s baptism and John’s message that Jesus was the Messiah. He was evidently uninformed, however, about such teachings as justification by faith in Christ or the work of the Holy Spirit in salvation. At such points, Priscilla and Aquila, having lived and worked with Paul, were able to help Apollos.</p>
<p>Soon after this instruction, Apollos left Ephesus for the Roman province of Achaia in Greece with letters from the Ephesian Christians, urging the disciples in Achaia to welcome him as a Christian brother. On arrival, he vigorously and publicly refuted the Jews, using his great knowledge of the OT Scriptures to prove that Jesus was the Messiah. Paul considered Apollos’s work in Corinth, capital of Achaia, so valuable that he described him as waterer of the seed that Paul had planted as the founder of the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.5-11">1 Cor 3:5-11</a>). From 1 Corinthians it is also clear that one of the factions dividing the Corinthian church was a clique centered around Apollos, although he was not directly responsible for it (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.12">1 Cor 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>). Paul had difficulty convincing Apollos that he should return to Corinth, perhaps because Apollos did not want to encourage the continuance of that little group (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.12">1 Cor 16:12</a>).</p>

  <title>Apostasy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">APOSTASY</p>
<p class="fl">Turning against God, as evidenced by abandonment and repudiation of former beliefs. The term generally refers to a deliberate renouncing of the faith by a once sincere believer rather than a state of ignorance or mistaken knowledge. Apostasy is distinguished from heresy (denial of a part of the faith) and from transfer of allegiance from one religious body to another within the same faith. Also, it is possible to deny the faith, as Peter once did, and then at a later time reaffirm it.</p>
<p>Originally, “apostasy” meant literal rebellion. Thus the Jews were described as “rebels” against King Artaxerxes (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.2.23">1 Esd 2:23</a>) and Jason as a “rebel against the laws” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.6-8">2 Macc 5:6-8</a>). OT descriptions of spiritual rebellion include departure from the law, forsaking temple worship, and willful disobedience toward God himself (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.22">Jos 22:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.19">2 Chr 29:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.19">Jer 2:19</a>). The prophetic writings of Isaiah and Jeremiah provide many examples of Israel’s defections (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.2-4">Is 1:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.19">Jer 2:19</a>). Israelite kings were often guilty of apostasy: Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.22-24">1 Kgs 14:22-24</a>); Ahab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">1 Kgs 16:30-33</a>); Ahaziah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.51-53">1 Kgs 22:51-53</a>); Jehoram (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.6,10">2 Chr 21:6, 10</a>); Ahaz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.1-4">2 Chr 28:1-4</a>); Manasseh (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.1-19">2 Chr 33:1-19</a>); Amon (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.21-23">2 Chr 33:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>In NT times many disciples withdrew from Christ (<a href="?bref=John.6.66">Jn 6:66</a>)—the most notorious example being Judas Iscariot. The Greek word from which “apostasy” is derived appears in only two passages. The apostle Paul was accused of apostasy for teaching others “to turn their backs on the laws of Moses” (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.21">Acts 21:21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). And apostasy is given an eschatological (end times) significance in <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>. Christians were warned not to be carried away and deceived in the widespread apostasy to come in the end times before the Lord’s return. That apostasy is linked to the rise of a man of rebellion who will be Satan’s tool (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-12">2 Thes 2:3-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.1-3">1 Tm 4:1-3</a>).</p>

  <title>Apostle, Apostleship</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">APOSTLE, APOSTLESHIP</p>
<p class="fl">Official designation given to certain leading individuals in the NT churches. Apostleship is the more comprehensive term, denoting the functions of the one who serves in such a capacity. Questions concerning origin, function, and history of the NT apostolate are much debated; one cannot speak of anything like consensus of opinion uniting the various church traditions. Some light is shed on our understanding of the terms by an examination of the possible linguistic and conceptual backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Greek word for “apostle” is not used outside the NT in the same sense as it is in the NT. It is derived from the verb “to send” and is at home in the language of the sea meaning a particular “ship” or “group of ships,” a “marine expedition” or “the leader” of such. Its usage is almost always impersonal and thoroughly passive. There is no hint of personal initiative or authorization, merely the connotation of something being sent. Later papyri use the word to mean “bill” or “invoice” or even a “passport,” continuing to reflect the vocabulary of maritime affairs.</p>
<p>In the NT, the word was used to designate those who had been sent by Jesus with the proclamation of the gospel. From among the wider group of those who followed him, Jesus selected 12 men (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.1-4">Mt 10:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.13-19">Mk 3:13-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.12-16">Lk 6:12-16</a>) who maintained with him a particularly close relationship, receiving private instruction and witnessing his miracles and controversy with the Jewish authorities. On one occasion, Jesus sent these men out to preach the message of repentance, to cast out demons, and to heal the sick; that is, to minister in ways that were characteristic of his own work (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.1-15">Mt 10:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.7-13,30">Mk 6:7-13, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.1-6">Lk 9:1-6</a>). The same relationship is expressed in the saying “He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me” (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.16">Lk 10:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.10.40">Mt 10:40</a>). It is clear that the Twelve are not merely to pass Jesus’ teaching on but to represent his very person. After the resurrection, Jesus commissioned the Twelve (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-20">Mt 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.1-53">Lk 24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.1-21.25">Jn 20–21</a>) to proclaim God’s act in Christ on behalf of all men. Only those who had been with Jesus from the beginning of his ministry to his resurrection were qualified to be his apostolic witnesses (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.21-22">Acts 1:21-22</a>). Paul qualified because he had seen the risen Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.4-10">1 Cor 15:4-10</a>).</p>
<p>The Pauline writings demonstrate two characteristic usages of the word “apostle.” On occasion, it refers to persons authorized by local congregations and entrusted with the safe delivery of specific gifts for other members of the Christian community (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.23">2 Cor 8:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.25">Phil 2:25</a>). More important are those passages where “apostle” takes on a more technical sense through the qualifying phrase “of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1">1 Cor 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1">2 Cor 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.13">11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.1">Gal 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.1">Eph 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.1">Col 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.6">1 Thes 2:6</a>). The “sent one” is the “sent one of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.7">Rom 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1,5">1 Cor 9:1, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28">12:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.17-19">Gal 1:17-19</a>). In the statements where Paul claims his own right to this title, he argues along lines assuming the same basic apostolic concept that Jesus had. He consistently links this claim to a specific event in the past in which the risen Lord had appeared to him (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1">1 Cor 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.12,16">Gal 1:12, 16</a>). This appearance he ranked alongside those of the resurrection appearances (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3-8">1 Cor 15:3-8</a>). Paul understood his experience outside Damascus (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-19">Acts 9:1-19a</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-16">22:6-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.12-18">26:12-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.17">Gal 1:17</a>) as a lifelong commission to preach the now-resurrected One (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17">1 Cor 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.1-2">2:1-2</a>) chiefly among the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.15">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.15">22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.17,23">26:17, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.15-16">Gal 1:15-16</a>). It was through his preaching ministry that Christ continued to work, creating the new people of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1-2">1 Cor 9:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.8">Gal 2:8</a>).</p>

As used by some biblical scholars, the term “apothegm” denotes brief stories in the Gospels that culminate in a saying of Jesus (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.8.18-22">Mt 8:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.10-13">9:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.18-22">Mk 2:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.13-15">10:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.1-5">Lk 6:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.37-44">11:37-44</a>). Also known as “pronouncement stories,” the apothegmata (plural) are devoid of a larger historical setting and contain only enough detail to make the saying of Jesus intelligible. Because such stories were used in worship, in the education of new Christians, and in the correction of false teachings, they were of great interest to the early church.</p>

  <title>Appian Way</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">APPIAN WAY</p>
<p class="fl">Main highway from Rome southward to the heel of the Italian peninsula. Originally the Appian Way terminated at Capua, but later it was extended to Brundisium, about 350 miles (560 kilometers) from Rome. It received its name from Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began its construction in 312 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Appian Way is referred to by the ancient writers Livy, Strabo, Horace, and others in a variety of contexts. Portions of the road still exist today south of Rome, with the original Roman paving intact in many places. Ruins of some structures built along the original road are also in evidence.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul traveled on the Appian Way on his journey to Rome after disembarking from a ship at Puteoli (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.13-15">Acts 28:13-15</a>). Christians from Rome came out to meet him in the vicinity of Three Taverns and the Appii Forum (“marketplace of Appius”). These were two of eight major stations known to have existed along the Appian Way. The Appii Forum was located 43 miles (70 kilometers) from Rome in the middle of the Pontine Marshes. Horace, writing in 65–68 <span class="era">BC</span>, complained of the noise and stench that assaulted those who stayed there. Three Taverns was located 10 miles (16 kilometers) closer to Rome.</p>
<p>As Paul traveled on, he would have passed Bovillae, a village located about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Rome. This village was the ancestral home and cult center of the family of Caesar Augustus. Much of the Appian Way from Bovillae to Rome was lined with tombs. Roman law forbade burials within the city of Rome, so it became common practice to bury the dead beside the major roads leading into the city.</p>

Around the forum was a region of swamp and marsh, notorious in the ancient world for bad water, mosquitoes, expensive taverns for travelers, nighttime noisy traffic of cargoes and passengers on mule-drawn barges along a canal cut through the area. The Appian Way passes through the Appius Forum about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Rome.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">AQUEDUCT</p>
<p class="fl">Conduit or artificial channel for conducting water from a distance, usually by means of gravity; also a structure carrying a conduit or canal across a valley or over a river.</p>
<p>In Palestine most cities were situated near an abundant water supply so that in time of siege, water would be available. Ancient tunnels for the conveyance of water have been found at Gezer. The Jebusites, inhabitants of the area that later became Jerusalem, seem to have constructed some sort of aqueduct to bring rainwater into the city (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.8">2 Sm 5:8</a>). By the time of King Hezekiah there existed a “conduit of the upper pool” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17">2 Kgs 18:17</a>). In anticipation of throwing off the Assyrian yoke, Hezekiah made a 1,777-foot (541.4-meter) tunnel through the hill of Ophel to carry water from the Gihon spring to the pool of Siloam (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.9-11">Is 22:9-11</a>). The famous “Siloam inscription” describes how it was done.</p>
<p>It is also known that two aqueducts, 13 and 41 miles (21 and 66 kilometers) in length, brought water into Jerusalem. They merged at the Roman reservoirs near Bethlehem. On reaching the city, the water was carried to the temple area by means of underground pipes (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1">Ez 47:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.18">Jl 3:18</a>). In NT times, the Jewish historian Josephus stated Pontius Pilate appropriated some “Corban” money from the temple treasury for work on an aqueduct. Three “pools of Solomon,” which are of Roman design, were probably constructed with part of those funds.</p>
<p>Other cities of Bible times served by ancient aqueducts were Tyre, Samaria, Caesarea (Roman capital of the province), Jericho, and Ephesus in Asia Minor. The Romans brought the science of aqueduct engineering to a fine art. The Appia (312 <span class="era">BC</span>) was 10.3 miles (16.6 kilometers) long, and the Ano Vetus (272 <span class="era">BC</span>) was over 32 miles (51.5 kilometers) long. Both were underground channels that brought water into the city of Rome.</p>

  <title>Arabah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ARABAH</p>
<p class="fl">Great valley dividing eastern and western Palestine. The Arabah extends south from the Sea of Galilee through the Jordan River valley to the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. Commonly known as the Rift Valley, the Arabah is about 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide and 200 miles (322 kilometers) long. The Dead Sea, located in the Arabah, is the lowest point on the earth’s inland surface, 1,275 feet (388.5 meters) below sea level.</p>
<p>In general the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">arabah</span> means a wasteland or barren district. North of the Dead Sea to the Sea of Galilee, the valley is referred to by the Arabs as the Ghor (“depression”) and south of the Dead Sea as the Arabah.</p>
<p>In the OT the name Arabah is sometimes applied to the entire length of the valley, though at times the southern portion is alluded to (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.1">Dt 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.8">2:8</a>), and elsewhere the northeast portion is indicated (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.17">Dt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.49">4:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.2">Jos 11:2</a>). It could refer to the portion east of the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.49">Dt 4:49</a>) or to the part west of the river (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.16">Jos 11:16</a>) or to the Jordan River valley (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.7">2 Sm 4:7</a>). In the Hebrew OT, the plural of Arabah <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">Arboth</span><span class="ital">)</span> is found 17 times, and its meaning is “plains”—referring to the portion of the Arabah near Jericho or Moab. The Dead Sea is sometimes referred to as the Sea of the Arabah or Sea of the Plain (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">2 Kgs 14:25</a>). For the most part the section of the Arabah north of the Dead Sea was, and is today, fertile and productive.</p>
<p>It was from the Arabah that Joshua led the campaign to conquer Jericho. Abner fled to the northern Arabah after being defeated at Gibeon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.29">2 Sm 2:29</a>). The murderers of Ishbosheth crossed the area to bring his head to David at Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.7">2 Sm 4:7</a>), and Zedekiah was fleeing to the area when he was captured by the Babylonians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.4">2 Kgs 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.39.4">Jer 39:4</a>).</p>
<p>The southern Arabah was the scene of Israel’s wanderings before entering the Promised Land. Farther north, the Arabah was the site of the final acts of Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-36.13">Nm 32–36</a>), who died and was buried in the Arabah (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.1">Dt 1:1</a>) in the plains of Moab east of the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.1-6">Dt 34:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>South of the Dead Sea there were deposits of iron and copper, and <a href="?bref=Deut.8.9">Deuteronomy 8:9</a> may allude to this general area when it speaks of “a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper.” The land here is generally barren, though in ancient times careful use of irrigation made agriculture possible to a limited extent. Several important trade routes have passed through this area. The Arabah around the Dead Sea, prior to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, was once an especially fertile area, “like the garden of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.10">Gn 13:10</a>).</p>
<p>The rejuvenation of this area is one of the subjects of prophetic promise. Ezekiel speaks of a great river that will spring from the temple and go down into the Arabah, making the waters of the sea fresh and creating a healthy environment for fish and other living creatures (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1-12">Ez 47:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.18">Jl 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.8">Zec 14:8</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Palestine_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Palestine</a>.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">ARABIA, ARABS</p>
<p class="fl">Peninsula in southwestern Asia, surrounded by sea on three sides and by the Fertile Crescent on the fourth. Politically, the Arabian peninsula is bounded on the north by the modern Hashemite kingdom of Jordan and by Iraq and on the south by the Indian Ocean. The Persian Gulf forms its eastern boundary and the Red Sea its western boundary. Its area is just over a million square miles (1,609,000 square kilometers), about one-third the area of the United States.</p>
<p>Classical geographers such as Strabo followed the example set by the geographer Ptolemy in dividing Arabia into three divisions: <span class="ital">Arabia Petraea</span> (Rocky Arabia) in the northwest, which included Sinai, Edom, Moab, and Transjordan; <span class="ital">Arabia Deserta,</span> which included the Syrian Desert; and <span class="ital">Arabia Felix</span> (Happy Arabia), which included the southern section of the Arabian peninsula.</p>
<p>When “Arabia” is used as a geographical term in the Bible, it sometimes includes both northern and southern sections. For example, <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.14">2 Chronicles 9:14</a> says that the kings of Arabia brought gold to Solomon as tribute. At other times the name Arabia refers only to the northwestern <span class="ital">Arabia Petraea.</span> For example, Paul said that after his conversion he went away to the deserts of Arabia (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.17">Gal 1:17</a>) and referred to Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.25">4:25</a>), which is in that northwestern area. Many places named in the Bible as being in Arabia are more specifically in <span class="ital">Arabia Petraea.</span> Such sites include Buz, Dedan, Dumah, Ephah, the Hazor of <a href="?bref=Jer.49.28-33">Jeremiah 49:28-33</a>, Massa, Mesha, and Midian. Hazarmaveth, Ophir, Sabtah, Sephar, Sheba, and Uzal are in the south. Havilah and Parvaim are perhaps in the northeast, and authorities debate the location of Seba. The land of Uz, mentioned in the book of Job, is considered by many scholars to be located in the area between Edom and northern Arabia.</p>
<p>Arabia is thought by many to be one of the hottest countries. In some sections that conception is correct. The peninsula lies between seas on the east and west, but those bodies of water are too small to break the climatic continuity of the dry African-Asian continental masses. There are, however, some regions that enjoy temperate and semitropical climate. In the south much of the land is sufficiently elevated to avoid the intensity of tropical heat. The lowlands along the coast have a semitropical environment. Fogs and dews are common in the humid regions, but over inner Arabia the sun shines the year round, obscured only by an occasional sandstorm or an even rarer rain shower.</p>
<p>Arabia has long been desired for natural resources. Pharaohs of the first dynasty operated turquoise mines in Sinai, and the gold of Ophir and the frankincense and myrrh of South Arabia were world renowned. The queen of Sheba brought such precious spices to Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2,10">1 Kgs 10:2, 10</a>), and trade between Israel and Arabia flourished. Solomon had a seaport at Ezion-geber on the Red Sea for his opulent commerce with Ophir (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">1 Kgs 9:26-28</a>). King Jehoshaphat of Judah, who also received tribute from Arabs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.11">2 Chr 17:11</a>), tried to revive trade with Ophir but failed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48">1 Kgs 22:48</a>).</p>
<p>Tribes associated with Arabia played a significant role in biblical history. The Ishmaelites or Midianites who took Joseph to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-36">Gn 37:25-36</a>) were Arabians. So were the Amalekites who waged war with Moses in the wilderness of <span class="ital">Arabia Petraea</span> (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">Ex 17:8-16</a>). Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro, was a Midianite (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.1">Ex 18:1</a>). King Uzziah of Judah fought against Arabs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.7">2 Chr 26:7</a>); the Meunites mentioned in the same verse were probably also from Arabia. Geshem the Arab, known also from secular inscriptions, resisted the rebuilding of the Jerusalem wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">Neh 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1,6">6:1, 6</a>).</p>
<p>Kedar was an important North Arab tribe condemned in Isaiah’s message about Arabia (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.13-17">Is 21:13-17</a>). Jeremiah also spoke against it, prophesying its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, who conquered it (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.28-33">Jer 49:28-33</a>). Close allies of the tribe of Kedar were the Nabatean Arabs (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.7">Is 60:7</a>), who figure prominently in later history. They captured Petra, fulfilling the prophecy of Obadiah about Edom. References to Arabia and the Arabs in the Apocrypha and NT concern mostly the Nabatean Arabs (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.16">1 Macc 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.17">Gal 1:17</a>).</p>
<p>In southern Arabia four kingdoms developed: the Sabean, Minean, Qataban, and Hadramaut. Around 115 <span class="era">BC</span> the Himyarite kingdom gained control of southern Arabia, keeping it until about <span class="era">AD</span> 300. Three centuries later the Arabian peninsula witnessed the birth of Islam.</p>

<p class="h1">ARAD (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a Canaanite settlement or region in the Negev Desert at the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan. The king of Arad attacked the Israelites and was defeated (<a href="?bref=Num.21.1-3">Nm 21:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.40">33:40</a>). Consequently the Israelites renamed the place Hormah (“destruction”). Arad was later conquered by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.14">Jos 12:14</a>).</p>
<p>Until recently archaeologists thought this Arad was the modern Tell Arad. Excavations at Tell Arad, however, have shown that this site was uninhabited at the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Some scholars have suggested that the Arad mentioned in Numbers and Joshua was a region and not a specific place. Others say there were two Arads, the Canaanite city located possibly at Tell Malhata about 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) southwest of Tell Arad, and the Israelite city located at modern Tell Arad. This second suggestion is supported by an inscription of Shishak, an Egyptian pharaoh (940?–915 <span class="era">BC</span>), which indicates that two cities named Arad existed during the early first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The only possible mention of modern Tell Arad is in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Judges 1:16</a>, where Arad is used as a reference point for the land settled by the Kenites. Tell Arad had been a large important city during the early Bronze Age, but after being destroyed around 2600 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was not reoccupied until shortly before 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>. From the time of King Solomon (970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>) until the Jews were taken into exile, Tell Arad served as a fortified citadel on Judah’s southern border.</p>
<p>Several interesting discoveries were made during the excavation of Tell Arad. An Israelite sanctuary was uncovered that is very similar in plan to the tabernacle and the temple, with an altar of the dimensions described in <a href="?bref=Exod.27.1">Exodus 27:1</a>. It has been suggested that this sanctuary might have served as the worship center of the Kenite clan. Tell Arad has also provided us with a number of inscribed potsherds, called ostraca. One such ostracon contains a reference to the “house of Yahweh,” a possible reference to the temple in Jerusalem.</p>

  <title>Aramaic</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ARAMAIC</p>
<p class="fl">One of the three original languages of the Bible, found in sections of the book of Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.4-7.28">2:4b–7:28</a>) and Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.8-6.18">4:8–6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.12-26">7:12-26</a>). Aramaic phrases and expressions also appear in Genesis (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.47">31:47</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.11">10:11</a>), and the NT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentUse">Old Testament Use</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic is linguistically very close to Hebrew and similar in structure. Aramaic texts in the Bible are written in the same script as Hebrew. In contrast to Hebrew, Aramaic uses a larger vocabulary, including many loan words, and a greater variety of connectives. It also contains an elaborate system of tenses, developed through the use of participles with pronouns or with various forms of the verb “to be.” Although Aramaic is less euphonious and poetical than Hebrew, it is probably superior as a vehicle of exact expression.</p>
<p>Aramaic has perhaps the longest continuous living history of any language known. It was used during the Bible’s patriarchal period and is still spoken by a few people today. Aramaic and its cognate, Syriac, evolved into many dialects in different places and periods. Characterized by simplicity, clarity, and precision, it adapted easily to the various needs of everyday life. It could serve equally well as a language for scholars, pupils, lawyers, or merchants. Some have described it as the Semitic equivalent of English.</p>
<p>The origin of Aramaic is unknown, but it seems to have been closely related to Amorite and possibly to other ancient northwest Semitic dialects barely known to scholars. Although an Aramean kingdom as such never really existed, various Aramean “states” developed into influential centers. A few short Aramean inscriptions from that era (10th to 8th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>) have been found and studied.</p>
<p>By the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, King Hezekiah’s representatives requested the spokesmen of the Assyrian king Sennacherib to “speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.26">2 Kgs 18:26</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). By the Persian period, Aramaic had become the language of international trade. During their captivity, the Jews probably adopted it for convenience—certainly in commerce—while Hebrew became confined to the learned and to religious leaders.</p>
<p>Gradually, especially after the Babylonian exile, Aramaic influence pervaded the land of Palestine. Nehemiah complained that children from mixed marriages were unable to speak Hebrew (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.24">Neh 13:24</a>). The Jews seem to have continued using Aramaic widely during the Persian, Greek, and Roman periods. Eventually the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Aramaic paraphrases, called Targums, some of which have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentUse">New Testament Use</p>
<p class="fl">In popular thought, Aramaic was the common language of Palestine during the time of Jesus. Yet that is by no means certain and probably is an oversimplification of the linguistic situation of that time. Names used in the NT reflect Aramaic (Bartholomew, Bar-Jonah, Barnabas), Greek (Andrew, Philip), and Latin (Mark), as well as Hebrew. There is no question that Aramaic was widely used, as were Greek and Hebrew. Latin was probably limited to military and governmental circles. Mishnaic Hebrew, a common kind of everyday Hebrew dialect, was also used in Jesus’ day; Mishnaic Hebrew documents have been discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p>What was the “Hebrew” referred to in certain NT passages (<a href="?bref=John.5.2">Jn 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.13,17,20">19:13, 17, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.16">20:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">Rv 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.16">16:16</a>)? The languages used for the inscription put on Jesus’ cross were “Hebrew, Latin, and Greek” (<a href="?bref=John.19.19-20">Jn 19:19-20</a>). Later, the apostle Paul was said to speak “Hebrew” (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.2">Acts 22:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.14">26:14</a>). The exact dialect he spoke may be debated, but as a Pharisee he was undoubtedly able to read the Hebrew of the OT. The Greek word for “Hebrew” is sometimes translated “Aramaic” and may be a general term for Semitic, or for a blend of Hebrew-Aramaic (as Yiddish is German-Hebrew). At any rate, Aramaic served as a transition from Hebrew to Greek as the language spoken by Jews in Jesus’ day. In that sense Aramaic connects OT Hebrew with NT Greek.</p>

Agri Dagh (Turkish for “Mountain of Trouble”) is one peak 17,000 feet (5,180 meters) high to which local tribesmen have given the name Kohl Nu, that is, Mt of Noah.

The plague from the Lord had come upon Israel as a result of King David’s prideful census. At the instruction of the prophet Gad, the repentant David purchased the floor and built an altar to the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.17-25">2 Sm 24:17-25</a>). Araunah offered oxen and everything needed for the altar as a gift, but David insisted on paying him, saying, “I cannot present burnt offerings to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God that have cost me nothing” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.24">2 Sm 24:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). A parallel account (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.15-16">1 Chr 21:15-16</a>) uses the Hebrew form Ornan for the Jebusite’s foreign name. David was in too much of a hurry to go to the tabernacle to make his sacrifice, the tabernacle and altar being farther away on the hill of Gibeon (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.27-30">1 Chr 21:27-30</a>). David chose the threshing floor as the site for the temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.22.1">1 Chr 22:1</a>), and Solomon built it there on Mt Moriah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.3.1">2 Chr 3:1</a>).

  <body>
<p class="h1">ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE BIBLE*</p>
<p class="fl">Simply defined, archaeology is the science that recovers and studies the relics of human antiquity. Biblical archaeology is concerned with the remains scattered across the Near East. Some lie buried at different levels in mounds; others survive as ruins or weathered monuments to past grandeur. Many of the artifacts bear inscriptions of sorts in a variety of ancient languages, some of which still need much study to be understood properly. Other artifacts comprise the material remains of everyday life; broken pottery bowls, charred timbers, trinkets, toys, ornaments, occasional fragments of cloth, rusted weapons, perhaps only the imprint of a woven mat. All must be interpreted carefully in the light of what is known about the period of history from which the objects have been recovered.</p>
<p>Many outstanding archaeological discoveries have been entirely accidental. At Ras Shamra in Syria, a peasant’s plow struck a tomb that led to the discovery of the ancient site of Ugarit. A Bedouin in search of a lost goat discovered the cave at Qumran that contained the Dead Sea Scrolls. In 1887 an Egyptian woman found the Amarna tablets while seeking decomposed bricks for use as fertilizer. In 1945 Egyptians hunting bird manure in caves near Nag Hammadi discovered important Coptic Gnostic manuscripts. Such chance finds, however, are no substitute for systematic surveys.</p>
<p>In modern archaeology potential sites are surveyed carefully, generally photographed from the air, and tested for metals and other underground anomalies by the use of complex electronic equipment. Recovered artifacts are dated according to the level where they occurred in the site and by other methods, including radiocarbon dating. The purpose is to present a chronologically accurate picture of the artifacts and also of the site itself.</p>
<p>The archaeologist and the Near Eastern scholar look at this testimony to ancient life in the realization that they are dealing with factual, objective data. Although there is obviously room for some speculation or difference of opinion, the objects being handled are silent but nevertheless real witnesses to people and events of the past. The relics, therefore, need to be understood in their own right as evidence and must not be manipulated to suit the fancies of some speculative interpretation of history, culture, or religion. Near Eastern archaeology is able to help us understand Scripture by providing objective background data. If, for example, an artifact containing pictographic or other forms of writing can be dated to around 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>, that alone tells us that written communications in the locality date back to at least that period. The antiquity of writing is now known to be such that all the early authors of OT material could easily have composed and written down all the narratives credited to them. Thus it is no longer necessary to suppose that Moses could not have written the Pentateuch (first five books of the Bible) on the ground that writing had not been invented in his day. In fact, archaeological discoveries have shown that Moses could, and probably did, write in Egyptian hieroglyphics, Babylonian cuneiform, and several Canaanite dialects (of which biblical Hebrew is one). Any theory of Pentateuchal composition that ignores such factual information is obviously wrong in a fundamentally important area.</p>

<p class="fl">The kind of housing in which the ancients lived has been revealed from excavations at many Near Eastern sites. Neolithic (late Stone Age) dwellings were often simple “wattle-huts” of interwoven sticks, though some showed evidence of artistic interior decoration. The elegant middle-class home at Ur in the time of Abram was attractive even by modern standards. The magnificence of ancient palaces at such sites as Knossos, Persepolis, Mari, and Qantir is abundantly evident even from the ruins. Weaving is now known to be one of the oldest human crafts; the two types of knots used today in making oriental rugs originated in Mesopotamia in the remote past. Of similar antiquity was the manufacture of pottery, glazed and unglazed, some plain and some decorated.</p>
<p>Obscure social customs in Scripture have been illustrated by archaeological discoveries. Abram’s procreation of a child by Hagar, his wife’s servant, was in conformity with local customs at Nuzi and was not regarded as immoral. The adoption of Eliezer by Abram (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2-4">Gn 15:2-4</a>) is clarified by texts from Nuzi that permitted childless couples to adopt sons who, in return for certain duties to the parents, would inherit the family estate. Such children had the inheritance rights of the firstborn, but their rights could be modified if the adopting parents subsequently had their own children. Texts from Nuzi, Ugarit, and Alalakh show that heads of families could disregard the natural order and choose any one of the sons to inherit firstborn rights (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.48.13-22">Gn 48:13-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.3-4">49:3-4</a>). Nuzi tablets indicate that such rights could be traded between various members of the family, which accounts for the transaction between Esau and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.31-34">Gn 25:31-34</a>).</p>
<p>Work of all kinds in the biblical period has been illustrated from many sources. The Beni Hasan tableau (1900 <span class="era">BC</span>) shows traveling Semites bringing goods to Egypt. On one of the animals is a set of portable bellows, suggesting that the travelers may have been metalworkers. Other trades and occupations illustrated from monuments and paintings include hunting, fishing, brick making, various types of agricultural work, pottery making, and other domestic crafts. Such sources also provide valuable information about the way the ancients dressed. Men pictured on the Beni Hasan tableau were bearded and wore short skirts and sandals. Women had long, multicolored dresses fastened at the shoulder with a clasp. They wore shoes and kept their flowing hair in place by means of bands. Another Egyptian painting, dated 500 years later and showing Semites bringing gifts to the pharaoh, indicates that clothing styles had barely changed at all. These illustrations come from lands other than Palestine; the Israelites were forbidden to make representations of human beings or God.</p>
<p>The most common traces of everyday life are potsherds, broken pottery pieces that were discarded in great quantities in settled areas and that can still be found today. Such fragments were often used as materials on which short messages were written, as illustrated by an important group of letters dating from the time of the prophet Jeremiah. The “Lachish letters” were actually military dispatches written in 587 <span class="era">BC</span> from an outpost north of Lachish to one of the officers defending Lachish itself. Centuries later in NT times potsherds were still popular as writing materials because they were more durable than Egyptian papyrus and more convenient than waxed writing boards. Rectangular wooden palettes with a slot for the rush pens and rounded hollows for the little tablets of red and black ink have been found in Egypt. Remains of some of the ink actually used in writing the Dead Sea Scrolls have been recovered from the settlement at Qumran.</p>
<p>In antiquity, various games were played by children and adults alike. From a tomb at Beni Hasan (c. 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>) came a painting of pigtailed Egyptian girls keeping several balls up in the air at once. A relief in a temple at Thebes showed Ramses III playing draughts (checkers) with a concubine. Egyptian children of a later period played a game using pebbles that was perhaps the ancestor of backgammon. From Megiddo came an ivory gaming board with holes, presumably for pegs (c. 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>). Children’s toys recovered from Near Eastern sites include whistles, leather-covered balls, model chariots, and animals on wheels, showing that tastes have changed very little over the ages. Adult sports such as wrestling, archery, and running were depicted in Egyptian tomb paintings.</p>
<p>The embalming of Jacob and Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.2-3,26">Gn 50:2-3, 26</a>) represented a social custom of long standing in Egypt and is thoroughly consistent with the background of the narrative. Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah with Sarah, Abraham, and others; although the site is well known, it cannot be excavated because it is venerated by the Arabs as the sacred resting place of their ancestor Abraham.</p>
<p>An inscription associated with an ancient Hebrew burial site was found in the Russian Museum on the Mt of Olives in 1931. At some point it had been removed from the grave site. It reads, “Hither were brought the bones of Uzziah king of Judah—do not open.” The inscription came from Christ’s time, suggesting that the original tomb of the great ruler had been found during excavations in Jerusalem and that the remains had been transferred to another site. Archaeologists have shown that the kind of stone door covering the entrance to Christ’s tomb was in fashion chiefly from about 100 <span class="era">BC</span> to about <span class="era">AD</span> 100, which is consistent with the Gospel records.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ArchaeologyandReligion">Archaeology and Religion</p>
<p class="fl">Archaeological excavations have done much to indicate the nature of biblical religion and worship. Long before Abram left Ur at the command of the one true God, pagan Mesopotamian peoples worshiped individual gods and recognized them as celestial deities or “sky gods.” There is thus nothing inherently impossible or improbable about the relationship of the Hebrew patriarchs to the God whom they served and venerated. The worship of heathen deities in portable shrines has been illustrated from a relief of Ramses II, which showed the divine tent in the middle of the Egyptian encampment. In addition, seventhcentury BC Phoenician writings referred to a portable shrine pulled by oxen. The Israelite wilderness tabernacle thus fits properly into that kind of background and is not of comparatively late origin, as was once supposed.</p>
<p>The tradition of singers participating in preexilic worship has been verified by archaeological discoveries indicating that for centuries the Palestinians had been noted for their musical abilities. Tablets from Ras Shamra (Ugarit) are full of religious poetry, some of which contains phrases similar to expressions in the Hebrew psalms. Solomon’s temple was built by Phoenician (Canaanite) workmen according to a ground plan (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1-38">1 Kgs 6</a>) similar to that of the eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> chapel found at Tel Tainat in Syria. The Wailing Wall in Jerusalem is thought to contain stones going back to Nehemiah’s time, but no traces of Solomon’s foundations have yet been uncovered in the city. Pieces of masonry from Herod’s temple, demolished in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, have come to light and furnish interesting factual information about the appearance of contemporary pillars and supporting structures. Though there were supposedly many synagogues in Palestine in Christ’s time, few remains of any significance have survived.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ArchaeologyandWarfare">Archaeology and Warfare</p>
<p class="fl">Understanding of ancient warfare, a prominent biblical theme, has been assisted greatly by the work of archaeologists. Ancient Near Eastern peoples regarded war as conflict between the gods of the opposing nations. Military service was therefore regarded as a sacred calling, and soldiers were members of an honored profession. In his capacity as Lord of hosts, God was the commander in chief of the Hebrew army; he could order a city to be given up to the “ban,” that is, to complete destruction (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.6.17,24">Jos 6:17, 24</a>). War was waged according to well-understood rules. An enemy threatening the safety of a city would normally send its inhabitants a demand for surrender. If it was accepted, all lives were spared, though property would be plundered. If the demand was rejected, the besieged city dwellers knew that if their defenses were breached, they might all be killed. Frontal assaults, spies, ambushes, and armed patrols were all used in warfare. Sometimes battles were decided by the outcome of combat between champions (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.38-54">1 Sm 17:38-54</a>).</p>
<p>Ancient armor was pictured widely on reliefs and monuments, supplementing the artifacts that have been recovered. A magnificent golden helmet from Ur is an outstanding example of Sumerian military equipment, contrasting with the much smaller Hittite helmets depicted on a tomb wall at Karnak. Metal helmets (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.38">1 Sm 17:38</a>) were worn initially only by leaders in the Israelite armies, but by Seleucid times all Hebrew soldiers were issued bronze helmets (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.6.35">1 Macc 6:35</a>). Roman legionnaires commonly wore either leather or bronze helmets. The Hebrews used two kinds of shields: a large one protected the whole body and was designed for use by infantry; the other, smaller one was carried by archers (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.14.8">2 Chr 14:8</a>). Such shields were generally of wood-and-leather construction, though occasionally made of bronze. Coats of scale armor (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.46.4">Jer 46:4</a>) were used in the Near East from at least the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>, as indicated by the recovery of such scales from Alalakh and Ugarit. Swords and spears, a normal part of Hebrew weaponry, came in a variety of shapes and sizes, as illustrated on monuments and bas-reliefs. Furnaces used for manufacturing swords were found at Gerar; Bronze Age daggers have been recovered from Lachish and Megiddo. The compound Asiatic bow, made of wood, horn, and tendons attached to iron limbs, was the successor of the Semitic weapon depicted on the Beni Hasan tableau. Discovery of names inscribed on arrowheads dating between 1300 and 900 <span class="era">BC</span> seems to indicate the existence of companies of archers (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.21.17">Is 21:17</a>). Very little is said in the NT about contemporary military equipment.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ArchaeologyandLiterature">Archaeology and Literature</p>
<p class="fl">Many types of biblical literature have been paralleled in counterparts discovered in the Near East. Excavators at Ras Shamra found poetic and prose tablets that contain grammatical and literary forms occurring in the Hebrew psalms. It is now incorrect to suppose that detailed law codes such as those in the Pentateuch were not compiled until after the time of Moses, because fragmentary Sumerian codes dating from about the 19th century <span class="era">BC</span> exhibit the same legislative tendencies. The code of the Babylonian ruler Hammurabi (18th century <span class="era">BC</span>), based on earlier Sumerian legislation, expanded the principles of justice into nearly 300 sections. Hammurabi’s code was an attempt to stabilize contemporary society on the basis of law and order. Its style is interesting; it commenced with a poetic prologue, followed by the prose legal section, and concluded with a prose epilogue. This three-part literary pattern also appears in the book of Job (prose-poetry-prose), as well as in more modern writings.</p>
<p>The covenant structure of <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">Exodus 20:1-17</a> and its fuller form in Deuteronomy have been examined in light of the literary structure of second-millennium <span class="era">BC</span> Hittite vassal treaties from Boghazkôy. The treaties were drawn up according to a standard pattern, the elements of which occur wholly or in part in the various OT covenantal passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">Ex 20:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lv 18:1-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.1-31.30">Dt 1:1–31:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-37">Jer 31:31-37</a>).</p>
<p>What appear to be 11 Mesopotamian tablet forms in Genesis can be isolated by the recurrence of the phrase “these are the generations of” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> and some modern versions. The phrase and its accompanying material correspond to the colophon (notation about a publication, often found on the very last page of modern books) of undamaged Mesopotamian tablets. Genealogical material such as occurs in Genesis was also found on clay tablets from Nuzi. The terse style of the earlier Genesis historical accounts is reminiscent of Sumerian history writing.</p>
<p>Hebrew wisdom literature such as Proverbs has been paralleled from Egypt by the “Instruction of Amenemope,” where <a href="?bref=Pr.22.17-24.22">Proverbs 22:17–24:22</a> in particular is close in content to the Egyptian material. Scholars have yet to decide if one depended on the other, or if both went back to an even earlier source that has not survived.</p>
<p>The epistolary (letter) form was a common feature of the ancient world (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-27">2 Sm 11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-29">1 Kgs 21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.10,20">2 Kgs 5:10, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6-7">Ezr 4:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.7">Neh 2:7</a>). Many collections of Egyptian papyri, such as the Zenon documents, consisted of letters. Among the Greeks the letter form dated back to Plato. His <span class="ital">Seventh Letter</span> (c. 354 <span class="era">BC</span>) is interesting because it attempted to rebut contemporary misunderstandings of his teaching and personal behavior. Certain of the apostle Paul’s letters (Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, Thessalonians) also stand in that general tradition. Paul’s Letter to Philemon corresponds closely to papyrus letters from Egypt of a purely personal nature.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ArchaeologyandLanguage">Archaeology and Language</p>
<p class="fl">Recovery of many ancient Near Eastern languages has done much to clarify our understanding of the OT. Expressions now known to be Sumerian and Akkadian occur not only in Genesis but elsewhere in the Scriptures. Thus in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</a> the phrase “the heavens and the earth” is a Sumerian expression <span class="ital">(an-ki)</span> meaning “universe”; the pair of antonyms (words opposite in meaning) expresses totality. <a href="?bref=Rev.22.13">Revelation 22:13</a> uses this literary device to express the same concept in three different ways.</p>
<p>Ugaritic and Eblaic, both west Semitic dialects, are closely related to Hebrew and contain striking literary similarities. Reference to archaic Ugaritic expressions has made it possible to translate properly some obscure Hebrew poetic language that is now seen to have preserved genuine ancient Canaanite phraseology.</p>
<p>Aramaic, another northwest Semitic language, was spoken in the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, and is represented in the OT principally by chapters in Ezra and Daniel. These were written in imperial Aramaic, as are the Elephantine papyri of the fifth and fourth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. It is now known, on the basis of the Aramaic used, to be linguistically incorrect to assign a late date to either Ezra or Daniel.</p>
<p>The NT was written in <span class="greek">koine</span><span class="ital">,</span> or “common” Greek, the language of the Near East and the Roman Empire. NT common Greek differs from other Greek dialects in containing underlying Semitic expressions, which are frequently unrecognized and therefore mistranslated by the unwary.</p>
<p>From the foregoing it is evident that archaeological discoveries have done much to enlarge our knowledge of the ancient world. Even with the limited data at our disposal it is possible to see the men and women of Scripture as real persons, living mostly in times of stress and uncertainty but often enjoying a high degree of culture unmatched until modern times. We see such persons as they should be seen—not as mythical or legendary figures, but as true children of their age, grappling with life’s problems and catching periodically a vision of God as all powerful and all holy, guiding the destinies of individuals and nations and bringing his purposes to pass in history. Archaeology has shown that the Hebrews must never be studied separately from other ancient Near Eastern peoples but instead must be seen as one element of a vast cultural complex that included such diverse peoples as the Sumerians and the Aegeans.</p>
<p>Such study must be pursued in a consistently objective fashion, arguing from relevant evidence to a proper understanding of biblical events and life. It is sometimes difficult to reconcile certain accepted interpretations of archaeological data and the evidence of Scripture. Such conflicts are few in number, however, and tend to diminish noticeably as new information is forthcoming. In principle the archaeologist has no particular interest in “proving the truth” of the Scriptures, and it is obviously impossible for a spade or a trowel to prove or disprove the spiritual revelations and assertions of Scripture. But it is fair to say that archaeology validates Hebrew history and explains many formerly obscure terms and traditions in both the OT and NT. It thus provides an authentic background for the prophecies culminating in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="h1">ARCHER, ARCHERY</p>
<p class="fl">The archer used bow and arrows in peace and war. Nomads (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.20">Gn 21:20</a>), hunters (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.3">Gn 27:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.24">Is 7:24</a>), raiders (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.22">Gn 48:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.12">Jos 24:12</a>), and warriors (<a href="?bref=Ezek.39.9">Ez 39:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.1.7">Hos 1:7</a>) used this weapon throughout the biblical period. The efficiency of the bow and the making of arrows improved tremendously over the centuries. The finest bow was the “composite bow,” made from strips and bands of sinew glued to the parts furthermost from the core with animal horn glued to the inner surface. The best of these bows could fire arrows from 300 to 400 yards (274 to 366 meters). The archer needed to be a strong person to string and operate it.</p>
<p>While the archer used the bow for hunting, it was particularly useful in war. Saul and Jonathan fought with sword and bow (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.4">1 Sm 18:4</a>), and David’s army contained skilled bowmen (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.2">1 Chr 12:2</a>).

<p>Job used the metaphor of God’s archers round about him when describing his many bodily ailments (<a href="?bref=Job.16.13">Jb 16:13</a>).

<p class="h1">ARCHITECTURE</p>
<p class="fl">Science, art, or profession of designing and constructing buildings, bridges, etc. Architecture is the practice of combining construction and art in order to produce “beauty with purpose.” The architect’s synthesis of creative imagination and technical skill produces structures of interest, unity, power, and convenience. When we look at a building, monument, or tomb, we are examining its art as well as its structure.</p>
<p>Special types of architecture are mentioned in Scripture, including houses, structures in particular cities, and, of course, the temples. All were influenced by the empires that dominated Israel at the time. It is therefore important to examine the architecture of empires associated with Bible history to understand the architecture of Palestine.</p>

<p class="h2" id="SumerianArchitecture">Sumerian Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">Architecture was first developed by the Sumerians, a people of non-Semitic origin. They may have settled on the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf a thousand years before moving northward to the mainland. From the beginning of their culture the Sumerians regarded architecture as an important artistic endeavor. It found its fullest expression in the building of temples. The Sumerian ziggurat, or staged tower, became Mesopotamia’s most distinctive contribution to architecture, both secular and sacred. The ziggurat has often been likened to a medieval European cathedral, the highest point of which might appear to be reaching upward to God as an expression of human religious aspirations. That, however, was not the concept the Sumerians held in building their shrines. For them, the ziggurat, standing on its mound or platform, represented a concentration of natural, life-giving forces. The god had already come down to his house, and it was the worshiper’s duty to commune with him there.</p>
<p>By 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> a Mesopotamian temple area commonly housed the ziggurat, several storehouses, shrines, workshops, and living quarters for priests. The ziggurat usually consisted of three stages: the inner walls of sun-dried mud brick, the outer walls of baked brick set in bitumen. The upper levels were reached by flights of stairs or ramps, and sometimes a small shrine to a local deity topped off the uppermost stage. In addition to devising decorated walls and columns, Sumerian architects discovered how to employ arches, domes, and vaults to give the impression of grandeur and space.</p>
<p>Sumerian domestic architecture was quite mixed in style. Most city houses were two-story dwellings built on three sides of a square, with the opening facing away from the narrow streets. Homes of the wealthy might contain 20 rooms; some included servants’ quarters. Indoor bathroom facilities were connected by means of drainpipes to an underground cesspool. Many houses had a family burial vault in the basement. There seems little doubt that the Akkadians, Hittites, Egyptians, and Greeks all benefited in various ways from the architectural innovations of Sumer.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EgyptianArchitecture">Egyptian Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">The Egyptians achieved the most lasting architectural forms ever attempted by any civilization, and much of their architecture has been preserved. Such forms included temples, tombs, and pyramids. Huge stones to build those structures had to be brought from distant quarries. The Egyptians made use of slave labor and built their structures in honor of their rulers.</p>
<p>The outstanding examples of Egyptian architecture are the pyramids, virtually all of which were constructed in the Old Kingdom period (c. 2700–2200 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Sumerian principle of the recessed niche was employed to accommodate the enormous stresses of stone masonry. Without that technique it would have been impossible to construct such a huge edifice as the Great Pyramid, the estimated weight of which is almost six million tons (5,448,000 metric tons). The Great Pyramid is one of the most perfectly oriented buildings on earth, being just a few seconds of one degree short of true north-south orientation. Many of the huge blocks of stone were cut and fitted together so accurately that it is impossible to insert the edge of a sheet of paper between them. The pyramids were meant to serve as tombs for the remains of the persons who ordered them constructed, but the structures themselves have become monuments to human creativity.</p>
<p>The major architectural style of the Egyptians was “post and lintel,” with horizontal crosspieces resting on columns. As a result, buildings of any size became a forest of columns. Wall surfaces were covered with carvings, paintings, and hieroglyphics. Temples were planned on a long axis with almost perfect symmetry. The structures seem designed for imperial pageants and other ceremonies staged to impress the people with the power and authority of their rulers.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheSphinxAndGreatPyramidsAtCairoEgypt"/>
<p class="h2" id="AssyrianandHittiteArchitecture">Assyrian and Hittite Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">The Assyrians followed the Sumerian pattern of temple construction but enlarged the ziggurats and added more stories. The great ziggurat at Borsippa was an outstanding example of seven-story temple construction. The foundation was about 272 feet (83 meters) square, and the building stood about 160 feet (49 meters) high. Each story was set back from the level beneath it in a terraced effect and painted with a different color of wash. Each story was intended to represent one of the planets. In accordance with later Sumerian practice the uppermost level had a small shrine built on its roof, where the god Nebo was thought to have taken up his residence. Many believe that the Tower of Babel, which God destroyed, was a ziggurat tower (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-32">Gn 11</a>).</p>
<p>Assyrian royal palaces of the eighth and seventh centuries <span class="era">BC</span> were large and elegant, decorated with enormous bas-reliefs depicting the king busily occupied with a variety of activities. Assyrian art was at its height in that period, and meticulous attention to detail brought a virile character to Assyrian architecture. Large stone sculptures of protective animals were stationed at entrances to public buildings. Similar statues were a feature of Hittite architecture in Anatolia, the eastern part of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Hittite buildings excavated at Boghazkôy and elsewhere easily matched those of the Assyrians in extent and grandeur. Towering columns, long halls, and expansive rooms were typical of Hittite palace construction in the Bronze Age.</p>
<p>Hittite temple design followed what was common in Babylonia, with several buildings grouped around an open court. One difference was that the main sanctuary was approached through a series of entrances or porches extending beyond the length of adjacent buildings. The design enabled small windows to be placed at the top of the projection in order to give additional light in the sanctuary.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GreekArchitecture">Greek Architecture</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TempleOfAthenaNike"/>
<p class="fl">Architecture rose to great achievements in the Greek world. Many factors combined to produce architectural beauty that has lasted for centuries. Those factors included the climate, setting, government, and people. Perhaps the most important factor was the people, who seemed free to imagine and develop designs and structures that have continued to excite our imaginations to this day.</p>
<p>The Greeks strove to attain beauty in their architecture. This worthy motive found its highest expression in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. In the time of Pericles (461–429 <span class="era">BC</span>) the Parthenon and Propylea on the Acropolis were remodeled from earlier originals, and the Erechtheum was also built there. Subsequent temples in Athens included that of Hephaestus, which was a less graceful version of the Parthenon, and the shrine of Ares. Phidias, the sculptor who designed the Parthenon, was also responsible, with his students, for much of the fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> statuary. Although the Sumerians had been the first to execute rather stereotyped freestanding stone statues, they had done so largely with theological considerations in mind. For the Sumerian sculptors, the statue had represented an individual standing before a god, ready to be judged. For the Greeks, however, the objective of good statuary was the most realistic and accurate reproduction of human anatomy possible, and like the Assyrians’, their sculptors studied anatomy. Eventually the Greeks became the world’s most proficient sculptors.</p>
<p>Many Greek buildings featured appropriate combinations of structure and setting. For example, theaters were built on hills so that the structure could have tiers of seats and still have a beautiful background. Marble was used extensively. Buildings were placed so that shadows added to their beauty. All that structural beauty was seen by the apostle Paul when he visited the city of Athens, but “he was deeply troubled by all the idols he saw everywhere in the city” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.16">Acts 17:16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Many of the most beautiful buildings, such as the Parthenon, were built in honor of pagan Greek gods. In response, Paul preached his famous sermon on the Areopagus (Mars Hill), a hill that overlooked the temples of Athens.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheParthenonInAthens"/>
<p class="h2" id="RomanArchitecture">Roman Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">The Romans were great builders who left their mark on the architecture of the world. Several factors influenced Roman architectural styles. First was the fact that the Romans took over earlier empires and earlier forms of architecture. Some Egyptian influence was seen, but the Greek eye for beauty and use of marble was more important. Another factor was the Roman discovery of cement made from volcanic earth which, when mixed with lime, formed a mortar of great cohesion. Cement enabled the Romans to build masonry arches without supporting columns. The effect was a sense of pomp and majesty. The use of cement also allowed the Romans to build structures of more than one story, such as the Colosseum.</p>
<p>Roman architects used central squares or public forums in the center of their cities. Around these were built public buildings, temples, shops, and porticoes. The central square contained arches and monuments commemorating victorious emperors. The Roman concept of municipal planning was copied throughout the Roman Empire, including Palestine.</p>
<p>The shortage of water in a number of countries over which the Romans ruled compelled them to devise means of transporting it overland. This led to the development of the aqueduct. Roman architects were faced with the problem of maintaining a sufficient degree of slope to enable water to flow by gravity. Cemented channels supported by stone arches provided much of the solution to the problem. The architectural design of aqueduct systems remained the same throughout the imperial period. Foundation piers were spanned by round arches. A stone channel was built on top of the archway, lined with cement, and frequently covered by a curved roof.</p>

<p class="fl">For a generation the Israelites had been tent dwellers, living only semisedentary lives at best, without need of permanent structures of any kind. When the time came for them to settle down, they were handicapped by their lack of construction skills. Archaeological excavation at such sites as Shiloh, Bethel, and Debir have uncovered Israelite attempts to rebuild on earlier Canaanite foundations. Their standard of workmanship was noticeably inferior to that of the Canaanite builders, as exhibited especially in Canaanite royal cities. Until the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Israelite buildings tended to be small and narrow, partly because the architects had not devised any means of roofing a dwelling other than by laying beams across its width and placing a flat covering on top. The first vaulted arch in Palestine was built in the Persian period, but it was so innovative that the conservative Judeans refused to adopt it as an architectural style. Only in the Roman period did the arch and vault gain acceptance, due largely to the influence of Herod the Great.</p>
<p class="h3">Old Testament Architecture</p>
<p class="h4">Cities</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT era, cities were built on hills or mounds and surrounded with a wall for protection. Generally houses were placed in a random fashion with winding paths or alleys connecting them. People unable to afford city life lived in villages that surrounded the city. They would work the nearby fields and in time of danger flee to the city for protection.</p>
<p>Most essential to any city was an adequate water supply. For that reason cities were built on or near underground springs. Some cities used plastered cisterns and catch basins to collect rainwater to supplement the regular water supply. Underground springs were protected by stepped tunnels for access when the city was besieged.</p>
<p class="h4">Fortifications</p>
<p class="fl">During much of OT times the Israelites used the techniques of the middle Bronze Age to defend their cities. The central feature was a wall made of stone or brick, 25 to 30 feet (7.6 to 9.1 meters) high. The wall was sometimes made with an artificial slope and a ditch at the bottom to fortify it against enemy battering rams.</p>
<p>During the Israelite monarchy, casemate walls were also built. These consisted of two parallel walls connected by a series of cross walls. The resulting rooms were then filled with dirt to give added protection against enemy battering rams (<a href="?bref=Ezek.26.9">Ez 26:9</a>). Sometimes walls 20 feet (6 meters) thick were built with overhangs so attackers could be subdued. The apostle Paul was let down off the wall of Damascus in a basket from a room in such a wall (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.25">Acts 9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.33">2 Cor 11:33</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Gates</p>
<p class="fl">Most city walls had two gates. One of these was for camel caravans, chariots, and larger vehicles; the other, on the opposite side of the city, was used for pedestrians, donkeys, and small animals. Many gates consisted of double doors (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.1">Is 45:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1">Neh 6:1</a>) made of wood and overlaid with bronze plating (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.2">Is 45:2</a>). The doors were secured with horizontal bars of wood, bronze (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">1 Kgs 4:13</a>), or iron (<a href="?bref=Ps.107.16">Ps 107:16</a>) that fit into openings in the gateposts (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.3">Jgs 16:3</a>).</p>
<p>The location of the gates was important to the defense of the city. Often the road leading to the gate was laid out so that attackers, who carried their shields in their left hands, would have to face the wall of the city and its defenders on their right side. Sometimes the gate was part of a large tower (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.9">2 Chr 26:9</a>). Occasionally, steps were constructed on the inside of the tower, so that sentinels could reach the top to stand watch (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.17">2 Kgs 9:17</a>). At other times the gate was so positioned that it turned 90 degrees between the portals, in order to prevent enemy archers from making a straight shot through the gate.</p>
<p class="h4">Houses</p>
<p class="fl">An above-average Israelite house consisted of several rooms facing an open courtyard (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.18">2 Sm 17:18</a>). The largest room was for the family, another was for the family’s cattle, and another was used as a general storeroom. Sometimes the walls were made of stones, with the joints filled with mud. Sometimes the inside walls were plastered with mud, although more prosperous homes had cypress or cedarwood. Floors were made of clay or polished plaster stones. The flat roofs were supported by beams and made watertight with wood or brushwood. An outside stairway gave access to the roof, and some people built roof chambers that in effect made a two-story house (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.19">1 Kgs 17:19</a>). The flat roofs of houses provided additional sleeping and recreational space for crowded households. The Mosaic law required these roofs to be surrounded by a protective parapet to prevent people falling to their deaths (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.8">Dt 22:8</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Solomon’s Temple</p>
<p class="fl">Probably the most important piece of Israelite architecture was King Solomon’s temple. The building was located on the site where Abraham was supposed to have offered his son Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-24">Gn 22</a>). It took seven and a half years to build and was notable for its beauty as well as its purpose. The plan of the temple was similar to that of the tabernacle, except that the dimensions were doubled and the height was tripled. The walls were made of stone overlaid with gold (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.22">1 Kgs 6:22</a>), with gold also covering the ceilings and floor. The partition between the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place was made of gold-covered cedarwood. The entrance to the Holy of Holies consisted of a double door made of carved olive wood overlaid with gold. The doorway stood open but was veiled. Outside the temple were two courts, an inner court for the priests and an outer court for the people.</p>
<p>Lack of constructional expertise in Israel compelled Solomon to hire Phoenician workmen. The result was a typically Phoenician structure, the ground plan of which closely resembled that of an eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> Canaanite chapel excavated at Tell Tainat in Syria. Columns and porticoes were doubtless a feature of the temple of Solomon, though the precise function of the freestanding pillars named Jachin and Boaz is still far from certain. Carefully dressed masonry seems to have appeared in Israel initially in Solomon’s time; excellent specimens of hewn and squared stone have been recovered from Samaria. The Samaritan site, along with Megiddo, has also furnished interesting examples of a decorated pilaster capital that derived its design from Canaanite artistic representations.</p>
<p>When Babylon overthrew Jerusalem and leveled the city in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, the temple was plundered of its wealth and burned to the ground. After Israel returned from captivity, the temple was rebuilt, with the foundation being laid in 525 <span class="era">BC</span>. However, that second temple was far less magnificent than Solomon’s and was in great need of repair by the time of King Herod of Judea (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Although OT tradition gives considerable prominence to the Solomonic temple and lauds its grandeur, the building was actually an adjunct to the royal palace, serving as a chapel. Only in the postexilic period was the temple freed from royal associations to become an independent shrine where people could observe the prescribed rituals. Both pre- and postexilic temples were quite small and narrow in their dimensions, their width being limited by the length of the wooden beams available for roofing purposes. The only way such a building could be enlarged was in the usual Near Eastern manner of attaching additional rooms to the exterior.</p>
<p class="h3">New Testament Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">The architecture of NT times consisted of Greek and Roman structures, since those rulers had most recently dominated Israel. The Greek cities were architectural models, containing planned streets, arches, theaters, public baths, temples, and a central marketplace called the <span class="greek">agora</span><span class="ital">.</span> Jewish homes, however, continued to remain small, with flat roofs over rooms facing a courtyard.</p>
<p>During Roman domination Herod the Great (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>) built some remarkable structures, including aqueducts, cisterns, dungeons, palaces, and whole cities (e.g., Caesarea). His greatest work was the rebuilding of the temple, a remarkable structure that took 83 years to complete. It lasted in its completed state only six years before it was destroyed by Titus in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>Herod’s temple managed to blend the old with the new. Though it appeared to embody the latest Hellenistic architectural fashions in its colonnades, marble columns, and facades, it was still firmly rooted in the traditions of Phoenicia. The Herodian structure was an enlargement, and to some extent a rebuilding, of the sixth-century <span class="era">BC</span> temple. A series of courts and porticoes surrounded the reconstructed shrine, which was given an illusion of grandeur by means of an enlarged entrance. In the middle of that porch stood an enormous doorway that gave access to the much smaller inner door of the shrine itself. Unfortunately, nothing of the building itself survived the destruction of <span class="era">AD</span> 70, leaving us almost completely dependent upon Josephus’s account. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=City_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">City</a>; <a href="?item=HomesandDwellings_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Homes and Dwellings</a>; <a href="?item=Temple_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Temple</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Hill northwest of the Acropolis in Athens overlooking the marketplace (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.19">Acts 17:19</a>). “Areopagus” also refers to the Athenian council or court that met there. The irregular limestone outcropping was also known as Mars Hill, Mars being the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Ares. Paul was taken to the Areopagus after he had been reasoning with Jews and God-fearing Gentiles in the Athenian synagogue and marketplace <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">agora</span><span class="ital">)</span> for several days (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.16-21">Acts 17:16-21</a>). Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers involved in those discussions brought Paul before the council but evidently not for an official arraignment. Trials were held at the Areopagus; there, some five centuries earlier, Socrates had faced those who accused him of deprecating the Greek gods. By Paul’s day the council of the Areopagus was responsible for various political, educational, philosophical, and religious matters, as well as for legal proceedings. The general tone of Paul’s address does not suggest judicial proceedings. He spoke as an intelligent Christian believer who was able to meet the intellectual Athenians on their own ground (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.22-31">Acts 17:22-31</a>). Some remained skeptical, but his address was convincing to a few who “joined him and became believers” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.32-34">Acts 17:32-34</a>).</p>

<p class="list">1. Name of several kings of an Arabian people called the Nabateans, considered to be descendants of Nebaioth, Ishmael’s oldest son (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.12-16">Gn 25:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.29">1 Chr 1:29</a>). According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Ishmael’s descendants inhabited an area all the way from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, calling it Nabatene. Their capital city, Sela, was called Petra in NT times.</p>
<p class="list">2. The Aretas of <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.8">2 Maccabees 5:8</a>, before whom Jason the priest was accused, ruled about 170 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Nabateans were evidently friendly toward the Maccabeans (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.24-28">1 Macc 5:24-28</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.35">9:35</a>). Josephus mentioned two other kings named Aretas. It was Aretas III, originally named Obodas, who extended Nabatean control and occupied Damascus during his reign (87–62 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="list">3. The NT contains a reference to still another Aretas. The apostle Paul had to escape from Damascus by being let down in a basket through a window in the wall because the governor there under King Aretas was guarding the city in order to seize him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.32-33">2 Cor 11:32-33</a>). That Aretas has been identified as Eneas, who took the title Aretas IV and ruled from 9 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 40.

Argob was located east of the Sea of Chinnereth (later called Sea of Galilee), beyond the regions of Geshur and Maacah (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Dt 3:14</a>). Moses assigned all of Bashan, including Argob, to half of Manasseh’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.13-14">Dt 3:13-14</a>). Jair, of that tribe, subdued the villages of Argob and named them Havvoth-jair (“the villages of Jair”). <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">First Kings 4:13</a> distinguishes between Argob and the villages of Jair, that are said to be in Gilead, south of Argob. <a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> may represent a textual difficulty, or perhaps the location of the villages of Jair on the border between Argob and Gilead was responsible for the apparent discrepancy.

  <title>Ark of the Covenant</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ARK OF THE COVENANT</p>
<p class="fl">Most important piece of furniture in the wilderness tabernacle (tent-sanctuary) that God instructed Moses to build (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.10-22">Ex 25:10-22</a>). The Hebrew word for ark can also mean “chest” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.9-10">2 Kgs 12:9-10</a>) or “coffin” (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.26">Gn 50:26</a>), but it is not the same word used for Noah’s ark. The ark that Moses had Bezalel make was an oblong chest made of acacia wood (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.1-5">Ex 31:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.1-9">37:1-9</a>). The chest measured approximately 45 by 27 by 27 inches (114 by 69 by 69 centimeters), and was overlaid inside and out with gold. It was fitted with two pairs of rings through which poles were slid to make it portable. The ark would also serve as container for the two tablets of the covenant that would be given to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.16">Ex 25:16</a>). Since the tablets were also called the “testimony,” the ark was sometimes called the “ark of the testimony.” Also in the ark were placed a pot of manna, the miraculous food provided by God (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.33">Ex 16:33</a>), and Aaron’s rod that had budded (<a href="?bref=Num.17.10">Nm 17:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.4">Heb 9:4</a>).</p>
<p>The lid of the ark was called the “mercy seat” or “place of mercy” (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.17">Ex 25:17</a>). It was a slab of gold fitting over the top of the ark and having an importance of its own. Once a year the high priest was to make atonement for the people of Israel by sprinkling the mercy seat with the blood of bulls and goats (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.2-16">Lv 16:2-16</a>). In fact, the English expression “mercy seat” is related to the Hebrew word for “atone.” The lid was called a “seat” because the Lord was considered as enthroned between two cherubim (winged creatures) positioned opposite each other (<a href="?bref=Ps.99.1">Ps 99:1</a>). The Lord spoke to Moses from between the cherubim (<a href="?bref=Num.7.89">Nm 7:89</a>).</p>
<p>The ark was sometimes referred to simply as the ark (<a href="?bref=Exod.37.1">Ex 37:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.31">Nm 3:31</a>), at other times as the “ark of the covenant” (<a href="?bref=Num.4.5">Nm 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.4.16">Jos 4:16</a>). The Israelites were thus reminded that the ark’s holiness was not magical but derived from the holy law of God contained inside it. That name also confronted the Israelites with their need to follow the commands God had given in his “covenant.”</p>
<p>Those commands were given by the God of the covenant (or promise) who had rescued Israel from slavery in Egypt and who had promised to be the ever-present God of his people (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6-7">Ex 6:6-7</a>). Hence the ark was most widely known as the “ark of the covenant.” Sometimes that name was expanded to “the Ark of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s covenant” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.18">1 Chr 28:18</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>At times the ark was called “the Ark of God.” It was a visible sign that the invisible God was dwelling in Israel’s midst. It had a devastating and often deadly “holiness.” The people of Beth-shemesh were severely punished after they had treated the ark without proper reverence (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.19">1 Sm 6:19</a>). A man named Uzzah was killed by the Lord when he touched it with his hand to keep it from tumbling to the ground from a cart (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.6-9">2 Sm 6:6-9</a>). The ark was dangerous to touch because it was the very symbol of God’s presence. For this reason God commanded that the ark be placed in the Holy of Holies, separated from the rest of the tabernacle (and later the temple) by a heavy veil (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.31-33">Ex 26:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.3-5">Heb 9:3-5</a>); no sinful man could look upon the glory of God above the ark and live (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.2">Lv 16:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">When the Israelites journeyed from Mt Sinai to Canaan, the ark accompanied them in their trek through the desert. It was to be a constant reminder of the holy presence of their God. The ark was spoken of in the accounts of that journey almost as though it were endowed with personal features (<a href="?bref=Num.10.33-36">Nm 10:33-36</a>). Although the wrapping and carrying of the sacred objects were carefully detailed (<a href="?bref=Num.4.1-49">Nm 4</a>), God’s relationship with the ark was so close that the ark seemed to be “alive.”</p>
<p>The ark clearly played a benevolent role during the desert journey. A group of Israelites rebelled and tried to invade Canaan on their own, although neither the ark nor Moses went with them (<a href="?bref=Num.14.44">Nm 14:44</a>). The result was defeat at the hands of their enemies (<a href="?bref=Num.14.45">Nm 14:45</a>). The ark played an important role in the crossing of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.13-17">Jos 3:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.4.9-10">4:9-10</a>), the conquest of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.6-11">Jos 6:6-11</a>), and the life of the Israelites in their new land (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.33">Jos 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.27">Jgs 20:27</a>). There is no hint of superstitious or magical use of the ark; it was not a fetish, talisman, or charm. Yet it had solemn significance as the container of God’s “testimony” and as the pledge of his presence.</p>
<p>A sharp contrast to the role of the ark in Joshua’s day is found in later times. In the days of Eli and his sons, that is, at the end of the period of the judges, religious life in Israel was at a low ebb. The ark was still venerated but looked upon as a fetish to ensure success or victory automatically. When losing a battle with the Philistines, the Israelites rushed the sacred chest to the battlefield, thereby hoping to gain a victory (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-10">1 Sm 4:1-10</a>). But the Lord did not tolerate such flagrant misuse of the ark. He allowed it to be captured by the uncircumcised Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.11">1 Sm 4:11</a>) and inflicted defeat on Israel and death on the house of the high priest Eli (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.13-22">1 Sm 4:13-22</a>).</p>
<p>At the same time, God vindicated the honor of the ark when it was offered to Dagon, the god of the Philistines. The account of the efforts of the pagan Philistines to get rid of the ark is humorous (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-6.21">1 Sm 5–6</a>). The biblical writer dramatically illustrated that the holy ark could neither be treated superstitiously by God’s people nor mocked by his enemies.</p>
<p>Samuel, a great reformer and prophet, made no attempt to restore the ark to a place of prominence after it was returned to Israel. He allowed it to remain in Kiriath-jearim (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.21">1 Sm 6:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.2">7:2</a>). Samuel first had to bring Israel back to obedience to God’s covenant before the ark of the covenant could be of any use. David, described as a king after God’s own heart and chosen to replace the disobedient Saul, exerted efforts to bring the ark back to a prominent place (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-17">2 Sm 6:1-17</a>). It may have been to David’s political advantage to add prestige to his newly established capital, Jerusalem, formerly the Canaanite stronghold of Jebus. But <a href="?bref=Ps.132.1-18">Psalm 132</a> describes David’s concern for the honor of God and for the ark. In a moment of great religious joy and enthusiasm he addressed God directly: “Arise, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and go to thy resting place, thou and the ark of thy might” (v <a href="?bref=Ps.132.8">8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). To restless David, the ark had also been “restless” as long as Israel had not yet obtained its “rest,” that is, as long as Canaan had not been completely conquered. Some measure of peace had already come during Joshua’s time (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.43-45">Jos 21:43-45</a>), but much remained to be done. By conquering Jebus, David virtually completed the conquest of the Promised Land. Finally the land had rest and the Lord could then “dwell” in his temple, the suitable resting place for the ark. Nevertheless, David’s desire to build a temple for the ark was not granted (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-17">2 Sm 7:1-17</a>). He was told that his son Solomon would build a home for the ark and for the Lord. Solomon erected a magnificent temple with a place for the ark in the most holy part, behind the curtains (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1-11">1 Kgs 8:1-11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ARMAGEDDON</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew word in <a href="?bref=Rev.16.16">Revelation 16:16</a> meaning “Mount Megiddo.” It is generally thought that the term refers to the town of Megiddo, strategically located between the western coastal area and the broad plain of Jezreel in northern Palestine. The area of Megiddo was important commercially and militarily and was the scene of many important battles in Israel’s history. There the Lord routed Sisera before the armies of Deborah and Barak (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">Jgs 4–5</a>); Gideon was victorious over the Midianites and Amalekites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-7.25">Jgs 6–7</a>); King Saul and his army were defeated by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-13">1 Sm 31</a>); and King Josiah was slain in battle by the Egyptian army of Pharaoh Neco (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29">2 Kgs 23:29</a>).

  <title>Armor and Weapons</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ARMOR AND WEAPONS</p>
<p class="fl">The location of Palestine at the crossroads of three continents gave it a strategic importance in the ancient world quite out of proportion to its size. Surrounded by the great military powers (Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Hittites of Anatolia), that stretch of land was constantly the object of aggressive ambitions of other nations. The invention of different weapons, fortifications, and tactics exerted a profound reciprocal influence on other inventions. Tactical innovation by one side prompted new countertactics by the other.</p>
<p>The three basic elements of the art of warfare are mobility, firepower, and security. Weapons alone seldom determined the issue of battle, particularly when both sides were evenly matched. The skill with which strategy and tactics were deployed, the spirit of the commander in directing his troops, and the precision with which the troops handled their weapons were decisive factors in many of the battles mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AttackWeapons">Attack Weapons</p>
<p class="fl">The armory of a military commander in antiquity consisted of a variety of offensive weapons designed to engage the enemy at long, medium, and short range. The bow and the sling were the principal weapons developed for long-range firepower; the javelin and the spear for medium-range; the sword, the ax, and the mace for short-range.</p>
<p class="h3">Bow</p>
<p class="fl">Early bows were fashioned from one piece of seasoned wood. No single type of bow wood, however, could provide the lightness, toughness, and elasticity required. Gradually the idea was conceived of combining several natural materials—wood, sections of animal horn, animal tendons and sinews, and glue—in the construction of a bow to meet all the demands placed on it. The resulting composite bow became a weapon of supreme importance. Composite structure gave a bow lightness, strength, and elasticity. Use of a double-convex form gave increased range and power of penetration.</p>
<p>The bowstring was made from bindweed, natural cord, hide, or the intestines of oxen or camels. The bow was strung by hand (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.16">2 Kgs 13:16</a>), usually bending it with the foot, which required considerable strength (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.22.35">2 Sm 22:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.3">Jer 51:3</a>). That may explain why archers were known as “bow treaders” or as “those who tread a bow.”</p>
<p>The form of the arrowhead was a response to the enemy’s defense and armor. In the late Bronze period, for example, a battle arrowhead was generally of bronze and was thick in the middle, tapering to a spine. Its shape was dictated by the fact that the coats of mail in widespread use at the time could be penetrated only by a spined or ribbed arrowhead. The arrow shaft was usually made from reed, a material that combined strength with pliability.</p>
<p class="h3">Sling</p>
<p class="fl">Complementing the bow was the sling, devised originally by shepherds to drive off animals molesting their flocks (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.40">1 Sm 17:40</a>). It gradually assumed importance as a weapon of war, its supreme advantage being simple construction. Not only did a sling require little technical skill to produce, but the stones used as projectiles were readily available on the ground. In the hands of a trained slinger a missile could be hurled as far as 600 feet (183 meters) in any terrain. The sling’s capacity for high-angled fire up a steep slope was particularly important in an assault on a fortified city. Its principal disadvantage was that strenuous training and experience were required to achieve accuracy in its operation (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.20.16">Jgs 20:16</a>).</p>
<p>A sling was commonly made from two leather thongs to which were attached a pocket for holding the stone. With the thongs pulled taut the pocket became a bag. The slinger held his arms above his head, the bag in his left hand and the ends of the taut thongs in his right hand. After swinging the sling several times around his head with great force to give it momentum, he suddenly released the end of one of the thongs to discharge the missile. Lead pellets as well as smooth stones were used as projectiles. They were carried in a bag or were piled conveniently at the slinger’s feet.</p>
<p>The importance of the sling as a long-range weapon is evident in the familiar account of David’s encounter with the Philistine champion, Goliath of Gath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.40-51">1 Sm 17:40-51</a>). At that time the Philistines possessed many advanced types of weapons, but the bow and sling were not among them. They depended on medium-range weapons like the javelin and short-range weapons like the sword (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.4-7,45,51">1 Sm 17:4-7, 45, 51</a>). The sling gave David an advantage in range that was decisive against Goliath’s superior weapons and armor (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.48-49">1 Sm 17:48-49</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Javelin and Spear</p>
<p class="fl">Two weapons employed for medium-distance warfare were similar in appearance but different in length and operation. The javelin, generally lighter and shorter than the spear, was designed for throwing. It was like a large arrow that was hurled by the hand. Sumerian charioteers of the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span> were armed with several javelins, carried like arrows in a quiver attached to the body of the chariot. Javelin heads were designed for penetration and altered in shape and material as enemy armor became more effective. A head fashioned with sharp hooks or barbs was difficult and painful to extract from a wound.</p>
<p>The spear was similar in appearance to the javelin but was larger, heavier, and designed primarily as a thrusting weapon (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.25.7-8">Nm 25:7-8</a>). The oldest military monuments known indicate that the spear was already well developed. On the Egyptian hunter’s slate palette and on the black granite stele from Warka (c. 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>), the warrior’s personal weapon is a long staff tipped with a leaf-shaped blade with a sharp spine. Throughout the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, the spear was standard equipment for heavy-armed infantry and the most effective weapon for both chariot and infantry charges. Excavations have shown that the spear was the common weapon of the seminomadic tribes who began pouring into Palestine from the north in the middle Bronze Age.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of spears in that early period was a metal tip attached to the butt of the shaft, enabling a spear to be stuck upright in the ground when not in use. That feature persisted into later periods and is mentioned specifically in reference to Saul’s spear, which was stuck in the ground by his head while he slept (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.7">1 Sm 26:7</a>). Occasionally the metal tip functioned as a thrusting weapon in its own right, as is evident in the account of the slaying of Asahel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.23">2 Sm 2:23</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Sword</p>
<p class="fl">One of the earliest objects made of iron was the sword. Swords were designed for either stabbing or striking. The stabbing sword developed as a long straight blade, tapered toward the point for piercing the body. Its tapered edges were sharpened so that it could also serve as a cutting instrument. The striking sword, on the other hand, had only one sharp edge, with the thickest part of the blade not along the center but along its blunt edge. Such a sword was often curved, sometimes to a degree that gave it the appearance of a sickle, but with the outer, convex edge sharpened as the cutting blade. The earliest type of sickle sword appeared in the second half of the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Both the hilt, or handle, and the blade were fashioned from a single bar of metal. In the middle Bronze Age the curved striking sword functioned essentially as an ax, with a comparatively long hilt and short blade.</p>
<p>That type of sword completely disappeared in the late Bronze Age because it proved ineffective against the widespread use of the helmet and armor. In its place appeared a new design with the curved blade equal in length to the hilt and sometimes longer. It provided a cutting weapon in chariot fighting and against an enemy who possessed no armor. Widespread use of such long-bladed swords at that time explains the phrase repeatedly used in the Bible to describe Joshua’s conquests of the Canaanites: Joshua smote them with the edge of the sword (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.8.24">Jos 8:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.28-39">10:28-39</a>). That expression would be inappropriate for the action of a short, straight, narrow sword designed as a thrusting weapon. A fine specimen of curved sword was found at Gezer in Palestine in the tomb of a nobleman, dating to the first half of the 14th century <span class="era">BC</span>. The same type of blade is also depicted on a late 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> ivory carving from Megiddo.</p>
<p>During those centuries advances made in the technology of forging iron were reflected in the development of the straight sword as well. The Sea Peoples, among whom were the Philistines, specialized in short-range arms. As early as the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> they began to make the straight blade more effective than the curved sickle-type sword.</p>
<p>By the time of Saul, the Philistines had used their technology to establish themselves as city dwellers and the dominant military presence in the land. Their military superiority was based on the chariot and on an infantry equipped with personal armaments of high quality. They carefully retained the forging of hard metal under their own supervision and kept the Israelites from developing forges of their own (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-22">1 Sm 13:19-22</a>). Not until that situation was altered could the balance of power pass from the Philistines to Israel.</p>
<p class="h3">Mace and Ax</p>
<p class="fl">The mace and the ax, developed as alternatives to the sword before hard metal could be forged, were designed for hand-to-hand fighting. They consisted of a comparatively short wooden handle, one end of which was fitted with a lethal head made of stone or metal. The weapons were swung like a hammer to deliver a striking blow. The critical detail was the secure fastening of the head to the handle to prevent its flying off when swung or breaking off when struck. The handle of both the mace and the ax was widened at the point of the grip, tapering toward the head, to prevent the weapon from slipping from the hand when swung. Such weapons were carried in the hand or attached to the wrist with a loop. The mace was designed to batter and smash, the ax to pierce and cut.</p>
<p>The mace was a very primitive weapon. The hieroglyphic sign for the infinitive <span class="ital">to fight</span> represents hands holding a mace and a medium-size shield. During the Chalcolithic and the first half of the early Bronze periods (3500–2500 <span class="era">BC</span>), the mace was the primary weapon for personal combat. Because the helmet had not yet made its appearance, the striking power of the mace was devastating. Long after the mace had become obsolete as a personal weapon, it continued to serve as a symbol of sovereign authority for the king or deity (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.2.9">Ps 2:9</a>).</p>
<p>Complex technical problems taxed the ingenuity of armorers in the production of the ax. The blade had to be fixed securely to the handle. The cutting ax had a short blade and a wide edge. It was an effective weapon against an enemy unprotected by armor. It was also used for tearing down the wall of a besieged city, as in the wall painting at Saqqarah (23d century <span class="era">BC</span>). But against armor the cutting ax was ineffective. Deeper power of penetration was achieved with the piercing ax, which had a long, narrow blade ending in a short, sharp edge.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DefensiveProtection">Defensive Protection</p>
<p class="fl">Without provision for personal protection of the individual soldier on the battlefield, the mobility and firepower of an army could be seriously compromised.</p>
<p class="h3">Shield</p>
<p class="fl">Designed to provide a barrier between the body of a soldier and the weapon of his foe, the shield was one of the oldest means of security devised. In the time of the judges and the early Israelite kings, persons of rank were frequently protected by a very large shield. It was carried by a special shield bearer who remained constantly at the unprotected right side of the warrior to whom he was assigned as a bodyguard (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.9.54">Jgs 9:54</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.1">1 Sm 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.7">17:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.15">2 Sm 18:15</a>). The right side of an armed combatant was unprotected because he carried his weapons in his right hand and his shield in his left. The shield bearer therefore had to stand by his master’s vulnerable right side to protect him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.41">1 Sm 17:41</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.16.8">Ps 16:8</a>). In that period the shield was ordinarily anointed as part of the consecration of an Israelite warrior and his weapons for battle (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.21">2 Sm 1:21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Armor</p>
<p class="fl">Personal armor protected the body of a combatant from injury while freeing his hands to use his weapons. The earliest type of body armor formed a substitute for the long shield. It consisted of a full-length tunic made from leather or some tough fiber. It was relatively simple to produce, was light enough to permit full mobility, and offered a measure of protection to the chest, abdomen, back, thighs, and legs. So equipped, a soldier required only a short shield to protect his arms and face.</p>
<p>The late Bronze period saw the development of the coat of mail. It consisted of hundreds of small pieces of overlapping metal joined together like fish scales and sewed to the surface of a cloth or leather tunic. Written documents from Nuzi state that from 400 to 600 large scales and several hundred smaller scales went into the production of a single coat. Smaller scales and narrower rows were used where greater flexibility was needed, as at the throat and neck. The resulting garment was relatively flexible, affording freedom of movement, while the hard metal scales gave far greater personal protection than leather or fiber could provide.</p>
<p class="h3">Helmet</p>
<p class="fl">Since the greatest point of vulnerability for a soldier in combat was his head, concern for some form of protective helmet can be traced as far back as the end of the fourth millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Bronze helmets were worn both by Goliath and by Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.5,38">1 Sm 17:5, 38</a>). Although the helmet was standard equipment for the heavily armed infantry of foreign armies for centuries, it does not seem to have been a common possession of soldiers in the Israelite army during the period of the united monarchy. Among military reforms introduced by King Uzziah in the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span> was provision of helmets for the army of the southern kingdom of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.14">2 Chr 26:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">AROER</p>
<p class="list">1. Transjordanian city existing from Moses’ time until the fall of Jerusalem (586 <span class="era">BC</span>). It was among the cities that Israel conquered from Sihon the Amorite and Og the Bashanite in an area assigned to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and to half of Manasseh’s tribe. Aroer was on the southern border of that territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.9">Jos 13:9</a>), on the northern rim of the large Arnon Canyon (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.36">Dt 2:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.12">3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.48">4:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.9">Jos 13:9</a>). Evidently the city was rebuilt after Israel destroyed it (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.12.2">Jos 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.32.34">Nm 32:34</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Aroer was the hub city for a number of villages (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.26">Jgs 11:26</a>) and was the city from which the census began under King David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.5">2 Sm 24:5</a>). The Moabites gained control of it during the later monarchy and kept it until the time of Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.19">Jer 48:19</a>). King Hazael of Damascus captured Aroer, assuring Syrian control of Transjordan (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.33">2 Kgs 10:33</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Aroer has been identified with a mound beside the village ’Ara’ir, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) southeast of Dibon on the east side of the ancient north-south Transjordan highway.</p>
<p class="list">2.

This Aroer has been tentatively placed in the area northwest of Amman and east of Rabbah.</p>
<p class="list">3. City in the Negev Desert area of Judah. Aroer was one of the villages receiving spoil taken in David’s victory over the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.28">1 Sm 30:28</a>). Two of David’s “mighty men” were sons of Hotham the Aroerite (<a href="?bref=1Chr.11.44">1 Chr 11:44</a>).

  <title>Artaxerxes</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ARTAXERXES</p>
<p class="fl">Name of three kings of the Persian Empire.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Artaxerxes I (465–424 <span class="era">BC</span>), known as Macrocheir or Longimanus, son and successor of Xerxes I (486–465 <span class="era">BC</span>). Xerxes I was the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther and <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">Ezra 4:6</a>. A few years after the succession of Artaxerxes I, the Greeks urged Egypt to revolt against Persia. Only in 454 <span class="era">BC</span> was that movement crushed along with other dissension in the Persian Empire. By 449 <span class="era">BC</span>, when peace was made between the Greeks and Persians by the treaty of Callias, Artaxerxes had gained full control over his empire, and a period of peace resulted.</p>
<p class="list-text">Artaxerxes I was the ruler who brought the rebuilding of Jerusalem to a temporary standstill (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-23">Ezr 4:7-23</a>), and who commissioned Ezra to visit the city in the capacity of secretary of state of Jewish affairs in 458 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.8">Ezr 7:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.11-26">11-26</a>). In 445 <span class="era">BC</span> Nehemiah went to Jerusalem as civil governor in the 20th year of Artaxerxes I (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1">Neh 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">2:1</a>). By altering the text of <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7">Ezra 7:7</a> to read “thirty-seventh” instead of “seventh,” some scholars have tried to show that Artaxerxes II was the Persian king under whom Nehemiah worked. The Elephantine papyri, however, indicate that Sanballat, governor of Samaria, was quite advanced in years in 408 <span class="era">BC</span>, shortly before the death of Darius II (423–405 <span class="era">BC</span>); hence Sanballat’s opposition to Nehemiah must have occurred years earlier under Artaxerxes I. The dates of Ezra and Nehemiah thus fall within the lifetime of this monarch.</p>
<p class="list-text">Artaxerxes I was notable for his kindness toward the Jews in Persia, once matters of procedure had been established clearly; his support for the work of Ezra and Nehemiah is evident from their writings.</p>

<p class="list">2. Artaxerxes II Mnemon (404–359 <span class="era">BC</span>), grandson of Artaxerxes I and son of Darius II. His reign was a time of unrest in the Persian Empire, one result of which was the loss of Egypt about 401 <span class="era">BC</span>. He constructed several splendid buildings and seems to have enlarged the palace at Susa.</p>
<p class="list">3. Artaxerxes III Ochus (358–338 <span class="era">BC</span>), son and successor of Artaxerxes II. He brought peace to the empire by shrewd diplomacy, but he was assassinated. Neither he nor his father is mentioned in the OT.</p>

  <title>Asa</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ASA</p>
<p class="list">1. Third king of the southern kingdom of Judah (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>) after the split of Solomon’s Empire into independent kingdoms. Solomon’s son Rehoboam, Asa’s grandfather, had neither Solomon’s wisdom nor his tact. Rehoboam failed to use diplomacy to avoid an approaching explosion of popular resentment against Solomon’s oppressive policies; in fact, Rehoboam actively precipitated the explosion. Asa came to the throne just after his father, Abijam (or Abijah), who reigned only briefly (913–910 <span class="era">BC</span>). Asa thus inherited a shrunken, vulnerable kingdom. Moreover, he was thrust into a suddenly unstable political arena shaken by collapse of the great world empires of old Babylonia to the north and east in Mesopotamia, and of Egypt to the southwest. Hence until the emerging might of Assyria was firmly established (mid-ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>), the small Palestinian states (Israel, Judah, Syria, the Arameans, and Phoenicians, and to some degree the peoples of Moab and Edom) were free to push and shove among themselves.</p>
<p class="list-text">The rival states had superficial similarities, especially Judah and Israel, but were divided by deep differences and intense self-interest. Borders were in perpetual dispute—never fully settled but seldom contested in all-out bloody conflict. Threats, expedience, bribes, payment of tribute, marriages purchased for power, and other cunning arts in the catalog of political kingcraft were employed to shift alliances. Since all were playing the same game, a kind of fluid balance resulted.</p>
<p class="list-text">At the beginning of King Asa’s reign there was an initial decade of peace and prosperity. Then, however, he was called upon to face enemy threats and invasion. In those crises he trusted God and forced out or defeated all who attempted to conquer, divide, or destroy Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.1-8">2 Chr 14:1-8</a>). Further, he cleansed the land of pagan shrines and places of worship and even took away the royal prerogatives and standing of Maacah, his mother. She had erected an image of the fertility goddess Asherah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.10">1 Kgs 15:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.16">2 Chr 15:16</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Nonetheless, later in his reign Asa abruptly abandoned his trust in God. By means of a huge gift that stripped the temple treasures, he entered an alliance with Ben-hadad, king of Damascus (Syria) in order to force Baasha, ruler of the northern kingdom of Israel, to withdraw from newly conquered territory in Judah. Asa had become heedless of God’s faithful protection when Israel, Judah’s mortal enemy, stood triumphant and strategically poised to strike, only five miles (8 kilometers) from Jerusalem. Asa’s power play worked. Israel had to retire from the field in the south to meet Ben-hadad’s threat from the north.

  <title>Ascension of Christ</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ASCENSION OF CHRIST</p>
<p class="fl">Transference of the resurrected body of Jesus from this world to heaven. Among the NT writers, only Luke described Jesus’ ascension. <a href="?bref=Acts.1.9-11">Acts 1:9-11</a> pictures a scene in which Jesus was “taken up” and disappeared into a cloud. <a href="?bref=Luke.24.50-51">Luke 24:50-51</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.1.12">Acts 1:12</a> locate that final event near Bethany, east of Jerusalem on the Mt of Olives.</p>
<p>Matthew concluded his history before Pentecost, but John suggested the Ascension in Jesus’ own comments: Jesus has departed, but he will return (<a href="?bref=John.21.22">Jn 21:22</a>); he cannot be touched, for he must ascend (<a href="?bref=John.20.17">20:17</a>); many will believe without having seen him (<a href="?bref=John.20.29">20:29</a>). Thus, the Gospels assume that (1) after the resurrection Jesus appeared to his disciples; (2) at some point in time those appearances ceased; and (3) although physically absent, Jesus is still spiritually present in his church. Other NT writings agree. The apostle Paul wrote that God raised Christ from the dead “and seated him in the place of honor at God’s right hand in the heavenly realms” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.20">Eph 1:20</a>) or, as the writer of Hebrews put it, “in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God of heaven” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>).</p>
<p>The Ascension, however, is more than merely a past event. It has further significance in the NT that can be summarized under two headings: (1) its meaning for Christ and (2) its meaning for the Christian.</p>
<p>For Christ, the Ascension is the necessary entrance into his heavenly “glorification” in which he sits on the right hand of the Father until his enemies become his footstool (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Ps 110:1</a>—the OT text most quoted in the NT). The Ascension is proof of his glorification and his superiority over such OT heroes as David (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.33-36">Acts 2:33-36</a>). By his ascension he rises over all and fills all (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.10">Eph 4:10</a>), receiving “the name that is over every name” (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>). For the author of the book of Hebrews the Ascension is also proof of Christ’s superiority to angels; he sits enthroned while they are constantly being sent out to serve (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.13-14">Heb 1:13-14</a>). Angels, authorities, and powers are all subject to the ascended Christ (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Tm 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.22">1 Pt 3:22</a>).</p>
<p>For the Christian, the ascension of Christ is meaningful in four ways. First, without it there would be no gift of the Holy Spirit, who could not come until Jesus had ascended and sent him (<a href="?bref=John.16.7">Jn 16:7</a>). Without the Ascension, the church would have Jesus locally in one place, not spiritually present “wherever two or three are gathered” (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.20">Mt 18:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.28.20">28:20</a>).</p>
<p>Second, since a truly human Jesus has ascended to heaven, human beings can also ascend there. Jesus went “to prepare a place” for his followers (<a href="?bref=John.14.2">Jn 14:2</a>). The hope of those who are “in Christ” is that they will eventually ascend to be with him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-10">2 Cor 5:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>Third, the Ascension proves that the sacrifice of Christ is finished and accepted by God. Jesus has passed through the heavens (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14">Heb 4:14</a>) and entered the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.20">Heb 6:20</a>), which is described as the inner sanctuary of the heavenly temple, the real temple of which the one on earth was a copy (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.24">Heb 9:24</a>). Having brought a single, once-for-all sacrifice to God (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.12">Heb 9:12</a>), Christ sat down (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.12">10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.2">12:2</a>), showing that no repetition of his sacrifice is necessary.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Ascension means that there is a human being in heaven who sympathizes with humanity and can therefore intercede on humanity’s behalf (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 Jn 2:1</a>). Jesus has experienced everything humans experience—birth, growth, temptation, suffering, and death—and therefore he can serve effectively as an intermediary before God in heaven (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">Heb 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.7-10">5:7-10</a>). Christ’s ascension assures the church that God understands the human situation and that Christians can therefore approach him boldly in their prayers (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-16">Heb 4:14-16</a>).</p>
<p>Thus Christ’s ascension is an indispensable aspect of NT teaching. It is the basis for recognition of Christ’s exalted status and for the Christian’s confidence and hope.</p>

<p class="fl">One of the Philistines’ five main cities (the “pentapolis”) along with Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.3">Jos 13:3</a>). Ashdod was located midway between Joppa and Gaza, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) from the coast. The ancient tell has been excavated extensively since 1962. The earliest level found was Canaanite, dating to the 17th century <span class="era">BC</span>. When the Israelites arrived in the Promised Land, the city was inhabited by the giant Anakim (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.21-22">Jos 11:21-22</a>). Though unconquered, it was assigned to Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.46-47">Jos 15:46-47</a>). Its people were referred to as Ashdodites (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.4">Jos 13:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.7">Neh 4:7</a>). During the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span> the coast of Palestine was invaded by the Sea Peoples, a group of tribes from the Aegean area. Ashdod was destroyed and reoccupied by one of these peoples, the Philistines. Excavations at Ashdod have uncovered three levels of Philistine occupation and have furnished a glimpse of the material culture of these traditional enemies of Israel.</p>
<p>In the days of Eli the priest, the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant and placed it first in the temple of their god Dagon in Ashdod, then in Gath and Ekron (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-12">1 Sm 5</a>). A plague broke out wherever the ark went, so the Philistine rulers returned it with an offering of gold (<a href="?bref=1Sam.6.1-18">1 Sm 6:1-18</a>). Although David and Solomon controlled Ashdod, it was not until Uzziah came to the throne of the kingdom of Judah (792–740 <span class="era">BC</span>) that Ashdod was actually conquered (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.6">2 Chr 26:6</a>). After a while, Judah’s military power waned, and the city became independent again. Ashdod resisted Assyrian encroachments until Sargon II attacked and destroyed it in 711 <span class="era">BC</span>, a fact illumined by three fragments of a basalt stele of Sargon found at Ashdod in 1963. Those events led Isaiah to warn Judah against supporting Ashdod or counting on Egypt or Ethiopia to oppose the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.1-6">Is 20</a>). Excavations at Ashdod show evidence of the destruction by both Uzziah and Sargon II.</p>
<p>Ashdod remained under Assyrian control until the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik I (664–609 <span class="era">BC</span>) took the city after a siege of 29 years (perhaps the longest in history). Later, probably at the time of the fall of Jerusalem (586 <span class="era">BC</span>), Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ashdod and took its king to his court. Jeremiah and Zephaniah had prophesied about the people remaining in Ashdod (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.20">Jer 25:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.4">Zep 2:4</a>). That remnant later opposed Nehemiah’s rebuilding of Jerusalem, and its women married Jewish husbands (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.7">Neh 4:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-24">13:23-24</a>). Earlier, the prophet Zechariah had predicted further desolation for Ashdod (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.6">Zec 9:6</a>).</p>
<p>During Maccabean times the city, then called Azotus, was attacked and plundered by both Judas and Jonathan Maccabeus because of its idolatry (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.12-15">1 Macc 4:12-15</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.68">5:68</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.77-85">10:77-85</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.4">11:4</a>). Freed by Pompey in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, Ashdod became part of the Roman province of Syria. Later Herod the Great willed the city to his sister Salome. Philip the evangelist preached the message of Christ in Azotus (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.40">Acts 8:40</a>). The early Christian historian Eusebius regarded it as an important town in the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>, and Christian bishops were located there from the fourth through the sixth centuries. During the Middle Ages, Ashdod, or Azotus, began to decline, and now is only a small village called Esdud.</p>
<p>Ashdod was located about three miles (4.8 kilometers) inland and therefore had a port, separated from the city proper, called Ashdod Yam, or Ashdod-on-the-Sea. That coastal town in later years became larger than the inland city. Excavations in the area of the seaport have uncovered remains of Canaanite, Israelite, and Hellenistic occupation. One interesting find was the remains of a Hellenistic dye operation. A purple dye made from the murex shell was used to dye cloth worn by royalty and the wealthy. The site of the port continued to be occupied through the Arabic period, and today Israel has built a port near the site of ancient Ashdod Yam.</p>

<p class="fl">Jacob’s son born to Leah’s maid Zilpah (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.12-13">Gn 30:12-13</a>). The name Asher, probably meaning “happy,” was given to the child by Leah in her delight at his birth. Asher had four sons, Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and a daughter, Serah (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.17">Gn 46:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.30">1 Chr 7:30</a>). Some have speculated that the tribe of Asher took its name from a locality mentioned in Egyptian texts of the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. It is more likely that the tribe bore the name of its ancestor. Asher and his brothers received a special blessing and prediction from Jacob as he was dying (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.20">Gn 49:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.33.24-25">Dt 33:24-25</a>, where the dying Moses blessed Asher and the other tribes).</p>

<p class="h1">ASHER (T<span class="lc">ribe</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Israelite tribe that inhabited the fertile coastal territory when the Promised Land was divided for settlement. Asher’s allotment stretched north of Mt Carmel to a point slightly above the city of Sidon. The eastern boundary ran along the western slopes of the hills of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.24-34">Jos 19:24-34</a>). The tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali were Asher’s eastern neighbors. Due south, the Carmel mountain range was a natural barrier between Asher and the tribe of Manasseh. The land of Asher was agriculturally rich and is still known for its olive groves. Economically, the people of Asher joined in maritime trade with the Phoenicians of the city of Tyre.</p>
<p>As a tribe, Asher fluctuated in size. From the few who entered Egypt with their father, Jacob, the tribe grew to 41,500 adult warriors at Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Num.1.40-41">Nm 1:40-41</a>). At the second census in the wilderness the tribe numbered 53,400 soldiers (<a href="?bref=Num.26.47">Nm 26:47</a>). At the time of King David the number varied from 26,000 to 40,000 warriors (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.40">1 Chr 7:40</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.36">12:36</a>). Asher was never more than fifth in size among the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>The tribe joined the rest of Israel in rejecting the optimistic reports of Caleb and Joshua about the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.30-14.10">Nm 13:30–14:10</a>). As a result, that generation perished in the wilderness after 40 years of wandering (<a href="?bref=Num.14.22-25">Nm 14:22-25</a>).</p>
<p>At the close of the northern campaign in the Promised Land, Joshua gave the remaining seven tribes their own territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.2">Jos 18:2</a>). The fifth partition went to Asher’s descendants. Earlier, Ahihud had been chosen by God to distribute land within the territory given to Asher’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.34.16,27">Nm 34:16, 27</a>). Certain Levites, descendants of Gershom, were allocated cities within its borders (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.6,30">Jos 21:6, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.62,74">1 Chr 6:62, 74</a>).</p>
<p>Like all the Israelite tribes, Asher was never able to possess all of its inheritance. Failure to drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob subjected the tribe to the degradations of pagan culture (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.31">Jgs 1:31</a>). The “unpossessed” territory of the Sidonians and the Phoenicians stretched along the coastal region for 200 miles (322 kilometers). Thus “the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out” (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.32">Jgs 1:32</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). It is possible that Asher’s tribe, having become a partner in the enterprises of the successful Phoenicians, lost all desire to expel them from their cities.</p>
<p>After the death of the Israelite judge Ehud, Israel fell into the hands of Jabin, king of Canaan. When the judge Deborah stirred up Barak to marshal Israel’s forces for battle, God gave their army a great victory and liberated them from their oppressor (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-24">Jgs 4</a>). After the victory Deborah complained that “Asher sat unmoved at the seashore, remaining in his harbors” (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.17">Jgs 5:17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Eventually, through amalgamation, the tribe succumbed to Phoenician religious and cultural influences. Foreign invasion and pagan inroads were its downfall.</p>
<p>Little is said in the Bible of the tribe’s leadership. At the time of the exodus, when the nation was organized at Mt Sinai, Pagiel the son of Ochran became tribal chief (<a href="?bref=Num.1.13">Nm 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.2.27">2:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.72">7:72</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.26">10:26</a>). But the Bible is silent from then on about Asher’s leaders. None of the judges of Israel came from Asher, and in King David’s day the tribes of Asher and Gad were omitted from the list of the nation’s chief officers (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.16-22">1 Chr 27:16-22</a>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are some bright spots in Asher’s tribal history. The tribe answered the call of Gideon to drive out the Midianite enemy (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-8,35">Jgs 6:1-8, 35</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.7.23">7:23</a>). They rallied with the rest of the tribes of Israel to defend Saul, their first king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.7">1 Sm 11:7</a>). Later, 40,000 Asherites sided with David to give him Saul’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.23-36">1 Chr 12:23-36</a>). After the fall of Samaria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, a small remnant came to Jerusalem to observe the first Passover feast in many years (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.5">2 Chr 30:5</a>), when King Hezekiah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>) invited all the tribes to assemble for the Passover (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.10-11">2 Chr 30:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT one of Asher’s descendants is mentioned, an 84-year-old widow named Anna, a prophetess. She described Jesus as “the redemption of Jerusalem” from the time of his dedication to the Lord in the temple (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.36-38">Lk 2:36-38</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Fine powder left after something has been thoroughly burned. The burning of sacrificial offerings on the tabernacle or temple altar produced ashes that were disposed of ceremonially (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.16">Lv 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.4.12">4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.10-11">6:10-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.13">Heb 9:13</a>).

Ashes thrown into the air by Moses during the contest of God with the Egyptian pharaoh spread like fine dust over all the land of Egypt and caused a plague of boils to break out among both people and animals (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.8-10">Ex 9:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>Ashes are frequently mentioned in the Bible in connection with the ancient custom of putting ashes on oneself as a symbol of extreme grief, penitence, humiliation, or sense of worthlessness. The Bible refers to ashes and dust almost interchangeably in this usage. Examples of such expressions of emotion include Tamar’s distress after being sexually assaulted by her half brother (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.19">2 Sm 13:19</a>), Mordecai’s agony over the Persian king’s order of genocide for the Jews of his realm (<a href="?bref=Esth.4.1-3">Est 4:1-3</a>), Daniel’s confession and pleading for his captive people (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.3">Dn 9:3</a>), and the king of Nineveh’s repentance after hearing Jonah’s preaching (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.6">Jon 3:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.10.13">Lk 10:13</a>). Ashes were spoken of as symbols of humility (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.27">Gn 18:27</a>), worthlessness or futility (<a href="?bref=Job.13.12">Jb 13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.30.19">30:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.20">Is 44:20</a>), and destruction (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.18">Ez 28:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.6">2 Pt 2:6</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">ASHKELON</p>
<p class="fl">City dating back to ancient times, also spelled Askelon (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). In the Bible, Ashkelon was one of the Philistines’ five main cities (the “pentapolis”), along with Gaza, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.3">Jos 13:3</a>). Ashkelon was located on the Mediterranean coast, 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of modern Tel Aviv, and was always an important port. Often in conflict with Egypt, it was captured by Ramses II (c. 1286 <span class="era">BC</span>) and by Merneptah (c. 1220 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Ashkelon is mentioned as one of the cities conquered by Judah (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.18">Jgs 1:18</a>). After the Philistine invasion of Canaan in the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span>, the city became one of the invaders’ major centers. When Samson’s riddle was answered through the duplicity of his Philistine wife, Samson vented his rage at Ashkelon, killing 30 men (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.19">Jgs 14:19</a>). Ashkelon was partially responsible for pushing the tribe of Dan from its allotment; so Samson, a member of that tribe, probably had a long-standing grudge against the city. Ashkelon also figures in the story of the Philistine control of the ark (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-6.21">1 Sm 4–6</a>). On hearing of the deaths of Saul and Jonathan, David lamented the loss of his king and of his friend, exclaiming that their deaths should not be published in Ashkelon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.20">2 Sm 1:20</a>). Various OT prophets refer to Ashkelon (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.20">Jer 25:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.47.5-6">47:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.8">Am 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.4-7">Zep 2:4-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.5">Zec 9:5</a>).</p>
<p>In the period of Israel’s decline King Pekah of Israel, King Rezin of Damascus, and the king of Ashkelon rebelled against Assyria. Tiglath-pileser III responded with three successive campaigns (734–732 <span class="era">BC</span>), the first of which conquered Ashkelon. Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the city and deported many of its inhabitants to Egypt during his conquest of Palestine (604 <span class="era">BC</span>). Successive invaders then took the city from each other: Scythians, Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, and Maccabees. Ashkelon was the birthplace of Herod the Great, and ruins of his building projects are to be found there. Ashkelon is not mentioned in the NT but was a battleground in the Jewish rebellion against Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 66).</p>

Mention of the kingdom of Ashkenaz along with Ararat and Minni (<a href="?bref=Jer.51.27">Jer 51:27</a>) suggests that he was the ancestor of the Scythians, a people who resided in the Ararat region in Jeremiah’s time. An active, warlike people, the Scythians contributed to the unrest of the Assyrian Empire and to its eventual collapse.

  <title>Ashurbanipal</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ASHURBANIPAL</p>
<p class="fl">Esarhaddon’s son and the Assyrian ruler (669–633 <span class="era">BC</span>) who reigned in the years during which kings Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah governed the southern kingdom of Judah. The northern kingdom of Israel, whose capital was Samaria, had fallen in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> to another powerful Assyrian ruler, Sargon II.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Ashurbanipal (also spelled Assurbanipal) had to fight continually to retain, regain, and defend his empire, which included Babylonia, Persia, Syria, and Egypt. Though his chief interests were evidently cultural, he was required to spend most of his time, and almost all the resources of his empire, maintaining the submission of conquered peoples, putting down a civil war fomented under the leadership of his brother, and coping with constant border skirmishes.</p>
<p>Much of what we know about the culture of ancient Mesopotamia—historical facts, religion, legends, and lore—comes from the cuneiform literature collected by Ashurbanipal and deposited in a large library he built in Nineveh, his capital. The remains of this library, discovered about a century ago and now in the British Museum, continue to have impact on biblical knowledge. Without doubt his library has been his most significant memorial.</p>
<p>Ashurbanipal was evidently the Assyrian monarch who sent alien people into Samaria (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.10">Ezr 4:10</a>). Deportation of conquered peoples was standard Assyrian policy, which accounts for the assimilation and disappearance of the ten tribes of Israel after its fall to Sargon II. In <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.10">Ezra 4:10</a> the Assyrian king is called Osnappar, a transliteration of the Hebrew spelling. The consonantal similarity of the Hebrew word to the Assyrian name Ashurbanipal, plus the list of conquered peoples mentioned in the text, point to Ashurbanipal as the most likely identification.</p>
<p>By 630 <span class="era">BC</span> the Assyrian Empire was experiencing difficulty in maintaining its cohesiveness, and after Ashurbanipal’s death it could no longer sustain itself. Innumerable Assyrian soldiers had died on faraway battlefields; mercenaries and captives pressed into the military did not serve well. Moreover, hordes of barbarians from the steppes of Asia battered Assyria from the outside. Vassal Babylon successfully revolted. Though a mere shadow of its former glory, Egypt also slipped from its Assyrian yoke. Ashurbanipal’s sons were not equal to the task. Probably no one could have been. In less than 20 years a relatively weak coalition of enemies surrounded Nineveh and in 612 <span class="era">BC</span> razed the city. A spark of resistance continued at nearby Haran, but within months it was snuffed out by Median troops. By the same ruthless, unrestrained cruelty with which it ruled its empire, Assyria perished.</p>
<p>The demise of Assyria gave a new lease on life to the tiny kingdom of Judah. Some scholars place Ashurbanipal’s death in King Josiah’s eighth year of reign (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.3-7">2 Chr 34:3-7</a>). As Assyria lost its grip, the resulting vacuum brought back independence by default. Young King Josiah was able to begin and to consummate the most sweeping spiritual revival and political reforms in Judah’s history. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=AssyriaAssyrians_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Assyria, Assyrians</a>; <a href="?item=KingsBooksofFirstandSecond_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Kings, Books of First and Second</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">ASHURNASIRPAL*</p>
<p class="list">1. Ashurnasirpal I (1049?–1031 <span class="era">BC</span>), Assyrian king listed in the synchronistic Assyrian chronicle as the legitimate successor ofShamshi-adad IV (1053?–1050 <span class="era">BC</span>). Ashurnasirpal I ruled during a period of Assyrian weakness following the vigorous reign of Tiglath-pileser I (1115?–1077 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ashurnasirpal II (885–860 <span class="era">BC</span>), Assyrian king, son of Tukulti-ninurta II (890–885 <span class="era">BC</span>). His grandfather, Adad-nirari II (911–891 <span class="era">BC</span>), laid the foundations of the Neo-Assyrian period (900–612 <span class="era">BC</span>). Ashurnasirpal II, its first great monarch, consolidated his position by crushing rebellious middle Euphrates tribes and then conducted campaigns against Syria (877 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Philistia. In his annals he recorded the tribute received from the maritime towns of Philistia: “Gold, silver, tin, copper . . . large and small monkeys, ebony, boxwood, ivory . . . I received.” Ashurnasirpal’s westward expedition was the first of several Assyrian assaults on Syria, ultimately threatening Israelite forces as well. The expedition also established his reputation as a cruel and merciless opponent, a theme repeated constantly in his annals. A statue of Ashurnasirpal II recovered from Calah depicted him as a stern, egotistical despot. He fashioned the Assyrian army into a military machine that struck terror into the hearts of its opponents.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ashurnasirpal II was an outstanding example of the way aggressive rulers in the ancient world treated their enemies. In his annals he boasted: “The heads of their warriors I cut off, and I formed them into a pillar over against their city. . . . I flayed all the chief men . . . and I covered the pillar with their skins; some I walled up within the pillar, some I impaled upon the pillar on stakes.” Other atrocities included burning captives alive; mutilating prisoners by hacking off hands, noses, or ears; gouging out eyes; disemboweling pregnant women; and leaving prisoners in the desert to die of thirst.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ashurnasirpal II made Calah (Nimrud) his capital city, employing more than 50,000 prisoners in the work of reconstruction. A. H. Layard, excavating Nimrud in 1845, uncovered the royal palace with its colossal statuary. Ashurnasirpal II was succeeded in 859 <span class="era">BC</span> by his son Shalmaneser III, who reigned for 35 years. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=AssyriaAssyrians_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Assyria, Assyrians</a>.</p>

  <title>Asia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ASIA</p>
<p class="fl">In NT times, the Roman province immediately east of the Aegean Sea. The province was established in 133 <span class="era">BC</span> out of the kingdom left to the Romans in the will of Attalus III, king of Pergamum. Greek geographers generally employed the name Asia to denote the whole eastern continent, but from the second century on, the Romans generally referred to the kings of Pergamum as “kings of Asia.” Hence the custom of using “Asia” for the peninsula alone (i.e., Asia Minor) gradually crept into popular usage.</p>
<p>The extent of the province of Asia differed at each stage of its history. Before Roman occupation the word was used to refer to the kingdom of the Seleucid dynasty (founded by Seleucus I; 305–281 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Apocrypha referred thus to Asia (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.8.6">1 Macc 8:6</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.13">11:13</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.39">12:39</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.13.32">13:32</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.3.3">2 Macc 3:3</a>), as did the early Jewish historian Josephus in his Antiquities. When the territory was wrested from Seleucid control by the Romans in their war against Antiochus the Great, the Romans gave it to their allies, the Attalids; Attalus III willed it to the Romans. The limits of Roman control were not firmly established until an extensive revolt had been put down. The borders then included Mysia, Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia, and (nearer the Aegean) Aeolis, Ionia, and Troas. The islands off the coast (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Rhodes, Patmos, etc.) were also included. The mainland now forms part of modern Turkey.</p>
<p>In 116 <span class="era">BC</span> the province was enlarged to include Greater Phrygia. Its geographic limits were then Bithynia to the north, Galatia to the east, Lycia to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. Even then, the boundaries were not solidly fixed, for in 25 <span class="era">BC</span> Augustus Caesar augmented Rome’s dominion by combining other parts of Phrygia, Lyconia, Pisidia, and possibly Pamphylia into a province called Galatia. Those geographical limits remained until <span class="era">AD</span> 285, when the province was greatly reduced in size and the term Asia became restricted to the coastal areas and lower valleys of the Maeander, Cayster, Hermus, and Caicus Rivers.</p>
<p>During Roman occupation the capital of the province was Pergamum. By the time of Augustus, however, the residence of the Roman proconsul was at Ephesus.</p>
<p>In the NT, Asia generally meant the Roman province of that name. Sometimes the concept was primarily geographical; at other times primarily political. For example, at the Feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem there were Jews who had come from “Asia.” These included other provinces governed by Rome, such as Cappadocia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.9-10">Acts 2:9-10</a>). This seems to indicate that Luke, the writer of Acts, used the term to describe the province originally bequeathed to the Romans by Attalus III. Luke used the word again in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>, providing tacit evidence of the strength of Jewish communities in Asia Minor as a whole and confirming the use of “Asia” in the restricted sense of the Roman province.</p>
<p>On Paul’s second missionary journey, he and Timothy were prevented by the Holy Spirit from preaching in Asia (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.6-8">Acts 16:6-8</a>). Evidently, from the context, Luke again had the old boundaries of the province in mind. On Paul’s return from Greece he stopped briefly at Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.19-21">Acts 18:19-21</a>). On his third missionary journey, he remained in Ephesus for more than two years, so that from this capital city “all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.10">Acts 19:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Luke further referred to Asia in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.26-27">Acts 19:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.4,16,18">20:4, 16, 18</a>; and <a href="?bref=Acts.27.2">27:2</a>. Paul also made several references to it (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.5">Rom 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8">2 Cor 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.15">2 Tm 1:15</a>). The apostle Peter likewise used the term (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pt 1:1</a>). In the NT the risen Christ was the last to refer to Asia. He instructed the apostle John, then living in exile on the island of Patmos, to write letters to seven specific churches on the mainland of Asia (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-4">Rv 1:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>Other cities in this Roman province mentioned in the NT include Laodicea and Hierapolis (<a href="?bref=Col.4.13">Col 4:13</a>), and lesser-known Adramyttium (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.2">Acts 27:2</a>), and Assos (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.13-14">Acts 20:13-14</a>).</p>

Several such officials were concerned for the safety of Paul during a silversmiths’ riot in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.31">Acts 19:31</a>). Nothing else is known about their qualifications, periods of tenure, or duties. Why there were a number of such officers in Ephesus at the time of the riot, or why the Asiarchs showed such concern for Paul, is not clear. Perhaps they were deputies of the “Commune of Asia,” responsible to promote and protect the imperial cult (the worship practices of Rome and the emperor). The Asiarchs mentioned were evidently not adverse to a religious movement like Christianity, which embarrassed the prevailing pagan cult of Artemis. The long account in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-41">Acts 19</a> repeats one of Luke’s themes, that Christianity was not subversive, nor was Paul a political menace. Otherwise the Asiarchs would not have favored him in such a manner.</p>

<p class="h1">ASSHUR (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient name of a city on the Tigris River whose habitation can be traced back to about 2500 <span class="era">BC</span>. Asshur was not a large city (less than one-tenth the size of Babylon or Nineveh), but it formed the homeland and first capital of the later Assyrian kingdom.</p>
<p>Asshur had become a thriving city by the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, trading with the Assyrian colony at Kanish (in modern Turkey). It reached its peak in the old Assyrian Empire under Shamshi-adad I (1813–1781 <span class="era">BC</span>), who stretched his control over most of northern Mesopotamia, including Mari. His empire fell to Hammurabi of Babylon (1792–1750 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Asshur entered a dark period about which little is known. When the Assyrians once again became a major power in the Near East late in the second millennium, the capital was moved away from Asshur; however, it remained the ancient holy city and the home of the Assyrian national god, Asshur.</p>
<p>For centuries the exact location of Asshur was unknown, but during the 19th century it was established that Qalat Shergat in Iraq was the modern location of this ancient Assyrian capital. The Germans excavated the site for a number of years prior to World War I. They uncovered a temple to Anu-adad that contained a large double ziggurat that still dominates the site today. A palace and several other buildings were also excavated. Among the literary discoveries were an Assyrian account of the Babylonian creation epic and a portion of the law code of the Assyrians.</p>

<p class="h1">ASSYRIA, ASSYRIANS</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient empire considered the symbol of terror and tyranny in the Near East for more than three centuries. Assyria received its name from the tiny city-state Asshur, on the western bank of the Tigris River in northern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). The city was the seat of worship of the sun god Asshur (also spelled Ashur). The Hebrew name occurs frequently in the Bible and is translated Assyria (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.14">Gn 2:14</a>), Assur (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.2">Ezr 4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.83.8">Ps 83:8</a>), or left as Asshur (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.11">Gn 10:11</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The form of the name comes originally from the Akkadian language.</p>
<p>Originally, Assyria was a small district in northern Mesopotamia, lying in a rough triangle between the Tigris River and the Upper Zab, a tributary of the Tigris. Eventually Assyria gained control of northern Syria, securing an outlet to the Mediterranean Sea, and took possession of the fertile Mesopotamian plain, extending Assyrian domain over all of Babylonia to the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="h3">Before the Eighth Century <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="fl">By the end of the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, the Sumerians were trading with Assyria and influencing its people culturally. Periodically Sumerian kings would claim political control over Assyria. Sargon of Agade (c. 2350 <span class="era">BC</span>) brought Assyria within the sphere of his political and commercial activities, and when the Amorites overthrew the third dynasty of Ur and established their own states, one of them incorporated Assyria into its territory. During the period of Hammurabi, one of the last great kings of the first Babylonian dynasty (c. 2360–1600 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Assyrians supplied building materials and other goods for the Babylonian kingdom.</p>
<p>Trade between Asshur and the Assyrian colony of Kanish in Anatolia began at a very early time in Assyrian history. Goods were transported by caravans of up to 200 donkeys at a time. The wealth pouring in from such a trade put Assyria in a very strong position economically.</p>
<p>The early phase of Assyrian commercial development was followed by a long period of decline, culminating in the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>. At that time Assyria was reduced to a state of vassalage by a non-Semitic people, the Hurrians (biblical Horites) of the state of Mitanni. In the 14th century another non-Semitic people, the Hittites, overthrew the power of Mitanni. Assyria was gradually able to rise again and assume the role of a great power in the ancient Near East, largely through the policies of a shrewd prince, Asshur-uballit. His reign marked the beginning of a long process by which Assyria ultimately rose to supremacy.</p>
<p>Enlil-nirari (1329–1320 <span class="era">BC</span>), son and successor of Asshur-uballit, attacked Babylon and defeated Kurigalzu II, the Kassite king of Babylon (1345–1324 <span class="era">BC</span>). Adad-nirari I (1307–1275 <span class="era">BC</span>) extended Assyria’s influence by winning victories over the Kassites in Babylonia. He also added territory to the northwest.</p>
<p>The period of consolidation and expansion in the first Assyrian Empire culminated in the capture of Babylon by Tukulti-ninurta I (1244–1208 <span class="era">BC</span>), which for the first time placed Babylon under Assyrian rule. After that climax, however, Assyrian power declined.</p>
<p>The three centuries from about 1200 to 900 <span class="era">BC</span> were marked by movements of different peoples such as the Greeks, Philistines, Arameans, and Hebrews. Under pressure of people migrating from Europe, the Hittite Empire, which formerly had given political stability to Asia Minor and protected the trade routes, crumbled rapidly. By 1200 <span class="era">BC</span> it fell to attacks by the Sea Peoples from the Greek mainland.</p>
<p>During the tenth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Assyria began to make a slow recovery. In the reign of Adad-nirari II (911–891 <span class="era">BC</span>), Assyria again launched upon a period of conspicuous economic and military expansion. For the next 60 years Assyrian kings followed a consistent policy of consolidating the work of Adad-nirari II. Ashurnasirpal II (885–860 <span class="era">BC</span>) is considered the first great monarch of that new era in Assyrian history. He possessed all the qualities and defects of his successors to the extreme. He had the ambition, energy, courage, vanity, and magnificence of a ruthless, indefatigable empire builder. Ashurnasirpal’s first activities were directed to the mountain area to the east, where he extended Assyria’s control among the mountain people. In the west he subdued the Arameans with characteristic cruelty and did likewise in Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser III is well known to historians of the biblical world for the battle of Qarqar (853 <span class="era">BC</span>), considered the most fully documented event from the ancient world. He launched an invasion of Syria that was met by a coalition led by Ben-hadad of Damascus and supported by King Ahab of Israel and several other states. Since Shalmaneser was unable to rout the 60,000 troops opposing him, it was many years before the Assyrians were able to conquer Damascus and Samaria. King Jehu of Israel (841–814 <span class="era">BC</span>), who later chose to pay tribute rather than fight, is represented, perhaps by an envoy, on the Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III, excavated at Shalmaneser’s capital city, Calah (now called Nimrud). Jehu is depicted as kissing the ground at the Assyrian monarch’s feet and offering a tribute of silver, gold, and lead vessels.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his reign Shalmaneser had to put down a rebellion by some of the principal Assyrian cities. He was succeeded by his heir, Shamshi-adad V (823–811 <span class="era">BC</span>). Shamshi-adad’s son Adad-nirari III (810–782 <span class="era">BC</span>) built a new palace at Calah and attacked King Hazael of Damascus (Syria) in 804 <span class="era">BC</span>. Assyrian pressure on the Syrians undoubtedly was a relief to Israel, which had been oppressed by Hazael (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.22-25">2 Kgs 13:22-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">From the Eighth Century to the Battle of Carchemish (605 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Beginning about 800 <span class="era">BC</span> the influence of Urartu (Ararat) began to expand, especially in north Syria, at the expense of Assyria. The next half century saw a drastic decline in Assyria’s fortunes. In 746 <span class="era">BC</span>, during a revolt in the city of Calah, the entire royal family was murdered.</p>
<p>The final phase of Assyrian power was instituted by the usurper Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>), known also by his adopted Babylonian throne-name Pul (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19">2 Kgs 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.26">1 Chr 5:26</a>). His reign began the process by which Assyria recovered and consolidated control of all its territories and established itself firmly as the dominant military and economic power in the Near East. Tiglath-pileser first secured control of the mountain passes in the north in order to eliminate the threat of invasion from that direction. Next he subjected Syria and Palestine in the west and took control of the road to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, through diplomacy, he gained the throne of Babylonia also. Under the name of Pul he governed Babylonia, creating the remarkable situation of two crowns united in one ruler bearing two different names. His political prudence was not usually found in the ruthless Assyrian monarchs.</p>
<p>From the year 743 <span class="era">BC</span> Tiglath-pileser III waged a number of campaigns in Syria and Palestine. King Menahem of Israel (752–742 <span class="era">BC</span>) paid him tribute (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19-20">2 Kgs 15:19-20</a>), as did Tyre, Byblos, and Damascus. In 738 he subjugated the north central state of Hamath. Responding to an appeal from King Ahaz of Judah (735–715 <span class="era">BC</span>) to help resist the pressures of a proposed anti-Assyrian coalition, Tiglath-pileser conquered Damascus in 732 and Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, a decade later. On both occasions deportations of people to Assyria took place. The fall of Samaria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> marked the end of the kingdom of Israel.</p>
<p>Sargon II (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>) claimed to be the Assyrian ruler who captured Samaria, but the biblical record attributed the capture to Shalmaneser (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.2-6">2 Kgs 17:2-6</a>). To the policy of deportation, Sargon and his successors added that of colonization. To replace the peoples carried into captivity, these Assyrian kings brought tribes from Babylonia, Elam, Syria, and Arabia and settled them in Samaria and surrounding territory. The new arrivals intermingled with the indigenous people remaining in the land after the deportation and became the Samaritans.</p>
<p>After 10 years of warfare against his enemies to the west in Syria and Asia Minor, and to the north in Urartu, Sargon concentrated his efforts on Babylonia. He chased Merodach-baladan II (721–710 <span class="era">BC</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12-19">2 Kgs 20:12-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1">Is 39:1</a>) to Elam and made himself king of Babylon in 709. He started building a new capital city for himself, Dur-Sharrukin (Khorsabad) near Nineveh but was killed in battle before it was finished.</p>
<p>Sargon was succeeded by his son Sennacherib (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>), who was occupied throughout his reign in a series of bitter wars. He is especially known in biblical studies for his campaign against Judah and siege of Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the ministry of the prophet Isaiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-19.37">2 Kgs 18:13–19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-37.38">Is 36–37</a>). It was during that crisis that the celebrated Siloam Tunnel was constructed to bring water into the beleaguered capital from the spring of Gihon, outside the city wall, to the pool of Siloam (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kgs 20:20</a>).</p>
<p>Sennacherib was murdered in 681 <span class="era">BC</span> and was succeeded by Esarhaddon, who tried unsuccessfully to establish Assyrian control over Egypt. Esarhaddon was succeeded by Ashurbanipal (669–626? <span class="era">BC</span>), who managed to capture No-amon (Thebes), thereby realizing the greatest victory in Assyrian history (cf. <a href="?bref=Nah.3.3-10">Na 3:3-10</a>). Ashurbanipal established a great library in Nineveh, which was excavated in 1860. Many tablets made of the finest clay and ranging in size from 1 to 15 inches (2.5 to 38 centimeters) were found, containing a vast selection of Akkadian material. Some of the tablets contain historical records; others, astronomical reports, mathematical calculations, and private or public letters. A considerable part of the collection deals with astrology and medicine. Many of the tablets contain prayers, incantations, psalms, and religious texts in general. A copy of the Babylonian account of creation was also found. This library is now one of the principal treasures of the British Museum in London.</p>
<p>Very little is known about Ashurbanipal’s reign after 639 <span class="era">BC</span> since his annals do not extend beyond that year. However, some information on events of his last 13 years can be gleaned from allusions in state correspondence, commercial documents, and prayers addressed to the gods. Evidently the situation in Assyria was becoming increasingly serious, and when Ashurbanipal died in 626 his empire declined quickly.</p>
<p>The Medes had entered the Assyrian annals during the reign of Esarhaddon, when they still consisted of a large number of associated but separate tribes. Later those tribes began to be welded into a single kingdom. Herodotus states that Phraortes, their king, attacked Assyria but lost his life on the battlefield and was succeeded by his son Cyaxeres.</p>
<p>The year 626 <span class="era">BC</span> marked several important events in the ancient world. Nabopolassar, a Chaldean prince, became king of Babylon (626–605 <span class="era">BC</span>) toward the end of that year. An alliance between the Medes and Nabopolassar was concluded, and from that time on, the success of Nabopolassar against Assyria was almost inevitable. By the year 617 <span class="era">BC</span> he had cleared Babylonia of all Assyrian garrisons. He then marched up the Euphrates to the Aramean districts that had been part of the Assyrian Empire for two and a half centuries. The plan was for Nabopolassar to attack Nineveh from the west and the Medes to attack it at the same time from the east; however, the combined forces of the Assyrians and Egyptians, now allies, compelled Nabopolassar to withdraw to Babylon.</p>
<p>In 614 <span class="era">BC</span> the Medes carried out a massive attack on Assyria. Although Nineveh was too strong to yield to the attack, the Medes captured some of the neighboring cities, including Asshur, the ancient capital. At that point Nabopolassar arrived with the Babylonian forces. He met Cyaxeres at Asshur, and they established mutual friendship and peace. Their alliance was later confirmed by the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar, Nabopolassar’s son, to Amytis, daughter of Cyaxeres. In 612 <span class="era">BC</span> their combined forces launched a final assault against Nineveh, and after three months of siege the mighty city fell (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.8">Na 1:8</a>).</p>
<p>Despite the loss of their capital, a weakened Assyrian kingdom survived for three more years. The Assyrian troops who could escape from Nineveh fled westward to Haran, where an Assyrian prince, Asshur-uballit, was made king and sought Egypt’s help to restore the kingship of Assyria. Necho II (609–593 <span class="era">BC</span>), known in the Bible as Neco, responded and set off with his Egyptian troops to Haran to fight against the Babylonians, who by now had annihilated Assyria. King Josiah of Judah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>), who evidently considered himself a vassal of Assyria’s heir, Neo-Babylonia, marched to oppose the Egyptian advance and was mortally wounded by an arrow on the battlefield of Megiddo (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29-30">2 Kgs 23:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.20-24">2 Chr 35:20-24</a>).</p>
<p>When Nabopolassar and his allies attacked Haran in 610 <span class="era">BC</span>, Asshur-uballit did not attempt to defend it but fled southwest to await Necho and his troops. The joint forces of the Egyptians and the Assyrians returned to mount an assault upon Haran with some initial success. But Nabopolassar’s army compelled the Assyrian-Egyptian forces to abandon the siege and withdraw to Carchemish (present-day Jarablus). There, under the leadership of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonians made a direct attack on the powerful army. The resultant carnage on both sides was graphically depicted by the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-12">46:1-12</a>). Nebuchadnezzar emerged victorious in the battle of Carchemish (605 <span class="era">BC</span>). However, because of the death of his father, he did not pursue his victory but returned to Babylon to assume the throne.</p>
<p>There is a tradition in the Assyrian Christian church that after the collapse of the Assyrian Empire under the onslaught of the Medes and Neo-Babylonians, a remnant of the Assyrian people—chiefly princes, noblemen, and warriors—took refuge in the mountains of Kurdistan. There they built a number of armed fortresses. Alexander the Great (336–323 <span class="era">BC</span>), his successors, and the Roman legions made no attempt to conquer these tribes. Trajan (<span class="era">AD</span> 98–117) marched at the head of the Roman armies through Armenia, touching the northern region of Kurdistan, on his way to Persia. It is asserted that the wise men, or magi, who visited the newly born king in Bethlehem, the baby Jesus, came from Edessa. According to this tradition, the magi, on returning from Bethlehem, proclaimed the amazing things they had heard and seen on their visit to the king. A Christian church was founded among the Assyrians that has survived throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>The region that was Assyria, including all of Mesopotamia, is within present-day Iraq, an Arabic-speaking country predominantly Muslim in religion.</p>

  <title>Astrology</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ASTROLOGY</p>
<p class="fl">Pseudoscience dealing with the supposed influence of the heavenly bodies on human character and destiny. Astrological conclusions are based on the apparent movement of the sun and planets through the zodiac, an arbitrary division of the celestial sphere into 12 segments identified with 12 major constellations. As the sun travels in its path, called the ecliptic, it cuts across the zodiac at various points. The movement of the sun and the planets in relation to the zodiac provides astrologers with patterns or “aspects” from which their interpretative schemes are drawn.</p>
<p>The 12 segments of the zodiac are called “houses.” Constellations (e.g., Leo, Virgo, Sagittarius) associated with the respective houses are called “signs.” One’s date of birth determines the sign under which one is born. Using a rather elaborate procedure, an astrologer attempts to draw up a celestial map or “horoscope.” Horoscopes are based on the supposed fact that persons born under a given sign have certain characteristics in common. Positions of the various planets with reference to the signs, or positions of the sun and moon with reference to one another, are regarded as pointing to favorable or unfavorable conditions.</p>
<p>The earliest known account of the use of astrology comes from ancient Sumer, a region in the lower Euphrates River valley. The Sumerian Gudea cylinders contain an account of a dream of King Gudea in which the goddess Nidaba came to him holding a tablet inscribed with a map of the heavens. The dream indicated that it was a propitious time for Gudea to build the Eninnu temple.</p>
<p>Astrology flourished in ancient Babylon under the influence of priests. It was integrally linked with the serious study of celestial phenomena. The superstitious Babylonians were intensely concerned with omens, so it is understandable that they would attempt to find omens in the observable movements of the sun, moon, planets, and stars. To the best of our knowledge the Babylonians originated the zodiac. They also drew up a monthly calendar of days that were propitious and days on which activity should be reduced to a minimum for fear of incurring the anger of one or more deities. This monthly pattern then served for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Babylonian influence in astronomy and astrology spread to Greece in the fourth century. The Greeks’ interest in science and their polytheistic religion, which allowed for the attribution of deity to heavenly bodies, undoubtedly inclined them to take up astrology and to develop it extensively.</p>
<p>The spread of Hellenistic culture brought the practice of astrology to Egypt, where it flourished for a long time. Herodotus, an early Greek historian, stated that the Egyptians were the first to use a person’s day of birth to predict character. Herodotus also wrote that the Egyptians kept careful records of unusual phenomena, which they used as a basis for predicting consequences that might follow similar phenomena in the future. The Egyptians contributed a number of refinements to the Greek astrological system, such as division of the sky into 36 sections, each with its own deity. They also divided the day into 24 hours.</p>
<p>The influence of Greek astrology was felt in the Roman world as well. A Roman astrologer named Nigidius, who was strongly influenced by Greek thought, made prognostications that show considerable subtlety—and also considerable vagueness. Not much is known about other Roman astrologers, although astrological belief played an important role in Roman life. A system of lucky and unlucky days was developed. The names of the days of the week were derived from the names of planets (which bore the names of gods). The practice of naming the days of the week for the planets probably goes back to the Hellenistic period. Roman contributions to the calendar system paved the way for an even more widespread use of astrology. For example, astrological computation was made easier for ordinary people by the adoption in 46 <span class="era">BC</span> of the 365-day Julian calendar.</p>
<p>It is often alleged that references to astrological motifs occur in the Bible. The blessings pronounced by Jacob on his 12 sons, for example, have been associated by some with the signs of the zodiac. Apocalyptic imagery of a cosmic nature is frequently regarded as having astrological significance. All such interpretations are highly speculative.</p>
<p>Attempts to predict the future by appeal to false deities, mediums, or objects were forbidden in the OT. The reason was that such attempts ignored God as the true source of revelation. The future was foretold by persons, like Daniel, who could interpret dreams, but the Scriptures make clear that Daniel’s ability was given to him by God (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.17-23">Dn 2:17-23</a>).</p>
<p>Specific reference to astrological prognostication is found in <a href="?bref=Isa.47.12-13">Isaiah 47:12-13</a> in an oracle dealing with the fall of Babylon. In that oracle the prophet Isaiah referred to a number of features that characterized that great empire. He spoke of enchantments practiced in Babylon. In an ironic tone he told the Babylonians to continue with their sorceries—they might bring success. He singled out the astrologers and referred specifically to the division of the heavens, evidently meaning the Babylonian division of the celestial sphere into segments (possibly the zodiac). He made reference as well to their custom of predicting the future at the time of each new moon. The point of the passage is that destruction will come to Babylon, and even its eminent astrologers will not be able to save it.</p>
<p>The prophet Jeremiah warned the Israelites not to be dismayed by signs in the heavens (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.1-3">Jer 10:1-3</a>). Those signs were evidently unusual celestial phenomena like eclipses, comets, and conjunctions of planets, all of which inspired dread in the hearts of most ancient people. The passage in Jeremiah indicates that it is wrong for God’s people to attribute mystical influence to such phenomena or to see in them portents of the future. Prognostication on the basis of such celestial phenomena was considered futile (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.3">Jer 10:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>The book of Daniel refers to a group of soothsayers, frequently understood to be astrologers (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.27">Dn 2:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.11">5:11</a>). The meaning of the word, however, is uncertain. It is derived from an Aramaic root meaning “to cut” or “divide” and hence may be a reference to the Babylonian practice of dividing the heavens into zones. The fact that the group is mentioned along with various kinds of diviners makes it quite likely that they were astrologers. The passage in Daniel demonstrates that those who use various “mantic” arts to predict the future are ineffectual.</p>
<p>The magi, who figure prominently in the account of the birth of Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-16">Mt 2:1-16</a>), may have been astrologers, although the word “magi” has broader connotations. It is possible that an unusual conjunction of planets at the time of the infancy of Christ was interpreted by them as a sign of the birth of the Jewish king. The magi could have learned about Jewish messianic belief from the book of Daniel or from the many Jewish officials in the Persian Empire. A tradition may have arisen from <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Numbers 24:17</a> that a star would be associated with the birth of the messianic king. Any unusual stellar phenomenon in the western sky might have led the magi to follow it to Palestine. The biblical account definitely does not validate astrological principles.</p>

<p class="h1">ASTRONOMY*</p>
<p class="fl">Science dealing with the phenomena outside the earth’s atmosphere but especially concerned with the observable arrangements, motions, and characteristics of the heavenly bodies. The word “astronomy” is based on two Greek words meaning “the law of the stars.”</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="RemarkableAstronomicalEventsInTheBible"/>
<p>Astronomy is by no means a modern science. Human beings have always been preoccupied with the heavens. The concern of the earliest civilizations with the universe appears to have been mainly astrological, but intellectual curiosity and the need for navigational orientation were certainly additional factors.</p>
<p>The Bible provides some interesting insights about astronomy. According to <a href="?bref=Gen.1.14-19">Genesis 1:14-19</a> the sun and moon, along with the stars, have the function of giving light on the earth, determining the seasons, and functioning as “signs.” The word “season” may denote festal seasons as well as the annual seasons. The Hebrew calendar was a lunar-solar calendar similar to that of the Babylonians. Hebrew festal seasons were based on the phases of the moon. The function of the heavenly bodies as signs seems to relate to their delineation of the heavens, permitting human beings on earth to orient themselves, navigate, etc.</p>
<p>Although the observed occurrence of an eclipse is never mentioned in the Bible, such a phenomenon is probably behind the numerous references to the darkening of the sun and moon in certain apocalyptic passages (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.31">Jl 2:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.9">Am 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.29">Mt 24:29</a>).</p>
<p>A number of constellations are cited in the OT. It is difficult to determine with certainty, however, which constellations are intended by particular Hebrew words. The Hebrew word translated “Pleiades” (in many versions) means “cluster” or “heap.” It is reasonable to suppose that the term applies to the most prominent cluster of stars in the heavens, the Pleiades. That cluster, within the constellation Taurus, is alluded to in <a href="?bref=Job.9.9">Job 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.38.31">38:31</a>; and <a href="?bref=Amos.5.8">Amos 5:8</a>.</p>
<p>A Hebrew word possibly related to the word “fool” is frequently understood to be the constellation Orion. The connection between that constellation and the word “fool” is unknown. Other constellations are noted as “the constellations of the southern sky” and the “the constellation of the Bear” (<a href="?bref=Job.9.9">Jb 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.38.32">38:32</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The Bear is known to most North Americans as the Big Dipper; it can be seen in the northern sky.</p>
<p>The stars are often referred to in Scripture. Their vast number was used as an analogy in God’s promise to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.5">Gn 15:5</a>). The apostle Paul referred to the varying magnitudes of the stars (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.41">1 Cor 15:41</a>). The writer of Jude used the concept of wandering stars to describe teachers in the early church who were propounding false doctrine (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.13">Jude 1:13</a>). The metaphor is thought by some to be based on the observable movement of the stars around the polestar. It is the fixed polestar, not the stars apparently moving in paths around it, that provides the reference point for navigation. A false teacher, like the apparently moving stars, would be an unreliable guide. It seems better, however, to understand Jude’s metaphor as referring to the planets. The study of astronomy by that time had advanced to the point where the regular apparent movements of the stars around the polestar and the position of constellations and star clusters were all well known. It is unlikely that all stars but the polestar were considered wandering stars. Planets, on the other hand, were regarded by ancient observers as traveling in erratic paths quite different from the fixed rotation of stars around the polestar. Some commentators think wandering stars referred to comets.</p>

  <title>Astyages</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ASTYAGES</p>
<p class="fl">Fourth and final king of the Medes (according to an early Greek historian, Herodotus), reigning 35 years until 550 <span class="era">BC</span>. At that time his Persian grandson, Cyrus II, revolted and overthrew Astyages’ kingdom. Supposedly Astyages had been forewarned in a dream about the prowess of a future offspring of his daughter Mandane. To protect himself he married her to Cambyses I, a Persian of royal lineage, because the Persians were weak at that time. To make himself even more secure Astyages arranged to have Cyrus, their son, abandoned in the wilds. But Cyrus was allegedly spared and raised by a cowherd until his true identity was discovered, whereupon he was sent to Persia to live with his royal parents.</p>
<p>With the help of Harpagus, a man greatly wronged by Astyages, Cyrus revolted against his Median grandfather and gained the crown for himself. According to Herodotus, Cyrus then allowed Astyages to live in the royal court without further harming him.</p>
<p>Mention of Astyages in an Apocryphal book (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bel.1.1">Bel 1:1</a>) gives a somewhat different impression, implying that Cyrus received the kingdom upon the death of Astyages. The statement could be merely popular stereotyped expression rather that an attempt to recount actual historical events. Certain cuneiform inscriptions support Herodotus’s account.</p>

<p class="list-text">Like her mother, Jezebel, Athaliah worshiped the Canaanite god Baal and encouraged her husband to do the same. Evidently she had considerable influence over Jehoram.

<p class="list-text">Because the kings of Israel and Judah disobeyed the Lord, Jehu was anointed by God to be the true king of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.2-3">2 Kgs 9:2-3</a>).

  <title>Athens</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ATHENS</p>
<p class="fl">Capital of modern Greece and for centuries chief city of the province of Attica. Athens’ famous landmark is the Acropolis, a steep flat rock that rises about 200 feet (61 meters) above the plain around it and which still holds several masterpieces of architecture. Walls dating from 1100 <span class="era">BC</span> indicate an advanced community by that time.</p>
<p>Athens began its rise to glory in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, first under the leadership of Solon (d. 559 <span class="era">BC</span>), who established democratic forms of government, and later under Pericles (d. 429 <span class="era">BC</span>), when the magnificent buildings of the Acropolis took form. In this golden age, Athens became the center of philosophy, art, architecture, and drama.</p>
<p>By the time Paul brought the Christian message to Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.15-34">Acts 17:15-34</a>), the city had only a portion of its former glory and prestige. Roman emperors continued to extend patronage by providing for new buildings and the restoration of the Agora (marketplace). Athens continued to be the home of the most prominent university in the Greek world. Both Epicurean and Stoic philosophy had worthy representatives in the city.</p>
<p>The Christian message was first brought to Athens by the apostle Paul on his second missionary journey about <span class="era">AD</span> 50. His only reference to Athens is in <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, where he indicated that he and Timothy arrived in the city together but that shortly thereafter he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica while he remained alone in Athens.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfAthens"/>
<p>Luke has provided a more complete account of Paul’s ministry there (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.16-34">Acts 17:16-34</a>). His arrival in a city marked by many statues to the gods, which surpassed anything he had seen in other cities, provoked in him strong feelings against such rampant idolatry. Reared in the strict monotheism of Judaism, Paul apparently viewed Athens as the epitome of sin, and the cultural majesty of the city could not undo this impression.</p>
<p>As did almost all cities of that day, Athens had its community of Jews, and Paul began to speak, according to his custom, with his own kinsmen. Before long he was also in the marketplace, speaking about Jesus to anyone who would listen, including some of the philosophers, who spoke condescendingly of him as peddling “scrap ideas.” Paul’s preaching of Jesus and the resurrection sounded as though he was proclaiming a new deity, which earned him a summons before the Areopagus, a civic body responsible for the religious and moral life of Athens. As such it had to approve any new deity. The name Areopagus came from a small hill just off the Acropolis where the body formerly sat for deliberations. By Paul’s time its meetings were commonly held in a portico at one end of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Most of Luke’s account consists of Paul’s message to the Areopagus, in which he referred to the many gods, even to an “unknown god.” Paul declared that he was making known to them the God who was not known. He closed his address with a call to repentance and judgment. His reference to the resurrection brought division, but some individuals wanted to hear more.</p>
<p>Luke says only that a few followed Paul, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagite council, and a woman named Damaris. Athens seems to be one of the few places where Paul did not succeed in establishing a church, and thus it did not figure prominently in early Christian history.</p>

  <title>Atonement</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ATONEMENT</p>
<p class="fl">In Christian thought, the act by which God and man are brought together in personal relationship. The term is derived from Anglo-Saxon words meaning “making at one,” hence “at-one-ment.” It presupposes a separation or alienation that needs to be overcome if human beings are to know God and have fellowship with him. As a term expressing relationship, atonement is tied closely to such terms as reconciliation and forgiveness.</p>
<p>In the <span class="sc">kjv</span> the word “atonement” occurs many times in the OT but only once in the NT (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.11">Rom 5:11</a>). Modern translations generally, and more correctly, render the word “reconciliation.” The idea of atonement is ever present in the NT, however, and is one of the fundamental concepts of Scripture. God is seen as taking the initiative in man’s salvation; thus atonement is the work of God, who opens the possibility for sinful human beings to receive pardoning grace. For the sinner, who cannot know God, who cannot bridge the gap between himself and God, a “new and living way” is opened up by God.</p>
<p>The need for atonement is bound up with man’s thoroughgoing sinfulness. All of Scripture (cited below from the <span class="sc">rsv</span> unless otherwise noted) points to the radical nature of that sinfulness. The prophet Isaiah affirmed, “All we like sheep have gone astray” (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.6">Is 53:6</a>). According to another prophet, Jeremiah, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand it?” (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.9">Jer 17:9</a>). David the psalmist cried, “There is none that does good, no, not one” (<a href="?bref=Ps.14.3">Ps 14:3</a>). Paul described the degeneracy of man caused by his disobedience and idolatry (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-32">Rom 1:18-32</a>) and summed it up: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">Rom 3:23</a>). Elsewhere Paul described men as enemies of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.10">Rom 5:10</a>), as “hostile to God” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.7">Rom 8:7</a>), as “estranged and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.21">Col 1:21</a>). Adam’s race is just like Adam: “Therefore as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all men sinned” (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12">Rom 5:12</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheSignificanceOfAtonementInTheNewTestament"/>
<p>The problem of the sinfulness of humanity is compounded by the holiness of God, who cannot look upon sin. Isaiah saw the holy God in the temple and drew back because of his own sinfulness (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-5">Is 6:1-5</a>). Not only is man terribly sinful, but God is fearfully holy. Consequently man dreads God and can do nothing to change this situation. He is lost, helpless, standing under the awful judgment of God. He cannot justify himself before God and cannot merit God’s concern. The possibility of atonement, then, rests entirely with God. The nature of that atonement, as illustrated in biblical history, affirms simultaneously the nature of both God and man.</p>
<p>The Hebrew term frequently translated “atone” has the basic meaning “to wipe out,” “to erase, “to cover,” or perhaps more generally “to remove.” In the <span class="sc">kjv</span> it is translated by such expressions as “to make atonement,” “forgive,” “appease,” “pacify,” “pardon,” “purge,” “put off,” and “reconcile.”</p>
<p>The most common OT expression of the means of atonement was the sacrifice and offering up of the blood of a victim. In a sacrifice the shedding of blood was the central act. Life was in the blood (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.11">Lv 17:11</a>); in the pouring out of the blood, life was given up; that is, death occurred. Elsewhere blood may be a symbol for life, but in the sacrificial motif it symbolized death. Some scholars have argued that in the pouring forth of the blood, life was made available to the people. It was the life <span class="ital">of the flesh,</span> however, that was in the blood, and the flesh was sacrificed. In the NT it is by virtue of the resurrection that the life of Christ is made available to believers.</p>
<p>Not every OT mention of atonement referred directly to the shedding of blood. On the Day of Atonement one of two goats was slain, but the other was “presented alive before the Lord to make atonement” (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.10">Lv 16:10</a>). That “scapegoat” was driven out into the wilderness bearing the sins of the people. Banishment or expulsion took the place of blood as the goat, bearing the sins of the people, suffered the fate of the sinner. The goat was a substitute for the people. Money offered for the temple was also said to make atonement (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.16">Ex 30:16</a>). In another text Aaron and Moses prevented the spreading of a plague by carrying incense: “He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people” (<a href="?bref=Num.16.47">Nm 16:47</a>). Those few special expressions do not undo the basic OT theme of atonement through provision of a substitute animal. The NT summarizes that theme by saying that “without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins” (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.22">Heb 9:22</a>).</p>
<p>From atonement for sin in the OT came such terms as “expiation” and “forgiveness.” From the idea of atonement for the wrath or judgment of God came “propitiation” and “reconciliation.” Hence in modern English translations various terms attempt to express the concept of atonement provided by God.</p>
<p>Throughout the NT it is made clear that the work of Christ, primarily the cross, is what provides atonement. OT language continues to find expression in the NT, especially the term “blood.” Thus in the NT we have the “blood of the covenant” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>) and the “new covenant in my blood” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>) as well as the “blood of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.13">Eph 2:13</a>) and the “blood of his cross” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.20">Col 1:20</a>). Almost equivalent are the frequent references to the cross and the death of Christ. The NT is the “new covenant” of Jesus Christ, sealed by his blood.</p>

<p class="h1">ATONEMENT, D<span class="lc">ay of</span></p>
<p class="fl">Yom Kippur, the most important day in the religious calendar of Israel, falling on the 10th day of Tishri (the Hebrew month corresponding to mid-September through mid-October). On that day the high priest entered the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle (or temple) to atone for the sins of all Israel. The basic idea of atonement is a “covering” of sin; the purpose is to accomplish reconciliation between man and God. In the NT the Day of Atonement was referred to as the “fast” (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.9">Acts 27:9</a>). To the rabbis, it was the “Day” or the “Great Day.”</p>
<p>Although many additional rites were added over the centuries, the basic description of the original Day of Atonement is <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Leviticus 16</a>. Complex and detailed ceremonies all focused on the central objective of complete atonement by sacrifice. First, the high priest removed his official garments, made for beauty and glory, and clothed himself in white linen as a symbol of repentance as he went about the duties of the day. Next, he offered a bull calf as a sin offering for the priests and himself. That done, he entered the Holy of Holies with a censer of live coals from the altar of incense, filling the area with incense. He sprinkled the bullock’s blood on the mercy seat and on the floor before the ark of the covenant. Then he cast lots over two live goats brought by the people. He killed one of the goats as a sin offering for the nation, taking the blood inside the veil and sprinkling it as before, thus atoning even for the Holy Place. He confessed the sins of the nation over the live goat as he placed his hands on its head. Finally he sent the live goat, called the scapegoat (i.e., the escape goat), into the wilderness. Symbolically it carried away the sins of the people. Then the high priest clothed himself in his usual apparel and offered a burnt offering for himself and one for the people with the fat of the sin offering. Outside the camp the flesh of the bull calf and goat was burned.</p>
<p>Other OT references to the Day of Atonement include <a href="?bref=Exod.30.10">Exodus 30:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.26-32">Leviticus 23:26-32</a>, giving the date in a list of all the annual feasts; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.9-16">Leviticus 25:9-16</a>, stating that each jubilee year began on the Day of Atonement; and <a href="?bref=Num.29.7-11">Numbers 29:7-11</a>.</p>
<p>The Day of Atonement became so central to Judaism that it survived the destruction of the temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 and the end of the sacrificial system. It is the highest holy day of Judaism today. Although nowhere in the books of Moses is there an explanation of “afflicting the soul” required on the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.27-32">Lv 23:27-32</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), the Jews have continuously interpreted it as referring to fasting (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.35.13">Ps 35:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.3-5,10">Is 58:3-5, 10</a>). In biblical times, celebration of the Day of Atonement showed that Israel believed the cleansing of their sins was accomplished by the rites commanded by God. The forgiveness and grace of God were granted them and were the basis for their continued fellowship with God as his covenant people. Because it was designated as a sabbath of solemn rest (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.31">Lv 16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.32">23:32</a>), all work was forbidden on that day as on the weekly observance of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>As with all the prescribed sacrifices throughout the year, the question arises as to the need for a special time for atonement. It is clear that the ritual was meant to avert God’s wrath for sins already committed as well as to guarantee the continued presence of God. The sacrifice of the first goat and the sending away of the scapegoat were intended to cleanse the nation, the priesthood, and the sanctuary from sin. The intent of the whole sacrificial system reached its highest expression on that day, called by some the “Good Friday of the OT.” The daily, weekly, and monthly sacrifices left something undone, so that the high priest could not enter the holiest place throughout the year. On that one day, however, he was permitted to enter with sacrificial blood as he solemnly represented the nation before the bloodstained mercy seat.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheDayOfAtonementAndTheNewTestament"/>
<p>The underlying reason for the day was that other offerings for sin could not provide for unknown (“secret”) sins. Because of such sins the sanctuary, the land, and the nation remained ritually unclean. The Day of Atonement was instituted by God for the complete atonement of all sin (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.33">Lv 16:33</a>). In the person of the high priest the nation was most fully represented by the access of their mediator into the very presence of God. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Atonement_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Atonement</a>; <a href="?item=OfferingsandSacrifices_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Offerings and Sacrifices</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">AVENGER OF BLOOD</p>
<p class="fl">Person who performed the duty of pursuing and ultimately executing the murderer of a close relative (<a href="?bref=Num.35.1-34">Nm 35</a>). Such a “redeemer” was expected to act in instances of deliberate murder but not of accidental manslaughter. A person guilty of manslaughter could find asylum in any one of six designated cities throughout the land (<a href="?bref=Num.35.11">35:11</a>) so that regular judicial processes could be set in motion. The avenger of blood can be seen in the accounts of Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.18-21">Jgs 8:18-21</a>), Joab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.27,30">2 Sm 3:27, 30</a>), the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-22">2 Sm 21</a>), and Amaziah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.5-6">2 Kgs 14:5-6</a>). During the monarchy the king could evidently thwart the avenger (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.8-11">2 Sm 14:8-11</a>).</p>
<p>The custom was rooted in the ordinance of God that required a life for a life in any case of intentional homicide (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.6">Gn 9:6</a>). Unfortunately, the intent of the law—to impress upon humanity the sacredness of human life—has sometimes been greatly distorted, leading to blood feuds and the annihilation of whole families in some societies.</p>

He is identical with the Azariah of <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.3">Ezra 7:3</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.2">2 Esdras 1:2</a>, whose father (meaning “ancestor”) was Meraioth. The parenthetical note about Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.10">1 Chr 6:10</a>) is generally held to go with the Azariah of verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.9">9</a> (see #6 above). It is possible, however, that this Azariah served in the temple (built by Solomon) during the reign of Uzziah and is therefore identical with #17 below.</p>

<p class="list"> 9. Zephaniah’s son, an ancestor of the singer Heman. Heman sang in the worship ritual instituted by King David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.36">1 Chr 6:36</a>).</p>
<p class="list">10. Hilkiah’s son or descendant, one of the first priests to settle in Jerusalem after the exile (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.11">1 Chr 9:11</a>; “Seraiah,” <a href="?bref=Neh.11.11">Neh 11:11</a>).</p>

<p class="list">12, 13. Two sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. Along with four of their brothers, they were killed for political reasons by Jehoram, heir to the throne (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.1-4">2 Chr 21:1-4</a>).</p>

<p class="list">16. Obed’s son, another of the five commanders in league with Jehoiada against Athaliah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.23.1">2 Chr 23:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list">17. High priest in Jerusalem during the reign of King Uzziah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.16-21">2 Chr 26:16-21</a>). He opposed Uzziah’s arrogant attempt to burn incense on the altar. Perhaps the same as #7 above.</p>
<p class="list">18. Johanan’s son, a leader of Ephraim’s tribe. Azariah and other leaders of the tribe joined the prophet Obed in protesting the capture of Judean prisoners by King Pekah of Israel and in effecting their release (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.12">2 Chr 28:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">19. Descendant of Kohath and the father of a Levite named Joel. Joel participated in the temple cleansing instituted by King Hezekiah of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12">2 Chr 29:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">20. Jehallelel’s son. This Azariah, a descendant of Merari, also participated in Hezekiah’s cleansing of the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12">2 Chr 29:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">21. Zadok’s descendant and high priest during the reign of Hezekiah of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.10,13">2 Chr 31:10, 13</a>). He participated in Hezekiah’s massive religious reforms.</p>

  <title>Azazel*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">AZAZEL*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew term of uncertain origin and meaning, occurring in <a href="?bref=Lev.16.8,10,26">Leviticus 16:8, 10, 26</a>. Since biblical or extrabiblical information is lacking, the meaning of Azazel has been interpreted in at least four ways:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Scapegoat. Some have thought the word refers to the scapegoat used in the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement. That interpretation is unlikely because verses 10 and 26 state that the goat was sent <span class="ital">for</span> and <span class="ital">to</span> Azazel (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Place to which the goat was sent. This is the view of many Jewish scholars, who attempt to support it by connecting the word “Azazel” with a high and rugged cliff from which the goat was thrown. Others regard the word as meaning “desert places.”</p>
<p class="list">3. Abstract “place” or state of being. Some believe Azazel comes from a Hebrew word meaning “depart” or “remove,” and thus interpret it as “utter removal,” “complete sending away,” or “solitude.” That the goat “may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel” (v <a href="?bref=Lev.16.10">10</a>) may be interpreted as “sent into a realm of being (or nonbeing) that is utterly removed.” This possibility strengthens the idea of removal of sins: they become “nothing,” since they are totally removed. Sending the goat away would then be a symbolic and ritual act through which God annihilates or removes one’s past sins.</p>
<p class="list">4. Personal name of a being, most likely a demon, to which the scapegoat was sent. Many modern scholars adopt this interpretation. Some support is found in the noncanonical book of Enoch, where Azazel appears as a ringleader of fallen angels who mislead mankind. Such a being would be an evil spirit to whom the sins of the people belong. Thus one goat is given to the Lord, the other to an evil being. Some have conjectured that that being was Satan himself.</p>
