<p class="h1">HABAKKUK (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Author of the eighth book of the Minor Prophets. The meaning of Habakkuk’s name is uncertain. It was probably derived from a Hebrew word meaning “to embrace.”</p>
<p>Nothing is known about Habakkuk apart from what can be inferred from his book. Several legends purporting to give accounts of his life are generally regarded as untrustworthy. The apocryphal book Bel and the Dragon describes a miraculous transporting of Habakkuk to Daniel while Daniel was in the den of lions. A Jewish legend makes Habakkuk the son of the Shunammite woman mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.8-37">2 Kings 4:8-37</a>. That legend apparently is based on the tradition that she would “embrace” a son. Chronological difficulties make both accounts unlikely.</p>
<p>Habakkuk lived in the period during the rise of the Chaldeans (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.6">Hb 1:6</a>), that is, during the reigns of the Judean kings Josiah and Jehoiakim. The dates 612–589 <span class="era">BC</span> delineate the probable period of his prophetic activity.</p>
<p>The book of Habakkuk reveals a man of great sensitivity. His deep concern about injustice and his prayer (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.1-19">Hb 3</a>) show that Habakkuk was characterized by profound religious conviction and social awareness.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Little is known about the prophet Habakkuk apart from information that may be gained from the book of Habakkuk itself. In <a href="?bref=Hab.1.1">1:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Hab.3.1">3:1</a> he is called a prophet, a spokesman for God to his fellow Israelites.</p>
<p>The prayer of chapter <a href="?bref=Hab.3.1-19">3</a> contains several musical designations (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.1,3,9,13,19">Hb 3:1, 3, 9, 13, 19</a>). Such technical notations suggest that the author had some responsibility for the temple music. If that is so, he may have been a member of one of the Levitical families. The apocryphal book Bel and the Dragon contains a reference to Habakkuk as “the son of Jesus of the tribe of Levi,” possibly reflecting such a tradition.</p>
<p>The book portrays Habakkuk as a man of deep moral sensitivity who rebelled at the injustice that characterized the society of his day.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Although it is difficult to date the prophecy of Habakkuk precisely, several clues to its date appear in the text. In <a href="?bref=Hab.1.5-6">1:5-6</a> the prophet refers to the Chaldeans whom God is “rousing.” The Chaldeans were originally a group of loosely organized tribes who occupied a large portion of the Assyrian Empire. They were a constant source of trouble to their Assyrian lords. Eventually, the Chaldeans successfully rebelled against the Assyrian power, placing Nabopolassar on the throne (625–605 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Chaldeans then ruled all of Babylonia, establishing the Babylonian Empire and inaugurating a period of extensive expansion. Because the Chaldeans came to power about 625 <span class="era">BC</span>, many scholars think that the prophecy of Habakkuk was written shortly before that time. The book would have been written, then, within the reign of Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>). <a href="?bref=Hab.1.6">Habakkuk 1:6</a> does not necessarily refer to the initial rise of the Chaldeans. Their reputation was already established as warlike and cruel, for the prophet described them as cruel and violent; they are said to march across the world and conquer it (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.6-8">1:6-8</a>). Their reputation for military prowess seems to fit best with a time after the battle of Carchemish (605 <span class="era">BC</span>), when Nebuchadnezzar II defeated the Egyptians and established the Babylonians as an important world power, but it is also possible that their reputation was gained from the Babylonian conquest of Nineveh in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The social conditions in Habakkuk’s day seem to fit with a time toward the end of the reign of Judah’s King Josiah. Although Josiah’s reign was characterized by far-reaching religious reforms, initiated by the discovery of the Book of the Law during renovations in the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.8">2 Kgs 22:8</a>), Habakkuk describes society as filled with “destruction and violence” (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.3">Hb 1:3</a>). An unfair judicial system led to oppression of the righteous (v <a href="?bref=Hab.1.4">4</a>). Because it is also possible that he was referring to the world at large, it seems best to date Habakkuk’s ministry as starting between 612 and 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, and continuing during the reign of Jehoiakim (609–598 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The historical period inaugurated by King Josiah’s death was one of the most bitter in the history of the kingdom of Judah. In 612 <span class="era">BC</span> the Babylonians destroyed the Assyrian city of Nineveh, and in two years they eliminated the last vestiges of formal Assyrian rule in Mesopotamia. The Egyptians, who had been allies of the Assyrians, sought to solidify their hold on the western portion of the former Assyrian Empire. They marched to Carchemish, an important city on the Euphrates River, where they were opposed by Josiah, who died in the battle there.</p>
<p>The Egyptians placed Jehoiakim on the throne in place of Jehoahaz, the rightful successor of Josiah. Jehoiakim was an Egyptian vassal, and the land of Judah was forced to pay heavy tribute. The faith of many people might understandably have begun to falter in that time. The religious reforms under Josiah had resulted not in national blessing but in the loss of their freedom. The tenor of society had changed from one of relative stability to one of oppression and violence (see <a href="?bref=Jer.22.17">Jer 22:17</a>).</p>
<p>In 604 <span class="era">BC</span> the Babylonians advanced into the Syro-Palestinian area, encountering only weak resistance. At that time Jehoiakim transferred his allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar, who continued his advance to the south. When Pharaoh Neco’s army challenged the invaders, both sides suffered heavy losses and Nebuchadnezzar retreated to Babylon. The vacillating Jehoiakim then transferred his loyalty to Egypt. In 598 <span class="era">BC</span> the Babylonians again advanced into Syro-Palestine, beginning a campaign that led to the fall of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The main purpose of Habakkuk’s prophecy is to explain what a godly person’s attitude should be toward the presence of evil in the world. It also addresses the nature of God’s justice in punishing moral evil.</p>
<p>The teaching of the book is set forth in an interesting pattern of crucial questions by the prophet about God’s activity in history. His questions may reflect deep doubts and concerns, or they may be a literary device for reflecting the questions that people in his society were asking. In the psalm at the end of the book, the prophet shows that he has reached an understanding of God’s purposes, and he rests in utter submission to God. One of the prophet’s chief problems was the seeming inactivity of God, as evil continued unpunished. God’s answer was that he does punish evil in his own time and with his chosen instruments. The world is not an arena in which evil continually triumphs. History testifies to the fall of tyrants and wicked nations. The godly person thus interprets history in terms of faith—trusting God and affirming God’s righteous rule in the world.</p>
<p>The book of Habakkuk does not explain why God has allowed evil in the world. It does affirm that a righteous person will see God’s activity in history through the eyes of faith. Chapter <a href="?bref=Hab.3.1-19">3</a> eloquently expresses that theme as Habakkuk looks at history and recounts God’s gracious activity on behalf of his people.</p>
<p>One of the most important theological concepts in the book is that of God’s sovereign activity in history. Habakkuk affirms God’s control of all history and demonstrates that even the godless nations are subject to his control. Their rise and fall is determined not by the fortuitous course of events but by God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The First Complaint and Its Response (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.1-11">1:1-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophecy of Habakkuk begins with a series of questions reflecting the prophet’s deep feelings over the wrongs rampant in his society. He begins by asking how long he will have to cry to God, who does not seem to hear. Many have asked that question as they see evil present in a world governed by the sovereign God.</p>
<p>The answer that the prophet received was unusual. The Lord was surely doing something about the evil in his society; he was raising up the Chaldeans as an instrument of his wrath to punish the people of Judah.</p>
<p>The description of the Chaldeans in <a href="?bref=Hab.1.6-11">1:6-11</a> is filled with bold metaphors that depict them as an awesome force pillaging as they advance in their conquests. One might well wonder, as the prophet did, why God would use such a tool to accomplish his purposes.</p>
<p>The prophet’s first complaint reflects a number of perplexing problems. Why does God not do something about evil? Why does he allow it to continue? God does not always seems to respond when people want him to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when God did answer, he said he would punish the evil in Judah by using the Babylonians. The prophet’s prayer was answered, but in a way he did not expect. God would use a hated and wicked nation to punish the wrongs of his own people. Habakkuk must have been perplexed at this, but he could take comfort in one fact: God was still in control of history (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.5-6">Hb 1:5-6</a>). God governed the rise and fall of nations, using even wicked ones to accomplish his will.</p>
<p class="h3">The Second Complaint and Its Response (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.12-2.5">1:12–2:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The answer to the first complaint was not enough for Habakkuk. He acknowledged that God had “decreed the rise of these Babylonians to punish and correct us for our terrible sins” (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.12">1:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). But he goes on to say, “You are perfectly just in this. But will you, who cannot allow sin in any form, stand idly by while they swallow us up? Should you be silent while the wicked destroy people who are more righteous than they?” (v <a href="?bref=Hab.1.13">13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). He implies that God observes the wicked Chaldeans but does not punish them for their wrongs. Habakkuk still cannot understand how God can use a wicked nation to punish his own people.</p>
<p>But Habakkuk did learn something from God’s first response. He began his second complaint with the affirmation “O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God, my Holy One, you who are eternal—is your plan in all of this to wipe us out? Surely not!” (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.12">1:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The prophet probably had in mind the previous verse, which declared that the god of the Chaldeans was their own military might. In contrast, Judah’s God is eternal and not transitory like the fleeting strength of armies and nations.</p>
<p>Habakkuk’s problem was still not resolved, for he next described the rapacious nature of the Chaldeans, wondering how God could use them to punish Judah. The Chaldeans were like fishermen, catching people in their nets and then worshiping their nets (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.15-16">1:15-16</a>). Habakkuk asked God if the Chaldeans would continue emptying their nets and slaying the nations (v <a href="?bref=Hab.1.17">17</a>).</p>
<p>Having posed his questions, the prophet waited to see what God’s response would be (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.1">2:1</a>). The Lord replied that his answer should be written in large, clear letters, for it was certain (v <a href="?bref=Hab.2.2">2</a>), but it would not be fulfilled immediately (v <a href="?bref=Hab.2.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>What follows is one of the greatest verses about faith in the whole OT (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">2:4</a>). The words “the righteous will live by their faith” became the touchstone of Paul’s message and of the Protestant Reformation. The apostle Paul appealed to <a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Habakkuk 2:4</a> in his exposition of the doctrine of justification by faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.11">Gal 3:11</a>). This passage was also important in the NT book of Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.38-39">Heb 10:38-39</a>).</p>
<p>The word “faith” in the OT basically means “firmness” or “strength.” The root of the word is used to describe the supporting posts of a door (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.16">2 Kgs 18:16</a>) and firm support for a peg (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.23">Is 22:23</a>). When used of God, the word has the sense of faithfulness or of unwavering commitment to his promises. Referring specifically to human faith, it means unwavering trust in the God who promised. Faith in the OT is not an abstract concept but rather is commitment to God. It is not characterized by works but by an attitude of wholehearted trust in God.</p>
<p>God affirms in <a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Habakkuk 2:4</a> that a truly righteous person will live by unwavering trust in God, trust that remains firm in spite of trials. Jesus taught the same thing in the parable of the sower (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.21">Mt 13:21</a>), and it is also expressed in <a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">James 1:12</a>.</p>
<p>God’s answer to Habakkuk’s complaint was that he does punish evil, but in his time and his way. A truly righteous person will not lose faith because evil is not immediately eliminated or the wicked quickly punished. Faith trusts in the sovereignty of God’s righteous rule in this world.</p>
<p class="h3">A Taunt-Song Celebrating the Fall of the Chaldeans (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.6-20">2:6-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After hinting at the fall of the Chaldeans, the prophet composes a taunt-song in which he depicts the gloomy future of that nation. When the Babylonian Empire fell to a coalition of Medes and Persians, the prophetic elements in Habakkuk’s poem became historical reality.</p>
<p>The prophet affirms that Babylon’s “debtors” will arise against her (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.7">Hb 2:7</a>). This expression implies that some nations would suddenly arise to bring about Babylon’s downfall.</p>
<p>The reason for the destruction of Babylon is cited in <a href="?bref=Hab.2.8">2:8</a>: “You have plundered many nations; now they will plunder you” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The OT principle of retributive justice teaches that God’s moral law extends not only to believers but to unbelievers as well.</p>
<p>The great building efforts of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar seem to be implied in <a href="?bref=Hab.2.9-11">2:9-11</a>. The prophet says that even the stones and beams of his cities will cry out, as though protesting the fact that the city was built with blood (vv <a href="?bref=Hab.2.11-12">11-12</a>).</p>
<p>Habakkuk condemns the Chaldeans, not only for their inhuman cruelty, but also for the shameful way in which they treated their captive peoples. The prophet pictures this degrading treatment in a vivid metaphor, saying it is like making others drunk in order to gaze on their shame (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.15">2:15</a>).</p>
<p>Habakkuk concludes his taunt-song with a denunciation of Chaldean idolatry, pointing out the folly of those who make gods from wood and stone (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.18-19">2:18-19</a>). The Chaldeans, like other pagan peoples, attributed their success to their idols. The prophet implies that because such trust is groundless—their idols are powerless to help them—Babylon will fall.</p>
<p>Habakkuk goes on to make a striking contrast between the Lord and the idols created by people: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is in his holy Temple. Let all the earth be silent before him” (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.20">2:20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). God is real and he is sovereign. The prophet’s word is that the earth should wait in hushed silence for the judgment that will surely come.</p>
<p class="h3">The Prayer of Habakkuk (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.1-19">3:1-19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophecy of Habakkuk closes with a prayer, reminiscent of some of the OT psalms. It contains a superscription (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.1">3:1</a>) and several musical notations.</p>
<p>Some have argued that this chapter is not originally Habakkuk’s, because it does not fit the narrative flow of the book. They regard the chapter as originating in the postexilic period.</p>
<p>However, the psalm could have been written by the prophet and added to his prophetic oracles, either by himself or by a secretary. The musical notations do not necessarily point to a later period, because many psalms have such musical directions, and their preexilic date has been substantiated by linguistic and historical studies.</p>
<p>The prayer is similar to the message of Habakkuk. In it he affirms that God will judge his enemies (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.16">3:16</a>), and he praises God’s sovereignty (v <a href="?bref=Hab.3.3">3</a>). Both themes are prominent in the prophetic oracles of chapters <a href="?bref=Hab.1.1-17">1</a> and <a href="?bref=Hab.2.1-20">2</a>.</p>
<p>The prayer is filled with assurances of God’s power and justice. It forms a fitting conclusion to the body of the book, in which the prophet questioned divine providence. It demonstrates that the prophet had come to a place of unshakeable faith as he observed God’s activity in history.</p>

<p class="h1">HADES*</p>
<p class="fl">Abode of the dead. In Greek mythology Hades was originally the god of the underworld (also named Pluto), a brother of Zeus. He was the abductor of Persephone and thus the cause of winter. His realm, which was called by his name (and also called Tartarus), was the dark land where the dead existed. Odysseus entered that realm and fed the ghosts with blood to get directions back home (Homer’s <span class="ital">Odyssey</span> 4.834). Originally the Greeks thought of hades as simply the grave—a shadowy, ghostlike existence that happened to all who died, good and evil alike. Gradually they and the Romans came to see it as a place of reward and punishment, an elaborately organized and guarded realm where the good were rewarded in the Elysian Fields and the evil were punished (so described by the Roman poet Virgil, 70–19 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>“Hades” became important to the Jews as the typical term used by the translators of the Septuagint to render the Hebrew name “Sheol” into Greek. This was a very suitable translation for the Hebrew term, for both words can signify the physical grave or death (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.35">Gn 37:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.5.5">Prv 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.7.27">7:27</a>), and both originally referred to a dark underworld (<a href="?bref=Job.10.21-22">Jb 10:21-22</a>) where existence was at best shadowy (<a href="?bref=Job.38.17">Jb 38:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.9">Is 14:9</a>). Sheol is described as under the ocean (<a href="?bref=Job.26.5-6">Jb 26:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.2.2-3">Jon 2:2-3</a>) and as having bars and gates (<a href="?bref=Job.17.16">Jb 17:16</a>). All people go there whether they are good or evil (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.48">Ps 89:48</a>). In the earlier literature there is no hope of release from Sheol/hades. C. S. Lewis describes this concept well in <span class="ital">The Silver Chair:</span> “Many sink down, and few return to the sunlit lands.” Of course, all these descriptions are in poetic literature; how literally the Hebrews (or the Greeks, for that matter) took their descriptions of hades/Sheol is hard to say. They may have simply used the older picture-language of Greek poetry to describe that for which prose words were inadequate.</p>
<p>Jew and Greek alike came in contact with Persia—the Jews at the time the postexilic writers were composing their books (e.g., Malachi, Daniel, and some psalms), and the Greeks somewhat later (they fought the Persians 520–479 <span class="era">BC</span> and conquered them 334–330 <span class="era">BC</span>). Whether because of Persian influence on these groups or not, during this period, the idea of reward and punishment after death developed, and Sheol/hades changed from a shadow land to a differentiated place of reward and punishment for both Greeks (and Romans) and Jews. Josephus records that the Pharisees believed in reward and punishment at death (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.3), and a similar idea appears in 1 Enoch 22. In these and many other cases in Jewish literature, hades stands for the one place of the dead, which has two or more compartments. In other Jewish literature, hades is the place of torment for the wicked, while the righteous enter paradise (Pss of Sol 14; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.2.1">Wisd of Sol 2:1</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.3.1">3:1</a>). Thus, by the beginning of the NT period, hades has three meanings: (1) death, (2) the place of all the dead, and (3) the place of the wicked dead only. Context determines which meaning an author intends in a given passage.</p>
<p>All these meanings appear in the NT. In <a href="?bref=Matt.11.23">Matthew 11:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.10.15">Luke 10:15</a>, Jesus speaks of Capernaum’s descending to hades (<span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). Most likely he simply means that the city will “die” or be destroyed. “Hades” means “death” in this context, as “heaven” means “exaltation.” <a href="?bref=Rev.6.8">Revelation 6:8</a> also exemplifies this: Death comes on a horse, and hades (a symbol of death) comes close behind. This personification of hades probably comes from the OT, where hades/Sheol is viewed as a monster that devours people (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.12">Prv 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.20">27:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.16">30:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.14">Is 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.15,18">28:15, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.2.5">Hb 2:5</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matthew 16:18</a> is a more difficult use of hades. The church will be built upon a rock and the gates of hades will not prevail against it. Here the place of the dead (complete with gates and bars) is a symbol for death: Christians may in fact be killed, but death (the gates of hades) will no more hold them than it held Christ. He who burst out of hades will bring his people out as well. This is also the meaning of <a href="?bref=Acts.2.27">Acts 2:27</a> (quoting <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Ps 16:10</a>): Christ did not stay dead; his life did not remain in hades; unlike David, he rose from the dead. It is uncertain in either of these cases whether hades is simply a symbol for death or whether it means that Christ and the Christian actually went to a place of the dead called hades; probably the former is intended. Whatever the case, since Christ did rise, he has conquered death and hades. He appears in <a href="?bref=Rev.1.18">Revelation 1:18</a> as the one holding the keys (the control) to both.</p>
<p>Two NT passages refer to hades as the place where the dead exist: <a href="?bref=Rev.20.13-14">Revelation 20:13-14</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.16.23">Luke 16:23</a>. In <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a> hades is emptied of all who are in it (either all dead or the wicked dead, depending on one’s eschatology)—the resurrection is complete. When the wicked are judged and cast into the lake of fire (Gehenna), hades is also thrown in. <a href="?bref=Luke.16.23">Luke 16:23</a>, however, clearly refers to hades as the place of the wicked dead. There the rich man is tormented in a flame, while the poor man, Lazarus, goes to paradise (Abraham’s bosom).</p>
<p>Hades, then, means three things in the NT, as it did in Jewish literature: (1) Death and its power is the most frequent meaning, especially in metaphorical uses. (2) It also means the place of the dead in general, when a writer wants to lump all the dead together. (3) It means, finally, the place where the wicked dead are tormented before the final judgment. This is its narrowest meaning, occurring only once in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.23">Lk 16:23</a>). The Bible does not dwell on this torment—Dante’s picture in <span class="ital">The Inferno</span> draws on later speculation and Greco-Roman conceptions of hades more than on the Bible.</p>

<p class="h1">HAGAR</p>
<p class="fl">Egyptian handmaid of Sarai, the wife of Abram. At Sarai’s insistence, Abram took Hagar as his concubine, and she became the mother of his son Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">Gn 16:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.9-21">21:9-21</a>).</p>
<p>When God commanded Abram to leave Mesopotamia, he promised to make a great nation of him and to give the new land to his seed (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2,7">Gn 12:2, 7</a>). After ten years in Canaan and still childless, Sarai suggested to Abram that he take Hagar as his concubine and have children by her. It was the custom in northeast Mesopotamia that, when a wife failed to produce an heir for her husband, she could give him a slave for that purpose. Any son born of the union of husband and concubine was considered the child of the wife (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-6">30:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>During her pregnancy, Hagar became disrespectful to Sarai. Sarai dealt so harshly with Hagar that she fled to the desert. An angel of God appeared to her at a well in the desert and told her to return to Abram’s house, promising that she would have a son, Ishmael (“God hears”), who would be a wild and quarrelsome man. Hagar then named the place Beer-lahairoi, meaning “the well of one who sees and lives.”</p>
<p>Ishmael was born when Abram was 86 years old, and 14 years later God gave Abraham and Sarah the promised son, Isaac. At the time of Isaac’s weaning (at approximately three years of age), a feast was held. At the weaning feast Ishmael mocked Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.9">Gn 21:9</a>), and Sarah in anger asked Abraham to send Hagar and Ishmael away. Abraham hesitated until God spoke to him and told him to do so (v <a href="?bref=Gen.21.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>Hagar and Ishmael left to wander in the wilderness of Beersheba. When their water was exhausted, God miraculously rescued Hagar and Ishmael from death and assured Hagar that Ishmael would be the father of a great nation (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.17-19">Gn 21:17-19</a>). Ishmael lived in the wilderness of Paran, became a hunter, married an Egyptian, and became the father of the Ishmaelites.</p>
<p>In an allegory developed by Paul (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.22-31">Gal 4:22-31</a>), Hagar represents the old covenant of Sinai. As Ishmael was Abraham’s son by human arrangement, the Judaizing Christians who would bind all Christians to the law of Moses are like Hagar’s children born in slavery. Sarah, the freewoman, represents the new covenant of Christ. As Isaac was Abraham’s son by faith in the divine promise, Christians who are free of the fleshly ordinances of the law are spiritual children of Sarah. The contrast is between salvation by works, which is bondage to the law, and salvation by grace and faith, which is freedom.</p>

<p class="fl">Method of Jewish interpretation that is homiletical in character. Haggadah is usually defined negatively, that is, as that part of rabbinic teaching that is <span class="ital">not</span> Halakah. Haggadah and Halakah complement each other; the latter is interpretation that gives the rule, statute, or religious law Jews are to follow, while Haggadah aims at edification, inspiration, inner piety, and religious devotion, covering the entire field of religion and ethics. Halakah states the fact; Haggadah stirs one to action. “Halakah” means literally “walking,” thus showing the devout Jew how to walk in the way of the Lord. “Haggadah” means literally “narrative” or “storytelling,” which includes proverbs, parables, and sermons. Within these artistic forms of instruction are contained moral and ethical principles intended to show one how to live correctly. Among the two types of interpretation, Haggadah is the more “popular,” having a wider appeal. Its way of storytelling is designed to touch the human heart “so that one should recognize him who created the world, and so cling to his ways” (Sifrei-Deuteronomy 49). As one Jewish scholar has said, its purpose is “to bring Heaven down to earth and to elevate man to Heaven.” Because Haggadah is not Halakah, but rather interpretation, it also contains other material, such as metaphysical speculations, historical and legendary tales of Israel’s past, visions of its future, and remarks on scientific subjects, such as astronomy and medicine.</p>

<p class="fl">Haggai was among the Jewish colonists at Jerusalem in the year 520 <span class="era">BC</span> when his prophetic words were recorded (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-2">Ezr 5:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.14">6:14</a>). The four messages the Lord gave to Haggai were to be directed to specific individuals. The first was to Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>). The second was to Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the remnant of the people (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.2">2:2</a>). The third was a word to the priests (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.11">11</a>). The final message was limited to Zerubbabel (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.21">21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The key phrase of Haggai’s prophecies is “Consider your ways” or “Consider” (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.5,7">1:5, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.15,18">2:15, 18</a>). The purpose of God’s messages to the Judean leadership and people, therefore, was to awaken them to their spiritual responsibilities. Two different classes of Judeans had to be turned from their indifference. The true believers needed to be reminded that God was merciful. The situation could be remedied, even though they thought the sins committed by their fathers were unforgivable. The hypocrites among the Judeans had only sought the promised blessings. They had only exchanged one form of idolatry for another. When the blessings did not materialize, they were disappointed.</p>
<p>The unifying message was that today gives no key to what God will do tomorrow. God’s fulfillment of his promises cannot be judged by appearances. Haggai’s message was twofold: reproof and encouragement. The colonists needed to be chastised for their indifference and consoled in the midst of their troubles.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Teaching">Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Haggai is a practical book, dealing with the believer’s service to God. Procrastination and indifference have been debilitating sins among God’s people throughout all ages. Concern and a sense of urgency are always pleasing to God (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.11-14">Rom 13:11-14</a>).</p>
<p>The presence of God is the primary motivation for boldness and the means of banishing discouragement (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19-20">Mt 28:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.8-21">Eph 3:8-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.5-6">Heb 13:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>Separation from contaminating influences and sin is demanded of all believers (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-7.1">2 Cor 6:14–7:1</a>). Without this quality of life, the believer cannot expect to be found fit for God’s service (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.19-26">2 Tm 2:19-26</a>). The disobedient child of God can expect removal of blessing and chastisement from God (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.3-13">Heb 12:3-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.1-3">Jas 4:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>The message concerning God’s judgment of sin and the establishment of the messianic kingdom is a message of hope to the NT believer as well as the Jews of Haggai’s day (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.4-13">Rom 15:4-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10-18">2 Pt 3:10-18</a>).</p>
<p>The key phrase of Haggai (“consider your ways”) has echoes in <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.5">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>, as do his writings about the effects of sin and the blessings of God (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.1-25">Jude 1:1-25</a>).</p>
<p>The God of Haggai is given the title “Lord of hosts” (“<span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Almighty”) 14 times in the book. This title is characteristic of the postexilic prophetic books, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, where it is found more than 80 times. It teaches that God is all-powerful and is Master of all spirit beings in heaven and all created beings on the earth.</p>
<p>Haggai also testifies to the God-breathed quality of the Word of God and its divine authority. Over and over the prophet announces ways that God has spoken to him and is the author of these messages (at least 25 times in the space of 28 verses).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">First Message</p>
<p class="fl">The first message Haggai was to deliver to the Judeans was given to him “on the first day of the month” (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>). Upon the first day of each month, the Jews were to bring special offerings to the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Num.28.11-15">Nm 28:11-15</a>). God chose this special time to reveal the sin of the people with regard to the unfinished sanctuary.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Judeans were singled out for the first message from the Lord (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>). Zerubbabel was the civil leader or governor, and Joshua was the spiritual leader or high priest. Together, they were responsible for the activity (or inactivity) of God’s people.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord revealed the procrastination of the people (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.2">1:2</a>). God’s temple had not been completed because his people had determined for themselves that “the time is not come.” The energies and finances of God’s people had been channeled selfishly into their own homes (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.4">4</a>).</p>
<p>“Now” (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.5">1:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) focused the attention of the Jews upon the present requirement of God in the light of their sinful indifference. They were to give attention to their own condition spiritually and materially: “Consider how you have fared.” This key phrase of Haggai’s prophecies is literally “Set your heart on your ways” or “Lay your ways to your heart.” Self-examination would reveal that their procrastination had robbed them of more than just 16 years.</p>
<p>Verse <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.6">6</a> reveals the poverty in which the Jews were living as a result of God’s chastisement for their sin. The blessings of God had been withdrawn in accord with his covenant (see <a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-29.1">Dt 28:15–29:1</a>).</p>
<p>Following another exhortation to “consider” their ways (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.7">Hg 1:7</a>), the Lord revealed the remedy for the Jews’ cursed condition: “rebuild my house” (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.8">8</a>). The disobedience with regard to the completion of the temple was the reason for their poverty (vv <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.9-11">9-11</a>).</p>
<p>The response of the leaders and the people was encouraging. The resumption of the construction of the temple was a definite manifestation of belief in the word of God (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.12">1:12</a>). Immediate obedience also testified to the acceptance of the ministry of Haggai, who was “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s messenger” delivering “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s message” (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.13">13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Second Message</p>
<p class="fl">Approximately one month later Haggai was summoned again by the Lord (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.1">2:1</a>). The second message continued the note of encouragement with which the first message closed. Perhaps the builders had begun to feel the pressures of their service. Perhaps the old doubts and discouragements had plagued their faith again. The adversaries had reappeared to hinder them (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.3-6.12">Ezr 5:3–6:12</a>). Haggai’s second message was similar to Ezra’s claim that “the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.5">Ezr 5:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Lord not only sees his servants’ needs but also sends relief and encouragement.</p>
<p>The day of this second message was the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.33-43">Lv 23:33-43</a>). Perhaps this reminder of God’s glorious presence with their ancestors in the wilderness made their present situation all the more discouraging. Therefore, the Lord spoke to all the people rather than just to their leaders (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.2">Hg 2:2</a>). Was there any survivor of the preexilic days who had personally beheld the glory of God as it resided in the Solomonic temple (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1-11">1 Kgs 8:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.9.1-11.23">Ez 9:1–11:23</a>)? Was the present temple “as nothing” in comparison (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.3">Hg 2:3</a>)? The Babylonian Talmud listed five things that were absent in the new temple that had been present in the Solomonic temple: (1) the ark of the covenant, (2) the sacred fire, (3) the shekinah glory, (4) the Holy Spirit, and (5) the Urim and Thummim.</p>
<p>Again, “now” calls attention to God’s remedy. Three times the command “take courage” is proclaimed (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.4">2:4</a>). Each time the command is given, one of the recipients of God’s message is addressed (cf. v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.2">2</a>). The concluding command was “work.” The reason for the strength and the activity was God’s presence. The Holy Spirit might seem to be absent from the temple, but he would remain among the people “according to the word” of God (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.5">5</a>).</p>
<p>To encourage the workers further, God revealed the future glory of his house (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.6-9">2:6-9</a>). That glory would come to pass after a time of judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.6-7">6-7a</a>), when the treasures of all nations come in (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.7">7b</a>). The exact meaning of this verse has been variously interpreted. The views center around two different translations: “the desire of all nations shall come” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) and “and the treasures of all the nations will come to this Temple” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The arguments for the messianic interpretation based on the first translation may be summarized as follows: (1) The vast majority of both Christian and Jewish interpreters took this phrase as a reference to the Messiah. (2) The abstract noun “desire” may have the concrete concept of the one who is desirable. (3) Though the verb in the Hebrew is plural, it is grammatically possible for the agreement of subject and predicate to be based upon the second noun (“nations”) in a genitive relationship. (4) The time element is suitable since God has just judged the nations and the hour of Christ’s coming would be at hand. (5) An alternate translation is available that meets the grammatical difficulties but retains the messianic import: “They [the nations] have come to the desire of all the nations.”</p>
<p>In spite of the weight of the arguments for this first view, it seems better to accept the second translation and corresponding view. The arguments are as follows: (1) The vast majority of early Christian and Jewish interpreters base their view on the Latin Vulgate translation (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 400), while the second translation is in agreement with an older version, the Greek Septuagint (c. 300 <span class="era">BC</span>). (2) The singular “desire” may be taken as a collective noun referring to “features” or “wealth.” (3) The principle of Hebrew grammar that allows the noun “nations” to be the one with which the verb agrees is a rare occurrence in poetic books for such constructions as this. It is unlikely that such phraseology would be used without Haggai’s declaring the exact meaning in the immediate context. (4) The immediate context does solve the difficulty by the plain declaration that the silver and the gold belong to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.8">2:8</a>). (5) The kingdom context of these verses accords well with such parallel passages as <a href="?bref=Isa.60.5,11">Isaiah 60:5, 11</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.21.24">Revelation 21:24</a>.</p>
<p>The conclusion to this message of encouragement is that the future glory of the temple (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.3">Hg 2:3</a>) will be greater than in the days of the Solomonic temple (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.9">9</a>), because the shekinah glory will return (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.7">Hg 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-5">Ez 43:1-5</a>) and the building will have great beauty (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.8">Hg 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13,17">Is 60:13, 17</a>). God will also grant peace (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.9">Hg 2:9</a>) in his kingdom at the time of this future glorious temple (see <a href="?bref=Isa.9.6-7">Is 9:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.12">66:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.13">Zec 6:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Third Message</p>
<p class="fl">About two months later Haggai received a third message from God (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.10">Hg 2:10</a>). This time exhortation would be the theme, and the message was directed to the priests alone (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.11">11</a>). Haggai used questions concerning the law of Moses to instruct the priests in the polluting character of sin. Something clean or holy cannot transfer its sanctity to something else (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.12">12</a>). But that which is unholy <span class="ital">can</span> transfer <span class="ital">its</span> character to something clean, defiling it (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.13">Hg 2:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.22.4-6">Lv 22:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.19.11">Nm 19:11</a>).</p>
<p>The application of this principle to the Judeans was clear: the offerings they brought during their years of disobedience were unacceptable to God because of Judah’s uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.14">Hg 2:14</a>).</p>
<p>By reviving the memory of past disobedience and chastisement, God was exhorting the Jews to constantly “consider” (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.15,18">2:15, 18</a>) the consequences of disobedience. Such consideration should prevent future spiritual indifference. The conclusion of the message was a reminder of the blessing of God upon the obedient (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.19">19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Fourth Message</p>
<p class="fl">On the same day Haggai received another message from God (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.20">2:20</a>). This message was to be directed toward Zerubbabel (v <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.21">21</a>), who was to be encouraged by the permanency of his inherited Davidic office (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.4-17">2 Sm 7:4-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1,5,10,17-20">1 Chr 3:1, 5, 10, 17-20</a>). The gentile nations would be judged and the kingdoms of the world overthrown (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.6-7,21-22">Hg 2:6-7, 21-22</a>). This would be but the preparation for God’s rule (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.11.15-18">Rv 11:15-18</a>).</p>
<p>The promise to Zerubbabel in <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.23">Haggai 2:23</a> was God’s means of confirming that his promises to David were still operative even after the 70-year Babylonian captivity and the 16-year stagnation among the Judeans who had returned to Jerusalem. Zerubbabel was appointed “as a signet ring” by God. A signet was a personal cylinder or ring seal and a sign of the authenticity of their signature. Kings used them for identifying their decrees (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.10">Est 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.8.8-10">8:8-10</a>) and for confirming the authority of their deputies (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">Gn 41:42</a>). God’s appointment of Zerubbabel “as a signet ring,” therefore, meant that Zerubbabel would be God’s seal of authority on the continuation of the Davidic line from which the Messiah should come and reign (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.1.12">Mt 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.27">Lk 3:27</a>).</p>

  <title>Hairstyles and Beards</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HAIRSTYLES AND BEARDS</p>
<p class="fl">In Palestine and throughout the Near East, women’s hairstyles were long. In NT times a woman who cut her hair might be mistaken for a pagan priestess and thus be disgraced (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.15">1 Cor 11:15</a>). The apostle Peter warned Christian women against preoccupation with elaborate styles of hair (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.3">1 Pt 3:3</a>). When a woman married, it was customary to change her hairstyle slightly, in favor of a more mature appearance. Curling tongs and hair oils were used by some married women.</p>
<p>Dark hair is mentioned frequently in the Bible, although gray hair represented maturity and was respected. Some persons preferred to make use of popular black and red hair dyes. According to tradition, Herod the Great dyed his graying hair with henna.</p>
<p>Beard and hair trimming was performed in a specialized manner in Jewish culture. An Israelite man was instructed not to cut the hair on his temples or trim the corners of his beard (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.27">Lv 19:27</a>). This was done to maintain a contrast in every way between the Israelites and the members of idolatrous cults in Canaan and elsewhere (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.29-30">Dt 12:29-30</a>). Beards distinguished Hebrews from Egyptians, who were clean-shaven, although they sometimes wore false beards on ceremonial occasions. Shaving or cutting off the beard of enemy captives was considered the gravest humiliation that the victor could impose. A shaved head, however, was also a recognized symbol of purification at the termination of a vow (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.8-9">Lv 14:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">Acts 18:18</a>). Shaving a beard was the usual sign of mourning (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>). It could also symbolize the approach of doom (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.20">Is 7:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.41.5">Jer 41:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.37">48:37</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">HALAKAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Overall term for Jewish law. Halakah, which means literally “walking,” gives the authoritative Jewish way of life as contained in the Mishnah. It shows Jews how they are to walk (i.e., live life) and what they must do (see <a href="?bref=Exod.18.20">Ex 18:20</a>).</p>
<p>First of all, Halakah rests upon the biblical laws and commandments found in the written Law (the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible) and the oral law (according to Jewish tradition, the unwritten law supposedly given to Moses on Mt Sinai and passed down through generations, finally to be recorded in the Talmud). In the Pentateuch, then, Halakah is given as law; for example, we are told not to work on the Sabbath. But what, in this context, does “work” mean? The written Law gives us no help, but in the Talmud we have Halakah, which is interpretation of the written Law, and in the Talmud we learn what “work” means.</p>
<p>Second, Halakah rests upon all the rabbinic legislation and decisions handed down through the ages by great Jewish scholars. All these things, taken together, provide the basis for making religious-legal decisions in the orthodox Jewish community. All these things, the written and oral law plus the history of Jewish legal scholarship, provide us with Halakah.</p>
<p>Halakah is intended to be all-encompassing, to handle every situation in life. One’s eating habits, sex life, business ethics, social activities, entertainment—these and much more are dealt with by Halakah. For this reason it has been called “the Jewish way”; it is the Jewish legal and practical guide to living.</p>

<p class="fl">An important commercial city of Caria in Asia Minor, beautifully situated on a bay about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the island of Cos. Its excellent natural harbor and the fertile soil in the surrounding area, which produced abundant crops of fruits and nuts, made it a prominent trading center. The tomb of one of the most famous kings of Caria (Mausolus, 377–353 <span class="era">BC</span>) at Halicarnassus was considered one of the wonders of the ancient world. It was also the birthplace of Herodotus and Dionysius. The city was burned by Alexander the Great when he was not able to take the acropolis. From <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.23">1 Maccabees 15:23</a> it appears that it had a substantial Jewish population because a letter written by the Roman Senate asked that no harm should be done to them (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.19">1 Macc 15:19</a>). Josephus notes that the city granted the Jews the right to “celebrate their Sabbaths, and perform their holy offices, according to the Jewish laws; and may make their <span class="greek">proseuchae</span> (places of prayer) at the sea-side, according to the customs of their forefathers” (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.10.23).

<p class="h1">HALLEL*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew term describing a song of praise to God. It was later used in the Talmud and in rabbinical writings to refer to several groups of psalms of praise to God. <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-118.29">Psalms 113–118</a> were known as the Egyptian Hallel, and first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Jewish tradition assigned them to Moses. During the temple period, this Hallel was recited on 18 days in the year, but only once at night, on the Passover. For that occasion it was recited in parts. <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-114.8">Psalms 113–114</a> preceded the meal, prior to drinking the second cup, and <a href="?bref=Ps.115.1-118.29">Psalms 115–118</a> were recited after the last cup was filled. This is probably the song that is meant in the reference to the Last Supper of Jesus and his disciples, when they sang a “hymn” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.30">Mt 26:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.26">Mk 14:26</a>). This Hallel was also used for the feasts of Unleavened Bread, Pentecost, Tabernacles, and Dedication.</p>
<p>The Great Hallel consisted of <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">Psalm 136</a> but sometimes included <a href="?bref=Ps.120.1-136.26">Psalms 120–136</a>. <a href="?bref=Ps.146.1-148.14">Psalms 146–148</a> were also considered a single Hallel.

  <title>Hallelujah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HALLELUJAH</p>
<p class="fl">Important Christian acclamation used extensively in the church’s worship and liturgy from early times. “Hallelujah” is a transliteration into Greek, and thence into English, of two Hebrew words that mean “Praise the Lord.” This combination of the two Hebrew words forms the characteristic call to praise. Jews living in the Dispersion in pre-Christian times were already using the transliteration in their synagogue worship. “Hallelujah,” according to ancient Hebrew tradition, is to be written as one word, except in <a href="?bref=Ps.135.3">Psalm 135:3</a>. It occurs nowhere in the OT but in the Psalter, where it occurs 23 times, and for the first time in <a href="?bref=Ps.104.35">Psalm 104:35</a>. Each of <a href="?bref=Ps.111.1-10">Psalms 111</a> to 113 begins with “Hallelujah”; each of <a href="?bref=Ps.115.1-18">Psalms 115</a> to 117 ends with the word; and each of <a href="?bref=Ps.146.1-10">Psalms 146</a> to 150 begins and ends with it.</p>
<p>In the Septuagint version of <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-118.29">Psalms 113–118</a>, all the individual psalms are headed “Allelujah.” Through the Vulgate, this form of the word “Hallelujah” has come into use in the church. Like another famous Hebrew liturgical term, “Amen,” “Hallelujah” has passed from the OT to the NT, and thence to the Christian church. But in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> and <span class="sc">erv</span> the phrase is rendered “Praise ye the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,” and similarly, in the <span class="sc">rsv</span> and <span class="sc">nlt</span>, it is rendered “Praise the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p>In Hebrew liturgical usage the Hallel, or Hymn of Praise, <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-118.29">Psalms 113–118</a>, is sung at the three great religious festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. At the domestic celebration of Passover, <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-9">Psalms 113</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.114.1-8">114</a> are sung before the meal and <a href="?bref=Ps.115.1-118.29">Psalms 115–118</a> are sung after it. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.30">Matthew 26:30</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.14.26">Mark 14:26</a> refer to the singing of <a href="?bref=Ps.115.1-118.29">115–118</a> as the “hymn” sung by the Lord and his disciples after their celebration of the Passover and before they left the upper room.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="CalligraphyByTimothyRBotts"/>
<p>“Hallelujah” does not appear anywhere in the NT except in <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-6">Revelation 19:1-6</a>. There it is a chant of the saints in heaven. It was taken over into the liturgy and hymnody of the church at an early date. It became the characteristic expression of joy and was therefore sung especially at Eastertide, as is witnessed by Augustine. The choice by the Christian church of <a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-9">Psalms 113</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.114.1-8">114</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.118.1-29">118</a> from the Hebrew Hallel as the psalms to be sung on Easter day marks the liturgical connection of Easter with Passover.</p>

<p class="h1">HAM (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Second son of Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.32">Gn 5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.6.10">6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.7.13">7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.9.18,22">9:18, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1,6,20">10:1, 6, 20</a>). Ham had four sons whose names were Cush, Mizraim (Hebrew for Egypt), Put, and Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.6">Gn 10:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.8">1 Chr 1:8</a>). Ham, then, is seen as the ancestor of the Egyptians (though a mixed race apparently occurs later), as well as of peoples in Africa, Arabia, and Canaan.</p>
<p>After the Flood, Noah began cultivating vineyards, and on one occasion exposed himself while drunk (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.20-24">Gn 9:20-24</a>). Ham saw his father lying naked and related the incident to Shem and Japheth, who covered Noah up discreetly. When Noah awoke and learned what “his youngest son” (seen by some as Ham) had done, he cursed Ham’s son Canaan, saying his brothers (Cush, Mizraim, and Put) and Shem and Japheth would rule over him. But if Ham is the one referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.9.24">9:24</a> as offending Noah, why should the curse fall on his son Canaan? The most likely answer is that Ham is not being referred to in verse <a href="?bref=Gen.9.24">24</a>. The expression is “his youngest son” (the “younger” of the <span class="sc">kjv</span> is hardly possible in Hebrew), whereas Ham is repeatedly seen as the second of the brothers, not the youngest (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.32">5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.6.10">6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.7.13">7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.9.18">9:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1">10:1</a>), the explicit order of the sons indicating age. Instead, “his youngest son” refers to Canaan, and to some base deed not being recorded, on whom the curse falls. “Son” used for “grandson” is common Semitic material, and it seems to have been used here in this way since Canaan is the “youngest” of the (grand)sons. The curse, then, as the text clearly says, is on Canaan rather than Ham. Canaan (and his posterity) is to be subjugated by Japheth and Shem with the Canaanites, finally disappearing by NT times.</p>

<p class="fl">Son of Hammedatha the Agagite, a high official under King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) in Persia during the time of Esther. Haman became angry with Mordecai, the uncle of Esther the queen, because Mordecai would not bow down to him as all others did. In anger he planned to exterminate all the Jews in Persia (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.8">Est 3:8</a>). While he was plotting Mordecai’s hanging, the king was reading about Mordecai’s valuable services. Haman’s plot to kill all Jews was revealed, and he went to the gallows made for Mordecai. Haman’s ten sons were killed shortly after, and their bodies were strung up as well. In the Hebrew Bible the sons’ names are written in a perpendicular manner, supposedly to show their relative positions on the gallows. The carnival atmosphere of the Feast of Purim sometimes resulted in Haman being hanged in effigy, or his name being written on the soles of shoes to express contempt.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">HAMATH</p>
<p class="list">1. City and district located about 125 miles (201 kilometers) north of Damascus (Syria), on the Orontes River. The early residents apparently were of the Hamitic race from the descendants of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.18">Gn 10:18</a>), but later inhabitants were Semitic. It was to be the northern boundary of the nation of Israel, described as the “entrance of Hamath” (<a href="?bref=Num.34.7-8">Nm 34:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.5">Jos 13:5</a>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">Lebo Hamath</span>), but actually it was such only in the early monarchy and under Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>). The location is uncertain but was between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Some scholars have thought of it as an actual place-name, Lebo-hamath, and have identified it with modern Lebweh on the Orontes. Others have located it elsewhere in Syria.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hamath was established during the Neolithic period and destroyed about 1750 <span class="era">BC</span>, perhaps by the Hyksos. It was later rebuilt and conquered by Thutmose III (1502–1448 <span class="era">BC</span>), and while Egypt controlled Syria, Hamath prospered. Several Hittite inscriptions have been discovered that disclose that Hamath had become the capital of a small Hittite kingdom prior to 900 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list-text">When David fought Hadadezer, king of Zobah, and defeated him, then Toi, king of Hamath, sent his son to congratulate David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.9-10">2 Sm 8:9-10</a>). Since Solomon built store-cities in the region of Hamath (<a href="?bref=2Chr.8.4">2 Chr 8:4</a>), it has been suggested that Hamath had become a tributary kingdom to Israel. During the reign of Ahab of Israel, the Assyrian royal inscriptions state that Irhulini, king of Hamath, allied with Damascus, Israel, and the 12 kings of the coast to resist the advances of Shalmaneser III (860–825 <span class="era">BC</span>). The league halted Shalmaneser, although he continued to harass Syria, and about 846 <span class="era">BC</span> he conquered the Syrian league, when Hamath became subject to Assyria. In 730 <span class="era">BC</span> Eni-Ilus, then king of Hamath, paid tribute to Tiglath-pileser III. About 720 <span class="era">BC</span> Sargon II colonized Hamath with 4,300 Assyrians and moved many people from different areas of his kingdom, including Hamath, to Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24">2 Kgs 17:24</a>). Israelites also were apparently colonized in Hamath (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>). Other OT references to the Assyrian conquest of Hamath include <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.34">2 Kings 18:34</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.13">19:13</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.10.9">Isaiah 10:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.36.19">36:19</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.37.13">37:13</a>, and <a href="?bref=Amos.6.2">Amos 6:2</a>. Later the city seems to have been subject to Damascus (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.23">Jer 49:23</a>). Some of the prophets predicted that Israel would eventually extend its boundaries once again to Hamath (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.16-17">Ez 47:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.1">48:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.2">Zec 9:2</a>).</p>

<p>After the death of Solomon, the kingdom was divided and the northern boundary shrank.

  <title>Hammurabi*, Law Code of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HAMMURABI*, Law Code of</p>
<p class="fl">Law code devised by Hammurabi, the last great king of the first Babylonian dynasty (c. 1790–1750 <span class="era">BC</span>), to safeguard the rights and define the responsibilities of Babylonian citizens. The laws were inscribed on stelae, which were usually erected in marketplaces or near temples for all to see. The most complete example discovered so far dates from the latter part of his reign. The black diorite stele was found at Susa in 1901 by French archaeologists. It stood eight feet (2.4 meters) high and showed a bas-relief of Hammurabi receiving the symbols of kingship and law from the god Shamash. Beneath this was a poetic introduction, followed by the 282 articles of the code, and an epilogue in an equally poetic style extolling the virtues of Hammurabi, his concern for his people, and the way in which he had followed the wishes of the great god Marduk and the god of justice, Shamash. The gods are called upon to curse any who defy the stele.</p>
<p>It had been carried to Susa as a battle trophy by the Elamites in 1160 <span class="era">BC</span>, and it is now in the Louvre in Paris. The code is a collection of laws based on Sumerian and early Semitic laws. Similarities between the code of Hammurabi and those of the Assyrians, Hittites, and Hebrews are numerous.</p>
<p>Hammurabi began his code by setting out punishments for the most obvious crimes, such as kidnapping, theft, receiving stolen property, breaking and entering, looting, perjury, false accusation, and harboring a fugitive. All these could be punished by death, especially where robbery involved the theft of temple or state property, and where perjury was committed by a witness giving testimony in a case involving a capital offense.</p>
<p>All valid transactions took place before witnesses, and it was essential that their testimony was trustworthy in disputed cases. Summary justice was meted out to the man found guilty of breaking and entering: “If a man made a breach in a house, they shall put him to death in front of that breach and wall him in” (section 21), and to the looter at a fire: “If a fire broke out in a man’s house, and a man, who went to extinguish [it] cast his eye on the goods of the owner of the house and has appropriated the goods of the owner of the house, that man shall be thrown into that fire” (section 25).</p>
<p>The protection of feudal rights and responsibilities are outlined in the next section. The officer was responsible for soldiers under his command in the same way that the soldier was required to fulfill his duty to the state. The law also protected his property while he was in the army. A tenant was under obligation to use his rented property carefully and advantageously. If a tenant rented land that became flooded before the harvest, the law protected him from having to pay rent for that year. He also had to be thoughtful toward his neighbors’ crops and ensure that he didn’t inundate their fields by his own overzealous irrigation (sections 30–56).</p>
<p>The detail in which contracts and commercial laws are discussed indicates the extent and variety of such transactions. If money was borrowed from a merchant who foreclosed and the borrower was unable to repay the loan, he had to make payment in kind, for example, in dates from his own crop. The permissible interest rate was approximately 20 percent. The borrower was also protected by law from the practice of the lender’s using a small weight of grain or money and insisting on the return with interest at a large weight. Anyone caught doing this forfeited whatever he had lent. Female wine sellers were also cautioned against selling with short weight (section 108). High interest rates were prescribed for obtaining wine on credit, and it is unlikely that many took advantage of this early form of credit.</p>
<p>To ensure an equal division in the breaking up of a partnership, the transaction was performed in the presence “of God,” presumably in the temple. A trader borrowing money at interest was expected to make a profit. If he did, he repaid the principal and the interest. If he did not, it was presumed that he was a poor trader, and he was penalized by having to repay the merchant double the amount that he had borrowed. If the money was loaned as a favor, however, and the trader then suffered a loss, the principal only was repayable without interest. A trader who was robbed by bandits was not required to make payment. Sealed receipts were used as a safeguard of fair trading practices. In disputes between a merchant and a trader over a loan, if the merchant proved his case, the trader had to return three times the amount of the money originally borrowed. Where the merchant disputed with a trader who then proved his case, the merchant paid the trader six times the amount of the principal involved (sections 98–107).</p>
<p>A creditor could not come and take a debtor’s money or grain without his permission. If he did so, he had to return what he had taken and forfeit the loan. In several instances a person could be held as a pledge. If he died of natural causes during that period, no claim could be made, but if he died as a result of maltreatment, compensation was payable according to rank. If the pledge was a slave (the lowest level of Mesopotamian society), the amount payable was one-third of a mina of silver and the loan was forgiven. If the pledge was a man’s son, the creditor’s son was put to death as a recompense. Where a wife, son, or daughter was bound over for service to pay a debt, the maximum period of servitude was three years (sections 113–117).</p>
<p>A man was responsible for the security of anything left with him for safekeeping. If the property was lost through robbery because the building was not secure, restitution had to be made to the owner of the property. Anyone claiming falsely that his property was lost had to pay the city council double the amount of his claim.</p>
<p>There were also extensive laws related to sex and marriage (sections 127–162). Like most transactions, marriage was not valid without a contract. Adultery was frequently punished by death, but a man might plead to have his wife’s life spared. The victim of rape was not punished. (According to Mosaic law, such a person was equally guilty if the act took place within the city, as she was expected to scream for help. If it occurred outside the city walls, however, she was not held responsible, on the theory that her screams could not have been heard.) Hammurabi’s code shows concern for the woman who was deserted or whose husband was taken captive. She was permitted to live with another man if she had insufficient means to be self-supporting.</p>
<p>A woman’s dowry was returned when she was divorced, or if there had been no dowry, a payment of one mina of silver was made to her, or one-third of a mina of silver if her husband was a peasant. If a woman neglected her household duties to set herself up in business, her husband might divorce her without payment or he might remarry without divorcing her, thus forcing her to live on in the house as a servant.</p>
<p>A slave who had borne her master’s child could not be sold. If a man married a woman who was sick, and he then decided to marry another, the sick wife might continue to live in the house and her husband had to support her for the rest of her life. A woman who killed her husband for her lover was impaled on stakes (section 153). Incest was punishable by death or banishment. Breach of promise cases usually resulted in the repayment of double the value of the dowry. When a wife died, her dowry became part of her inheritance for her children, but if she died childless and her father returned her marriage price, her husband might not lay claim to her dowry, which had to be returned to her father (sections 162–163). The rights of a younger unmarried son were protected, as were those of the children of a master and his slave. A son was protected against being disinherited by his father unless he had committed some serious offense. A widow was protected against the overzealous financial demands of her children. If a free woman married a slave, their children were free. If the slave died, his widow retained her dowry and half the goods acquired since the marriage, the slave owner being entitled to the remainder. Women temple personnel were also protected by law.</p>
<p>Under Hebrew law, it was a father’s duty to teach his son the means of earning a livelihood. Hammurabi’s code prescribed that an adopted son had to be similarly trained, and if in any way he was not reared as a natural child within the family, he might return to his own home.</p>
<p>If a man subsequently had a family of his own and the foster child was sent away, he had the right to take with him one-third of the man’s goods, although none of his land or his house, since these were the inheritance of the natural children. If a child died in a nurse’s care and she took another assignment without informing the new employers of the previous death, her breast was cut off.</p>
<p>The most famous section of Hammurabi’s law code concerns assault: “If a [man] has destroyed the eye of a member of the aristocracy, they shall destroy his eye.” Similarly, if he broke a man’s bone or knocked out a tooth, he would suffer the same fate (sections 196–197). If the injured person was a commoner, however, a fine of one mina of silver was charged for destroying an eye or breaking a bone. When the injured man was a slave, payment of half his value had to be made. Punishments for simple assault depended upon the rank of the two protagonists. Where a man swore that the blow was not deliberate, he might simply pay the physician’s bill. Other penalties were set out for instances where the blow was fatal or caused a woman to miscarry (sections 209–214).</p>
<p>Surgeons’ fees were also specified. For saving a life or for eye surgery, the fee was ten shekels of silver when the patient was an aristocrat, but only five for a commoner, and two for a slave. If an aristocratic patient died under the surgeon’s bronze knife, or lost an eye, the surgeon could have his hand cut off (section 218). If a slave died during surgery, the surgeon had to replace the slave with another. For setting a broken bone or healing a sprained tendon, the physician charged five, three, or two shekels, depending on the patient’s status (sections 221–223).</p>
<p>The final section of laws concerns the protection of people from the poor workmanship of house and boat builders, rules and regulations for those who rent animals or hire people, theft of agricultural implements, rates for hiring and paying wages, and rules for the purchase and sale of slaves (sections 228–282).</p>
<p>A man who fraudulently let out his master’s oxen for hire rather than using them on his own fields would be required to pay the normal rental of grain for the field. If he was unable to do so, he was to be dragged through that field by the oxen.</p>
<p>Because of similarities in culture, it is hardly surprising that there should be areas of correspondence between Hammurabi’s code and the Mosaic law. Thus both bodies of legislation prescribed the death penalty for adultery (Hammurabi section 129; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.10">Lv 20:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.22">Dt 22:22</a>) and for the kidnapping and selling of an individual (Hammurabi section 114; <a href="?bref=Exod.21.16">Ex 21:16</a>). The <span class="ital">lex talionis,</span> or principle of retaliation, in <a href="?bref=Exod.21.23-25">Exodus 21:23-25</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.19.21">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> is reflected widely in Hammurabi’s laws, including sections 197, 210, and 230. The differences, however, are equally significant. Whereas Hammurabi’s legislation allowed women equal rights of divorce (section 142), these were denied under the Mosaic law by simply not being included (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.24.1-4">Dt 24:1-4</a>). Hammurabi’s code was basically pragmatic in nature, and although promulgated under the authority of Shamash, god of justice, the legislation took little notice of ethical and spiritual principles.</p>

  <title>Hand</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HAND</p>
<p class="fl">The terminal part of the forelimb that has the ability to grasp. “Hand” is used hundreds of times in the Bible to describe a physical part of one’s body. It is also used frequently in metaphors or figurative language.</p>
<p>Figuratively, the hand meant power (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.15">Dt 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.31.5">Ps 31:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mk 14:62</a>). Indeed, in <a href="?bref=Josh.8.20">Joshua 8:20</a> “hand to flee” is translated “power to flee” (see <a href="?bref=Ps.76.5">Ps 76:5</a>). Conversely, limp hands symbolized irresoluteness and weakness (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.3">Is 35:3</a>). Clasping the hands signified friendship (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.15">2 Kgs 10:15</a>). To seat someone on one’s right hand denoted favor (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.11">Pss 16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.77.10">77:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">110:1</a>). Clean hands symbolized innocence (<a href="?bref=Ps.26.6">Ps 26:6</a>), while striking hands sealed a bargain (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.1">Prv 6:1</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Lifting the hand symbolized violence (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.26">1 Kgs 11:26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The hands were used in supplicatory prayer (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.11">Ex 17:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.9.22">Lv 9:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.15">Is 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.8">1 Tm 2:8</a>) and in making vows (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.22">Gn 14:22</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <a href="?bref=Gen.24.2">24:2</a>).</p>
<p>Other idiomatic uses of the hands expressed jeopardizing one’s life (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.3">Jgs 12:3</a>), gladness (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.12">2 Kgs 11:12</a>), generosity (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.11">Dt 15:11</a>), grief (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.19">2 Sm 13:19</a>), humility (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.32">Prv 30:32</a>), and undertaking a duty (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.62">Lk 9:62</a>). Manual labor is an expression of man’s dignity and duty (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.28">Eph 4:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.11">1 Thes 4:11</a>), the marks of which Paul was not ashamed to display (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.34">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.12">1 Cor 4:12</a>). Ritual hand washing was obligatory for the priests before fulfilling their office (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.19-21">Ex 30:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.40.30-32">40:30-32</a>). The scribes and Pharisees so misapplied this that Jesus ignored ceremonial hand washing (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.1-20">Mt 15:1-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.38">Lk 11:38</a>). Pilate’s hand washing (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.24">Mt 27:24</a>) disclaimed responsibility for, or professed innocence concerning, a wrong that, however, could not be done without his consent.</p>
<p>When Israel went out of Egypt “with an high hand” (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.8">Ex 14:8</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), the reference is to the hand or help of the Lord. The hand of the Lord represented God’s resistless power (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.15">Dt 2:15</a>), judgment (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.11">Acts 13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.31">Heb 10:31</a>), divine inspiration (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">Ez 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1">37:1</a>), and providential care (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.6">Ezr 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.28-29">Jn 10:28-29</a>).</p>
<p>The laying on of hands had a profound significance and occurs frequently in the Bible. Before making a blood sacrifice, the person making the offering, not the priest, laid hands on the victim. The act signified the transference of guilt to, or self-identification with, the victim (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.4">Lv 1:4</a>). Laying on of hands signified appointment to an office, as when Moses commissioned Joshua (<a href="?bref=Num.27.12-23">Nm 27:12-23</a>), the apostles made seven disciples their associates or deputies in the ministry (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.5-6">Acts 6:5-6</a>), and Paul and Barnabas were appointed missionaries and representatives of the church in Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.3">13:3</a>). By laying on of hands, a person was made an associate with the holder of an office and was admitted to the status of that office (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">1 Tm 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6">2 Tm 1:6</a>). The act was accompanied by prayer and was, in itself, a form of prayer. As Augustine remarks: “What else is the laying on of hands but a prayer over one?”</p>
<p>The laying on of hands accompanied healing in the ministry of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.5">Mk 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.40">Lk 4:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.11-13">13:11-13</a>) and of the disciples (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.18">Mk 16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.12,17">Acts 9:12, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.8">28:8</a>). This expressed the self-identification and sympathy of the healer with and for the sufferer, as well as reinforced the patient’s faith and God’s imparting health to him in answer to prayer.</p>

At age 75, Abraham was commanded by God to move to a land that God had for him (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-4">Gn 12:1-4</a>). There were relatives who remained in Haran, however, to whom Jacob, Abraham’s grandson, fled in fear of Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.42-43">27:42-43</a>). Jacob stayed in Haran many years while serving his Uncle Laban and acquiring Leah and Rachel as wives, as well as many sheep and goats, servants, camels, and donkeys (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.43">30:43</a>).</p>
<p>This “city of Nahor” (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.27-29">Gn 11:27-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.24.10">24:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.27.43">27:43</a>) was established in the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, and its location on a branch of the Euphrates soon made it an important commercial center. Perhaps the ancient trade route that linked Damascus, Nineveh, and Carchemish passed by Haran. Ezekiel mentions trade between Haran and Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.23">Ez 27:23</a>). Haran was an Aramean city and was famous for its worship of the lunar Sin and Nikkal. This system was an offspring of the cult found in Sumerian Ur. Sin and his consort Nikkal were revered not only here but throughout Canaan and even in Egypt. The cult persisted past NT times, its temple finally being destroyed by Mongols in the 13th century <span class="era">AD</span>. It is little wonder that God commanded Abraham to leave this seat of idolatry. Modern Harran preserves the ancient cuneiform spelling of the name (cf. <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Charran,” <a href="?bref=Acts.7.2,4">Acts 7:2, 4</a>).</p>

  <title>Hardness of Heart*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HARDNESS OF HEART*</p>
<p class="fl">A phrase signifying spiritual obstinacy.</p>
<p>The first references to the hardening of the heart exemplify the fundamental features of this doctrine in Scripture. The number of times it is referred to is surprising; there are at least 20 references to the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart in the OT alone, as well as Paul’s exposition of its significance in <a href="?bref=Rom.9.17-24">Romans 9:17-24</a>.</p>
<p>The first reference is <a href="?bref=Exod.4.21">Exodus 4:21</a>, where God promises Moses that he will harden Pharaoh’s heart that he might not allow the Israelites to go. This promise is repeated (see <a href="?bref=Exod.7.3">Ex 7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.14.4,17">14:4, 17</a>) and rapidly comes to pass (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.13-14">7:13-14</a>), as revelation and miracle follow one another before the eyes of Pharaoh, followed by the actual occurrence of the events God warned about, including all the judgments of the 10 plagues.</p>
<p>No doubt is left in the mind of the reader, either in the exodus account itself or later, that Pharaoh’s obstinacy was an act of divine judgment on God’s part for his own external ends and purposes (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.16">Ex 9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.20">Jos 11:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.17-18">Rom 9:17-18</a>). Nevertheless, it is also stated that Pharaoh hardened his own heart (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.15,32">Ex 8:15, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.34">9:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.15">13:15</a>), showing that the hardening process is a deliberate product of personal rebellion against revealed truth. This is a crucial aspect of the scriptural presentation of the matter; judicial hardening of the heart is not only an act of God upon the sinner’s nature but also a willful turning from the truth. The sinner is therefore responsible to God for his hardness of heart.</p>
<p>The process of judicial hardening is described by Paul in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-32">Romans 1:18-32</a>. All humans have an innate God-consciousness from which they deliberately turn away. They change the truth into a lie and suppress what truth they have. As a result, hardness of heart takes over. Paul’s expression for this is that “their foolish heart was darkened” because “God gave them up” to the results of their own sin. The results are both intellectual (“God gave them over to a reprobate mind”) and moral, as well as social or cultural. Paul uses the term “hardness of heart” in <a href="?bref=Rom.2.5">Romans 2:5</a> to describe the general result. It is important to note that it is not against God’s wrath or against the results of sin that the wicked are in revolt but against “truth” and against their own conscience (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.14-16">2:14-16</a>).</p>
<p>God often warns his people not to harden their hearts, for Scripture associates hardening with unbelief (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.7">Dt 15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.8,15">Heb 3:8, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.7">4:7</a>). Jesus was grieved at the callousness of his hearers’ hearts (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.5">Mk 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.14">16:14</a>). He referred to allowances God had made to the Jews concerning divorce because of the hardness of their hearts (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.8">Mt 19:8</a>).</p>
<p>On at least two occasions in the Gospels, judicial blindness is ascribed directly to God, and its purpose stated (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.13-15">Mt 13:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.39-41">Jn 12:39-41</a>). Hardness of heart is therefore an aspect of the development of the fallen character, manifesting the root of rebellion (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.8">Ps 95:8</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.40">Jn 12:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.8,15">Heb 3:8, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.7">4:7</a>). Throughout Scripture, Jewish apostasy is so described (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.14">2 Kgs 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.16-17">Neh 9:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.8">Heb 3:8</a>).</p>

  <title>Harvest</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HARVEST</p>
<p class="fl">The gathering in of a crop, especially for food. There was no single harvesttime in ancient Israel. Olives were harvested in September–November, flax in March– April, barley in April–May, and wheat in May–June. Fruits such as figs and grapes were harvested at the end of the summer, in August or September. The Israelites’ calendar revolved around the harvest periods (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.15.1">Jgs 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.1.22">Ru 1:22</a>).</p>
<p>In the OT, Pentecost (a harvest festival) was one of the three major festivals that the Israelites were required by the Lord to keep annually (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.16">Ex 23:16</a>). In doing so they would remember that the rich land into which they had been brought from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.7-10">Dt 8:7-10</a>) was the gift of God. In offering the firstfruits of the harvest (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.10-11">Lv 23:10-11</a>), the Israelites showed gratitude and acknowledged their dependence on the Lord. Moreover, as the harvest was a gift, they were not to be selfish in enjoying it but to leave some for the underprivileged (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-10">19:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.22">23:22</a>).</p>
<p>NT references to harvest are largely figurative. In one parable (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.24-30">Mt 13:24-30</a>) harvest represents the final judgment and the reapers are angels, gathering in the righteous and excluding the wicked from the kingdom (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.13.36-43">36-43</a>). In another, the harvest refers to those who have not yet heard the gospel, and the “laborers” are those who bring it to them (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.37-38">Mt 9:37-38</a>).</p>

Jews were required to employ the Greek language in their daily lives, and with the language came the influence of Greek culture. This process was quite apparent in Palestine during the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, and the Jewish people responded in two antagonistic ways: one party was friendly to the Greeks; the other party set as their goal strict adherence to the principles of Judaism. The latter group, known as “the pious,” or Hasideans, cherished the ideals of responsible covenant observance (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.9">Dt 7:9</a>), and in the Maccabean period became militants in their efforts to worship God according to the Mosaic law. Both the Pharisees and the Essenes may have had early roots in the Hasidim movement.</p>

<p class="h1">HATRED</p>
<p class="fl">Intense feeling of aversion or enmity, which could prompt a person to loathe someone or something, or even to seek revenge for having been wronged. The Scriptures forbid people to hate others (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.17-18">Lv 19:17-18</a>) because it leads to sin. Indeed, hatred itself is considered murder (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.15">1 Jn 3:15</a>). We are called upon to let God, the holy one, avenge all wrongs (<a href="?bref=Pr.20.22">Prv 20:22</a>), and we are commanded by Jesus to love our enemies (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-44">Mt 5:43-44</a>).</p>
<p>Not all aspects of hatred are sinful. The Scriptures tell us that God hates evil (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.16-19">Prv 6:16-19</a>) and evil people (<a href="?bref=Ps.5.5">Ps 5:5</a>). The Scripture also has expressions such as “Jacob have I loved; Esau I have hated” (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.2-3">Mal 1:2-3</a>). This means that God elected Jacob and not Esau to be the progenitor of the chosen Jewish race. In similar fashion, would-be Christians are challenged by Jesus to hate their lives and earthly relationships if they want to follow him (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.26">Lk 14:26</a>). This means that they must choose Jesus above all else.</p>

<p class="fl">Region in northeastern Transjordan mentioned in Ezekiel’s description of the borders of the land (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.16-18">Ez 47:16-18</a>). In biblical times it corresponded to the modern Jebel ed-Druze of the Leja. This area is mentioned as early as the reign of Shalmaneser III of Assyria in his description of a military campaign in 841 <span class="era">BC</span>. His army marched to Mt Khauranu after a siege of Damascus and before crossing Galilee to Mt Carmel.</p>
<p>In 733–732 <span class="era">BC</span> Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria conquered Damascus and its surrounding region and organized it into provinces, one of which was Khaurina, or Hauran. The same province is mentioned in the Annals of Ashurbanipal during his campaign against the Arabians (639–637 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">HAVILAH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Land in the neighborhood of Eden, now unknown but said to be watered by the river Pishon and containing supplies of gold, bdellium, and onyx stone (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.11-12">Gn 2:11-12</a>). The location of Havilah has been a matter of much dispute. It cannot have any connection with the Havilah of <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.7">1 Samuel 15:7</a>, where Saul fought against certain Amalekites, because the locale of the Eden narratives is Mesopotamian and not Palestinian. On the same basis, any attempt to locate Havilah in southern Arabia, Somaliland, or India would be mistaken. The “river” Pishon may have been an irrigation canal, since Akkadian does not have a separate word for these two different bodies of water, and the Mesopotamian custom was to name large irrigation canals as if they were rivers. This would help to account for the survival of the name “Pishon” long after the canal had disappeared. The Pishon was one of four branches that the river formed once it left Eden; hence, Havilah must have been to the north, since the narrative assumes an upstream perspective. Probably Havilah was in the general area of the Shinar plain and was watered by a major irrigation canal. Both Havilah and the canal have long disappeared.</p>

<p class="h1">HAVOTH-JAIR*, HAVVOTH-JAIR*</p>
<p class="fl">Series of settlements on the edge of Bashan across the Jordan captured by Jair, according to <a href="?bref=Num.32.41">Numbers 32:41</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). Because of their location, they fell into the allotment of the half-tribe of Manasseh. The number of these villages is given in <a href="?bref=Josh.13.29-30">Joshua 13:29-30</a> as 60, and they are probably included in the cities and towns of <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.22-23">1 Chronicles 2:22-23</a>, although only 23 cities are specified as belonging to Jair. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> rendering as “Bashan-havoth-jair” (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Dt 3:14</a>) makes the location as specific as in the Hebrew. In <a href="?bref=Judg.10.4">Judges 10:4</a>, a judge named Jair had 30 sons who controlled 30 cities named Havvoth-jair. But he is obviously different from the Jair of <a href="?bref=Num.32.41">Numbers 32:41</a>. If his sons controlled only 30 settlements, he himself probably governed the remaining 30. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.21-24">1 Chronicles 2:21-24</a>, which reflects a relationship between Judah and Manasseh, Jair was said to have 23 cities in Gilead when Geshur and Aram captured 60 towns from the tent settlements of Jair and Kenath and its dependencies. While the variant numbers present difficulties, the narrative itself may be the Chronicler’s way of indicating Judah’s sense of sovereignty over Gilead.</p>

  <title>Hazael</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HAZAEL</p>
<p class="fl">King of Syria (843?–796? <span class="era">BC</span>) who came to power by assassinating his ruler, Ben-hadad (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.7-15">2 Kgs 8:7-15</a>), and establishing a new dynasty. An inscription of Shalmaneser speaks of Hazael as a “son of a nobody,” and mentions that he had “seized the throne.” The Hebrew prophet Elijah was told to anoint Hazael as the next king of Syria (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.15">1 Kgs 19:15</a>).</p>
<p>Upon becoming king, Hazael continued the policy of Ben-hadad in resisting the Assyrian military influence in Palestine. Although most of Palestine came under Assyrian control in 841 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hazael was able to retain independence by withstanding the siege of Damascus. Failing in a final attempt to subdue Damascus in 837 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Assyrians withdrew. This allowed Hazael the freedom to begin a series of attacks against Israel that resulted in Syrian domination of most of Palestine.</p>
<p>Toward the end of Jehu’s reign in Israel, Hazael occupied Israelite territory in the hills of Galilee and east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32">2 Kgs 10:32</a>). After Jehu’s death, the Syrian king continually harassed Israel, captured much of Philistia, and spared Jerusalem only because Joash, king of Judah, asked for peace and was willing to pay heavy tribute (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.17-18">12:17-18</a>). The Syrian oppression continued during the reign of Hazael’s son until Adad-nirari III, king of Assyria, marched into Syria, causing Damascus to submit and pay heavy tribute. This took the pressure off Israel and provided opportunity for her to regain territory taken by Hazael (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.24-25">13:24-25</a>).</p>
<p>Archaeologists found the remains of a bed at Arslan Tash (Hadathah) that may have been included in the tribute taken from Damascus. Part of the inscription on a piece of ivory inlay from the bed reads “to our Lord Hazael.” Evidently there was a high level of culture in Damascus under Hazael. According to Josephus, Hazael was long remembered for his part in building temples in Damascus.</p>

<p class="h1">HAZOR</p>
<p class="list">1. City in northern Palestine in the territory of Naphtali, called “the capital of the federation of all these kingdoms [of Canaan]” in <a href="?bref=Josh.11.10">Joshua 11:10</a>. Located five miles (8 kilometers) southwest of Lake Huleh and ten miles (16 kilometers) north of the Sea of Galilee, it is known as Tell el-Qedah (or Tell Waggas) today. At its peak it numbered 40,000 inhabitants and was by far the largest Canaanite city in area and population. It was a great commercial center on the trade routes between Egypt and Babylon.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hazor is first mentioned in the 19th-century <span class="era">BC</span> Egyptian Execration Texts. It is given prominence in the archives of Mari (18th century <span class="era">BC</span>), being the only Palestinian city to be mentioned in these documents. It is frequently mentioned in Egyptian documents from the time of Thutmose III to Ramses II, including the Tell el-Amarna correspondence.</p>
<p class="list-text">The OT mentions Hazor a number of times. The first time concerns the conquests of Joshua in which Hazor was completely destroyed (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-15">Jos 11:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.19">12:19</a>). At that time, Hazor was a Canaanite royal city whose king, Jabin, headed a northern Canaanite federation against the invading Israelites. Hazor figures in the revolt led by Deborah and Barak against another Jabin that resulted in a rout of Jabin’s forces under Sisera (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">Jgs 4–5</a>). Hazor was fortified by Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15">1 Kgs 9:15</a>); the remains of Solomon’s Hazor are clearly preserved. King Ahab (874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>) also added to the fortifications; the elaborate water system Ahab constructed when he rebuilt the whole upper city and fortified it to withstand long siege has been found. The city was destroyed by the Assyrian Tiglath-pileser III about 732 <span class="era">BC</span>, thus bringing to an end its use as a fortified Israelite city (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>). Fortresses of the Assyrian, Persian, and Hellenistic periods have been found in various strata of the city. Hazor is not mentioned again in the OT, but <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.11.67">1 Maccabees 11:67</a> says Jonathan encamped near the plain of Hazor where he fought against Demetrius (147 <span class="era">BC</span>). The last mention of Hazor in ancient sources was by Josephus.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hazor has been of particular interest for the light it sheds on the conquest of Palestine described in Joshua. Excavations clearly show that the great city was destroyed by fire in the last half of the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> and was never rebuilt. Archaeological finds support the biblical picture of a violent conquest under Joshua. The meager Israelite occupation in the 12th and 11th century <span class="era">BC</span> was replaced by a well-fortified city during the Solomonic era.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in southern Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.23">Jos 15:23</a>). It is perhaps el-Jebariyeh, on the Wadi Umm Ethnan near Bir Hafir, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) southeast of el-’Auja.</p>

  <title>Head</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HEAD</p>
<p class="fl">The uppermost portion of the body, containing the brain, major sense organs, and the mouth. It appears many times in the Bible as a physical description. The Hebrew term for <span class="ital">head</span> is also used figuratively in the Old Testament. Frequently, it designates prominence or authority.</p>
<p>To raise one’s head was considered an act of pride (<a href="?bref=Ps.140.9">Ps 140:9</a>) or honor (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.20">Gn 40:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.3.3">Pss 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.27.6">27:6</a>). Bowing the head signified humility (<a href="?bref=Isa.58.5">Is 58:5</a>) or sadness (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.10">Lam 2:10</a>). The Hebrew word is used metaphorically of mountain peaks (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.5">Gn 8:5</a>), the tops of buildings (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.4">Gn 11:4</a>) or trees (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.24">2 Sm 5:24</a>), and river sources (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.10">Gn 2:10</a>). The term was commonly used to designate positions of political, military, or familiar authority. In this sense the “head” exercised control over all those subjected to him (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.18">Jgs 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.17">1 Sm 15:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.43">Ps 18:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.8-9">Is 7:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.7">Jer 31:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.1.11">Hos 1:11</a>). David was called the “keeper of mine head” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) when he served as the bodyguard of Achish (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.2">1 Sm 28:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.9.53">Jgs 9:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.21">Ps 68:21</a>).</p>
<p>Greek philosophers used the image of the body to represent the universe. The head of this body—called Zeus or Reason—was considered responsible for the creation and sustenance of the remaining members (celestial beings, humans, animals, plants, and inanimate objects). The universe, or “body,” owed its existence to the “head.”</p>
<p>Between 460 <span class="era">BC</span> (the date usually ascribed to the first writings of Hippocrates) and <span class="era">AD</span> 200 (the death of Galen, who developed Hippocrates’ findings), Greek medical science came to understand the head as the seat of intelligence. The body was able to operate efficiently only because the brain was capable of interpreting data received from the body (eyes, ears, skin, and so on), and because it was able to send out appropriate impulses to the various members of the body, based upon the data received. The ability of the brain to interpret and direct made the existence of the body completely dependent upon it.</p>
<p>In the NT, the term refers to the actual human head (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.36">Mt 5:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.17">6:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.14.8">14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.7">26:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.27">Mk 6:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3">14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.46">Lk 7:46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.9">Jn 13:9</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.7">20:7</a>), to apocalyptic beings (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.14">Rv 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.4.4">4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1">12:1</a>), and to animals (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.7,17,19">Rv 9:7, 17, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.3">12:3</a>). Furthermore, it appears in such expressions as “to heap coals of fire upon the head,” meaning to return good for evil (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.20">Rom 12:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.44">Mt 5:44</a>); to “shear” or “anoint the head” expressing a vow (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.24">Acts 21:24</a>); and “to lay down the head,” meaning to sleep (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.20">Mt 8:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.58">Lk 9:58</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul drew from the OT metaphorical understanding of the term to express the headship of God over Christ, Christ over man, and man over woman (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.3-16">1 Cor 11:3-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.5.23">Eph 5:23</a>). In the light of these relationships, Paul encouraged women at Corinth to wear veils in worship. The veil gave a woman the authority to worship as an equal with men before God. The term is used again with the meaning “authority” to express the lordship of Christ over the universe (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.21-22">Eph 1:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.10">Col 2:10</a>).</p>
<p>Paul used the image of the head and body to express the relationship between Christ and his church (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.15">Eph 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.23">5:23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-27">1 Cor 12:12-27</a>). In addition to the OT sense, the contributions of medical science in Paul’s day may provide insight into this image, for Christ is not only the dominant ruler over the church but also the dynamic force that provides its direction and unity. The ability of the church to exist and the focal point of its activity are rooted in the work of its “head,” Jesus Christ. In this light, various modern exegetes have argued that headship does not mean “authority” as much as it means “source,” as in the term “fountainhead.” Thus, he who is the head is the source, the supplier. These interpreters see God as being Christ’s supplier, and Christ being the church’s supplier, and man being woman’s supplier.</p>

  <title>Head Covering</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HEAD COVERING</p>
<p class="fl">Something used to cover one’s head either for protection or for religious reasons.</p>
<p>Men wore a cap, turban, or head scarf for protection against the sun. The cap was similar to a skullcap (a cap without a brim) and was sometimes worn by the poor. The turban (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.23">Is 3:23</a>) was made of thick linen wound around the head with the ends tucked inside the folds. The priest’s turban had a plate strapped to it bearing the inscription “Holy to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.36">Ex 28:36</a>). The head scarf was made from a square yard (.8 square meter) of cloth, folded in half to form a triangle. The sides fell over the shoulders and the V-point down the back, and it was held in place by a headband made of cord. About the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, male Jews began to wear phylacteries on their foreheads, small leather boxes containing special Scripture passages, at morning prayers and at festivals, but not on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Women were often veiled in public, although this custom changed over the centuries. In NT times, women usually wore veils (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.5-6">1 Cor 11:5-6</a>). Women also wore a cloth similar to the head scarf, but the fabric was different in quality and color from that worn by men. It was often pinned over a stiff hat and set with ornaments. If a woman was married, these and other important coins covered the front of the hat and constituted her dowry (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.15.8-10">Lk 15:8-10</a>). Women also adorned their heads with an elaborate plaiting of their hair, prompting Peter to warn Christian women about too much concern with external beauty (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.3-4">1 Pt 3:3-4</a>).</p>

  <title>Heal, Healing</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HEAL, HEALING</p>
<p class="fl">To make well. The OT provides the proper background for a Christian understanding of the concept of healing. In the OT the basic point is made that God is the healer of his people. In <a href="?bref=Exod.15.22-26">Exodus 15:22-26</a>, after God has delivered his people from Egypt, led them through the sea, and sweetened the water at Marah, he speaks of himself as their “healer.” This refers primarily to physical sustenance, but it points to the more encompassing concept of God sustaining his people in an eternal relationship with himself. In a similar manner, <a href="?bref=Deut.32.39">Deuteronomy 32:39</a> speaks of God as the one who heals. The context in Deuteronomy implies that this healing power derives from the fact that God is God. This concept of God as the healer is echoed throughout the OT by the psalmists (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.2">Pss 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.41.4">41:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.3">103:3</a>) and prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.22">Is 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.14">Jer 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.7.1">Hos 7:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.11.16">Zec 11:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesustheHealerAccountsintheGospels">Jesus the Healer: Accounts in the Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">The NT significantly emphasizes Jesus as the healer. Mark portrays him as a teacher and healer in his opening account of Jesus’ ministry in Capernaum with the healing of the demoniac, Peter’s mother-in-law, the sick brought to him in the evening, and the leper (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.21-45">Mk 1:21-45</a>). Indeed, healing sickness and casting out demons characterize Jesus’ ministry. Mark presents in rapid succession Jesus’ healing of the paralytic (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.1-12">2:1-12</a>), the man with the withered hand (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>), the multitudes by the sea (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-12">7-12</a>), the Gerasene demoniac (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.1-20">5:1-20</a>), the woman with a hemorrhage, and Jairus’s daughter (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.5.21-43">21-43</a>). Jesus then commissioned the Twelve to proclaim repentance, to cast out demons, and to heal the sick (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.7-13">6:7-13</a>). He himself continued with healings at Gennesaret (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.6.53-56">53-56</a>), casting out the unclean spirit from the daughter of the Syrophoenician woman (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.24-30">7:24-30</a>), healing the deaf and mute man (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.7.31-37">31-37</a>), the blind man of Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">8:22-26</a>), the boy possessed with an evil spirit (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.14-20">9:14-20</a>), and blind Bartimaeus (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-52">10:46-52</a>).</p>
<p>Certainly healing is an important aspect of Jesus’ ministry. The healings expressed not only his compassion for those suffering but also constituted a revelation of his person. This is brought out by the climactic statement of Jesus in healing the paralytic: “that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins” (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.10">Mk 2:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). It also seems that Mark intended his readers to understand that the healing of the deaf and mute man (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.31-37">7:31-37</a>) and the blind man of Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">8:22-26</a>) symbolize the awakening of spiritual understanding in the disciples of who Jesus is. It is also significant that Mark has placed the healing of Bartimaeus (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-52">10:46-52</a>) immediately after Jesus’ third announcement of his own coming death (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.32-34">32-34</a>) and the disciples’ third failure to understand that his being the Messiah entailed the necessity of suffering (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-45">35-45</a>).</p>
<p>Matthew also portrays Jesus as teaching, preaching, and healing (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23-25">Mt 4:23-25</a>), and parallels the accounts in Mark, except for the healing of the demoniac in the synagogue (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.23-28">Mk 1:23-28</a>) and the blind man of Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">8:22-26</a>). However, according to his special purpose and structure, Matthew has placed many of Jesus’ healings together in a “mighty works” section (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-9.38">Mt 8–9</a>), complementing the “great words” (“sermon”) section (chs <a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">5–7</a>). Matthew views Jesus’ healings as directly fulfilling the OT, as he states in <a href="?bref=Matt.8.17">8:17</a>. The unique way in which the healings of <a href="?bref=Matt.8.16">8:16</a> are spoken of as fulfilling <a href="?bref=Isa.53.4">Isaiah 53:4</a> seems to indicate that Jesus’ power over sickness derives in some way from his death for sin, which was to be accomplished at the end of his ministry.</p>
<p>It is also interesting that Matthew, in relating Jesus’ healing of the multitudes by the sea (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.15-21">Mt 12:15-21</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-12">Mk 3:7-12</a>), cites <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-4">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>. This OT passage speaks of God’s servant anointed with the Spirit to proclaim justice to the nations. As used by Matthew, the quotation explains why Jesus commanded those healed not to make him known. Jesus did not want too much publicity about himself to thwart God’s plan for him as the Suffering Servant who was to bring salvation to the nations. This action demonstrates that Jesus’ healings are revelations of his person. Again another quotation from Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.9-10">6:9-10</a>) in <a href="?bref=Matt.13.14-15">Matthew 13:14-15</a> brings out the fact that healing is understood primarily in the spiritual sense of hearing Jesus’ proclamation of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Luke, like Matthew and Mark, portrays Jesus preaching and healing. After the account of the birth of John and Jesus and the ministry of John the Baptist, Luke presents Jesus preaching in Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-30">Lk 4:16-30</a>). Here, in the synagogue of his hometown, Jesus himself, using a quotation from <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-2">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, affirms that the Spirit has anointed him to proclaim good news and to announce release for the captives and a recovery of sight for the blind (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">Lk 4:18</a>). The healing aspect of Jesus’ ministry occupies an important place in the rest of the book of Luke. Indeed, Luke has all the healing incidents noted by Mark, except for those in <a href="?bref=Mark.6.45-8.26">Mark 6:45–8:26</a>. However, Luke’s opening scene in Nazareth seems to underscore that Jesus’ healing is to be understood, not as merely expressing Jesus’ compassion for the needy, but primarily as a sign of the arrival of the kingdom of God as promised in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>This emphasis may be seen in the distinctively Lukan account of the commissioning of the 72 disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.1-12">Lk 10:1-12</a>), where Jesus instructs them to heal the sick in any city they enter and announce to the people there that the kingdom of God has come near to them (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.10.8-9">8-9</a>).</p>
<p>The first three Gospels take up the OT understanding of God as the healer of his people and see this as fulfilled in Jesus. This fulfillment signifies the presence of God’s reign in the ministry of Jesus and points to him as the one through whom God is at work in the midst of his people.</p>
<p>John’s Gospel has only four healing incidents: the official’s son (<a href="?bref=John.4.46-54">Jn 4:46-54</a>), the man ill for 38 years (<a href="?bref=John.5.1-18">5:1-18</a>), the man born blind (ch <a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">9</a>), and the climactic raising of Lazarus (<a href="?bref=John.11.1-44">11:1-44</a>). The special purpose and structure of this Gospel indicate that these incidents are carefully related to the accompanying discourses and are clearly intended as signs revealing the person of Jesus. The heightened emphasis on healings as revelatory signs in this Gospel confirms the similar intention in the first three Gospels.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HealingsDonebytheApostles">Healings Done by the Apostles</p>
<p class="fl">The Acts of the Apostles tells of the continuation of Jesus’ ministry through the Spirit at work in his disciples. The primary focus in Acts is on proclamation, as <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">1:8</a> indicates. However, the healing of the lame beggar in Jerusalem indicates that the disciples were able to exercise the power of healing in the name of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-16">3:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.8-16">4:8-16</a>). The healing is clearly intended to point to and glorify the person of Jesus and lead to faith in him (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.12-26">3:12-26</a>). The balanced, twofold ministry of the disciples may be seen in the prayer of <a href="?bref=Acts.4.29-30">4:29-30</a>: “O Lord, hear their threats, and give your servants great boldness in their preaching. Send your healing power; may miraculous signs and wonders be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The ministry of Philip in Samaria was devoted to proclaiming Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.5">Acts 8:5</a>) and healing the sick and those with unclean spirits (v <a href="?bref=Acts.8.7">7</a>). Peter heals Aeneas and raises Tabitha (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.34,40">9:34, 40</a>), and in each case the effects are that many believe in the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.9.35,42">35, 42</a>). Paul is also described as preaching the gospel (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.2-3">17:2-3</a>), healing (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.8-11">14:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.8">28:8</a>), casting out spirits (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.18">16:18</a>), and raising a dead man (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.9-10">20:9-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="HealingsintheChurchAge">Healings in the Church Age</p>
<p class="fl">The letters of the NT say little about healing. First Corinthians speaks of the gifts of healing (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.9,28">1 Cor 12:9, 28</a>). The implication is that such gifts are intended to be part of the ministry of the church, but the context indicates that not all are given such gifts (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.30">30</a>) and that it is God who sovereignly distributes gifts for the good of the body. James indicates that a believer who is ill should request the church to pray for his healing (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.14-16">Jas 5:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.12.13">Heb 12:13</a>). The clear implication is that God is willing and able to minister to his people for healing today.</p>

<p class="h1">HEART</p>
<p class="fl">Vital bodily organ; emotional center of one’s being.</p>
<p>In Hebrew and Greek, as in modern English, “heart” is used to designate a physical organ as well as the emotional center of one’s being. “Heart” (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">leb</span><span class="ital">;</span> Greek <span class="greek">kardia</span>) occurs approximately 1,000 times in the Bible, though it is often disguised in translation. The range of meaning is great.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PhysicalHeart">Physical Heart</p>
<p class="fl">That the beating heart indicates life seems implied in <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.37-39">1 Samuel 25:37-39</a> (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), despite the delay in Nabal’s death. Physical food and wine affect the heart (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.5">Jgs 19:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.15">Ps 104:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.17">Acts 14:17</a>), and the heart can “faint” and “tremble.” The heart’s position in the body yields an obvious metaphor for “the center” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.40">Mt 12:40</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PyschologicalHeart">Pyschological Heart</p>
<p class="fl">The heart attends intellectually (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.12.11">Jer 12:11</a>); it also perceives (<a href="?bref=John.12.40">Jn 12:40</a>), understands (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.9">1 Kgs 3:9</a>), debates (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.6">Mk 2:6</a>), reflects (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.19">Lk 2:19</a>), remembers (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.51">Lk 2:51</a>), thinks (<a href="?bref=Deut.8.17">Dt 8:17</a>), imagines (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.51">Lk 1:51</a>), is wise (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.17">Eccl 1:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), has technical skill (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.3">Ex 28:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), and much more.</p>
<p>Emotionally, the heart experiences intoxicated merriment (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.36">1 Sm 25:36</a>), gladness (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.29">Is 30:29</a>), joy (<a href="?bref=John.16.22">Jn 16:22</a>), sorrow (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.2">Neh 2:2</a>), anguish (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.2">Rom 9:2</a>), bitterness (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.10">Prv 14:10</a>), anxiety (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.13">1 Sm 4:13</a>), despair (<a href="?bref=Eccl.2.20">Eccl 2:20</a>), love (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.1">2 Sm 14:1</a>), trust (<a href="?bref=Ps.112.7">Ps 112:7</a>), affection (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.3">2 Cor 7:3</a>), lust (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.28">Mt 5:28</a>), callousness (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.5">Mk 3:5</a>), hatred (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.17">Lv 19:17</a>), fear (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.28">Gn 42:28</a>), jealousy (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.14">Jas 3:14</a>), desire (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.1">Rom 10:1</a>), discouragement (<a href="?bref=Num.32.9">Nm 32:9</a>), sympathy (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.9">Ex 23:9</a>), anger (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.6">Dt 19:6</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), irresolution (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.7">2 Chr 13:7</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), and much more.</p>
<p>Volitionally, the heart can purpose (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.5">1 Cor 4:5</a>), incline to (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.7">1 Sm 14:7</a>), prompt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.4">2 Kgs 12:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.4.23">Prv 4:23</a>), be steadfast (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.23">Acts 11:23</a>), be willing (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.22">Ex 35:22</a>), contrive evil (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.4">Acts 5:4</a>), or follow its “treasure” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.21">Mt 6:21</a>).</p>
<p>Morally, the heart can be gentle, lowly (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29">Mt 11:29</a>), holy (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.13">1 Thes 3:13</a>), faithful (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.8">Neh 9:8</a>), upright (<a href="?bref=Ps.97.11">Ps 97:11</a>), pure, single-minded (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.8">Jas 4:8</a>), clean (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.8">Acts 15:8</a>), loving toward God (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.30">Mk 12:30</a>) and others (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.22">1 Pt 1:22</a>), hardened, or sensitive (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.19">Ez 11:19</a>). Scripture’s emphasis falls upon the heart’s evil (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.5">Gn 6:5</a> and throughout), as self-deceiving (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.26">Jas 1:26</a>), deceitful (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.9">Jer 17:9</a>), avaricious (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.19-21">Mt 6:19-21</a>), lustful (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.28">Mt 5:28</a>), arrogant (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.9">Is 9:9</a>), impious (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.51">Acts 7:51</a>), perverse (<a href="?bref=Ps.101.4">Ps 101:4</a>), and impenitent (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.5">Rom 2:5</a>). Nothing defiles a man worse than his own heart (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.18-19">Mk 7:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>Yet out of the heart can come good (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.45">Lk 6:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.15">8:15</a>). Even when frustrated by circumstances or by fear, the heart’s good intention remains good; its evil intent, bad (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.18">1 Kgs 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.28">Mt 5:28</a>).</p>
<p>Being so complex, a person’s heart is sadly divided, and Scripture often extols a perfect, whole, true (i.e., united) heart (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.5">Gn 20:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.11">Ps 86:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.37">Acts 8:37</a>). The “heart” signifies the total inner self, a person’s hidden core of being (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.4">1 Pt 3:4</a>), with which one communes, which one “pours out” in prayer, words, and deeds (<a href="?bref=Ps.62.8">Ps 62:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.18-19">Mt 15:18-19</a>). It is the genuine self, distinguished from appearance, public position, and physical presence (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.7">1 Sm 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.12">2 Cor 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.17">1 Thes 2:17</a>). And this “heart-self” has its own nature, character, and disposition (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.16">Dn 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.4">7:4</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.12.33-37">Mt 12:33-37</a>).</p>

The mystery of the hidden self is fully known to God and to Christ (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.10">Jer 17:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.47">Lk 9:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.27">Rom 8:27</a>), and the heart is the seat of our knowledge of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.6">2 Cor 4:6</a>). The state of heart governs the vision of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.8">Mt 5:8</a>); from the heart one speaks to God (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.8">Ps 27:8</a>); the heart is the locus of divine indwelling (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6">Gal 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.17">Eph 3:17</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, moral evil in the heart is seen in biblical perspective as sin against God. Senseless hearts are darkened, often secretly idolatrous, far from God, “not right” before God (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.18-19">Dt 29:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.8">Mt 15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.21">Acts 8:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.21">Rom 1:21</a>). Yet the Lord will not despise a broken, contrite heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.17">Ps 51:17</a>). When one’s heart is turned toward God, he promises to make it sensitive to divine things, renewed and purified (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.29">Dt 4:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.25">2 Kgs 23:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.10">Ps 51:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.13">Jl 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25-27">Ez 36:25-27</a>). God’s law shall then be written on the heart as the inward guide and incentive (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.33">Jer 31:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.10">Heb 8:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.2-3">2 Cor 3:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>In Christian terms, such transformation involves believing the gospel from the “honest and good heart” that provides fruitful soil for the Word of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.15">Lk 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.9">Rom 10:9</a>). The true heart draws near to God, loves him with all its intellect, feeling, and will (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.27">Lk 10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.22">Heb 10:22</a>). Then God gives strength, reward, renewal, grace, peace, and joy to the heart (<a href="?bref=Ps.73.26">Ps 73:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.57.15">Is 57:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.7">Phil 4:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.9">Heb 13:9</a>). So the ancient ideal becomes possible again, that of being “a man after God’s own heart” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.14">1 Sm 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.22">Acts 13:22</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">HEAVEN</p>
<p class="fl">Realm (or realms) designated by a Hebrew term used to represent the sky and air and also heaven. The form of the word in Hebrew is dual (implying two of something). Although this dual form may only represent an ancient device for expressing the plural, it is supposed by some to imply the existence of a lower and an upper heaven—a physical and a spiritual heaven.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The OT writers viewed the physical heavens as a “firmament” appearing as a great arch supported on foundations and pillars (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.8">2 Sm 22:8</a>) and spread out above the earth, with rain descending through its doors (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.23">Ps 78:23</a>). The keynote of the OT revelation about the physical heavens is set forth in <a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Psalms 8</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">19:1-6</a>. Elsewhere the OT speaks of the atmospheric heavens as the region of the clouds (<a href="?bref=Ps.147.8">Ps 147:8</a>), winds (<a href="?bref=Zech.2.6">Zec 2:6</a>), rain (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.11">Dt 11:11</a>), thunder (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.10">1 Sm 2:10</a>), dew (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.13">Dt 33:13</a>), frost (<a href="?bref=Job.38.29">Jb 38:29</a>), and the abode of birds (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26,30">Gn 1:26, 30</a>). It is also the locale of such destructive forces as hail (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.11">Jos 10:11</a>), fire, and brimstone (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.24">Gn 19:24</a>). In the NT this notion of the vaulted expanse of the sky as the region in which the elements, clouds, and tempests gather (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.2">Mt 16:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.25">Lk 4:25</a>) and birds fly (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.58">Lk 9:58</a>) is continued.</p>
<p>In addition to the atmospheric regions, the Hebrew idea of the physical heavens includes stellar space, which ultimately embraces the universe. The heavenly bodies of the stellar heavens were viewed by the Hebrews as inexpressibly glorious manifestations of God’s handiwork without having any power or vitality of their own. These include the sun, moon, planets, and stars, which were but lights in the firmament of the heavens (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.14">Gn 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.5">15:5</a>). As such, they were regarded as unworthy of worship because God had, by his own will and grace, made humans superior to them. In fact, the Hebrews were expressly forbidden to worship the stellar bodies (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4">Ex 20:4</a>), the gods and goddesses who represented them (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.17-25">Jer 44:17-25</a>), or to participate in astrological speculation (<a href="?bref=Isa.47.13">Is 47:13</a>). Hence, this unique theological ordinance differentiated the Hebrews, who viewed the heavenly bodies as made and moved by the will of God, from the superstitious heathen, who worshiped them.</p>
<p>The term “heaven of heavens” (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.14">Dt 10:14</a>; see also <span class="sc">kjv</span> <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.33">Pss 68:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.148.4">148:4</a>) is the literal English rendition of the Hebrew idiom for the superlative “the highest heaven.” Some have thought this the counterpart to Paul’s expression “the third heaven” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.2">2 Cor 12:2</a>), which parallels the classical Greek conception of three heavens. This notion was subsequently adopted by the Roman Catholic medieval church and in the Latin form of <span class="ital">Coelum Aqueum, Coelum Sidereum,</span> and <span class="ital">Coelum Empyreum.</span> The basic concept followed the Greek view, and it coincides with the OT view of the physical and spiritual heavens as indicated earlier. Those who follow this approach tend to regard this third heaven as the place reached by the souls of the blessed as they pass through the two lower regions of the atmosphere and outer space containing the celestial bodies, and enter into the uttermost reaches of the universe.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The Lord Jesus indicated that heaven is the dwelling place of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.9">Mt 6:9</a>). Jesus, during his earthly ministry, repeatedly claimed that he had come from heaven (<a href="?bref=John.3.13">Jn 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.33-51">6:33-51</a>); and on at least three occasions utterances from heaven confirmed these claims (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.16-17">Mt 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.5">17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.28">Jn 12:28</a>). There is where the true tabernacle stands, of which the earthly tabernacle was merely a shadow (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.8.1-5">Heb 8:1-5</a>). That abode of God was in view when the apostle Paul wrote of “the third heaven” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.2">2 Cor 12:2</a>). As such, it is often seen as a synonym for God himself (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.23.22">Mt 23:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.18">Lk 15:18</a>).</p>
<p>After Jesus’ ascension, recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6-11">Acts 1:6-11</a>, two angels reminded the disciples that Jesus would return again from heaven. This was later confirmed by the apostle Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-11">1 Cor 15:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.7-16">Eph 4:7-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Tm 3:16</a>) and reiterated in the summary of the teachings of the NT known as the Apostles’ Creed. In all, the relationship of Jesus Christ to the heavenly abode of God is inextricably interwoven in the NT and is inseparable from the gospel message itself. Indeed, it is from the “right hand of God” that Christ forever lives to make intercession for those who have come to him by faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.25">Heb 7:25</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mk 14:62</a>).</p>
<p>Paul asserts that the believer’s body will be made conformable to the glorious body of Jesus Christ when Christ returns from heaven (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.20-21">Phil 3:20-21</a>). The believers need such a heavenly body to match their heavenly citizenship. The term “citizenship” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “commonwealth” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) implies a colony of individuals who live in a foreign country while observing the laws of their homeland instead of the land in which they reside (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.22.28">Acts 22:28</a>). The implication for believers is quite clear: They are to live according to the moral and ethical principles of God as revealed from heaven regardless of the standards proclaimed by the world. They have been raised together with Christ and have been instructed to “seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.1">Col 3:1</a>). From there Christ has blessed his followers “with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">Eph 1:3</a>). The expression “in the heavenly places” is peculiar to Ephesians (see <a href="?bref=Eph.1.3,20">1:3, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.6">2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.10">3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">6:12</a>), suggesting that the blessings of the spiritual world are not relegated to some remote future time or place but can be perceived by faith here and now. That is why believers are said to have been made partakers already in the heavenly calling (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.1">Heb 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.4">6:4</a>).</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, believers look forward to a new heaven and a new earth with the new Jerusalem. There will be no tears, sorrow, pain, death, and night there because the Son of God will be there (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-4,27">Rv 21:1-4, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-5">22:1-5</a>), and in the resurrected state there will be no marrying or giving in marriage (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.27-38">Lk 20:27-38</a>). At least two OT saints, Enoch (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.22-24">Gn 5:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.5">Heb 11:5</a>) and Elijah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.11">2 Kgs 2:11</a>), were translated directly into the presence of God—into heaven. In addition to Paul’s statement about the third heaven, John was called into heaven (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1">Rv 4:1</a>), a heaven that is intended to be populated (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1">19:1</a>). All believers will ultimately dwell in heaven in their resurrection bodies, which they will receive when the Lord comes for them from heaven (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.16-17">1 Thes 4:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-4">Rv 19:1-4</a>). The Lord will also give treasures and rewards at that time (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.12">Mt 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.25">1 Cor 9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1">2 Cor 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.8">2 Tm 4:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">Jas 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.4">1 Pt 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.4">5:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">Rv 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.4.10">4:10</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">HEAVENLIES*, The</p>
<p class="fl">Term unique to Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians, also translated “heavenly places” or “realms,” and referring to the super earthly upper regions of the air. Since the term “in the heavenlies” carried with it associations from pagan cultic vocabulary, it was perhaps used by the apostle in an apologetic manner.</p>
<p>“The heavenly places” indicates the sphere where the risen Christ has been seated at the right hand of God in a position of authority, power, and dominion, reigning as conqueror and ruler high above the heavenly world (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.20-21">Eph 1:20-21</a>). Other usage points to the idea of the realized hope of those who are in Christ, in that believers have already been blessed with “every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies” (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">3</a>) and are raised with Christ, seated with him in the heavenlies (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.6">2:6</a>). The church will make known the wisdom of God to the principalities and powers in the heavenlies (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.10">3:10</a>). She will thus participate in the victory over the spiritual hosts of wickedness, also present in the heavenly places (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">6:12</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="OriginandHistory">Origin and History</p>
<p class="fl">In the Middle Ages a common view was that Hebrew was the primitive language of humankind. Even in colonial America, Hebrew was still referred to as “the mother of all languages.” Linguistic scholarship has now made this theory untenable.</p>
<p>Hebrew is actually one of several Canaanite dialects that included Phoenician, Ugaritic, and Moabite. Other Canaanite dialects (for example, Ammonite) existed but have left insufficient inscriptions for scholarly investigation. Such dialects were already present in the land of Canaan before its conquest by the Israelites.</p>
<p>Until about 1974, the oldest witnesses to Canaanite language were found in the Ugarit and Amarna records dating from the 14th and 15th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. A few Canaanite words and expressions appeared in earlier Egyptian records, but the origin of Canaanite has been uncertain. Between 1974 and 1976, however, nearly 17,000 tablets were dug up at Tell Mardikh (ancient Ebla) in northern Syria, written in a previously unknown Semitic dialect. Because they possibly date back to 2400 <span class="era">BC</span> (perhaps even earlier), many scholars think that language may be the “Old Canaanite” that gave rise to Hebrew. By 1977, when another 1,000 tablets were unearthed, only about 100 inscriptions from Ebla had been reported on. Languages change over a long period of time. For example, the English used in the time of Alfred the Great (ninth century <span class="era">AD</span>) seems almost like a foreign language to contemporary English speakers. Although Hebrew was no exception to the general principle, like other Semitic languages it remained remarkably stable over many centuries. Poems such as the Song of Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Jgs 5</a>) tended to preserve the language’s oldest form. Changes that took place later in the long history of the language are shown in the presence of archaic words (often preserved in poetic language) and a general difference in style. For example, the book of Job reflects a more archaic style than the book of Esther.</p>
<p>Various Hebrew dialects apparently existed side by side in OT times, as reflected in the episode involving the pronunciation of the Hebrew word “shibboleth/sibboleth” (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.4-6">Jgs 12:4-6</a>). It seems that the Israelites east of the Jordan pronounced the initial letter with a strong “sh” sound, while those in Canaan gave it the simple “s” sound. Scholars have also identified features of Hebrew that could be described as reflecting the northern or southern parts of the country.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FamilyofLanguages">Family of Languages</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew belongs to the Semitic family of languages; these languages were used from the Mediterranean Sea to the mountains east of the Euphrates River valley, and from Armenia (Turkey) in the north to the southern extremity of the Arabian peninsula. Semitic languages are classified as Southern (Arabic and Ethiopic), Eastern (Akkadian), and Northwestern (Aramaic, Syriac, and Canaanite—Hebrew, Phoenician, Ugaritic, and Moabite).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Character">Character</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew, like the other early Semitic languages, concentrates on observation more than reflection. That is, things are generally observed according to their appearance as phenomena, not analyzed as to their inward being or essence. Effects are observed but not traced through a series of causes.</p>
<p>Hebrew’s vividness, conciseness, and simplicity make the language difficult to translate fully. It is amazingly concise and direct. For example, <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1-6">Psalm 23</a> contains 55 words; most translations require about twice that many to translate it. The first two lines, with slashes separating the individual Hebrew words in the original, read:</p>
<p class="poetry-1-sp">The Lord/[is] my shepherd/</p>
<p class="poetry-3">I shall want/not</p>
<p class="fl">Thus eight English words are required to translate four Hebrew words.</p>
<p>Hebrew does not use separate, distinct expressions for every shade of thought. Someone has said, “The Semites have been the quarries whose great rough blocks the Greeks have trimmed, polished, and fitted together. The former gave religion; the latter philosophy.”</p>
<p>Hebrew is a pictorial language in which the past is not merely described but verbally painted. Not just a landscape is presented but a moving panorama. The course of events is reenacted in the mind’s sight. (Note the frequent use of “behold,” a Hebraism carried over to the NT.) Such common Hebraic expressions as “he arose and went,” “he opened his lips and spoke,” “he lifted up his eyes and saw,” and “he lifted up his voice and wept” illustrate the pictorial strength of the language.</p>
<p>Many profound theological expressions of the OT are tightly bound up with Hebrew language and grammar. Even the most sacred name of God himself, “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (Yahweh), is directly related to the Hebrew verb “to be” (or perhaps “to cause to be”). Many other names of persons and places in the OT can best be understood only with a working knowledge of Hebrew.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HebrewScriptandGrammar">Hebrew Script and Grammar</p>
<p class="h3">Alphabet and Script</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew alphabet consists of 22 consonants; signs for vowels were devised and added late in the language’s history. The origin of the alphabet is unknown. The oldest examples of a Canaanite alphabet were preserved in the Ugaritic cuneiform alphabet of the 14th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The old style of writing the letters is called the Phoenician or paleo-Hebrew script. It is the predecessor of the Greek and other Western alphabets. The script used in modern Hebrew Bibles (Aramaic or square script) came into vogue after Israel’s exile into Babylon (sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>). The older style was still used sporadically in the early Christian era on coins and for writing God’s name (as in the Dead Sea Scrolls). Hebrew has always been written right to left.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TheHebrewAlphabet"/>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheHebrewAlphabet"/>
<p class="h3">Consonants</p>
<p class="fl">The Canaanite alphabet of the Phoenician and Moabite languages had 22 consonants. The older Canaanite language reflected in Ugaritic had more consonants. Arabic also preserves some Old Canaanite consonants found in Ugaritic but missing in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="h3">Vowels</p>
<p class="fl">In the original consonantal Hebrew script, vowels were simply understood by the writer or reader. On the basis of tradition and context, the reader would supply whatever vowels were needed, much as is done in English abbreviations (“bldg.” for “building”; “blvd.” for “boulevard”). After the collapse of the nation in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the dispersion of the Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem led to Hebrew’s becoming a “dead language,” no longer widely spoken. Loss of traditional pronunciation and understanding then became more of a possibility, so Jewish scribes felt a need for permanently establishing the vowel sounds.</p>
<p>First, vowel letters called “mothers of reading” <span class="ital">(matres lectionis)</span> were added. These were consonants used especially to indicate long vowels. These were added before the Christian era, as the Dead Sea Scrolls reveal.</p>
<p>Later (about the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>), the scribes called Masoretes added vowel signs to indicate short vowels. At least three different systems of vowel signs were employed at different times and places. The text used today represents the system devised by Masoretic scribes who worked in the city of Tiberias. The vowels, each of which may be long or short, are indicated by dots or dashes placed above or below the consonants. Certain combinations of dots and dashes represent very short vowel sounds, or “half-vowels.”</p>
<p class="h3">Linkage</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew joins together many words that in Western languages would be written separately. Some prepositions (<span class="hebrew">be</span>-, “in”; <span class="hebrew">le</span>-, “to”; <span class="hebrew">ke</span>-, “like”) are prefixed directly to the noun or verb that they introduce, as are the definite article <span class="hebrew">ha</span>-, “the” and the conjunction <span class="hebrew">wa</span>-, “and.” Suffixes are used for pronouns, either in the possessive or accusative relationship. The same word may simultaneously have both a prefix and a suffix.</p>
<p class="h3">Nouns</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew has no neuter gender; everything is masculine or feminine. Inanimate objects may be either masculine or feminine, depending on the formation or character of the word. Usually, abstract ideas or words indicating a group are feminine. Nouns are derived from roots and are formed in various ways, either by vowel modification or by adding prefixes or suffixes to the root. Contrary to Greek and many Western languages, compound nouns are not characteristic of Hebrew.</p>
<p>The Hebrew plural is formed by adding -<span class="hebrew">im</span> for masculine nouns <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">seraphim, cherubim</span><span class="ital">)</span> and -<span class="hebrew">oth</span> for feminine nouns.</p>
<p>Three original case endings indicating nominative, genitive, and accusative have dropped away during the evolution of Hebrew. To compensate for the lack of case endings, Hebrew resorts to various indicators. Indirect objects are indicated by the preposition <span class="hebrew">le</span>-, “to”; direct objects by the objective sign <span class="hebrew">’eth</span><span class="ital">;</span> the genitive relationship by putting the word before the genitive in the “construct state,” or shortened form.</p>
<p class="h3">Adjectives</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew is deficient in adjectives. “A double heart” is indicated in the original Hebrew by “a heart and a heart” (<a href="?bref=Ps.12.2">Ps 12:2</a>), and “two differing weights” is actually “a stone and a stone” (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.13">Dt 25:13</a>); “the whole royal family” is “the seed of the kingdom” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1">2 Kgs 11:1</a>).</p>
<p>Adjectives that do exist in Hebrew have no comparative or superlative forms. Relationship is indicated by the preposition “from.” “Better than you” is expressed literally in Hebrew “good from you.” “The serpent was more subtle than any other beast” is literally “the serpent was subtle from every beast” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1">Gn 3:1</a>). The superlative is expressed by several different constructions. The idea “very deep” is literally “deep, deep” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.7.24">Eccl 7:24</a>); the “best song” is literally “song of songs” (compare “king of kings”); “holiest” is literally “holy, holy, holy” (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Is 6:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Verbs</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew verbs are formed from a root usually consisting of three letters. From such roots, verbal forms are developed by a change of vowels or by adding prefixes or suffixes. The root consonants provide the semantic backbone of the language and give a stability of meaning not characteristic of Western languages. The vowels are quite flexible, giving Hebrew considerable elasticity.</p>
<p>Hebrew verb usage is not characterized by precise definition of tenses. Hebrew tenses, especially in poetry, are largely determined by context. The two tense formations are the perfect (completed action) and imperfect (incomplete action). The imperfect is ambiguous. It represents the indicative mood (present, past, future) but may also represent such moods as the imperative, optative, and jussive or cohortative. A distinctive usage of the perfect tense is the “prophetic perfect,” where the perfect form represents a future event considered so sure that it is expressed as past (e.g., see <a href="?bref=Isa.5.13">Is 5:13</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Style">Style</p>
<p class="h3">Vocabulary</p>
<p class="fl">Most Hebrew roots originally expressed some physical action or denoted some natural object. The verb “to decide” originally meant “to cut”; “to be true” originally meant “to be firmly fixed”; “to be right” meant “to be straight”; “to be honorable” meant “to be heavy.”</p>
<p>Abstract terms are alien to the character of Hebrew; for example, biblical Hebrew has no specific words for “theology,” “philosophy,” or “religion.” Intellectual or theological concepts are expressed by concrete terms. The abstract idea of sin is represented by such words as “to miss the mark” or “crooked” or “rebellion” or “trespass” (“to cross over”). Mind or intellect is expressed by “heart” or “kidneys,” and emotion or compassion by “bowels” (see <a href="?bref=Isa.63.15">Is 63:15</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Other concrete terms in Hebrew are “horn” for strength or vigor, “bones” for self, and “seed” for descendants. A mental quality is often depicted by the part of the body thought of as its most appropriate embodiment. Strength can be represented by “arm” or “hand,” anger by “nostril,” displeasure by “falling face,” acceptance by “shining face,” thinking by “say.”</p>
<p>Some translators have attempted to represent a Hebrew word always by the same English word, but that leads to serious problems. Sometimes there is considerable disagreement on the exact shade of meaning of a Hebrew word in a given passage. A single root frequently represents a variety of meanings, depending on usage and context. The word for “bless” can also mean “curse, greet, favor, praise.” The word for “judgment” is used also for “justice, verdict, penalty, ordinance, duty, custom, manner.” The word for “strength” or “power” also means “army, virtue, worth, courage.”</p>
<p>Further ambiguity arises from the fact that some Hebrew consonants stand for two different original consonants that have merged in the evolution of the language. Two words that on the surface appear to be identical may be traced back to two different roots. For an example of this phenomenon in English, compare “bass” (a fish) with “bass” (a vocalist).</p>
<p class="h3">Syntax</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew syntax is relatively uncomplicated. Few subordinating conjunctions (“if,” “when,” “because,” etc.) are used; sentences are usually coordinated by using the simple conjunction “and.” English translations of biblical texts generally try to show the logical connection between successive sentences, even though it is not always clear. In <a href="?bref=Gen.1.2-3.1">Genesis 1:2–3:1</a>, all but three of the 56 verses begin with “and,” yet the <span class="sc">nlt</span> translates that conjunction variously as “then” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.3">1:3</a>), “so” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.27">27</a>), “so” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.1">2:1</a>), and “instead” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.2.6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Hebrew style is enlivened by use of direct discourse. The narrator does not simply state that “such and such a person said that . . .” (indirect discourse). Instead, the parties speak for themselves (direct discourse), creating a freshness that remains even after repeated reading.</p>
<p class="h3">Poetry</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew poetry uses a variety of rhetorical devices. Some of them—such as assonance, alliteration, and acrostics—can be appreciated only in the original Hebrew. But parallelism, the most important characteristic of Hebrew poetry, is evident even in English translation. Among the many forms of parallelism possible, four common categories exist: (1) synonymous, a repeating style in which parallel lines say the same thing in different words; (2) antithetic, a contrasting style in which contrary thoughts are expressed; (3) completive, with a completing parallel line filling out the thought of the first; (4) climactic, in which an ascending parallel line picks up something from the first line and repeats it. Numerous other forms of parallelism enrich Hebrew poetry. The possible varations of parallelism are almost endless.</p>
<p class="h3">Figures of Speech</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew abounds in expressive figures of speech based on the Hebrew people’s character and way of life. Certain odd but well-known expressions found in English literature come from the Hebrew style, like “apple of his eye” (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.10">Dt 32:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.17.8">Ps 17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.7.2">Prv 7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.8">Zec 2:8</a>) and “skin of my teeth” (<a href="?bref=Job.19.20">Job 19:20</a>). Some of the more striking Hebrew modes of expression are hard to transfer into English, such as “to uncover the ear,” meaning “to disclose, reveal.” Others are more familiar, like “to stiffen the neck” for “to be stubborn, rebellious”; “to bend or incline the ear” for “to listen closely.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Legacy">Legacy</p>
<p class="fl">English and a number of other modern languages have been enriched by Hebrew. English even contains a number of Hebrew “loan words.” Some of these have had wide influence (“amen,” “hallelujah,” “jubilee”). Many Hebrew proper nouns are used in modern languages for persons and places, such as David, Jonathan/John, Miriam/Mary, Bethlehem (the name of several towns and cities in the United States).</p>
<p>Many common Hebrew expressions have been unconsciously accepted into English figures of speech, as in “mouth of the cave” and “face of the earth.” Some figures, such as “east of Eden,” have been used as titles for books and films.</p>

  <title>Hebrews, Letter to the</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HEBREWS, Letter to the</p>
<p class="fl">One of the most profound and enigmatic books in the NT. The identity of its author, the time of its writing, and the people and place to which it was sent are all shrouded in mystery. Yet, in spite of the uncertainty, Hebrews remains one of the most timely and relevant books in the Bible. Some 300 years ago John Owen, the English Puritan, appropriately remarked: “No doubt the Epistle next in importance to Romans is this to the Hebrews.” The letter is both doctrinal and practical, theological and pastoral. In short, it builds a compelling case for the superiority of Christianity. Hebrews also reflects the impassioned concern of a pastor’s heart. Those who have experienced God’s ultimate work of grace in Christ are urged to hold fast to God’s final word of revelation in his Son.</p>
<p>Unlike most other NT epistles, Hebrews does not begin like a letter. There is no introductory salutation, the writer is not identified, and no mention is made of those to whom the document is addressed. The author characterizes the work as a “word of exhortation” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.22">13:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), which suggests a sermon or oral homily (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.13.15">Acts 13:15</a>). Nonetheless, its conclusion is that of a conventional letter (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.22-25">Heb 13:22-25</a>). Some have detected a gradual transition in the document from an essay to a more specifically epistolary form (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.2.1">2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.22-25">13:22-25</a>). The evidence thus suggests that the author may have cast the original homiletic “word of exhortation” into letter form when the need to communicate in writing with his Christian friends became urgent.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Who wrote the book is not directly stated in the letter. Since the late second century, various authorities have linked the document with the apostle Paul. Clement of Alexandria (d. 220) theorized that Paul wrote the letter in Hebrew for Jews and that Luke translated it into Greek. However, this suggestion has not been widely received by modern scholars. Clement’s pupil Origen (d. 254) stated more generally that the thoughts of the letter are Pauline but that the style is unlike that of the known writings of the apostle. Other early authorities, such as Jerome (d. 419) and Augustine (d. 430), persuaded that canonicity demanded apostolic authorship, likewise affirmed that Paul was the author.</p>
<p>Yet a number of factors argue against the Pauline authorship of Hebrews. The anonymity of the letter is contrary to the consistent pattern of Paul’s introduction in the opening salutation of his letters. Moreover, <a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">Hebrews 2:3</a> indicates the writer was discipled by eyewitnesses of the Lord. Yet Paul insists that his knowledge of Christ was gained from a firsthand encounter with the risen Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.1.12">Gal 1:12</a>). F. F. Bruce evaluates the authorship of Hebrews as follows: “We may say with certainty that the thought of the epistle is not Paul’s, the language is not Paul’s, and the technique of OT quotations is not Paul’s.”</p>
<p>Early Christian tradition suggests that Barnabas may have written Hebrews. According to Tertullian (d. 220), many early authorities believed that Barnabas was responsible for the letter. <a href="?bref=Acts.4.36">Acts 4:36</a> (<span class="sc">asv</span>) speaks of him as a “son of exhortation” (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.13.22">Heb 13:22</a>). Furthermore, as a Levite, Barnabas would have been familiar with the Jewish sacrificial ritual so prominent in the letter.</p>
<p>Luther was the first to suggest that Hebrews may have been penned by Apollos, “an excellent man of learning, who had been a disciple of the apostles and learned much from them, and who was very well versed in Scripture.” As a native of Alexandria (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24">Acts 18:24</a>), Apollos would have been familiar with the typological interpretation evident in Hebrews. Clearly Apollos was the sort of man who was qualified to write Hebrews.</p>
<p>Other names have been suggested as possible authors. Calvin surmised that either Luke or Clement of Rome was responsible for the letter. It is noted that the Greek of Hebrews resembles the language and style of the third Gospel and Acts. Others theorize that Hebrews may have been written by Silas, a Jewish Christian from Jerusalem who would have been thoroughly familiar with the Levitical ritual. Silas is described as one of “the church leaders” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.22">Acts 15:22</a>). He was a coworker with Paul in the gentile mission, and apparently was known in Rome as well as in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.12-13">1 Pt 5:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is probable that the author of Hebrews was a second-generation Jewish Christian, a master of classical Greek whose Bible was the Septuagint, conversant with first-century Alexandrian philosophy, and a creative apologist for the Christian faith. As to the identity of that author, we can affirm no more than Origen in the third century: “But as to who actually wrote the Letter, God alone knows.”</p>

<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The very early title of the letter, “To Hebrews,” suggests that the book concerns Jewish Christians living in the Dispersion. The letter itself offers a few hints of the historical circumstances surrounding its composition. Not long after becoming Christians, the readers of the letter were exposed to severe persecution (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.32-36">Heb 10:32-36</a>). During their trial, the new believers endured imprisonment, confiscation of personal property, and public ridicule. Yet the persecution had not been fatal; they had not yet been called upon to lay down their lives in martyrdom (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.4">12:4</a>). Amid the excitement of their newfound faith in Christ, they had demonstrated practical concern and love by ministering to fellow believers in need (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.10">6:10</a>) and comforting others who had been harassed for their faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.34">10:34</a>).</p>
<p>But since the time of those earlier trials, the readers had made little progress in Christian maturity (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.11-13">5:11-13</a>). Moreover, in the face of a new wave of persecution, and despondent over an apparent delay in the Lord’s coming, the believers had begun to waver and abandon hope. Indeed, they threatened to renounce Jesus Christ and to revert back to the security of the Jewish religion that enjoyed the protection of Roman law.</p>
<p>Thus we read that because of the strange, new teachings of certain Judaizers who sought to draw them back to their former religion (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.9">13:9</a>), the wavering believers had neglected to assemble together (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.25">10:25</a>) and had lost confidence in their spiritual leaders (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.17">13:17</a>). Faced with the possibility that these Jewish Christians might abandon their faith altogether, the writer sternly warns them of the tragic consequences of renouncing the Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-6">6:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.26-31">10:26-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.12-19">13:12-19</a>) and urges them to renew their commitment to Christ, God’s foremost and final revelation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Lacking firm information as to the author and recipients of the letter, no certainty exists as to the date of the writing. We have noted that the author of Hebrews, and probably his readers as well, had been discipled by those who were personally acquainted with Jesus (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">2:3</a>). Further evidence in the letter suggests that Paul probably was not alive. Timothy, Paul’s younger associate, was still living (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.23">13:23</a>).</p>
<p>The absence of any mention in Hebrews of the destruction of the Jerusalem temple is significant for dating the letter. In terms of his argument that the old covenant had passed away and the legal priesthood had been superseded, the writer would scarcely have omitted mention of the temple’s destruction had he written the letter later than <span class="era">AD</span> 70. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.6-10">Hebrews 9:6-10</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.10.1-4,11-14">10:1-4, 11-14</a> plainly suggest that the Jewish sacrifices were still being offered. Hence, it may be supposed with some degree of certainty that the letter was written prior to <span class="era">AD</span> 70. If it was written after Paul’s death, that would put it after <span class="era">AD</span> 67, the traditional date of his execution. Thus, Hebrews may have been written in the period <span class="era">AD</span> 67–70.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginandDestination">Origin and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">The place from which Hebrews was written is also uncertain. Some manuscripts of the letter bear the subscription “written from Rome” or “written from Italy.” Such notations are educated deductions drawn from the statement “The Christians from Italy send you their greetings” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.24">13:24</a>). Most probably this indicates that the writer is extending greetings to a church in Italy on behalf of Italian Christians associated with him in another land, possibly Asia. Nevertheless, we cannot locate the point of origin with any certainty.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the letter was written to a group of Jewish converts to Christianity. Yet the precise community to which it was sent is a matter of debate. Opinions vary from Judea to Spain. Tradition has it that Hebrews was directed to Jewish Christians living in Palestine. But against a Palestinian destination it may be argued: (1) the readers had had no personal contact with Jesus (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">2:3</a>), an unlikely event for mid-first-century residents of Palestine; (2) the statement in <a href="?bref=Heb.12.4">12:4</a> that his readers had not yet given their lives could hardly be said of Palestinian Christians of the period; (3) the generosity of the believers (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.34">10:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.16">13:16</a>) was inconsistent with the poverty of the Jerusalem church; and (4) the general tone of the letter is Hellenistic rather than rabbinical.</p>
<p>Other proposals for the destination of Hebrews include (1) Caesarea, on the supposition of Lukan authorship; (2) Syrian Antioch or Cyprus, assuming Barnabas wrote the letter; (3) Ephesus, in the light of the conversion of many Jews during Paul’s ministry in that city; (4) Colosse, noting certain similarities between the Colossian heresy and the false beliefs of the “Hebrews”; and (5) Alexandria, because of the apparent influence of the philosopher Philo Judaeus in the letter.</p>
<p>The thesis that Hebrews was directed to a group of Jewish Christians in Rome has found favor with a number of scholars. Arguments in support of a Roman destination include the following facts: (1) The letter was first known in Rome no later than <span class="era">AD</span> 96. (2) <a href="?bref=Rom.11.13,18">Romans 11:13, 18</a> suggests that the church at Rome consisted of a Jewish-Christian minority. (3) References to persecution and suffering endured by the readers (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.32-33">Heb 10:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.4">12:4</a>) are consistent with known repressive measures exacted by the Roman authorities. (4) There is a good possibility that saints who “come from Italy” would convey greetings to their brethren in Rome. (5) The Jewish community in Rome preserved certain features of nonconformist or sectarian Judaism that would explain several notable similarities between the theology and praxis of the Qumran community and that expressed in Hebrews.</p>
<p>It is likely that the letter was addressed to a small subgroup within a local church. The exhortation in <a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">5:12</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>)—“by this time you ought to be teachers”—hardly would have been relevant to an entire congregation. <a href="?bref=Heb.13.7,24">Hebrews 13:7, 24</a> lends further support to the theory that the letter was sent to a small group, perhaps to a “house church” within a larger assembly.</p>
<p>Tentatively, one might conclude that the addressees were converts from Judaism who dwelt in the Dispersion. Hence they were familiar with OT Judaism and were acquainted with the religious philosophy of the Greek world. Possibly the readers comprised a house fellowship that tended to disassociate itself from the parent group (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.25">10:25</a>). The existence of such house churches in Rome is confirmed by <a href="?bref=Rom.16.5,14-15">Romans 16:5, 14-15</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">In response to the threat that his Jewish-Christian friends might renounce Christianity and revert to Judaism, the writer by a “word of exhortation” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.22">13:22</a>) communicated to them the finality of the Christian revelation. He sought also to inform his despondent, vacillating readers that Christ, the object of God’s final revelation, is vastly superior to the greatest of Judaism’s heroes. The author, in addition, affirmed the heavenly and eternal character of the salvation secured by Christ. Whereas the legal sacrificial system was powerless to effect the remission of sin, Christ the eternal High Priest “is able, once and forever, to save everyone who comes to God through him” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.25">7:25</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>In short, the writer commended to his readers the need for patient endurance amid the persecution and sufferings to which the heirs of eternal salvation are inevitably exposed. Just as Jesus, the forerunner of our faith, suffered and patiently endured in anticipation of eternal reward, so ought harassed, oppressed believers “take a new grip with your tired hands and stand firm on your shaky legs” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.12">12:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>) in anticipation of their reception in that eternal “kingdom that cannot be destroyed” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.28">12:28</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The author’s final purpose for writing was to proclaim the fearful judgment that awaits those who repudiate Jesus Christ. Since “our God is a consuming fire” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.29">12:29</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), “what makes us think that we can escape if we are indifferent to this great salvation” (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">2:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>)?</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">Next to Romans, Hebrews is the most doctrinal book in the NT. The writer develops a series of weighty arguments to demonstrate the superiority of the gospel of Christ to the religion of Judaism. Since Jesus is final both as to his person and his work, Christianity is the ultimate and normative faith. The book’s particularism runs counter to the spirit of the modern world.</p>
<p class="h3">The Superiority of the Son to Former Revelation (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-4">1:1-4</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The writer acknowledges that God revealed himself to the prophets of old in many ways—through dreams, visions, audible speech, and mighty acts. But “in these last days” (the advent of the end times, cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.26">9:26</a>) God spoke finally and definitively through his own Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">1:2</a>). Central to the argument is the fact that in one way or another the prophets received an eternal word from God. Yet given the intimate relation of the Son to the Father, God’s latest revelation has come forth from the very depths of his own being.</p>
<p>Identification of the Son as the pinnacle of divine revelation leads to a concise but profound statement of Christ’s person and his cosmic work. The Son reflects the glory of God in that the sum of the divine attributes brilliantly shine through his person. Moreover, he bears the very image and stamp of God’s nature (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">1:3</a>), as the wax bears the impress of the seal. Jesus as God’s final word of revelation is truly the divine and eternal Son of God. Christ’s excellence is further displayed in the fact that he is the mighty agent through whom the universe was created (v <a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">2</a>) and by whom the cosmic order is sustained (v <a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">3</a>). In the moral realm he has wrought the purification of sins and now sits enthroned on God’s right hand (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.8.1">8:1</a>). God’s pleasure toward the Son is seen in that he has appointed Christ heir and head of all (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">1:2</a>). His name is surpassed by none save God the Father (v <a href="?bref=Heb.1.4">4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Superiority of the Son to Angels (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.5-2.18">1:5–2:18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Angels enjoyed an exalted status in biblical and postbiblical Judaism. Traditionally the Jews believed that angels praised God upon his throne, mediated God’s revelation to men, attended to God’s will, and gave succor to the people of God. Angels were far superior to men in power and knowledge. According to the Jewish Apocrypha, angels ruled the stars and were responsible for the rise and fall of civilizations. In Qumran thought, angelic beings would engage in a final cosmic struggle with Belial and the forces of evil at the end of the age.</p>
<p>Against this background the writer of Hebrews argues that the Son is vastly superior to the angels. To prove his point, the author assembles a string of well-known OT texts and applies them directly to the Son. God never said of any angel, “Today I have become your Father” (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Ps 2:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Yet just such a claim was made on behalf of the Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.5">Heb 1:5</a>). When the Son incarnated himself in the world, he received the obedient worship of angels (v <a href="?bref=Heb.1.6">6</a>). His is the sovereignty and the eternality and the majesty at God’s right hand (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.1.8,11-12">8, 11-12</a>). By contrast, angels are “only servants” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.1.14">14</a>) that rank below the Son in dignity and might.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Heb.2.1-4">Hebrews 2:1-4</a> the writer parenthetically warns his wavering congregation of the danger of drifting away from the truth of God. If disobedience to the law mediated by angels resulted in stern punishment, how much more severe would be God’s judgment on those who trampled under foot the revelation delivered by the Son? If God’s saving grace in Christ is neglected, retribution will surely follow (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">2:3</a>).</p>
<p>The mention of angels turns the writer’s mind to Jesus’ humiliation and exaltation (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.5-18">2:5-18</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Psalm 8</a>, a song about the smallness and yet the significance of man, is applied to the experience of Jesus. In assuming human flesh and blood, Jesus was made “for a little while . . . lower than the angels” (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.7">Heb 2:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). But subsequent to the completion of his earthly work, he was elevated above the angels and crowned with the glory and honor of heaven (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.9">9</a>). The theological implications of Christ’s descent and ascent are carefully spelled out: Christ descended to earth (1) to bring many children to glory (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.10">10</a>), (2) to destroy the devil (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.14">14</a>), (3) to deliver his people from the bondage of death (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.15">15</a>), and (4) to make an offering on the cross for the sins of the people (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">17</a>). He ascended to heaven (1) to intercede on our behalf as a faithful High Priest (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">17</a>), and (2) to succor those who are sorely tempted (v <a href="?bref=Heb.2.18">18</a>). The perfect summary of Christ’s person and work is given in <a href="?bref=Heb.2.9">Hebrews 2:9</a>: “What we do see is Jesus, who ‘for a little while was made lower than the angels’ and now is ‘crowned with glory and honor’ because he suffered death for us. Yes, by God’s grace, Jesus tasted death for everyone in all the world” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Superiority of the Son to Moses and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.1-4.13">3:1–4:13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish Christians contemplating reversion to Judaism surely believed that Moses was one of the greatest figures in Israel’s history. So esteemed was the one who led Israel out of Egypt through the wilderness and who gave them the Law that there was no one in Israel’s history so honored as Moses. Yet the author of Hebrews argues that Moses, though faithful to his calling, was but a servant in the house of God. Jesus, by contrast, was not a servant but a Son; he was not a mere dweller in the house but the very builder of the structure. Jesus, therefore, far transcends the revered figure of Moses.</p>
<p>Practical implications are drawn from Jesus’ superiority to Moses. From <a href="?bref=Ps.95.7-11">Psalm 95:7-11</a> the writer rehearses the tragic experience of Israel under Moses during the desert wanderings (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-19">Heb 3:7-19</a>). Throughout the 40-year wilderness experience the people hardened their hearts and rebelled against God. In turn God was provoked by their stubbornness and swore that those who sinned would never enter the rest he was going to provide (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.3.10-11,18">10-11, 18</a>). The writer thus argues that if disobedience to God under Moses had serious consequences, forsaking Christ will be much more perilous. Hence the wavering Christians are urged to watch lest due to an evil, unbelieving heart they should fall away from the living God (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.12">12</a>). Nothing short of steadfast persistence will lead to the attainment of the heavenly goal (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.14">14</a>).</p>
<p>Joshua, likewise, was regarded as a great leader of Israel. Yet because of disobedience, the people under Joshua’s leadership failed to enter the rest that God had planned. That rest spoken of corresponds to the Sabbath rest of God (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.3-4">4:3-4</a>), and is a concept closely related to salvation. It is a spiritual reality that is achieved by turning from our own empty works and trusting in the finished work of Christ (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.10">10</a>). The author reminds the readers that “there is a special rest [a Sabbath rest] still waiting for the people of God” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.9">9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), one that only Christ can provide. Christians not only benefit from this Sabbath rest in the present age but anticipate its full realization in the age to come. One of the chief means of ensuring entry into the Sabbath rest of salvation is the Word of God (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.12">12</a>). The living and powerful Word penetrates the innermost depths of the soul, reveals our impoverished condition, and strengthens the trusting heart.</p>
<p class="h3">The Superiority of the Priesthood of the Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-7.28">4:14–7:28</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Almost half of Hebrews is devoted to the priesthood of Jesus Christ. The writer goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the revered Aaronic priestly system has been superseded by the High Priest “in the line of Melchizedek” (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.6">5:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.20">6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.11">7:11</a>). This central theme had been anticipated earlier when Christ was referred to as “our merciful and faithful High Priest before God” who has made atonement for sins (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">2:17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Hebrews makes the claim that Jesus’ priesthood is the ultimate ground of the believers’ confidence (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-16">4:14-16</a>). On three counts Jesus surpasses the old legal priestly order. First, he is an <span class="ital">exalted</span> high priest (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.14">14</a>). The Jewish high priest climbed the mount to enter the temple sanctuary. But Jesus, our great high priest, has ascended to heaven itself and entered the sanctuary on high. He ministers in no earthly tabernacle but in the very presence of God. Second, Jesus is an <span class="ital">empathetic</span> high priest (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">15</a>a). Fully God and fully man, Jesus suffers along with his people in their trials and afflictions. From heaven’s perspective he knows fully what his people are called upon to endure. He “feels” our hurts, and he does so perfectly. Finally, Jesus is a <span class="ital">sinless</span> high priest (v <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">15</a>b). Day in and day out (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.27">7:27</a>), year in and year out, the Levitical priests were required to bring sacrifices for their own sins. Yet Jesus had no sin that needed cleansing, for “he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">26</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In view of Jesus’ priestly perfections, sorely tempted Christians are urged to come to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.16">4:16</a>).</p>
<p>For those not convinced that Jesus was indeed a legitimate priest, two prerequisites for priesthood are detailed. First, if the high priest is to represent humanity before God, he must be taken from among men (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>). And second, he must be called by God to high priestly office, as was Aaron (v <a href="?bref=Heb.5.4">4</a>). Christ has fully satisfied these qualifications. From <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Psalms 2:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.110.4">110:4</a> it is shown that Jesus did not take this office upon himself but was appointed by God (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.5-6">Heb 5:5-6</a>). Moreover, from the obedience that he had to learn (v <a href="?bref=Heb.5.8">8</a>) and from the agony of the Gethsemane experience (v <a href="?bref=Heb.5.7">7</a>) it is clear that Jesus was in every way a man. Nevertheless, Hebrews makes it perfectly clear that Jesus was not a priest after the order of Aaron but a high priest in the line of Melchizedek (v <a href="?bref=Heb.5.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>After introducing the theme of Christ as a Melchizedekian high priest, the writer recalls that his readers were not ready for such advanced teaching. Although not new converts (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">5:12</a>), his friends had remained spiritually immature and sluggish. Hence the writer issues the challenge to press on to Christian maturity, to be ready for the solid food of advanced teaching.</p>
<p>In his digression the writer warns not only against spiritual immaturity but also against “apostasy.” The question now arises whether the author’s apostasy teaching in <a href="?bref=Heb.6.4-8">Hebrews 6:4-8</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.10.26-31">10:26-31</a> contradicts the NT doctrine of the perseverance of the saints. Undoubtedly it does not. Some authorities hold that those addressed were not true Christians, hence the issue is not one of apostasy. It is possible, like Judas Iscariot or Simon Magus (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.9-24">Acts 8:9-24</a>), to possess considerable knowledge of the gospel and fall short of personal commitment. But the writer makes it quite clear that in the case of his addressees he is persuaded otherwise (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.9">Heb 6:9</a>). The most reasonable view is that in these two hortatory passages the writer advances a hypothetical argument warning his friends of the utter seriousness of reverting back to Judaism. That is, if a falling away were to occur, renewal would be impossible unless Christ were to die a second time. The writer sums up the point of these difficult passages with the words “It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.31">10:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Nevertheless, followers of Christ may confidently lay hold of God’s promises, confirmed by solemn oath, to see them through their trials (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.13-18">6:13-18</a>). God may be trusted to hold the believer fast.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-28">Hebrews 7</a> contains an intricate argument for the superiority of Christ’s priesthood over the old legal order. Melchizedek, the ancient priest-king of Salem (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18-20">Gn 14:18-20</a>), is regarded as a primordial type of Christ. He is “king of righteousness” and “king of peace” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.2">Heb 7:2</a>). The solemn priest from Salem has figuratively what Christ possesses actually: neither mother nor father, neither beginning nor end of life (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">3</a>). Melchizedek is shown to be superior to Abraham on three counts: (1) Melchizedek blessed the patriarch (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.1,7">1, 7</a>); (2) he accepted tithes from Abraham (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.2-6">2-6</a>); and (3) Melchizedek lives on since the OT nowhere mentions his death (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.8">8</a>). It follows that since Levi was in the loins of Abraham as seed (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.10">10</a>), Melchizedek is superior to the Levitical priests. And inasmuch as Christ is a priest in the likeness of Melchizedek (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.15">15</a>), it follows that the Son of God is more excellent than the old legal priesthood.</p>
<p>The result is that the old Levitical priesthood has been superseded by the priesthood of Christ. The demise of the old order was inevitable, for its repetitive animal sacrifices could never effect spiritual perfection (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.11">7:11</a>). It was a system characterized by weakness and uselessness (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.18">18</a>). By contrast, Christ’s priesthood is indestructible, eternal, uninterrupted, efficacious, final, and perfect (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.16,21,24-27">16, 21, 24-27</a>). Forgiveness and reconciliation is possible only through Christ, our great High Priest.</p>
<p class="h3">The Superiority of the Priestly Work of the Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.1-10.39">8:1–10:39</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Since Christ’s priestly office far excels the old order, it follows that his priestly ministration is superior to all that has gone before. The theme of Christ as high priest in a better sanctuary is introduced (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.1-5">8:1-5</a>). The writer utilizes Plato’s distinction between the ideal form in heaven and the imperfect copy on earth to argue that the Levitical sanctuary and sacrifices are mere shadows of the heavenly realities: (1) Christ ministers in the true tent that is the heavenly sanctuary (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.8.2,5">2, 5</a>); (2) he discharges his high priestly service in the very presence of the Father, which results in a far more effective ministry (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.8.1,6">1, 6</a>); and (3) his oblation on the cross was the ultimate sacrifice (v <a href="?bref=Heb.8.3">3</a>). How unreasonable it is that his Christian readers should go back to the old Jewish priestly system!</p>
<p>Christ is the minister of a new and better covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-13">8:6-13</a>). The old covenant established by God with the nation’s fathers was not to be despised; nevertheless, it had become ineffectual and obsolete (v <a href="?bref=Heb.8.13">13</a>). Indeed, the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>) foresaw the new covenant that God would inaugurate with his people. This new covenant sealed by Christ involves (1) the immediate work of the Holy Spirit on the mind and heart (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.10">Heb 8:10</a>); (2) a personal and intimate knowledge of God (v <a href="?bref=Heb.8.11">11</a>); and (3) the full absolution of sins (v <a href="?bref=Heb.8.12">12</a>). This new and better covenant has been established on the work of Christ, the great High Priest.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1-28">9</a> gives a detailed comparison of the efficacy of priestly service under the old and new covenants. The Levitical priests ministered in a material sanctuary on earth (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1-5">1-5</a>). Features of the tabernacle and its furnishings are described to highlight their obsolescence. More important, however, is the character of the sacrificial ritual conducted in the earthly sanctuary. The Jewish priests in their daily service were not permitted to enter the Holy of Holies, which contained the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat—the place of propitiation of sins (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.6">6</a>). The high priest alone could enter the Holy of Holies, and then but once a year on the Day of Atonement, and only after sacrificing for his own sins (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.7">7</a>). The inaccessibility of the Holy of Holies signified that access to the presence of God had not been opened. The presence of the curtain symbolized that the people had no way to the throne of God, the priests had no way, and the high priest had a limited way and only once a year. Moreover, the sacrifices brought by the Jewish priests could not purify the conscience but merely dealt with external ritual cleansing (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.9.9-10">9-10</a>). A truly effectual sacrifice must await “the time of reformation” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>Christ’s priestly ministration is shown to be far more efficacious. First, the Christian’s High Priest has brought a better sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.11-14">9:11-14</a>), and here we arrive at the heart of the message of Hebrews. Employing the imagery of the tabernacle, the author demonstrates that Christ our High Priest has accomplished what the Jewish priests failed to do. He entered the heavenly Holy of Holies, not repeatedly, but <span class="ital">once</span> for all, thereby effecting a completed redemption (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.12">12</a>). Christ brought to the altar, not the blood of bulls and goats, but his own life’s blood. The Lord did not merely lay down a material body, but he presented himself to God through the eternal Spirit (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14">14</a>). Christ’s better sacrifice thus goes beyond cleansing of the flesh to the purification of the defiled conscience.</p>
<p>Second, Christ through his death has instituted a better covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.15-23">9:15-23</a>). The teaching of <a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-13">Hebrews 8:6-13</a> is developed further. The old covenant was sealed with the blood of calves and goats (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.19">9:19</a>). But the new covenant was ratified with the blood of Christ, God’s own Son. The new covenant thus could accomplish what the old covenant merely foreshadowed—forgiveness and cleansing of sins (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.22">22</a>).</p>
<p>Third, Christ ministers in a better tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.24-28">9:24-28</a>). Our Lord entered, not into a merely earthly sanctuary, but into the holy place of heaven, there to represent us (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.24">24</a>). Access to the throne is not limited to one day per year, for he is continually in the presence of the Father. Nor is it necessary that repeated sacrifices be made. Christ’s single sacrifice on the cross has conquered sin once and for all (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.26">26</a>). In sum, as regards the sanctuary, the covenant, and the sacrifices, the Christian’s High Priest is vastly superior to the old Jewish order.</p>
<p>In order to drive home these crucial points, the writer in chapter <a href="?bref=Heb.10.1-39">10</a> expands on the theme of the absolute finality of Christ’s high priestly work. The earlier argument concerning the futile character of the Levitical sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.6-14">9:6-14</a>) is repeated for emphasis (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.1-4">10:1-4</a>). The Mosaic ceremonial legislation called for repetitive sacrifices, which could never perfect the worshiper (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.1">1</a>). Instead of purifying one’s life, they served only as a yearly reminder of sin (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.3">3</a>) until Christ should come.</p>
<p>The writer discovers in <a href="?bref=Ps.40.6-8">Psalm 40:6-8</a> a prediction that the eternal Christ would become man for the purpose of offering himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.5-10">Heb 10:5-10</a>). Once again the sanctifying power of Christ’s single self-oblation is emphasized (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.10">10</a>). The vivid contrast is again drawn between the ineffective ministry of the Jewish priests who stand during the daily ritual (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.11">11</a>), and the effectual single sacrifice of Christ, who is now seated at the right hand of God (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.12">12</a>). Since Jesus “by that one offering . . . perfected forever all those whom he is making holy” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.14">14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), nothing can be added to what the seated Sovereign has accomplished (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.18">18</a>).</p>
<p>In view of the manifest superiority of Christ’s priestly office and work, the struggling Christians are exhorted to appropriate the means of grace at their disposal (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.19-39">10:19-39</a>). In the midst of trials and persecution they should remember that Christ has effectively opened the way to God (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.10.19-20">19-20</a>). They are summoned to come to God in faith with hearts cleansed by Christ’s sacrifice (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.22">22</a>). Those tempted to revert to legal religion should hold fast and support one another in love (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.10.23-24">23-24</a>). The means of grace afforded by corporate worship should not be neglected (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.25">25</a>). In short, the wavering Jewish Christians are summoned to renewed endurance and fidelity to their Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.10.26-31">26-31</a>). What God has promised to his people he will surely make good.</p>
<p class="h3">The Superiority of the Life of Faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-12.29">11:1–12:29</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The discussion of faith and endurance as the solution to despondency (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.36-38">10:36-38</a>) prompts a fuller consideration of the faith theme. Faith is a prominent concept in the book of Hebrews, as attested by the fact that the word occurs some 35 times in the letter. The Pauline idea of faith as the means of legal justification is adapted to the particular circumstances of the threatened Jewish Christians. The concept of faith is broader in this book than the strictly saving faith discussed by Paul, in that it leads to spiritual salvation (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.39-40">11:39-40</a>). Faith is the power by which heaven’s unseen realities are laid hold of to satisfy the soul. Faith enables the Christian disciple to view the world and interpret the flow of history from the divine perspective. Faith is the means of victory over the world of sin and woe. Through faith the believer approaches the throne of grace (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.16">4:16</a>) with the confidence and assurance that God will enable him to overcome.</p>
<p>The victory faith affords is amply illustrated from the history of God’s OT people. Abel, Enoch, and Noah in the primal history; Abraham, the father of faith; Moses, the leader of the young nation; and many valiant prophets and martyrs serve as living memorials to faith’s overcoming power. And yet God has something better in store for his sanctified people, the church (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.40">11:40</a>): the reality of the living Christ.</p>
<p>Yet the greatest model of steadfast endurance in suffering is Jesus, “the Originator and Perfecter of our faith” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.2">12:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). When surrounded with trials, the Christian needs to recall Christ, who in anticipation of the heavenly crown endured the cross and its shame. The Christian’s trials are trivial compared with what Jesus Christ was called upon to suffer (v <a href="?bref=Heb.12.3">3</a>). Moreover, for the people of God, suffering and persecution prove to be disguised blessings. The rod of discipline confirms our status as children of the living God (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-10">5-10</a>). But beyond this, the sovereign God is able to transform the Christian’s suffering into inestimable blessing (v <a href="?bref=Heb.12.11">11</a>). Hence the wavering saints should strive for spiritual wholeness and maturity, taking care lest they be overtaken by bitterness and resentment (v <a href="?bref=Heb.12.15">15</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Final Exhortations and Benediction (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.1-25">13:1-25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The writer in his closing words challenges his Christian friends to be faithful to the tasks that lie at hand. They are to show continued love to the brethren, to extend hospitality to strangers, to uphold the sanctity of marriage, to be content with what they now possess, and to be obedient to their spiritual leaders (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.1-7">13:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>The readers are warned against the trickery of the Judaizers, who would lead them astray from Jesus Christ, the one who remains “the same yesterday, today, and forever” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.8">13:8</a>). Spiritual determination is strengthened by recalling the example of Christ, who “suffered outside the city gates” for their salvation (v <a href="?bref=Heb.13.12">12</a>). As the people of God, they are challenged to follow Christ “outside the camp,” bearing abuse for him (v <a href="?bref=Heb.13.13">13</a>). Patient endurance is possible when the Christian realizes that he has no enduring city here (v <a href="?bref=Heb.13.14">14</a>). His goal is the heavenly Jerusalem, the eternal city of God.</p>
<p>The anonymous letter to the unknown “Hebrews” closes with a glorious benediction. The Christian’s God is described as the great “God of peace” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.20">13:20</a>), and Jesus is “the great Shepherd of the sheep,” who established a new and eternal covenant and then rose triumphant from the dead. And the promise is made to the trusting soul that the triune God would “equip you with all you need for doing his will” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.13.21">21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The letter to the Hebrews is rich in doctrinal teaching. It discloses more about the historical Jesus than any other NT letter. It alone explains the atoning work of Christ under the rubric of the Melchizedekian priest. The letter’s discussion of repentance, justification, sanctification, and perseverance makes it a mine of salvation teaching. Its explication of old and new covenants, impending judgment, and the world to come make a significant contribution to Christian theology. And the letter’s teaching on faith, endurance, and the practical Christian combine to make Hebrews one of the most important documents God has given to the church.</p>

<p class="list">1. City of antiquity still standing today. It was built on the southern end of the highlands that run north to south through the length of Palestine. In patriarchal times it was known as Kiriath-arba (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.2">Gn 23:2</a>) and stood on the hill known as El Arbain. The modern city straddles both ridges of the mountain range.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hebron is situated 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem and less than two miles (3.2 kilometers) from Mamre, where Abraham spent much of his life. It is 3,000 feet (914 meters) above sea level and marks the southern end of the Judean highlands. From this elevation the land slopes down rapidly to the east, but gradually to the west and south. The soil is relatively fertile, and a variety of fruits (apples, plums, figs, pomegranates, apricots), nuts, and vegetables are grown easily. To the south is the Negev, where the grazing land is excellent. A large number of springs and wells dot the landscape and assure residents of an abundance of water.</p>
<p class="list-text">In OT times Hebron included Mamre, the place where Abraham built an altar to the Lord after parting from Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">Gn 13:18</a>). It was here, too, that he learned of the capture of his nephew Lot (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.12-16">14:12-16</a>); and here that, years later, he entertained three angels and was told of the judgment soon to fall on Sodom and Gomorrah (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.18.1-33">18</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Sarah died in Hebron, and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.8-9,17">Gn 23:8-9, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.9-10">25:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.29-32">49:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.50.12-13">50:12-13</a>) in which to bury her. This cave is now within the walls of the modern city, and the famous mosque of Haram el-Khalil was built over it.</p>
<p class="list-text">At the time of the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, spies were sent into the land. They began in the south and traversed the central highlands of Palestine from Kadesh-barnea through Hebron to Rehob (<a href="?bref=Num.13.17-21">Nm 13:17-21</a>). On their return they brought back evidence of the productivity of the land (vv <a href="?bref=Num.13.23-24">23-24</a>). From <a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Numbers 13:33</a> we know that giants (“sons of Anak”) lived in Hebron. The sight of these men filled ten of the spies with fear. Only Caleb and Joshua proved equal to the occasion. Because of their faith, they were promised a possession in the land, and Caleb was given Hebron (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.9,13">Jos 14:9, 13</a>). The unfaithful spies died in a plague in the presence of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Num.14.36-37">Nm 14:36-37</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">During the period of the judges, Hebron is mentioned in connection with Samson. When trapped inside the city of Gaza, he carried off the gates and left them at Hebron (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.3">Jgs 16:3</a>). Following the death of Saul, the first king of Israel, David was crowned king of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin in Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1">2 Sm 2:1</a>). He made this city his capital, for it was more centrally located than Benjamin, and its position at the southern end of the mountain range removed it as far as possible from the 10 northern tribes that followed Ishbosheth, the son of Saul. It was far enough from the Philistines to the west and the Amalekites to the south to avoid notice, and it was also easily defensible. Hebron also lay at the junction of several important trade routes, and this ensured its prominence. Later, however, when David was made king over all Israel, he moved his capital to Jerusalem—an act that must have displeased the people of Hebron.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Absalom wished to obtain support for his claim to the throne, he initiated his revolt from Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.7-12">2 Sm 15:7-12</a>). Following the death of Solomon, David’s son, the kingdom was divided. Rehoboam, fearing an attack by the Egyptians on his southern border, fortified Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.1-12">2 Chr 11:1-12</a>). From this time onward the city disappears from the OT record.</p>

  <title>Heir</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HEIR</p>
<p class="fl">One who inherits something or who is entitled to a future inheritance; the one who receives the property of a deceased person, particularly on the basis of law and usually by means of a will. In both the OT and NT, the Hebrew and the Greek words encompass these ideas.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Genesis 15</a>, after God had reiterated his special promise to Abraham, Abraham wondered how the fulfillment of the promise might occur. At the time, only his steward, Eliezer of Damascus, was “the son of his house,” that is, the one of his large household who would inherit. There was no natural-born son of Abraham within the family (see <a href="?bref=Gen.15.3-4">Gn 15:3-4</a>). Without a son in patriarchal times, a man’s chief steward could be his heir as a substitute. Later, after the birth of Ishmael (Abraham’s son by Hagar, Sarah’s maidservant) and of Isaac (his son by Sarah, his wife), trouble erupted between the women, and Sarah demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away, because Sarah did not want Ishmael to be an heir with her own son, Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.10">Gn 21:10</a>).</p>
<p>A wise woman, at Joab’s instigation, told David a story about herself and her two sons. She said that one son killed the other, and that her family now wanted to kill the remaining son for the murder. If this happened, she claimed, the heir of her deceased husband would be destroyed and the family would be left with no inheritance (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.7">2 Sm 14:7</a>).</p>
<p>Another biblical illustration of this normal use of the word “heir” is seen in a parable told by Jesus. The workers in the vineyard, who saw the son of their master coming, said among themselves, “This is the heir; come, let us kill him and have his inheritance” (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.33-43">Mt 21:33-43</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.12.7">Mk 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.14">Lk 20:14</a>).</p>
<p>In a number of references in the NT, the word “heir” is used to refer to the believer in Christ, who has an inheritance coming because of being a child of God the Father and consequently a joint heir with Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.16-17">Rom 8:16-17</a>). The inheritance of salvation is variously referred to in different sections of the NT. In <a href="?bref=Heb.6.17">Hebrews 6:17</a>, Christians are called “heirs of the promise.” This promise occurred when God said to Abraham, “I will certainly bless you richly, and I will multiply your descendants into countless millions” (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.14">Heb 6:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">Hebrews 11:7</a>, Noah is described as “an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). In <a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">James 2:5</a>, the poor in the world who are rich in faith are said to be “heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those who love him” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Paul writes that those who are justified by God’s grace are made heirs according to the hope of eternal life (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.7">Ti 3:7</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">Hebrews 1:2</a>, the word “heir” is used with a singular reference to God’s Son, who is said to have been appointed “heir of all things” by his Father. Here is an instance where someone has been designated to receive an inheritance but will actually enter into full possession of it much later.</p>
<p>In biblical times the right of primogeniture—that is, the right of the eldest son in the family to be the primary heir in the household—prevailed. In OT times, the firstborn son possessed the birthright, which included inheriting a double portion of his father’s possessions and headship of the family (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.15-17">Dt 21:15-17</a>). The other sons shared the remainder equally. If there were no sons to inherit, the daughters became the heirs (<a href="?bref=Num.27.8">Nm 27:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.36.1-12">36:1-12</a>), although there was a stipulation that the daughters could not marry outside their tribe. This was to preserve the tribal territory intact. If there were no daughters, then the dead man’s brothers inherited; if no brothers, then his uncles; and if no uncles, then the nearest relative (<a href="?bref=Num.27.9-11">27:9-11</a>). Because the matter of tribal possession was so important, it is easy to understand why there was such a concern for genealogical records among the Hebrew people.</p>

  <title>Heliopolis</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HELIOPOLIS</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient Egyptian city famed as a center for worship of the sun god Re. Heliopolis (“city of the sun”) was located in the Nile River delta region of Lower Egypt, a few miles northeast of modern Cairo. Heliopolis became important from about 2400 <span class="era">BC</span>, with the emergence of Atum-Re as the cult deity. Many pharaohs embellished the city’s temples and put up various public monuments, especially in the New Kingdom period (1570–1150 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Since the temples contained the royal archives, the priests became the official historians of Egypt. Herodotus, a Greek historian of the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, said the priests at Heliopolis were famous for their knowledge of Egyptian history. There were also training schools for priests and a medical school in the city.</p>
<p>Other Egyptian sun worship centers existed at various times, but Heliopolis maintained its popularity for some 2,000 years. Though the city was of little importance politically, it was of primary religious influence. Among Egyptian religious buildings, the temple of Re at Heliopolis was second in size only to the temple of Amon at Thebes.</p>
<p>In the OT, Heliopolis is called On. When Joseph was a member of the Egyptian official class, he married Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.45,50">Gn 41:45, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.46.20">46:20</a>). The prophet Ezekiel warned of coming destruction in Egypt by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, citing Heliopolis (On) as one of the cities to be destroyed (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.17">Ez 30:17</a>). In <a href="?bref=Amos.1.5">Amos 1:5</a>, the <span class="sc">rsv</span> (mg) has an alternative rendering, “On,” for “Valley of Aven,” and the same reading in <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.17">Ezekiel 30:17</a> for the <span class="sc">nlt</span> “Heliopolis.” The prophet Jeremiah also predicted the destruction of the obelisks (sacred pillars) of Heliopolis (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.13">Jer 43:13</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Beth-shemesh”). <a href="?bref=Isa.19.18">Isaiah 19:18</a> is probably also a reference to Heliopolis (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The city lost its prominence in the fourth and third centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, partly because of the library founded at Alexandria early in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>. Alexandria replaced Heliopolis as the leading intellectual center in Egypt.</p>
<p>Little remains today from the ancient city of the sun, but an obelisk erected by Sesostris I (1971–1928 <span class="era">BC</span>) can still be seen at the site of Heliopolis. Several obelisks from Heliopolis, erected by Thutmose III (1490–1436 <span class="era">BC</span>), have been moved to various parts of the world in modern times.</p>

<p class="fl">Hell is the final destiny of unbelievers and is variously described by the figures of a furnace of fire, eternal fire, eternal punishment (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.42,50">Mt 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41,46">25:41, 46</a>); outer darkness, the place of weeping and torment (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.12">8:12</a>); the lake of fire, the second death (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">Rv 21:8</a>); a place for the devil and his demons (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>). Evidently, those in hell experience everlasting separation from the Lord, never to see the glory of his power (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.9">2 Thes 1:9</a>). Those who worshiped the beast will be subject to continuous torment (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.10-11">Rv 14:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>Other expressions that indicate that the final state of the wicked is eternal are these: “burn with unquenchable fire” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.12">Mt 3:12</a>); “to the unquenchable fire . . . where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.43,48">Mk 9:43, 48</a>); there is sin that “will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.32">Mt 12:32</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). When Scripture is understood properly, there is no hint anywhere of the termination of the terrible state of unbelievers in hell. Their doom is unending; there is a solemn finality about their miserable condition. (It is significant that the most descriptive and conclusive utterances about hell come from the lips of Jesus.)</p>
<p>A summary of all Scripture that speaks of hell indicates that there is the loss and absence of all good, and the misery and torment of an evil conscience. The most terrifying aspect is the complete and deserved separation from God and from all that is pure, holy, and beautiful. In addition, there is the awareness of being under the wrath of God and of enduring the curse of a righteous sentence because of one’s sins that were consciously and voluntarily committed.</p>
<p>Although the biblical descriptions of hell are stated in very physical and literal terms, the essential character of hell should not be conceived in or limited to designations such as the worm that devours, the stripes that are inflicted, the burning or being consumed by fire. This affirmation does not detract from the horror or the gravity of the situation in hell, because nothing could possibly be worse than separation from God and the torment of an evil conscience. Hell is hell for those who are there essentially because they are completely alienated from God, and wherever there is alienation from God, there is always estrangement from one’s fellows. This is the worst possible punishment to which anyone could be subject: to be totally and irrevocably cut off from God and to be at enmity with all those who are around oneself. Another painful consequence of such a condition is to be at odds with oneself—torn apart from within by an accusing sense of guilt and shame. This condition is one of total conflict: with God, one’s neighbors, and oneself. This is hell! If the descriptions of hell are figurative or symbolic, the conditions they represent are more intense and real than the figures of speech in which they are expressed.</p>
<p>Punishment for sin is a persistent teaching of the Bible. The doctrine of judgment is as extensive as the Canon itself. Typical of such passages are <a href="?bref=Gen.2.17">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.17-19">3:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.4.13">4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.26.27-33">Leviticus 26:27-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.7">Psalm 149:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.11">Isaiah 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.10">Ezekiel 14:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.2-2.16">Amos 1:2–2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.19">Zechariah 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41,46">Matthew 25:41, 46</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.23-24">Luke 16:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.5-12">Romans 2:5-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.7-8">Galatians 6:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.29-31">Hebrews 10:29-31</a>; and <a href="?bref=Rev.20.11-15">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalTerms">Biblical Terms</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew word “Sheol” in the OT is predominantly used for “the grave, the pit, the place of the departed dead” (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.35">Gn 37:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.7.9">Jb 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.14.13">14:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.17.13-16">17:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.6.5">Pss 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.55.15">55:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.9.18">Prv 9:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.10">Eccl 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.11">Is 14:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.10-12,18">38:10-12, 18</a>). There does not seem to be a very clear distinction in the OT between the final destiny of the good and the evil. They all alike go to the grave, to the world below, a world of gloom, weariness, darkness, decay, and forgetfulness, where one is remote from God (<a href="?bref=Job.10.20-22">Jb 10:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.3-6">Ps 88:3-6</a>), yet accessible to him (<a href="?bref=Job.26.6">Jb 26:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.138.8">Ps 138:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.2">Am 9:2</a>). It is a place characterized by silence (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.17">Pss 94:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.17">115:17</a>) and rest (<a href="?bref=Job.3.17">Jb 3:17</a>). Other texts, however, seem to suggest some aspect of consciousness, hope, and communication in Sheol (<a href="?bref=Job.14.13-15">Jb 14:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">19:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Pss 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.49.15">49:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.9-10">Is 14:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.21">Ez 32:21</a>). A few texts seem to suggest the threat of divine judgment after death (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.17">Pss 9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.55.15">55:15</a>). On the whole, Sheol was regarded with dismay and foreboding (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.22">Dt 32:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.18">Is 38:18</a>).</p>
<p>It was not until the time of the postcanonical Jewish literature, the writings that were developed between the close of the OT and the beginning of NT times, that clear distinctions were made between the final destinies of the righteous and the unrighteous. The idea of separate divisions within Sheol for the good and the evil was developed. It is unmistakable that there was in Jewish thought, as reflected throughout the OT, a belief in a future and continued existence beyond death, however shadowy and indefinite the concept.</p>
<p>The Greek word “hades” in the NT is used very similarly to “Sheol” in the OT. It was, in fact, used by the translators of the Septuagint, the Greek version of the OT, for Sheol. It designated in general the place or state of the dead, the grave, or death itself. In some versions the word is not translated at all but is transliterated simply as “hades.” The NT is not always very explicit about the meaning of hades, other than what has just been described. Use of the word often does not reveal much about the specific condition of the dead. There are some passages, however, that indicate a distinct advance over the use of Sheol in the OT. One NT passage definitely describes hades as a place of evil and punishment of the wicked, and may appropriately be translated “hell” (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.23">Lk 16:23</a>). In all other instances, hades indicates nothing more than the place of the dead.</p>
<p>The Greek word “Gehenna” is used in a number of NT texts to designate the fiery place for punishment of sinners and is often translated “hell” or “the fires of hell” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22,29-30">Mt 5:22, 29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.9">18:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.15,33">23:15, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.43,45,47">Mk 9:43, 45, 47</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.6">Jas 3:6</a>). It is usually used in connection with the final judgment and often has the suggestion that the punishment spoken of is eternal. Gehenna is derived by transliteration from the Hebrew of the OT “valley of Hinnom” or the “valley of the son of Hinnom,” a ravine on the south side of Jerusalem. This valley was the center of idolatrous worship in which children were burned by fire as an offering to the heathen god Molech (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.3">2 Chr 28:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.6">33:6</a>). In the time of Josiah it became a place of abomination, polluted by dead men’s bones and rubbish (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10-14">2 Kgs 23:10-14</a>) and by the garbage and filth of Jerusalem dumped there. A fire burned continuously in this valley. It thus became a symbol of the unending fires of hell where the lost are consumed in torment. It was a symbol of judgment to be imposed on the idolatrous and disobedient (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.31-34">Jer 7:31-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.35">32:35</a>).</p>
<p>Another Greek word used to designate hell or “the lower regions” is “Tartarus” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Pt 2:4</a>), a classical word for the place of eternal punishment. The apostle Peter uses it for the fallen angels who were thrown into hell, “committed . . . to pits of nether gloom to be kept until the judgment” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). </p>
<p>As noted above, there are, in addition to these terms, the very explicit and vivid phrases that clearly teach the doctrine of hell, as developed at the beginning of this article. The biblical doctrine is determined much more by these decisive phrases than by the somewhat indecisive but frequently used terms “Sheol” and “hades.”</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheJusticeofEternalPunishment">The Justice of Eternal Punishment</p>
<p class="fl">It is difficult for us to understand the righteous judgment of a holy God who, on one hand, hates all evil, yet, on the other hand, loves the evildoers enough to sacrifice his only Son for their salvation from sin. Divine wrath is the necessary reaction of a holy God who hates all that is contrary to his righteous nature. When the only remedy for human sin is rejected and all appeals of a loving, seeking God for the reconciliation of rebellious sinners are refused, there is no other course of action that God himself can pursue but to leave the sinner to his self-chosen destiny. Punishment for sin is then the inevitable and inescapable response of holiness to that which is morally opposite, and it must continue as long as the sinful condition requiring it continues. There is no indication anywhere in Scripture that lost sinners in hell are capable of repentance and faith. If in this life they did not turn away from sin and receive Christ as Savior with all the favorable circumstances and opportunities afforded them on earth, it is unreasonable to think they will do so in the life to come. Punishment cannot come to an end until guilt and sin come to an end. When the sinner ultimately resists and rejects the work of the Holy Spirit whereby he is convicted of sin, there remains no more possibility of repentance or salvation. He has committed an eternal sin (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.29">Mk 3:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.11">Rv 22:11</a>), which deserves eternal punishment.</p>
<p>The impossibility of faith and repentance in hell is seen also from the tragic reality of the depraved will, conditioned and determined by its repeated rebellion against God. Sin reproduces itself in the will, and character tends to become irrevocably fixed. God responds to endless sinning with the necessary counterpart of endless punishment.</p>
<p>If the question is raised, How can a loving God send people to an everlasting hell? it must be replied that God does not choose this destination for people; they freely choose it for themselves. God simply concurs in their self-chosen way and reveals the full consequences of their evil choice. It must always be remembered that God is not only loving; he is also holy and righteous. There must be some adequate reckoning with justice in the universe where a revolt against God has brought evil consequences of enormous proportions.</p>
<p>While the duration of punishment in hell is eternal for all who have chosen that destiny for themselves, there are degrees of punishment proportional to the degrees of guilt of each individual. Only God is able to determine what those degrees are, and he will assign the consequences with perfect justice according to the responsibility of each one. Evidence of such gradations in future punishment is found in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.20-24">Mt 11:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.47-48">Lk 12:47-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12-13">Rv 20:12-13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.48-61">Ez 16:48-61</a>). An obvious comparison is made in these texts between the differing intensities of punishment that are involved in the contrasting privileges, knowledge, and opportunities.</p>
<p>From all that has been said, it should be obvious that a variety of nonbiblical views must be ruled out, however attractively they may be presented by their advocates and however popular they may be from time to time. Among these views are the erroneous, but sometimes persuasive, doctrines of universalism, annihilationism, and second probation. Universalism promotes the concept that God will save everyone in the end. Annihilationism teaches that hell is not a place of conscious suffering but of final extermination. And second probation is a notion that people can be delivered from hell. It must always be remembered that the Bible is our rule of faith for the doctrine of hell, however difficult the doctrine may seem for natural reason or for human sentiment. Scripture leaves no doubt about the terrible nature and the eternal duration of hell. Rejection or neglect of this doctrine will have dire effects upon the mission of the church.</p>

<p class="h1">HELLENISM*</p>
<p class="fl">That unique blend of Greek cultural, philosophical, and ethical ideals that had a profound effect on the development of culture throughout the Mediterranean world. While the antecedents of the movement occurred long before, the Hellenistic Age is seen by most to have begun in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, with the death of Alexander, and to have continued until either 30 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Rome conquered Egypt, or (more likely) <span class="era">AD</span> 300. Rome itself was culturally conquered by Hellenism.</p>

<p class="h2" id="HellenisticAge">Hellenistic Age</p>
<p class="fl">Alexander the Great was more than a military conqueror. He made Hellenistic culture the norm throughout his realm. He taught conquered people the Greek language and customs, and he built new Greek cities (34 in all), like Alexandria in Egypt, which became bastions of Hellenism. His major accomplishment was not so much territorial as cultural; after him, Hellenism controlled the Western world for centuries. It was Alexander who spearheaded the triumph of the Attic <span class="greek">koine</span> (common) dialect over the other Greek dialects, and this became the primary force in the Hellenization of the East. The <span class="greek">koine</span> dialect was to be the basis for the acceptance of Hellenism by subject peoples. The first period after his death would be characterized by the dissolution of Alexander’s empire and an emerging balance of power among the forces of Ptolemy, who controlled Egypt and Palestine; Seleucus, who ruled Babylon and Asia Minor; and Antipater (followed by Antigonus), who reigned over Macedonia and the Hellespont.</p>
<p>In the East the next century was typified by intermittent skirmishes between the Ptolemies and Seleucids, with the result that Palestine became a buffer state between the two. An important difference is that the Ptolemies had a unified kingdom and so were not interested in change; under their rule, Palestine was autonomous both culturally and religiously. However, the Seleucids controlled many different groups and so tried to unite them by forcing Hellenization on them. This finally led to the successful revolt of the Jews under the Maccabees and the disintegration of both empires. In the West, Rome became progressively involved in Greek affairs and by 149 <span class="era">BC</span> controlled the Greek lands politically, while they themselves were overtaken by Greek ideals culturally.</p>
<p>During this period, there was a growing middle class, which was brought about partly because Alexander’s conquests led to a vast dispersion of Greeks into the conquered lands. The redistribution of wealth this engendered was based upon a Greek education and an acceptance of Hellenistic ideals. The term “civilized” came to be identified with the Greek way of life. Education was controlled by the idea of sound rhetoric, so that style triumphed over truth. Greek drama turned to comedy, which stressed realism in human emotions, and Hellenistic art grew even more naturalistic than in the classical period.</p>
<p>Philosophy also developed, with at least three schools arising to dominate Greek thought for the next few centuries. Interestingly, all three centered on practical ethics rather than the classical quest for truth and knowledge. The Cynics, founded by Diogenes, stressed a total self-sufficiency that left the individual in a social vacuum but taught him how to deal with human misery. The two most influential schools were the Epicureans and the Stoics. Epicurus sought freedom from anxiety or fear and taught that peace of the soul could only be derived from a disciplined, moderate experience of pleasures. The result was a retreat from society into one’s own selfhood. Stoicism, founded by Zeno and named after the <span class="greek">stoa</span> (porch) in Athens where he taught, was similar to cynicism in its emphasis on self-sufficiency, but it combined this with a stress on the brotherhood of man. Every person was to strive after virtue and live above the vicissitudes of life. This last philosophy had become the center of Hellenism by the time of Christ.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HellenismandJudaism">Hellenism and Judaism</p>
<p class="fl">Judaism was virtually the only culture that resisted the encroachment of Hellenism. Therefore, the power of this movement can be seen in the degree to which it permeated Judaism.</p>
<p>The pull of Hellenism was always felt primarily by the upper-class nobility, and it was strongest in Jewish communities of the Dispersion. However, under the Seleucids, the temple priesthood was pro-Hellenist, so this added a religious dimension to the economic pressure upon the wealthy. From the beginning Palestine was split into two factions: the urban nobility, who tried to make Jerusalem another <span class="greek">polis</span><span class="ital">,</span> or Hellenistic city-state, by adding such things as gymnasia and Greek drama; and the agricultural, poor peasants, who saw in Hellenism a threat to the very existence of the Mosaic system.</p>
<p>Jews had to learn <span class="greek">koine</span> Greek to make business transactions and participate in legal matters. Archaeology shows that almost all inscriptions in Palestine from the third century <span class="era">BC</span> were in Greek, and the translation of the Torah into Greek in the Septuagint shows the permeation of the language in the Jewish communities outside of Palestine (diasporate communities). The gymnasium was the school in Hellenistic cities, and Greek education was the key to citizenship. Alexandria, Egypt, in this regard became the intellectual center of the Greek world, and its influence on the strong Jewish community in that city was considerable. Well-to-do Jews in lands of the Dispersion and in Jerusalem itself were expected to procure a gymnasium education. Many followed the Greek practice of participating naked in sports, as can be seen from the literature of the intertestamental period, which is strongly antagonistic a century later (due to Jewish aversion to such public display). Jewish synagogue schools, as a result of competition with the gymnasia, adopted Greek ways. In fact, the development of the scribal tradition is partly due to this interaction; the movement was away from the oligarchical system of the temple era and toward a democratic instruction of the whole people.</p>
<p>Jewish literature and philosophy became permeated by Hellenistic patterns. This is seen in 1 and 2 Maccabees, which reflect Greek historiography. And Hellenistic influence can be seen in virtually every Jewish work of this period. The major exponent, of course, was Philo of Alexandria, whose allegorical interpretation of the OT was designed to make Jewish teachings palatable to the Hellenistic world and vice versa. This attitude was quite common. The symbolism of Jewish apocalyptic writing was influenced by a combination of Hellenistic and Oriental (primarily Persian) themes, and even the hyperconservative Essene movement used thought forms that had been molded via Judaism’s penetration by Hellenistic and Persian ideas. The stress on “eternal knowledge” and “revealed mystery” and the dualistic combination of salvation history and anthropology are evidence of this. Of course, the influence was not all one way. The development of Greek philosophy was strongly influenced by Semitic forms, especially Phoenician; and the strong Jewish piety was very attractive to the Greek mind.</p>
<p>It is accurate to say that even the Judaism of Palestine in the first century <span class="era">BC</span> was a Hellenistic Judaism. The universality of the <span class="greek">koine</span> Greek, the infiltration of Greek learning and thought patterns, the presence of Jewish literature in Greek, and the permeation of Hellenistic rhetorical devices, even into the very literature of the opposition movement, shows the power of Hellenism in Palestine.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HellenismandChristianity">Hellenism and Christianity</p>
<p class="fl">Some scholars have attempted to stratify early Christianity into periods typified by Palestinian, Hellenistic-Jewish, and Hellenistic outlooks. However, as the evidence above has shown, this is by no means an easy task, since even Judea was penetrated by Greek thought patterns. To be sure, the reactionary stance against Hellenism in Judaism is paralleled by the Hellenist-Hebrew conflict of <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-15">Acts 6</a> and the gentile mission. However, from the very earliest stages, the influence of Hellenism on the church can be traced. Moreover, it becomes virtually impossible to know whether a phrase is drawn from Palestinian or from Hellenistic sources, due to the mutual penetration of both into Palestine itself, and to the bilingual nature of the church from the beginning.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there were no differences at all. The Hellenistic background of Stephen allowed him to see the logical implications of the land and the temple typifying Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-7.60">Acts 6–7</a>), while the more conservative Jerusalem church did not. Also, a study of the speeches in Acts shows that the kerygma (preaching) developed differently for Jewish and gentile audiences. The first centered on OT fulfillment and the second on the active penetration of history by the one true God, who, unlike dead idols, involved himself in the affairs of man.</p>
<p>The fact that the NT was written in <span class="greek">koine</span> Greek makes the influence very direct. Strongly Jewish-oriented works, such as Hebrews or James, are written in polished Greek, and even the Gospels, which record the life of Jesus in a Jewish setting, reflect Hellenistic historiography (e.g., an interest in the theological meaning of the historical events). Most obviously Hellenistic, of course, are ideas found in the Epistles stemming from the gentile mission. Early hymns like <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-22">Colossians 1:15-22</a> use terminology from the Hellenistic environs to describe the incomparable superiority of Jesus over pagan ideals. The stress on the universal mission, while based on the teachings of Jesus, developed during the gentile mission; the primitive church interpreted it in keeping with Jewish proselyte theology, which was that the Gentiles became Christians after becoming Jews.</p>

<p class="h1">HELLENISTS*</p>
<p class="fl">Name used in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1,9">Acts 6:1, 9:29</a>, and possibly <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a> for a distinct branch of the early church that was characterized by Greek modes of thinking. Their actual identification is disputed, and the following possibilities have been propounded: (1) Greek-speaking Jews rather than Aramaic-speaking Jews (but “Hebrews,” as in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">6:1</a>, was seldom used in a linguistic sense); (2) proselytes of “Greeks” as opposed to true Jews (the list of deacons in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">6:5</a> makes this doubtful, for it is unlikely that they were all proselytes); (3) diasporate Jews living in Palestine (fits <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">6:1-6</a> but not the other passages); (4) pro-Hellenist sect within Judaism (this does not fit the whole tenor of the passages); (5) Gentiles who joined the church at an early date (this does not really fit the context of all three passages); (6) a general, not specific, term simply referring to one who either speaks Greek or follows Greek customs (or both). This is the best answer, as a study of the context illustrates.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">6:1</a> the group was probably made up of Hellenistic Jews then living in Palestine. This is seen in the deacons chosen in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">6:5</a>. Luke used Greek names for all of them, probably not because they were Greek but to symbolize the desire of the apostles to unify the separate groups. Most Jews in the ancient world had three names—a Jewish, a Greek, and a Roman name—and used one or the other depending on the occasion. The diversity is even more apparent in <a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">6:9</a>. Hellenistic Jews differed sufficiently in their background and worship habits, especially in the use of Greek in the service, that there would be separate synagogues for them (there were seven such in Jerusalem alone). This created a potentially divisive situation for the early church, and the schism here was the result. The “Hebrews” would naturally tend to allocate the common pool to those they knew, and so the separation between the groups would add to the problem.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Acts.9.29">9:29</a> the “Hellenists” are members of the same group. Paul, a diasporate Jew himself, would naturally go to his old compatriots on his first visit to Jerusalem after his conversion. In <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a> the manuscript evidence is equally divided between “Hellenists” and “Greeks.” As “Hellenist” is used in <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a>, it designates the Greek-speaking populace of Antioch and therefore Gentiles in general.

At the quadrennial games in Tyre when the king was present, Jason the brother of Onias, who had obtained the high priesthood by corruption, “sent envoys, chosen as being Antiochian citizens from Jerusalem, to carry three hundred silver drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.19">19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).

<p class="h1">HERESY</p>
<p class="fl">A sectarian group or teaching that deviates from the norm. The Greek word (<span class="greek">hairesis</span>), literally meaning “choice,” designates a sect or faction. For example, the Sadducees were a sect within Judaism (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.17">Acts 5:17</a>), as were the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">15:5</a>). When many Jews first believed that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, they were known as “the sect of the Nazarenes” (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.5">24:5</a>). In each of these verses, the word <span class="greek">hairesis</span> denotes nothing more than a sect. After the church grew and developed, any factious group within a local church was called <span class="greek">hairesis</span>—that is, it was a sect that held certain opinions contrary to the truths established by the apostles. In view of this, Paul told the Corinthian church that factious sects would develop among them as a way of separating the false from the true (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.19">1 Cor 11:19</a>). Eventually, the word “heresy” came to connote the particular teaching that caused certain ones to break away from orthodoxy. Thus, Peter warned Christians about various false teachers who would try to deceive believers with their heretical teachings (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1">2 Pt 2:1</a>). In the modern era, this is how the word “heresy” is usually understood; it is unorthodox and/or false teaching that damages the faith of certain believers and also causes divisive factions within the church.</p>

<p class="list">2. Christian who wrote the apocryphal book called The Shepherd (referring to the work’s central shepherd figure). In The Shepherd, Hermas states that he was originally a slave, gained his freedom, married and started a business, lost nearly everything material, saw his children lapse, and finally brought his family together by acts of repentance. Hermas indicates also that he knew Clement of Rome, late-first-century bishop of Rome. From internal evidences, it is impossible to tell if this biography is fictional or not. As to external facts, references to Hermas are contradictory. Some authorities, most eminently the Muratorian Canon, a late-second-century document, make Hermas a brother of Pius, bishop of Rome about 150. In the third century, Origen thought Hermas was the individual Paul named in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.14">Romans 16:14</a>, an identification upholding Hermas’s own statements.

<p class="h2" id="TheHerodianDynasty">The Herodian Dynasty (67–47 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Herodian dynasty became prominent during the confusion that resulted in the decay of the Hasmonean dynasty, the transference of Syria and Palestine to Roman rule, and the civil wars that marked the decay of the nation. Much of what we know about the Herods comes from the historian Josephus’s writings: <span class="ital">Antiquities of the Jews</span> and <span class="ital">The Jewish War.</span></p>
<p class="h2" id="HerodtheGreat">Herod the Great (47–4 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="h3">As Governor of Galilee (47–37 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Herod the Great became governor of Galilee at 25 years of age. Although he gained the respect of both the Romans and the Galilean Jews for quickly capturing and executing the bandit leader Ezekias, some in Hyrcanus’s court thought that he was becoming too powerful and arranged to have him brought to trial. He was acquitted and released and thereafter fled to Sextus Caesar at Damascus. Sextus Caesar, governor of Syria, appointed Herod governor of Coele-Syria, and thus he became involved with Roman affairs in Syria. He remained in this position under a series of rulers and was successful in collecting taxes and suppressing various revolts. Thus, in 41 <span class="era">BC</span> when Antony came to power under Octavius Caesar, after asking the advice of Hyrcanus II, Sextus appointed Herod and Phasael as tetrarchs of Judea.</p>
<p class="h3">As King (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">The reign of Herod is divided by most scholars into three periods: (1) consolidation from 37 to 25 <span class="era">BC</span>; (2) prosperity from 25 to 13 <span class="era">BC</span>; and (3) domestic troubles from 13 to 4 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The period of consolidation extended from his accession as king in 37 <span class="era">BC</span> to the death of the sons of Babas, the last male representatives of the Hasmonean family. During this period, he had to contend with many powerful adversaries.</p>
<p>The first adversaries, the people and the Pharisees, objected to his being an Idumean, a half Jew, and a friend of the Romans. Those who opposed him were punished, and those who took his side were rewarded with favors and honors.</p>
<p>The second adversaries were those of the aristocracy who sided with Antigonus. Herod had executed 45 of the wealthiest and had confiscated their properties to replenish his own coffers.</p>
<p>The third group of adversaries was the Hasmonean family. Herod’s chief problem was his mother-in-law, Alexandra. She was upset that he had not appointed another Hasmonean to the high priesthood to replace Hyrcanus, specifically her son Aristobulus. She wrote to Cleopatra, asking her to influence Antony to force Herod to remove the appointed high priest, Ananel, and replace him with Aristobulus. Finally, Herod gave way to the pressure. In the end, after a celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles, Herod had Aristobulus drowned, making it look like an accident. Herod put Alexandra in chains and placed her under guard to keep her from causing him more trouble.</p>
<p>Herod’s fourth adversary was Cleopatra. When civil war broke out between Antony and Octavius, Herod wanted to help Antony. But Cleopatra persuaded Antony to set Herod in battle against the Arabian king Malchus, who had failed to pay tribute to her. When she saw Herod winning, she ordered her troops to help Malchus, hoping to weaken both parties to the breaking point so that she could absorb them both. After a catastrophic earthquake in his domain in 31 <span class="era">BC</span>, Herod defeated the Arabs and returned home. Soon after, on September 2, 31 <span class="era">BC</span>, Octavius defeated Antony in the Battle of Actium, resulting in the suicides of Antony and Cleopatra.</p>
<p>The second period of Herod’s reign was one of prosperity (25–14 <span class="era">BC</span>). It was a period of splendor and enjoyment interrupted by occasional disturbances. According to Josephus, the most noble of all Herod’s achievements was the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, begun in 20/19 <span class="era">BC</span> (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 15.8.1). Rabbinic literature claims, “He who has not seen the Temple of Herod has never seen a beautiful building” (Babylonian Talmud: <span class="ital">Baba Bathra</span> 4a). Prior to this, he had built theaters, amphitheaters, and racecourses for both men and horses. In 24 <span class="era">BC</span> Herod built himself a royal palace and built or rebuilt many fortresses and gentile temples, including Strato’s Tower, later renamed Caesarea.</p>
<p>During this time, he became very interested in culture and gathered around him men accomplished in Greek literature and art. Greek rhetoricians were appointed to the highest offices of the state. One of these was Nicolas of Damascus, Herod’s instructor and adviser in philosophy, rhetoric, and history. In late 24 <span class="era">BC</span> he married Mariamne, daughter of Simon, a well-known priest in Jerusalem (she will be referred to as Mariamne II).</p>
<p>During this period, Herod’s rule was favorably accepted by the people. They were annoyed, however, by two things. First, he violated Jewish law by his introduction of the quinquennial games in honor of Caesar; and second, he built theaters and racecourses. He demanded a loyalty oath from his subjects, except for a privileged few. Also, he would not allow them to congregate freely for fear of a revolt. Despite these things, he had good control of the people and twice favored them by lowering taxes (in 14 <span class="era">BC</span> he reduced taxes by one-fourth).</p>
<p>The third period of Herod’s rule was clearly marked by domestic troubles (13–4 <span class="era">BC</span>). By now he had married ten wives. His first wife, Doris, had only one son, Antipater. He repudiated Doris and Antipater when he married Mariamne I, allowing them to visit Jerusalem only during the festivals. He married Mariamne I in 37 <span class="era">BC</span>. She was the granddaughter of Hyrcanus and had five children, two daughters and three sons. The youngest son died while in Rome, and the remaining two sons were to play an important role in this part of Herod’s reign. In late 24 <span class="era">BC</span> he married his third wife, Mariamne II, to whom one child was born, Herod (Philip). Malthace, his fourth wife, was a Samaritan and mother of two sons, Archelaus and Antipas. His fifth wife, Cleopatra of Jerusalem, was the mother of Philip the tetrarch. Of the remaining five wives, only Pallas, Phaedra, and Elpsis are known by name, and none played a significant part in the events of this period.</p>
<p>Alexander and Aristobulus, the sons of Mariamne I, were his favorites. Immediately following their own marriages, troubles began within the Herodian household. Salome, Herod’s sister and mother of Berenice (wife of Aristobulus), hated these two sons, mainly because she wanted the position and favor they enjoyed for her own son. Herod decided to recall his exiled son Antipater to show Alexander and Aristobulus there was another heir to the throne. Antipater took full advantage of the situation and used every conceivable means to acquire the coveted throne. Finally, a man of bad character, Eurycles from Lacedaemon, took it upon himself to inflame the father against his two sons and vice versa. Soon other mischief makers joined Eurycles, and Herod’s patience became exhausted. He put Alexander and Aristobulus in prison and named Antipater heir.</p>
<p>In his impatience to gain the throne, Antipater attempted to poison Herod. This plot failed when Pheroras, Herod’s brother, drank the poison by mistake. Herod put Antipater in prison and reported the matter to the emperor (c. 5 <span class="era">BC</span>). At this time Herod became very ill with an incurable disease. He drew up a new will that bypassed his older sons, Archelaus and Philip, because Antipater had poisoned his mind against them also. He chose his youngest son, Antipas, as his sole successor. </p>
<p>It was during this time that the wise men arrived in Judea, searching for the newborn king of the Jews. Herod instructed them to report to him the whereabouts of this child as soon as they found him. Being warned in a dream, they did not do so, but rather returned to their homes by another route. God warned Joseph (husband of the mother of Jesus) to flee to Egypt because of Herod’s intention to kill Jesus. Joseph took his family and left Bethlehem. Shortly after, Herod killed all the male children in Bethlehem who were two years old and under.</p>
<p>Herod’s disease grew increasingly worse. Permission came from Rome to execute Antipater, which he promptly did. He again altered his will, making Archelaus king of Judea, Idumea, and Samaria; Antipas tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, and Philip tetrarch of territories east of Galilee. On the fifth day after Antipater’s execution, Herod died at Jericho in the spring of 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. The people acclaimed Archelaus as their king.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Archelaus">Archelaus (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 6)</p>
<p class="fl">Archelaus was the son of Herod the Great and Malthace (a Samaritan) and was born around 22 <span class="era">BC</span>. Archelaus was faced with a multitude of problems. He had killed 3,000 people in putting down a revolution led by people avenging the blood of those killed by his father, Herod. Thus his rule got off to a bad start. At Pentecost in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, another revolt broke out, which lasted about two and a half months and during which the temple porticoes were burned and the treasury was pillaged by the Romans. This unrest spread to the countryside of Judea and to Galilee and Perea.</p>
<p>Archelaus treated both the Jews and the Samaritans brutally (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.7.3), a fact borne out by the Gospels. When Joseph returned from his flight to Egypt and learned that Archelaus was ruling Judea, he was afraid to go there and was warned against it by God; he took the infant Jesus to Galilee instead (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.22">Mt 2:22</a>).</p>
<p>Archelaus’s tyranny finally caused the Jews and Samaritans to send a delegation to Rome and complain formally to Augustus. The fact that such bitter enemies as the Jews and Samaritans could cooperate in this matter indicates the serious nature of the complaint. Antipas and Philip also went to Rome to complain about him. Presumably they resented his neglect as their Roman representative for Palestine. Thus in <span class="era">AD</span> 6 Archelaus was deposed and exiled to Vienna in Gaul (modern Vienne on the Rhône, south of Lyons). Antipas and Philip were allowed to continue their respective rules, and Archelaus’s territories were reduced to a province ruled by prefects or procurators.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Antipas">Antipas (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 39)</p>
<p class="fl">Antipas was the younger brother of Archelaus, born around 20 <span class="era">BC</span>. Of all the Herodians, he is mentioned most in the NT because he ruled over Galilee and Perea, where both Jesus and John the Baptist concentrated their ministries.</p>
<p>Antipas’s domain was in turmoil caused by the rebellion begun at Pentecost in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. He immediately set out to restore order and rebuild what had been destroyed. Following the example of his father, Herod the Great, Antipas founded cities. Sepphoris was his first project; it was the largest city in Galilee and his capital city until he built Tiberias. Since Nazareth was only four miles (6.4 kilometers) south-southeast of Sepphoris, it is quite possible that Joseph, Mary’s husband, was employed as a carpenter (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>) to help rebuild that city.</p>
<p>Of the 12 cities built by the Herodian family, Tiberias is the most important. It was the first city in Jewish history to be founded with the municipal framework of a Greek <span class="greek">polis</span><span class="ital">.</span> It was built in honor of the reigning emperor, Tiberius. Due to the fact that a cemetery was destroyed in the process of building, Tiberias was considered unclean by the Jews. Antipas offered free houses, land and tax exemptions for the first few years to anyone who would move into the city. He completed the city in <span class="era">AD</span> 23 and made it his capital.</p>
<p>In the Christian world the incident for which Antipas is most remembered is his beheading of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-12">Mt 14:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-29">Mk 6:17-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.19-20">Lk 3:19-20</a>; <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.5.2.116-119). There was a tangle of family events leading up to the death of John the Baptist. Antipas had married the daughter of Aretas IV (the daughter’s name is unknown). Aretas IV was the Nabatean king, and Augustus may have encouraged this marriage since he favored intermarriages between various rulers to promote peace in his empire.</p>
<p>Around <span class="era">AD</span> 29 Antipas took a trip to Rome, and on the way he paid a visit to his half brother Herod Philip, who must have lived in a coastal city in Palestine. Antipas fell in love with Herodias, Philip’s wife, who was also Antipas’s niece. The idea of becoming the wife of a tetrarch appealed to her, and she agreed to marry him when he returned from Rome if he would oust Aretas’s daughter. Antipas agreed to the plan, and when Aretas’s daughter heard of it, she fled to her father. This was a breach of political alliance as well as a personal insult, which led to retaliation by Aretas.</p>
<p>The marriage of Antipas and Herodias was in violation of the Mosaic law that forbade marriage to a brother’s wife (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.16">Lv 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.21">20:21</a>) except in order to raise children for a deceased childless brother by a levirate marriage (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5">Dt 25:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.19">Mk 12:19</a>). In this case, Philip not only had a child, Salome, but he was still alive. This is the situation that John the Baptist spoke so boldly against, and Antipas threw him in prison. Herodias’s hatred of John the Baptist was too great merely to settle for his incarceration. At an appropriate time, possibly Antipas’s birthday, she planned a banquet at Machaerus in Perea. Her daughter, Salome, danced for the king, and in an impulsive moment Antipas promised her under oath that he would give her anything, up to half of his kingdom. Following her mother’s advice, she asked for John the Baptist’s head on a platter. Immediately Antipas was sorry for his rash promise, but in order to save face in the presence of his underlords, he granted the request. Thus, John’s ministry ended around <span class="era">AD</span> 31 or 32.</p>
<p>There are three specific times when Antipas and Jesus are mentioned together in the Gospels.</p>
<p>Early in Jesus’ ministry Antipas heard of him and commented, perhaps with irony, that Jesus was John the Baptist resurrected (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-2">Mt 14:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.14-16">Mk 6:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.7-9">Lk 9:7-9</a>). It was obvious to Antipas that Jesus’ ministry was even more remarkable than John’s, but he was reluctant to use force to bring about the meeting for fear of once more arousing the people against him. Eventually, Jesus withdrew from Antipas’s territories without the two meeting.</p>
<p>Later, as Jesus became more popular, Antipas saw a potential threat to his own power and threatened to kill Jesus. Thus it was that on Jesus’ final trip to Jerusalem he was warned by some of the Pharisees that he should leave Antipas’s territories for his own safety (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.31-33">Lk 13:31-33</a>). Jesus sent as answer to “that fox” that he would continue his ministry of healing and casting out demons for a little longer, and when he had finished, he would then go to Jerusalem to die. The lion and fox were often contrasted in ancient literature. The Lion of Judah, Jesus Christ, was not going to be coerced by the crafty coward, Antipas.</p>
<p>The final encounter between the two occurred when Jesus was tried by Antipas in <span class="era">AD</span> 33 (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.6-12">Lk 23:6-12</a>). Since this event is mentioned only by Luke, some scholars consider it legendary. It must be remembered, however, that Luke’s addressee was Theophilus, probably a Roman officer, who would be especially interested in the reconciliation between Pilate and Antipas mentioned in this passage.</p>
<p>According to Luke’s account, when Pilate could find no fault in Jesus, he sent him to Antipas (who was celebrating the Passover in Jerusalem). Pilate thus freed himself from an awkward situation. A more subtle reason may have been to reconcile himself to Antipas. Their relationship had been rather strained since the Galilean massacre (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.1">Lk 13:1</a>), and because Pilate brought votive shields into Jerusalem, arousing the anger of the Jews (Philo’s <span class="ital">Legatio ad Gaium</span> 299–304). When Jesus was brought before Antipas, the ruler only mocked him and sent him back to Pilate. The main political accomplishment of the incident was Antipas and Pilate’s reconciliation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PhiliptheTetrarch">Philip the Tetrarch (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 34)</p>
<p class="fl">Philip the tetrarch was the son of Herod the Great and Cleopatra of Jerusalem and was born around 22 <span class="era">BC</span>. When Herod’s will was resolved, Philip was made tetrarch over Gaulanitis, Auranitis, Batanea, Trachonitis, and Iturea, all in the northern part of Herod the Great’s domain (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). His subjects were mainly Syrian and Greek. Thus he was the first and only Herodian to have his image on his coins.</p>
<p>He built two cities. First, he rebuilt and enlarged Paneas and renamed it Caesarea Philippi. Here Peter made his confession of faith to Jesus and was given the revelation of the church (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-20">Mt 16:13-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-30">Mk 8:27-30</a>). Next, he rebuilt and enlarged Bethsaida and renamed it Julias. Here Jesus healed the blind man (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">Mk 8:22-26</a>), and in a nearby desert place he fed the 5,000 (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.10-17">Lk 9:10-17</a>).</p>
<p>Philip was not as politically ambitious as his brothers. His rule was marked by tranquility and the loyalty of his subjects. When Philip died in <span class="era">AD</span> 34, Tiberius annexed his territories to Syria. After Caligula became emperor in <span class="era">AD</span> 37, he gave the territories to Agrippa I, brother of Herodias.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AgrippaI">Agrippa I (<span class="era">AD</span> 37–44)</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="HerodAgrippaI"/>
<p class="fl">Agrippa I was the son of Aristobulus (son of Herod the Great and Mariamne I) and Berenice. He was born in 10 <span class="era">BC</span> and was the brother of Herodias.</p>
<p>Agrippa I might be considered the black sheep of the Herodian family. While at school in Rome, he lived a wanton life, incurring many debts. In Rome he became a friend of Gaius Caligula and at one point stated that he wished Caligula were king rather than Tiberius. This was overheard and reported to Tiberius, who imprisoned him. He remained in prison until Tiberius’s death six months later.</p>
<p>Upon Caligula’s accession to the throne, he released Agrippa and gave him Philip the tetrarch’s territories and the northern part of Lysanias’s territory as well as the title of king. The title of king aroused the jealousy of his sister Herodias, and that eventually led to her husband, Antipas’s, downfall. At that time (<span class="era">AD</span> 39) Agrippa acquired all of Antipas’s territories and property.</p>
<p>When Caligula died in <span class="era">AD</span> 41, Agrippa curried the favor of the new emperor Claudius, whereupon Claudius added Judea and Samaria to Agrippa’s territory. This territory was once ruled by Agrippa’s grandfather, Herod the Great.</p>
<p>Agrippa I is mentioned in the NT for his persecution of the early church in order to gain favor with the Jews (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-19">Acts 12:1-19</a>). He killed James, the son of Zebedee, and imprisoned Peter. When Peter was released by an angel, Agrippa put the sentries to death.</p>
<p>Agrippa died in <span class="era">AD</span> 44 in Caesarea. Accounts of this incident are recorded both by Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 19.9.1.274–275; <span class="ital">War</span> 2.11.5.214–215) and the Scriptures. The incident occurred at Caesarea; he was wearing a sparkling silver robe, and when the people flattered him by calling him a god, he was suddenly struck with a mortal illness and died a horrible death. He was survived by his daughters, Bernice, Mariamne, and Drusilla, and by a son, Agrippa, who was 17 at the time. Because of Agrippa II’s youth, his father’s territories were temporarily made a province.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AgrippaII">Agrippa II (<span class="era">AD</span> 50–100)</p>
<p class="fl">Agrippa II was the son of Agrippa I and Cypros. In <span class="era">AD</span> 50, six years after his father’s death, Claudius made him king of Chalcis.</p>
<p>Agrippa II was in control of the temple treasury and the vestments of the high priest and thus could appoint the high priest. The Romans consulted him on religious matters, which is probably why Festus asked him to hear the apostle Paul at Caesarea (<span class="era">AD</span> 59), where he was accompanied by his sister Bernice (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-26.32">Acts 25–26</a>).</p>
<p>In May <span class="era">AD</span> 66 the Palestinian revolution began (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.14.4.284). When Agrippa’s attempt to quell the revolt failed, he became a staunch ally of the Romans throughout the entire war (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70). During this time, Nero committed suicide, the new emperor Galba was murdered, and Vespasian became the emperor. After pledging his allegiance to the new emperor, Agrippa remained with Titus, Vespasian’s son, who was in charge of the war (Tacitus’s <span class="ital">History</span> 5.81). After the fall of Jerusalem (August 6, <span class="era">AD</span> 70), Agrippa was probably present to celebrate the destruction of his own people.</p>
<p>Following this, Vespasian added new territories to Agrippa’s kingdom, though just which ones is not known. In <span class="era">AD</span> 79 Vespasian died and Titus became emperor. Little is known of Agrippa’s rule after this, except that he wrote to the historian Josephus praising him for <span class="ital">The Jewish War,</span> and he purchased a copy of it (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Life</span> 65.361–367; <span class="ital">Apion</span> 1.9.47–52).</p>
<p>Although the Talmud implies that Agrippa II had two wives (Babylonian Talmud: <span class="ital">Sukkah</span> 27a), Josephus gives no indication that he had any wives or children. Rather, he was known for his incestuous relationship with his sister Bernice. He died around <span class="era">AD</span> 100. His death marked the end of the Herodian dynasty.</p>

<p class="h1">HERODIANS*</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish party mentioned three times in the Gospels in connection with two incidents (one in Galilee and one in Jerusalem) and associated with the Pharisees in their opposition to Christ. In <a href="?bref=Mark.3.6">Mark 3:6</a>, after the healing of the man with the withered hand, the Pharisees went out and took counsel with the Herodians, plotting to destroy Jesus. In <a href="?bref=Matt.22.16">Matthew 22:16</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.12.13">Mark 12:13</a>, the Pharisees and Herodians allied against Christ to entrap him with their question as to the lawfulness of paying taxes to Caesar. The Herodians are never mentioned in either Luke or John.</p>
<p>The real problem comes in <a href="?bref=Mark.8.15">Mark 8:15</a>, where it speaks of the “leaven of Herod.” Another reading is the “leaven of the Herodians.” However, the parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Matt.16.6">Matthew 16:6</a> speaks of the “leaven of the Sadducees.” Are the Sadducees and the Herodians the same?</p>
<p>Matthew tends to label the religious leaders as Jesus’ opponents, whereas Mark emphasizes that Jesus’ opponents were both religious and political. What then is the significance of Matthew’s use of “the leaven of the Sadducees” in place of Mark’s “leaven of Herod” or “leaven of the Herodians”? Some have speculated that the Herodians were a political party composed principally of Sadducees. Some have identified them with the Sadducees, and others with the Boethusians, whose name more often than not was used interchangeably with that of the Sadducees. The Boethusians and the Sadducees were indistinguishable theologically, but the Sadducees were loyal to the Hasmonean dynasty, whereas the Boethusians were attached to the Herodian house and consequently were called the Herodians. Thus the Herodians had political affiliations with the Herodian house and religious affiliations with the Sadducees. Along with the Sadducees, the Herodians were men of influence—the aristocrats of Palestine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, during Jesus’ time the political differences between the Herodians and the Sadducees were not as distinct because of the marriage of the Herodian Herod Antipas to the Hasmonean Herodias. The Herodians and the Sadducees would have been on the same side politically against the Pharisees, the former being pro-government, while the Pharisees were both anti-Hasmonean and anti-Herodian. Congruent with this, <a href="?bref=Matt.16.12">Matthew 16:12</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.8.15">Mark 8:15</a> represent the Pharisees and the Sadducees/Herodians as contrary parties opposing Jesus.</p>
<p>In summary, the Herodians were also known as the Boethusians. Theologically they were in agreement with the Sadducees, but politically they were more pro-Herodian than the Sadducees. While the Pharisees looked for a cataclysmic messianic kingdom to remove the present Herodian rule, the Herodians worked to keep Herod’s dynasty in power.</p>

<p class="h1">HERODIAS</p>
<p class="fl">Daughter of Aristobulus, the son of Herod the Great, and Berenice. Born between 9 and 7 <span class="era">BC</span>, her older brother was Herod Agrippa I. In 6 <span class="era">BC</span>, while still in her infancy, she was betrothed by her grandfather, Herod the Great, to his son by Mariamne II named Herod Philip. Herodias was the mother of Salome, born between <span class="era">AD</span> 15 and 19.</p>
<p>Herodias and Herod Philip lived on the seacoast of Judea, possibly at Azotus or Caesarea. In <span class="era">AD</span> 29 Herod Antipas visited Herodias’s (his niece) residence on his way to Rome. They were attracted to each other and Herodias agreed to marry him provided he would divorce his present wife, the daughter of Aretas IV, the Nebatean king of Petra. Herodias, being a Hasmonean, did not want to share the house with an Arab—longtime foes of the Hasmonean dynasty. When Aretas’s daughter got word of this plot, she secretly escaped to her father, and Herodias and Antipas were married. This incident was the beginning of hostilities between Antipas and Aretas, which eventually led to Aretas’s war against and defeat of Antipas in <span class="era">AD</span> 36.</p>
<p>John the Baptist openly denounced this marriage (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-12">Mt 14:3-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-29">Mk 6:17-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.19-20">Lk 3:19-20</a>) because Jewish law forbade marriage with one’s brother’s wife (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.16">Lv 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.21">20:21</a>), except in order to raise children for a deceased childless brother by a levirate marriage (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5">Dt 25:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.19">Mk 12:19</a>). In this case the brother, Herod Philip, was still alive and had a child, Salome. The bold denunciation by John the Baptist led to Antipas’s imprisoning him around <span class="era">AD</span> 30 or 31. Herodias wanted more than this. She arranged, possibly at Herod Antipas’s birthday, to have her daughter dance before him and his magistrates. In appreciation, Herod Antipas promised Salome up to half of his kingdom. At her mother’s bidding, she asked for John the Baptist’s head on a platter.</p>
<p>Herodias last appears in history involved in an intrigue between her brother, Agrippa I, who had been designated king by the emperor Caligula, and her husband Antipas, who had long wanted such a title. Antipas, at his wife’s insistence, went to Rome to plead his case, but he lost and was banished. Herodias, however, did remain faithful and followed him into exile, even though Caligula would not have punished her because she was Agrippa’s sister.</p>

<p class="fl">Important Transjordanian city about 50 miles (80 kilometers) due east of Jerusalem. It had originally been Moabite but was conquered by Sihon, the Amorite king, and became the capital of his kingdom (<a href="?bref=Num.21.25-30">Nm 21:25-30</a>). The city was captured when Israel advanced into Canaan, and this portion of the Amorite territory was placed under Reubenite control (<a href="?bref=Num.32.37">Nm 32:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.17">Jos 13:17</a>). However, its position on the boundary between Reuben and Gad (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.26">Jos 13:26</a>) resulted in its being occupied by the tribe of Gad. The Moabites soon contested Israel’s claim to the territory, and in the period of the judges it changed hands at least once (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12">Jgs 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.9-11">1 Sm 12:9-11</a>). Israel controlled Heshbon until around 853 <span class="era">BC</span>, when it was occupied by Mesha, king of Moab. Subsequently, it was mentioned in preexilic prophetic censures of the Moabites (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.15.4">Is 15:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.8-9">16:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.2,33-34">Jer 48:2, 33-34</a>). <a href="?bref=Jer.49.3">Jeremiah 49:3</a> seems to indicate that Heshbon was finally occupied by the neighboring Ammonites.</p>
<p>It was an important Nabatean city in the Greek period, and it was conquered by the Jews in the campaigns of Alexander Janneus (103–76 <span class="era">BC</span>). In the Roman period it was incorporated into the province of Syria.</p>

  <title>Hezekiah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HEZEKIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. King of Judah from 715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>. The account of Hezekiah’s reign is in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-20.21">2 Kings 18:1–20:21</a>, <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1-32.33">2 Chronicles 29:1–32:33</a>, and <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">Isaiah 36:1–39:8</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Chronology">Chronology</p>
<p class="fl">Hezekiah succeeded to Judah’s throne at 25 and ruled for 29 years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.2">2 Kgs 18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1">2 Chr 29:1</a>). His mother was Abi (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.2">2 Kgs 18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1">2 Chr 29:1</a>; “Abijah,” a longer form), a daughter of Zechariah. The chronology of Hezekiah’s reign is difficult to establish with certainty. The Bible says the Assyrian siege of Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, began in the fourth year of his reign and that Samaria fell in the sixth year (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.9-10">2 Kgs 18:9-10</a>), which would make his reign begin about 728 <span class="era">BC</span> and end about 699 <span class="era">BC</span>. Assyrian king Sennacherib besieged the fortified Judean cities during Hezekiah’s 14th year (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13">2 Kgs 18:13</a>), which would have been 714 <span class="era">BC</span>. Assyrian records, however, indicate that Sennacherib came to the Assyrian throne in 705 <span class="era">BC</span> and that his Judean campaign took place in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>. The most generally accepted solution to the discrepancy is that Hezekiah came to the throne in 715 <span class="era">BC</span>, probably after a co-regency with his father, Ahaz, that began in 728 <span class="era">BC</span>. That solution harmonizes with the statement that Sennacherib’s siege took place in the 14th year of Hezekiah’s reign, or 701 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HezekiahsReligiousReforms">Hezekiah’s Religious Reforms</p>
<p class="fl">Hezekiah came to the throne at a critical juncture in Judah’s history. Sargon II had taken Samaria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Judah was militarily weakened from wars and raids by surrounding nations during the reign of Ahaz. Perhaps motivated by warnings to the northern kingdom delivered by the prophets Amos and Hosea that punishment would come if Israel did not turn back to God, Hezekiah began his religious reforms soon after becoming king.</p>
<p>In the first month of his reign, Hezekiah opened the temple doors and repaired them. He brought the Levites together and ordered them to sanctify themselves and the temple and to reinstate the religious ceremonies that had long been neglected. Hezekiah brought sacrifices, and the priestly temple service was restored (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1-36">2 Chr 29</a>).</p>
<p>Hezekiah then sent invitations throughout Judah and Israel for the Passover celebration in Jerusalem (held a month later than the prescribed time because the priests and people could not be ready earlier). It was hoped that religious unification would be a prelude to political reunification of the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. However, most of the northern tribes mocked the Judean messengers who brought the invitations, and only a few persons from the tribes of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun went to Jerusalem for the celebration (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.1-27">2 Chr 30</a>).</p>
<p>After the Passover observance, the worshipers set about destroying the high places and altars. They broke the pillars and cut down the Asherim throughout Judah and Benjamin, and also went into Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.1">2 Chr 31:1</a>). Hezekiah even smashed the bronze serpent that Moses had made (<a href="?bref=Num.21.6-9">Nm 21:6-9</a>), for it had become an object of worship and was identified with a serpent deity, Nehushtan (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kgs 18:4</a>). Because of his sweeping reforms, later generations said of Hezekiah, “There was never another king like him in the land of Judah, either before or after his time” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.5">2 Kgs 18:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheAssyrianThreat">The Assyrian Threat</p>
<p class="fl">Hezekiah knew that Assyria’s growing international dominance was a serious threat to his kingdom, but following his father’s policy of submission, Hezekiah did not attempt any resistance at first.</p>
<p>The inscriptions of the Assyrian king Sargon II record his victorious campaign in 711 <span class="era">BC</span> against a revolt by Aziru, king of Ashdod, who requested help from Egypt and Judah. Perhaps a prophecy received by Isaiah warned Hezekiah not to interfere with the Ashdod siege (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.1-6">Is 20</a>), and so no punitive action was taken against Judah by Assyria. Sargon died in 705, and his son Sennacherib came to the throne. This triggered widespread rebellion throughout the Assyrian provinces. Hezekiah withheld tribute from the new Assyrian ruler and, taking advantage of the confused situation, made raids against the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.8">2 Kgs 18:8</a>). After subduing rebellious elements in the East, Sennacherib began his campaign against the “land of Hatti” (the Assyrian name for the western countries) in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>. In preparation Hezekiah repaired Jerusalem’s city wall, raised towers on it, built another wall outside it, and strengthened the Millo in the City of David. He also stockpiled abundant quantities of weapons and shields (<a href="?bref=2Chr.32.5">2 Chr 32:5</a>). Knowing the necessity of an adequate water supply for a city under siege, Hezekiah had a 1,777-foot (542-meter) tunnel cut through solid rock from the spring of Gihon to the Siloam Pool to bring water into the city and to prevent the Assyrians from gaining access to the spring water outside the city (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kgs 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.3-4">2 Chr 32:3-4</a>). The Siloam inscription, carved inside the tunnel itself, records the completion of that remarkable conduit and is one of the oldest preserved examples of the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>Sennacherib invaded Palestine and, after an extensive campaign, put down the rebellion there. That campaign is well documented in Assyrian records, including a description of his siege on Jerusalem in 701, and this documentation is supplemented by the biblical account (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-19.37">2 Kgs 18:13–19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.1-22">2 Chr 32:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-37.38">Is 36–37</a>). Sidon, the cities of Phoenicia, and the immediate neighbors of Judah (including Byblos, Arnon, Moab, Edom, and Ashdod) submitted to the Assyrians. Resistant Philistine cities were also taken. Sennacherib laid siege against Ekron, whose king, Padi (a loyal subject of Sennacherib), had been taken prisoner by his own subjects and turned over in chains to Hezekiah. A large Egyptian and Ethiopian army failed to relieve the Ekronites, who were defeated by the Assyrians in the vicinity of Eltekah. Ekron was captured, and Padi was recalled to his throne by Sennacherib.</p>
<p>Sennacherib then turned his attention to the fortified cities of Judah and took them one by one (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13">2 Kgs 18:13</a>). Assyrian records claim that he captured 46 walled cities and countless villages, including Lachish and Debir (southwest of Jerusalem), 200,150 people, homes, cattle, and flocks without number. While Lachish was still under siege, Hezekiah saw that it was hopeless to resist and sent word to Sennacherib offering to surrender and pay whatever tribute he would impose. The Assyrian ruler demanded an enormous tribute of 300 talents of silver (800 talents according to Assyrian records, either an exaggerated figure or computed by a different standard) and 30 talents of gold. In order to pay that tribute, Hezekiah took all the silver in the temple and the royal treasuries, and stripped the gold from the temple doors and doorposts (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.14-16">2 Kgs 18:14-16</a>). This treasure was sent to Sennacherib along with other gifts that, according to the Assyrian account, included some of Hezekiah’s own daughters as concubines.</p>
<p>The account in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17-19.37">2 Kings 18:17–19:37</a> raises the question of whether there was another invasion of Judah at a later date, or whether this passage gives additional details about the invasion of 701. Although Hezekiah had already submitted and paid tribute, these verses describe further Assyrian demands. Those who believe it was a single invasion suggest that this is an account of the Assyrian deputation sent by Sennacherib to demand Jerusalem’s surrender while Lachish was still under siege. The deputation included the Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh (titles of court officials rather than personal names). They warned the citizens that their God was no more able to save them than the gods of other cities defeated by the Assyrians. In distress Hezekiah sent word to the prophet Isaiah, who assured the king that Sennacherib would hear a rumor and return to his own land and there die by the sword (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.1-7">2 Kgs 19:1-7</a>). Shortly afterward Sennacherib received word of Babylon’s revolt in his eastern provinces, so he departed at once without taking Jerusalem. Assyrian records do not claim that Jerusalem was taken but only say that Hezekiah was “shut up in Jerusalem like a bird in a cage.” Judah’s surrounding neighbors celebrated their deliverance and brought gifts of gratitude to Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.32.23">2 Chr 32:23</a>).</p>
<p>Later, the Assyrian king heard that Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, was advancing against him, so he sent another threatening message to Hezekiah, probably to warn him against making an alliance with Tirhakah. Hezekiah took the matter before the Lord and received word from Isaiah that the Assyrian king would return the same way he came and that Jerusalem would be untouched. Soon afterward, in a miraculous intervention by God, 185,000 Assyrian troops were killed, and the Assyrian monarch abandoned his plans to conquer Hezekiah. That embarrassing calamity understandably is not mentioned by the Assyrian records. In 681 Sennacherib was killed by two of his sons as Isaiah had predicted (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.7,37">2 Kgs 19:7, 37</a>).</p>
<p>Sometime prior to 701, Hezekiah became seriously ill, and Isaiah told him to prepare for death. The king earnestly prayed for an extension of life, and God promised him 15 more years as well as deliverance from the Assyrians. Hezekiah asked Isaiah for a sign that he would be healed, and a shadow cast by the sun moved backward 10 steps contrary to its normal direction (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.1-11">2 Kgs 20:1-11</a>).</p>
<p>Sometime after his recovery Hezekiah received a delegation with presents from Merodach-baladan of Babylon, ostensibly to congratulate Hezekiah on his return to health. The real object of the visit was probably to enlist Hezekiah as an ally in a conspiracy being formed against Assyria. The king showed the Babylonian envoys all the gold, silver, and other valuables he possessed. This act brought a warning from Isaiah that the day would come when all those treasures would be carried away to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12-19">2 Kgs 20:12-19</a>).</p>
<p>Hezekiah lived the remainder of his life in peace and prosperity. It may have been during this time that he encouraged literary efforts in Judah, which included copying some of Solomon’s proverbs (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.1-29.27">Prv 25–29</a>). Upon his death in 686, he was succeeded by his son Manasseh, who probably had become co-regent 10 years earlier.</p>

The founding of the city is credited to Eumenes II of Pergamum (197–160 <span class="era">BC</span>). Hierapolis, because of its mineral springs and deep cave known as the Plutonium, came to be a cultic center for the worship of Phrygian gods. Lethal vapors issued from the cave, which was thought to be an entrance to the underworld. Residents believed that a priest was seated deep inside the cave and that on certain occasions prophecies would be uttered for those seeking them. The mineral baths attracted visitors, and gradually the city developed into a leading commercial center. As Roman rule enveloped the city, Hierapolis became part of the province of Asia.</p>
<p>Under Paul’s influence, Christianity took hold there during his stay in Ephesus. Paul mentions Hierapolis in connection with the believer Epaphras, who worked diligently for the inhabitants as well as those in Laodicea and Colosse (<a href="?bref=Col.4.13">Col 4:13</a>). Even though several early Christians were martyred there, the church continued to grow. In the fourth century, Christians closed off the Plutonium with stones.</p>

<p class="h1">HIEROGLYPHICS*</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="EgyptianHieroglyphics"/>
<p class="fl">Early form of writing by using pictorial signs. The Egyptian, Hittite, Mayan, and Cretan civilizations—each one independently of the others—developed hieroglyphics. The hieroglyphics with which we are most familiar are Egyptian. They began as pictures of the objects they represent, so that a circle with rays emanating from the circumference would indicate the sun. This type of script began to be used in Egypt about 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. It was usually carved in stone but sometimes was written on papyrus with a reed pen. As papyrus began to be used more often, the symbols employed for the stone engravings became much more awkward to use on papyrus. The scribes and bookkeepers who used these symbols developed a cursive form of hieroglyphics called hieratic. This was later refined to a shorthand script called demotic.</p>
<p>As the script changed, so did the meaning of the signs. These signs began as picture-symbols, but they came to represent the sounds of the symbol. Thus we might use a ham pictorially for the verb “meet” because a ham is a type of meat, a word that sounds like “meet.” The Egyptians did not convert these signs into an alphabet as did many of their neighbors.</p>
<p>The use of hieroglyphics in Egypt lasted until the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>, when it was finally replaced by the alphabetic scripts of Latin and Greek. During the Middle Ages, there was little interest in or knowledge of hieroglyphics. During the Renaissance, interest revived, but scholars were unable to interpret the script. Its meaning remained a mystery until members of Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt in 1779 discovered the Rosetta Stone with inscriptions in Greek, demotic, and hieroglyphic. Twenty-five years later the Frenchman Jean-Francois Champollion deciphered the stone.</p>

Hostile toward Palestinian Jews who refused to accept Greek ways, Antiochus Eupator sent his vice-regent Lysias with 80,000 troops to solicit compliance. Maccabeus and his band, led by an angel, wrecked Lysias’s expedition and evoked a settlement that permitted Jews to maintain their ancestral customs.

  <title>High Place</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HIGH PLACE</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase commonly translated from the Hebrew bamah, which apparently derived from a word originally meaning “the back (or ridge) of an animal.” Thus it came to refer to a height or hill or a stone burial cairn. Usually it was an elevated worship center, such as the ones referred to in <a href="?bref=Num.33.51-52">Numbers 33:51-52</a>, <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.13-14">1 Samuel 9:13-14</a>, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.3">2 Kings 12:3</a>, <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.11">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.1-2">Ezekiel 36:1-2</a>. But sometimes (as in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.8">2 Kgs 23:8</a>) it was a <span class="hebrew">bamah</span> of the gate, a sanctuary with no special reference to height, located at the city gate as in Dan and Beersheba. It might even have been placed in a declivity (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.31">Jer 7:31</a>).</p>
<p>That a <span class="hebrew">bamah</span> might simply be a burial place with commemorative stelae or memorial stones is clear from such a passage as <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.7">Ezekiel 43:7</a>. An illustration of such a <span class="hebrew">bamah</span> is the so-called Gezer high place. This Bronze Age center with its 10 huge pillars is now interpreted as a mortuary shrine instead of a sanctuary in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p>A second word translated “high place” is <span class="hebrew">ramah</span> (elevation), from the Hebrew meaning “to be high.” Ezekiel used this term to refer to illicit worship centers (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.24-25,31-39">16:24-25, 31-39</a>) that evidently had no necessary connection with height.</p>
<p>One of the best-known and best-preserved of all high places in the vicinity of Palestine is the great high place at Petra, discovered by George L. Robinson in 1900. Located on a ridge west of the Khazneh, or treasury, it consists of a large rectangular court and adjacent altars. The court is about 47 feet (14.3 meters) long and 21 feet (6.4 meters) wide and is cut into the rock platform to a depth of 18 inches (45.7 centimeters). West of the court stand a square and a round altar, each hewn from the solid rock. South of the court is a pool measuring about eight and a half by nine and a half feet (2.6 by 2.9 meters) and cut four feet (1.2 meters) into the rock. South of the pool stand two sacred obelisks or pillars, also cut out of the solid rock. This whole complex is reached from a lower terrace by two flights of stairs. At this center the ancient Nabatean inhabitants of Petra evidently engaged in feasts and sacrifices to honor their gods. Though the worship center in its present form does not date before the first century <span class="era">BC</span>, it preserves an ancient tradition of Transjordan and illustrates the pagan and Israelite high places of OT times.</p>
<p>The pagan high place was usually located on a physical height, where one could feel closer to the god. Its first essential was an altar, which might be a heap of earth, unhewn stones, or a unit cut out of the solid rock. Second, there was a stone pillar (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.3">Dt 12:3</a>) or obelisk <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">matsebah</span><span class="ital">)</span> representing the male deity and having phallic associations; third, a tree or pole <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">asherah</span><span class="ital">)</span> representing the female deity (a fertility goddess); and fourth, a laver for ceremonial washings. A sanctuary with an image of the deity also required a building of some sort to protect it (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.29">2 Kgs 17:29</a>).</p>
<p>At these pagan high places sacrifices of animals and sometimes of human beings took place, and religious prostitution or homosexual acts were common. It is natural that such practices should develop in a context of sympathetic magic, where promiscuity and breeding among human beings was supposed to influence animals and crops.</p>
<p>The Hebrews had legitimate high places between the time of the destruction of the tabernacle at Shiloh and construction of the temple, though there was little similarity to pagan accoutrements or practices, apart from the presence of an altar and the offering of sacrifices. At one high place the people ate a sacrificial meal before Samuel anointed Saul king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.12-10.1">1 Sm 9:12–10:1</a>). The tabernacle was located at the high place of Gibeon during the reign of David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.39">1 Chr 16:39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.29">21:29</a>). Solomon offered sacrifices at several high places (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.2-3">1 Kgs 3:2-3</a>), and at the high place of Gibeon he met God and was granted the gift of wisdom for his administration (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.4-15">4-15</a>). Once Solomon’s temple was completed, high places were eliminated and were off-limits for the Hebrews.</p>
<p>When the Hebrews entered Canaan, they encountered pagan peoples who had long worshiped at high places. God commanded the Israelites to destroy those sanctuaries (<a href="?bref=Num.33.51-52">Nm 33:51-52</a>) to avoid contamination by them, but the warning went largely unheeded. At the height of the Hebrew kingdom, after Solomon had completed the temple, he built high places for the god Chemosh of Moab, Molech of Ammon, and other gods of his pagan wives. For this sin God determined to split the Hebrew kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.7-11">1 Kgs 11:7-11</a>).</p>
<p>After the division of the kingdom, Jeroboam established high places at Dan and Bethel, and Ahab and others proliferated their construction. Judgment was prophesied (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.2-3">1 Kgs 13:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.7-18">2 Kgs 17:7-18</a>), and ultimately the kingdom of Israel went into captivity to Assyria for her idolatry.</p>
<p>Rehoboam, the first king of the southern kingdom, spread high places all over his domain (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.23-24">1 Kgs 14:23-24</a>). Though King Asa launched a revival of true religion, he did not remove the high places (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.12-14">15:12-14</a>). Jehoshaphat also initiated revival, but again the high places remained (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.43">22:43</a>). On the other hand, his son Jehoram and his wife, Athaliah, encouraged their construction (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.11">2 Chr 21:11</a>). Joash, during his revival, did not eliminate the high places (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.3">2 Kgs 12:3</a>), nor did the good king Uzziah in similar efforts (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.3-4">15:3-4</a>). Ahaz made no pretense of faithfulness to God, and actively encouraged the idolatry of the pagan sanctuaries (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.3-4">16:3-4</a>). Finally, Hezekiah launched a campaign against the high places (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.1">2 Chr 31:1</a>), but his policies were reversed during the reign of his wicked son Manasseh (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.2-9">2 Kgs 21:2-9</a>). Josiah led the last Judean revival and again attacked the high places (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.5,8">23:5, 8</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.12">16:12</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.35">Jer 48:35</a>), Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.6.3">Ez 6:3</a>), Hosea (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.8">Hos 10:8</a>), and Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.9">Am 7:9</a>) roundly condemned these centers of idolatry. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=CanaaniteDeitiesandReligion_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Canaanite Deities and Religion</a>; <a href="?item=GodsandGoddesses_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Gods and Goddesses</a>; <a href="?item=Grove_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Grove</a>; <a href="?item=IdolsIdolatry_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Idols, Idolatry</a>.</p>

<p class="list">1. Father of Abdon, one of the judges (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.13-15">Jgs 12:13-15</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Jewish teacher and scholar (c. 60 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 20) who helped to develop the oral law and may have founded rabbinic Judaism. Hillel was called “the Elder,” a title that indicates a person holding a position of honor, generally given to those who stood at the head of the community. Born in Babylonia, he moved to Palestine for more advanced studies under two outstanding scholars, Shemaiah and Abtalyon. He first gained recognition when the sons of Bathyra, the chief interpreters of the Law at the time, could not decide on an answer to an important legal problem, namely, whether or not the offering of the paschal lamb overrode the Sabbath prohibitions. Having heard that there was a man living in Jerusalem who had studied under Shemaiah and Abtalyon, they sent for Hillel and told him the problem. Hillel’s answer was that the paschal offering took precedence over the Sabbath, and he argued his point so successfully that his ruling was accepted. He was then appointed to replace the sons of Bathyra. It has been argued, however, that Hillel’s appointment can hardly be attributed solely to this one incident.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hillel was one of the first persons to apply advanced principles of interpretation in determining practical law and action. Thus he is especially important for the development of the Talmud and the oral law. These rules provided the basis for later rabbinic interpretation.</p>
<p class="list-text">There are many stories describing Hillel’s character, picturing him as a man of great humility and extreme patience, pursuing peace even at the expense of truth. He is usually contrasted with his colleague Shammai, who is portrayed as impatient and ill-tempered. The most famous tale tells of a heathen who came to Shammai to be converted on the condition that he teach him the entire Law while he stood on one foot. Shammai snubbed him, and so the heathen went to Hillel. Hillel replied, “What is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor; this is the entire Law, all the rest is commentary. Now go and learn it.” Hillel thus became a model for Jews throughout history.</p>

After David had conquered Jerusalem and moved his capital there, Hiram sent cedarwood, masons, and carpenters to build David’s palace (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.11">2 Sm 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.1">1 Chr 14:1</a>). Hiram remained David’s friend throughout his life (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1">1 Kgs 5:1</a>), and after David’s death, he sought to continue that friendship with Solomon. When Solomon was ready to build the temple, Hiram provided wood from the forests of Lebanon, gold, and skilled craftsmen to help build and furnish the temple; Solomon, in return, gave Hiram wheat and oil for his household. Moreover, Solomon gave Hiram 20 cities in Galilee, although Scripture indicates that Hiram was not pleased with them (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-11">1 Kgs 5:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.10-14">9:10-14</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Although the Israelites were not a maritime people, Solomon did maintain a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">1 Kgs 9:26-28</a>). Hiram gave his assistance to Solomon by supplying sailors and perhaps ships to make Solomon’s fleet operable. The Phoenicians were noted sailors, who sailed the Mediterranean Sea as far west as Tarshish in Spain.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hiram was probably the son of Abibal. Hiram reigned in Tyre for 34 years and died at the age of 53. Phoenician historians record that Solomon married the daughter of Hiram.</p>

He was responsible for the creation of various furnishings in the temple: 2 bronze pillars, the capitals that adorned the pillars, the molten sea and the 12 oxen on which it stood, the 10 lavers with their bases, as well as shovels, pots, and basins.</p>
<p class="list-text">His name is also spelled Huram in <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.11">2 Chronicles 4:11</a>. He is called Huram-abi (abi meaning “master”) in <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.13">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.16">4:16</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">HITTITES</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical people who figure largely in the promises of a land for the descendants of Abram and the children of Israel. Once unknown to secular history and thought to be a mythical people by some critics of Bible history, information about the Hittites has been uncovered by archaeologists and historians, and they now are known to have had an empire centered in Asia Minor. They were of sufficient military strength to challenge the armies of Egypt under the vainglorious Ramses II and fought him to a standstill at Kadesh on the Orontes.</p>
<p>For the most part, the biblical references do not suggest that the Hittites were more than a minor group, but the association of Hittite kings and Egypt with Solomon’s trade in horses and their involvement in the conflicts of Syria and Israel in the divided monarchy indicate that the Hittites were a people of great consequence.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">The Hittite Empire had its center in Anatolia (Asia Minor, modern Turkey), with its capital at Hattusas (modern Baghazkoy) at the bend of the Halys River (present Kizil Irmak). The empire at times extended over a much larger area without definite boundaries since it included city-states that were dependencies of the Anatolian kingdom, related to it by treaties but otherwise not a part of it. Because of their presence in Palestine-Syria, the Hittites made their influence felt in Egypt and are well known from the art and inscriptions of that country. The presence of Hittites in Palestine is widely attested in the Bible, and the power of the Hittites in Palestinian cities like Hebron is indicated in patriarchal times.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">The Hittites (also known as Hattians) were one of several groups of peoples, thought to be neither Semitic nor Indo-European, who occupied the Anatolian plateau in the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. In the late part of this millennium Indo-Europeans overran the area and assumed political power.</p>
<p>History in the true sense, that is, based on written records, begins in Anatolia around 1900 <span class="era">BC</span> with the arrival of Assyrian traders. These merchants established themselves in various cities and corresponded with their homeland using cuneiform tablets. Numbers of these records have been found near Kayseri. These mention the struggle among Hittite principalities for supremacy in Anatolia and refer to a King Anittas, who is known from Hittite sources of later date.</p>
<p>During the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>, the dominance of the Hurrians was broken by the campaigns of the Egyptian king Thutmose III, but another Hurrian kingdom, Mitanni, soon became prominent in western Asia. Mitanni presented a threat to the Hittites, but with the arrival of an ambitious and energetic monarch, Suppiluliuma I (c. 1380–1340 <span class="era">BC</span>), there came a resurgence of Hittite vitality and the strength of the empire. This was the time of the writing of the Amarna letters, with their testimony of the confused situation in Palestine-Syria.</p>
<p>Suppiluliuma carried out a brilliant military expedition against Mitanni and then, by combining force with diplomatic genius, forged for himself a buffer zone of vassal city-states, which were bound to him by treaties, copies of which were found in the Hittite archives.</p>
<p>During the first half of the 14th century, the languor of Amenhotep III and the religious preoccupation of Akhenaten had allowed the Asiatic empire of Egypt to dwindle away into a memory. But with the beginning of the 19th dynasty, the Egyptians became concerned about regaining what was lost. The contest for Palestine-Syria reached its climax with the famous battle at Kadesh on the Orontes, where the initial advantage was won by Hittite chariots. Ramses II celebrated the battle as a victory, although he barely escaped with his life. The Hittite king, Muwatallis, also claimed a triumph, but in political terms the battle was inconclusive. The next Hittite king after him, Hattusilis III, signed a treaty with Ramses II in the 21st year of the reign of the Egyptian king; the pact was confirmed by the marriage of the daughter of Hattusilis to Ramses II.</p>
<p>Around the middle of the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Hittites were threatened from the west by the Ahhiyawa, possibly to be associated with the Achaeans and the Sea Peoples (see <a href="?item=PhilistiaPhilistines_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Philistia, Philistines</a>). It was a wave of the Sea Peoples that brought the Hittite Empire to an end around 1190 <span class="era">BC</span> and surged along the eastern Mediterranean coast until it was finally stopped in the Nile Delta by Ramses III.</p>
<p>In northern Syria, independent city-states continued to be ruled by kings who bore Hittite names and erected monuments inscribed with Hittite hieroglyphs. The Assyrians continued to refer to the area as the Land of Hatti, and the OT speaks of these rulers of principalities as “kings of the Hittites.” These little kingdoms were soon placed under Assyrian tribute and became Assyrian provinces in the reigns of Shalmaneser V and Sargon II, the rulers who also put an end to the northern kingdom of Israel by conquering Samaria in 721 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LanguagesandLiterature">Languages and Literature</p>
<p class="fl">In the texts found at Boghazkoy, eight different languages were employed. Of these, only two, Hittite and Akkadian, were used for official royal records. Akkadian was the lingua franca of the empire and was also the main language of the Amarna tablets. Hurrian is the only other language in which complete texts were written. The other languages occur mostly in short passages in Hittite religious documents, and one is identified only by some technical terms.</p>
<p>There were eight languages: (1) Hittite, also called Nesite, was recognized by B. Hrozny as having affinities with Indo-European. This proposal met with skepticism among scholars for a while, but it has been proved beyond question. (2) Hattic (Hattian), the language of the aboriginal people of Anatolia, is used for speeches of the priests in the performance of the cultic ritual relating to the Hittite pantheon. (3) Luwian is another Indo-European language, closely related to Hittite. (4) Palaic, a little-known language, is also Indo-European. (5) Hurrian appears in many ritual texts. Fragments of a Hurrian translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh were found. One of the Amarna tablets, written by Tushratta, king of Mitanni, to Amenhotep III, was in Hurrian. Also represented are (6) the Aryan language of the Mitanni rulers, (7) Akkadian, and (8) Sumerian. In addition to the cuneiform script, the Hittites used hieroglyphs, which have been found inscribed on stone and lead.</p>
<p>The Hittite archives contained texts of official documents, such as treaties, laws, instructions, annals of the kings, letters, and other historical records. There was much religious literature, including myths, legends, epics, incantations, rituals, omens, prayers, and descriptions of festivals and their celebration.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePeople">The People</p>
<p class="fl">The diversity of language characteristic of Hittite civilization is paralleled by the great mixture of ethnic backgrounds, particularly over the geographic range covered by the empire. The physical appearance of the Hittites is known from their own reliefs and from representation on Egyptian monuments. Their own depictions show the Hittites with unattractive faces, heavy coats, tall pointed caps, and shoes with turned-up toes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Religion">Religion</p>
<p class="fl">The Hittites had a pantheon of deities, known by name from the inscriptions and by appearance from the reliefs. Gods may be identified by a weapon or tool carried in the right hand, a symbol in the left hand, wings or similar appurtenances, or the sacred animal on which a divinity may stand.</p>
<p>A principal god was the weather god, whose sacred animal was the bull. Out of the multiplicity of local cults, there arose an official pantheon, headed by the sun goddess, Arinna, who was the supreme deity of the state and of the king. The treaties of the Hittites typically have a long list of divinities who served as witnesses to the treaty and oath.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HittitesandtheBible">Hittites and the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">The name “Hittite(s)” occurs nearly 50 times in the OT but does not appear in the NT. If one includes the occurrences of the name of Heth, the father of the Hittites, there are more than 60 citations in the Bible. Most have to do with the presence of Hittites in Canaan. Their progenitor and eponym, Heth, is listed second among the sons of Canaan in the “table of nations” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.15">Gn 10:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.13">1 Chr 1:13</a>). Most of the references to the “sons of Heth” appear in the narrative of the purchase of the cave of Machpelah by Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">Gn 23</a>).</p>
<p>The OT references to Hittites include <a href="?bref=Gen.26.34">Genesis 26:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.27.46">27:46</a> (Hittite women); <a href="?bref=Gen.49.29-32">49:29-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.50.13">50:13</a> (Ephron); <a href="?bref=Exod.33.2">Exodus 33:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.29">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.17">20:17</a> (their destruction); <a href="?bref=Josh.11.3">Joshua 11:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.8">12:8</a> (occupants of Canaan); <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.6">1 Samuel 26:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-12.31">2 Samuel 11–12</a> (Uriah, a warrior under David); <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20">1 Kings 9:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.29">10:29</a> (laborers or traders under Solomon); <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1">11:1</a> (wife of Solomon); <a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1">Ezra 9:1</a> (foreigners); <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.3,45">Ezekiel 16:3, 45</a> (Jerusalem’s ancestors).</p>

  <title>Hivites</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HIVITES</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a pre-Israelite group living in Canaan. Though not yet discovered/rated archaeologically or from secular history as a people, they were regarded as emerging from a son of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.17">Gn 10:17</a>) and as inhabiting areas of the Lebanon Mountains (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.3">Jgs 3:3</a>) and Mt Hermon (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.3">Jos 11:3</a>). They are referred to frequently as a group dispossessed by Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.8">Jos 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.11">24:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20">1 Kgs 9:20</a>) but who managed to survive into the kingdom period (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.7">2 Sm 24:7</a>) and lived at that time near Tyre as well as in other possible areas. Some scholars think that an error in copying, involving the changing of the letters <span class="ital">r</span> (resh) to <span class="ital">w</span> (waw) was responsible for the origin of the name Hivite from Horite.</p>
<p>Others have suggested a scribal confusion of names, since Zibeon is called a Hivite in <a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">Genesis 36:2</a> and a Horite in verses <a href="?bref=Gen.36.20">20</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.36.29">29</a>. In several cases the Septuagint gives “Horite” in place of the Masoretic Text “Hivite” (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.2">Gn 34:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.7">Jos 9:7</a>). Other passages in the Septuagint read “Hittite” rather than “Hivite” (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.3">Jos 11:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.3">Jgs 3:3</a>).</p>
<p>The overlapping or equivalence of Hivite and Horite in <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1-43">Genesis 36</a> probably indicates some relationship between the two peoples (cf. Ishmaelites and Midianites in <a href="?bref=Gen.37.27-28,36">Gn 37:27-28, 36</a>). Perhaps both Horites and Hivites are related to the Hurrians, who are well attested archaeologically.</p>
<p>The fact that there are some 25 occurrences of the name “Hivite(s)” in the OT, nearly one-third of which come in Joshua, makes it probable that they were a distinct people. Aside from Hivites in Palestine, they also appeared in Edomite territory (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">Gn 36:2</a>). OT references to Hivites include Hamor (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.2">Gn 34:2</a>), the men of Gibeon (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.7">Jos 9:7</a>), the northern Hivites (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.3-8">Jgs 3:3-8</a>), and those who lived near Tyre (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.7">2 Sm 24:7</a>). During the reign of Solomon, the Hivites and other foreign inhabitants of the land were made slaves; that is, they were put under forced labor (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-21">1 Kgs 9:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.7">2 Chr 8:7</a>).</p>

He is usually called Jethro (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">Ex 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.4.18">4:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.18.1-12">18:1-12</a>), but also Reuel (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">Ex 2:18</a>).</p>
<p>The confusion surrounding the name Hobab has never been satisfactorily resolved. <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a> seems to identify Hobab with Jethro; there is some manuscript evidence for adding “Hobab” to “the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law” in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Judges 1:16</a>, and to the mention of Reuel in <a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">Exodus 2:18</a>. But Hobab could be Jethro’s son, on one reading of <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Numbers 10:29a</a>: “Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law.” In this passage Moses requests that Hobab accompany Israel as guide and adviser in the wilderness.</p>

  <title>Holiness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HOLINESS</p>
<p class="fl">Chief attribute of God and a quality to be developed in his people. “Holiness” and the adjective “holy” occur more than 900 times in the Bible. The primary OT word for holiness means “to cut” or “to separate.” Fundamentally, holiness is a cutting off or separation from what is unclean and a consecration to what is pure.</p>
<p>In the OT, holiness as applied to God signifies his transcendence over creation and the moral perfection of his character. God is holy in that he is utterly distinct from his creation and exercises sovereign majesty and power over it. His holiness is especially prominent in the Psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.47.8">47:8</a>) and the Prophets (<a href="?bref=Ezek.39.7">Ez 39:7</a>), where “holiness” emerges as a synonym for Israel’s God. Thus, Scripture ascribes to God the title “Holy” (<a href="?bref=Isa.57.15">Is 57:15</a>), “Holy One” (<a href="?bref=Job.6.10">Jb 6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.15">Is 43:15</a>), and “Holy One of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.18">Ps 89:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.14">Is 60:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.50.29">Jer 50:29</a>).</p>
<p>In the OT God’s holiness denotes that the Lord is separate from all that is evil and defiled (cf. <a href="?bref=Job.34.10">Jb 34:10</a>). His holy character is the standard of absolute moral perfection (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.16">Is 5:16</a>). God’s holiness—his transcendent majesty and the purity of his character—are skillfully balanced in <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1-9">Psalm 99</a>. Verses <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1-3">1 through 3</a> portray God’s distance from the finite and earthbound, whereas verses <a href="?bref=Ps.99.4">4</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.99.5">5</a> emphasize his separation from sin and evil.</p>
<p>In the OT God demanded holiness in the lives of his people. Through Moses, God said to the congregation of Israel, “You shall be holy; for I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God am holy” (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lv 19:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The holiness enjoined by the OT was twofold: (1) external, or ceremonial; and (2) internal, or moral and spiritual. OT ceremonial holiness, prescribed in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the OT) included ritual consecration to God’s service. Thus priests and Levites were sanctified by a complex process of ritual consecration (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.1-46">Ex 29</a>), as were the Hebrew Nazirites, which means “separated ones” (<a href="?bref=Num.6.1-21">Nm 6:1-21</a>). Prophets like Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.9">2 Kgs 4:9</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.5">Jer 1:5</a>) were also sanctified for a special prophetic ministry in Israel.</p>
<p>But the OT also draws attention to the inner, moral, and spiritual aspects of holiness. Men and women, created in the image of God, are called to cultivate the holiness of God’s own character in their lives (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lv 19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.40">Nm 15:40</a>). In the NT the ceremonial holiness prominent in the Pentateuch recedes to the background. Whereas much of Judaism in Jesus’ time sought a ceremonial holiness by works (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-5">Mk 7:1-5</a>), the NT stresses the ethical rather than the formal dimension of holiness (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.7.6-12">6-12</a>). With the coming of the Holy Spirit, the early church perceived that holiness of life was a profound internal reality that should govern an individual’s thought and attitudes in relation to persons and objects in the external world.</p>
<p>The NT Greek equivalent of the common Hebrew word for holiness signifies an inner state of freedom from moral fault and a relative harmony with the moral perfection of God. The word “godlikeness” or “godliness” captures the sense of the primary Greek word for holiness. Another Greek word approximates the dominant OT concept of holiness as external separation from the profane and dedication to the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because the NT writers assumed the OT portrait of deity, holiness is ascribed to God in relatively few apostolic texts. Jesus affirmed the ethical nature of God when he enjoined his disciples to pray that the Father’s name might be esteemed for what it is: “Hallowed be thy name” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.9">Mt 6:9</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). In the book of Revelation the Father’s moral perfection is extolled with the threefold ascription of holiness borrowed from Isaiah: “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come” (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.8">Rv 4:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Is 6:3</a>). Luke, however, contemplated God’s holiness in terms of the dominant OT concept of his transcendence and majesty (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.49">Lk 1:49</a>).</p>
<p>Similarly the holiness of Jesus Christ is asserted in the NT. Luke (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">Lk 1:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.34">4:34</a>), Peter (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.14">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.27-30">4:27-30</a>), the writer of Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">Heb 7:26</a>), and John (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.7">Rv 3:7</a>) ascribe holiness to both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>Since the Spirit comes from God, discloses his holy character, and is the instrument of God’s holy purposes in the world, he also is absolutely holy (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18">Mt 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.3.16">3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">28:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.15">Lk 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.14">4:14</a>). The common title “Holy Spirit” underscores the ethical perfection of the third person of the Godhead (<a href="?bref=John.3.5-8">Jn 3:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.16-17,26">14:16-17, 26</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, holiness also characterizes Christ’s church. The apostle Paul taught that Christ loved the church and died for it “that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word” (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.26">Eph 5:26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Peter addressed the church as a holy people in language borrowed from the OT. Separated from the unbelieving nations and consecrated to the Lord, the church is “a holy nation” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>).</p>
<p>But the NT more often discusses holiness in relation to individual Christians. Believers in Christ are frequently designated as “saints,” literally meaning “holy ones,” since through faith God justifies sinners, pronouncing them “holy” in his sight. A justified sinner is by no means morally perfect, but God does declare believers to be guiltless. Thus, although Christians at Corinth, for example, were plagued with numerous sins, Paul could address his erring friends as those who were “sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Despite their problems, the Corinthian believers were “holy ones” in Christ.</p>
<p>The NT, however, places great stress upon the reality of practical holiness in the Christian’s daily experience. The God who freely declares a person righteous through faith in Christ commands that the believer progress in holiness of life. In God’s plan, a growth in holiness should accompany believing. God graciously provides the spiritual resources to enable Christians to be “partakers of the divine nature” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.4">2 Pt 1:4</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">HOLOFERNES</p>
<p class="fl">According to the book of Judith, the chief Assyrian general under King Nebuchadnezzar (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.4">Jdt 2:4</a>) who was ordered by the king to “go and attack the whole west country” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.6">6</a>). He ravaged the nations one after another (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.21-27">21-27</a>) and his huge army spread terror wherever it went (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.28">28</a>). He destroyed “all the gods of the land, so that all nations should worship Nebuchadnezzar only, and all their tongues and tribes should call upon him as god” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.3.8">3:8</a>). When Holofernes made a determined effort to seize Bethulia (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.7.1-32">7:1ff</a>.), the forces of Israel rallied and took up their weapons. The desperate Jews were about to surrender when the beautiful widow Judith asked permission of the leaders of the Jews to go to Holofernes (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.8.32-34">8:32-34</a>). The permission was given and Judith called upon God to deliver her people (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.9.2-14">9:2-14</a>). She “made herself very beautiful” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.10.4">10:4</a>) and went to meet Holofernes “to give him a true report” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.10.13">13</a>). Holofernes came under the spell of the beautiful Judith, and on the fourth day of her visit he made a banquet and Judith was invited (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.12.10-11">12:10-11</a>). Holofernes became drunk, and when all the servants had left, Judith took his sword and severed his head from his body and carried it back to Bethulia in a bag and showed it to the leaders of Israel. Jubilant Israelites attacked the leaderless Assyrians, who fled in panic. Led by Judith, the Jews joined in celebration and praise and offered thanksgiving in Jerusalem. This story of defeated pride has been a favorite theme of artists, including Donatello and Dante.</p>

<p class="h2" id="MiddleBronzeAgeHouses">Middle Bronze Age Houses (c. 1800–1500 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Israel’s early ancestors lived mostly in tents or temporary dwellings, but the Canaanites of the middle Bronze Age (into whose land the Israelites came) lived in substantial houses of several rooms built around a courtyard.</p>
<p>The simplest form of this new type of house had a courtyard with a single room on one side, generally on the west of the courtyard, to avoid having the prevailing westerly winds blow smoke into the room. Silos for storing grain were normally in the room rather than in the courtyard. Good examples of such one-roomed houses were found at Tell Nagila, northwest of Beersheba, dating to about 1700 <span class="era">BC</span>. Three such houses had a room 10 by 7 feet (3 by 2.1 meters) and a courtyard 10 by 16 feet (3 by 4.9 meters). Partitions sometimes divided the room. The walls were made of rough stone and mud bricks covered by mud plaster and were hardly thick enough to carry a second story. Houses were set close together to take advantage of a common back wall with entrances to the court on roughly parallel streets. Each house contained a stone and clay bench along the walls.</p>
<p>Sometimes several rooms were built off one side of the courtyard. The grandest of these yet found comes from Tell Beit Mirsim, dating from about 1600 <span class="era">BC</span>, probably the house of a local governor or patrician. There were no less than six rooms on the western side of the courtyard, which was some 35 by 19 feet (10.7 by 5.8 meters) in size. The roofed living space, including both the ground and second floors, was about 1,500 square feet (139 square meters); a second floor is assumed from the thickness of the walls all around. The ground floor may have been multifunctional with two stable rooms and two storage areas. Other less imposing variants of the courtyard house with rooms on one side only come from this same tell in Stratum E (c. 1700 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>The second type of house in the middle Bronze Age had a roofed hall with rooms on one or two sides. A good example of such a house with rooms on one side comes from Tell Beit Mirsim, dating from about 1800 <span class="era">BC</span>. The large, roofed, rectangular hall contained three large, flat stones set along the long axis to serve as foundations for the wooden roof supports. Rafters of wood and a roof of reeds covered with mud were found in the debris. Each of the three rooms on the west was entered from the hall. The stone foundations and mud brick walls were substantial enough to support a second story that could be reached by an exterior wooden staircase or ladder. The floor of earth, ashes, and straw was carefully smoothed over.</p>
<p>A third type of house consisted of an open courtyard with rooms on two adjacent sides of the court. A good example comes from Tell Beit Mirsim, built on the ruins of the house with the roofed hall. The roofed hall became the court. A house at Tell Taanach from the middle Bronze IIB period (c. 1700 <span class="era">BC</span>) was of very strong construction with walls over three feet (.9 meter) thick laid in mortar. The courtyard contained a cistern, and an oven was found in a room on the east side of the house. The ground floors were plastered and covered 2,300 square feet (214 square meters). An interior staircase led to a second story.</p>
<p>In some houses, rooms were placed at opposite sides of the courtyard. Good examples come from Beth Shemesh (Tell er-Rumeilah) and Megiddo. At Beth Shemesh the city wall formed the south wall of the house, and rooms lay east and west of the courtyard. Entrance was from the street into one of the rooms. The other rooms were entered by crossing the courtyard. The outer walls were over three feet (91.4 centimeters) thick and interior walls a foot and a half (45.7 centimeters) thick. Mud and lime plaster coated the walls.</p>
<p>At Megiddo houses were built against the north city wall. In level XII (c. 1750–1700 <span class="era">BC</span>) three well-preserved houses of this kind have been found. The houses were separated by walls at right angles to the city wall. Entrance to each house was through one door on the street, through a room, and into a courtyard paved with small stones and pebbles. The courtyards housed the ovens, and one house had a cistern.</p>
<p>A fourth type of middle Bronze Age house had rooms on three sides of the courtyard. These rooms varied greatly in size and use. A good example dating to about 1600 <span class="era">BC</span> comes from Megiddo, level IX. The house was 42 by 39 feet (12.8 by 11.9 meters) in size and contained nine rooms of varying sizes. The courtyard was plastered with lime and had a large oven in the center. A second oven was found in an eastern room. Each room had a door to the courtyard. This house, like others of the middle Bronze Age, had burials under the floors (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">1 Sm 25:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.34">1 Kgs 2:34</a> for biblical references in the Iron Age).</p>
<p>The wide variety of Palestinian houses during the middle Bronze Age points to a level of prosperity much higher than that of the early Bronze Age. Both houses and tombs yielded quantities of graceful and well-made household utensils.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LateBronzeAgeHouses">Late Bronze Age Houses (c. 1550–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Information is limited for this period, due partly to the accidents of excavation and partly to the severe destruction of many sites at the close of the age from the hands of Israelites, Sea Peoples, Egyptians, and others.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IsraeliteHousesoftheIronAge">Israelite Houses of the Iron Age (c. 1200–600 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Many examples of domestic buildings come from this period. The Israelite structures were at first rather crude, but the quality improved. Thus at Tell Qasil in the 12th century there were poor homes with a courtyard and single room on one side. At contemporary Beth-shemesh one larger house had a foundation of large uncut stones, a courtyard some 34 by 20 feet (10.4 by 6.1 meters), and three rooms on one side 11 by 10½ feet (3.4 by 3.2 meters). There was rough stone paving in the court and in two of the rooms. At Hazor a house was discovered that had a courtyard and rooms on one side dating to about 900 <span class="era">BC</span>. Half of the courtyard was covered, the roof being supported on stone pillars. These stone pillars are very characteristic of the Iron Age houses in Palestine and have been found in sites all over the country.</p>
<p>The most common type of house in the days of the kings of Judah and Israel was one in which rooms were built on three sides of a courtyard. This type of house has sometimes been called the “four-room house.” A long room was built across the short axis of the courtyard, and two other rooms, one on each side of the court, were constructed on the long axis. The courtyard was divided into three by two rows of pillars that extended down the long axis of the court. These pillars supported the roof and gave support for walls, either half height or full height. Entrance to the house was from the street into the courtyard, where ovens and silos were normally placed, although this varied. Such a framework could be expanded by adding a row of rooms outside the existing rooms on the long axis of the court. There were many ways to divide long rooms into smaller ones. In some cases where the walls were strong enough, a second story was added. An excellent example of a four-room house that was later enlarged was found at Shechem and dated to the period around 748–724 <span class="era">BC</span>. The courtyard contained a storage bin, a large open hearth, a quern (hand mill), stone grinders, and the bases of pottery jars resting in stone pedestals. In the rooms that had been added there was a device for catching water from the roof and delivering it to an underground water system. A large silo in one room was connected to a kitchen.</p>
<p>There is evidence that larger Iron Age houses served as industrial or commercial buildings. Certain houses at Tell Beit Mirsim contained dye vats and loom weights. In other places the large number of querns suggests a wheat-grinding industry. There is evidence also of wine vats, or potters’ equipment, and of shops. Some houses had rooms set apart for religious purposes and contained incense stands, figurines, small altars, and the like.</p>
<p>The excavations of Kathleen Kenyon at Jerusalem brought to light houses from the last days of Judah. They were rather small and irregularly planned but of the same general design as those in the hill country sites of Judah—a courtyard divided by a row of stone pillars that supported the roof.</p>
<p>The contrast between big houses and small houses in some towns probably indicates the social inequality referred to in the prophets. In the 10th and 9th centuries <span class="era">BC</span> there was a fairly uniform picture of many small houses and a few large ones. By the 8th century <span class="era">BC</span>, at a town like Tirzah, there were three or four large houses and a great many flimsy structures.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HousesinNewTestamentTimes">Houses in New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">There are references in the NT to houses, roofs, doors, foundations, an upper room, and lamps. One of Jesus’ parables refers to good and bad foundations (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.25">Mt 7:25</a>). In one incident friends took a paralyzed man up to the roof, which they took apart to lower him into the room where Jesus was (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.4">Mk 2:4</a>). Jesus referred to proclamations made from the housetops (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.27">Mt 10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.3">Lk 12:3</a>), and Peter went up on the roof to pray (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.9">Acts 10:9</a>). Houses were swept to find lost objects (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.8">Lk 15:8</a>) and illuminated by lamps (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.15">Mt 5:15</a>). There are several references to houses of specific individuals (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.3">Mk 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.5">Lk 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.4">16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.9">19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.20">Jn 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.34">Acts 4:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.11">9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.32">10:32</a>). Some houses had upper rooms on the roof reached by an outside staircase. The Passover meal was prepared in such a large upstairs room (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.12-15">Mk 14:12-15</a>). The disciples lodged in a similar room after the death and resurrection of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>). In such houses there were sometimes servants (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.7">10:7</a>), and some had a guest room (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.14">Mk 14:14</a>). We conclude from the NT data that there was a variety in the size and elegance of the houses of Jesus’ day. A typical street in Judea or Galilee would have houses ranging from the small house (25 to 30 square feet or 2.3 to 2.8 square meters) to the mansion of the upper classes, which could be two or more stories high embellished by rows of pillars and architectural adornment.</p>
<p>For the precise character of these houses, we have to turn to archaeological and literary evidence. The writings of the rabbis and Josephus fill in many details. Excavation in sites of the early Roman (Herodian) period (37 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 70) have provided more tangible evidence. A rich source of information is the excavation in the old Jewish quarter in Jerusalem. One large house of some 209 square yards in size had a central courtyard where three cooking ovens and a water cistern were found. Large niches set in some of the walls contained broken pottery and must have been cupboards. Traces of mosaic floors and plastered walls give an idea of the beauty of this house. There were several rooms off the courtyard, perhaps as many as ten. The remains of other fine houses of the late second temple period have been found further west, notably in the area of the Armenian cemetery on Mt Zion, in which beautiful frescoes were preserved exhibiting a unique representation of birds. Other houses have yielded mosaic pavements with purely geometric patterns, thus adhering to the injunction against depicting animal forms.</p>

Sometimes, however, it may refer to thick grape syrup (as in Arabic) or date syrup (as described by Josephus). Honey was considered one of life’s necessities (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.39.26">Ecclus 39:26</a>); one must not, however, eat too much (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.16,27">Prv 25:16, 27</a>).

  <title>Honor</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HONOR</p>
<p class="fl">Good reputation, respect, purity, integrity.</p>
<p>To the ancient world, the concept of honor was frequently linked to one’s tangible possessions. The honor of Odysseus was bound up with the restoration of his material goods; Achilles’ honor was dependent upon the gifts given him. Later, the word acquired the strong ethical nature we now associate with it. Plato was among the earliest to establish the personal moral element of honor, what he called “inward honor.” The distinctions accorded a man by the world—“outward honors”—were not of the same value as a virtuous person’s inner worth. The Romans as well as the Greeks placed great emphasis on the indispensable role of honor in an individual’s life.</p>
<p>Only in the Bible, however, do we gain a true perspective on honor. The OT required children to honor their parents (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.12">Ex 20:12</a>), a command that reappears in the ethic of the NT (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.1-2">Eph 6:1-2</a>). Undergirding such action is an even more basic obligation: the giving of honor to God, who worthily merits our devoted obedience (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.11">Rv 4:11</a>). <a href="?bref=Pr.3.9">Proverbs 3:9</a> presents the law’s requirement that one should honor the Lord with his gifts and with the firstfruits of his entire harvest. Honoring God, then, is expressed in the commitment of both life and possessions to the Lord’s service.</p>
<p>That people do not honor God as they should is a lamentable truth of Scripture. In all of history only Jesus Christ truly honored the Father by submitting himself totally to the divine will. His submission led him to the cross, the means whereby Christ is now extremely exalted (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">Is 52:13–53:12</a>). God the Father raised Christ to his permanent position as our great High Priest, an honor of incalculable significance (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.4-5">Heb 5:4-5</a>). Jesus taught that the one who serves him would also be honored by his Father (<a href="?bref=John.12.26">Jn 12:26</a>); conversely, those who reject him also reject God the Father (<a href="?bref=John.15.23">15:23</a>).</p>
<p>Christians are called upon to honor one another—that is, each is to consider his fellow believer more worthy of esteem than himself (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.10">Rom 12:10</a>). This orientation receives impetus from the affirmation of <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.7">1 Peter 1:7</a>, where Christians are said to possess honor. Showing honor to others should affect one’s entire lifestyle. Husbands are to give honor to their wives by showing loving regard for them (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.7">1 Pt 3:7</a>). Christian servants are expected to show honor to their masters so as to affirm the cause of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.1">1 Tm 6:1</a>). Beyond the immediate community of the redeemed, too, honor must be appropriately displayed by all those who revere the teaching of Scripture (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.7">Rom 13:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.17">1 Pt 2:17</a>).</p>

  <title>Hope</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HOPE</p>
<p class="fl">An expectation or belief in the fulfillment of something desired. Present hurts and uncertainty over what the future holds create the constant need for hope. Worldwide poverty, hunger, disease, and human potential to generate terror and destruction create a longing for something better. Historically, people have looked to the future with a mixture of longing and fear. Many have concluded that there is no reasonable basis for hope and therefore that to hope is to live with an illusion. Scripture tells us that those who do not have God do not have hope (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.12">Eph 2:12</a>).</p>
<p>The modern world has sought hope in human effort and a belief in the inevitability of progress that assumed everything would naturally get better and better. The threat and reality of war in the 20th century challenged that optimism and left growing despair in its wake. Though many still find little reason to hope, others have returned to a humanistic basis for hope. It is held that because people are the source of the world’s problems, they can also be the solution. This position can be called into question on the basis of present and historical evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Christianity has often been considered in discussions concerning hope. Unfortunately, Christianity has not always received “good press” in this regard. In the early centuries of church history, stress on the disparity between this world and the next seemed to create an attitude of escapism, futility, or indifference toward the problems and pains of human existence. In the 19th century Prussian philosopher Frederick Nietzsche (1844–1900) claimed that Christianity made people cowards because it taught that whatever happened was God’s will, thus discouraging efforts to change the world. Karl Marx (1818–83) said that Christianity or religion was the “opiate of the people.” For Marx, religion kept people from rising against those who oppressed them.</p>
<p>The tendency for Christianity to be viewed as otherworldly was opposed by Jürgen Moltmann in what has been called “the theology of hope.” That theology was the product of the pessimism and despair of post-World War II Europe. Moltmann’s theology of hope says that the future is the basis for changing the present, and that Christian service should be an attempt to make otherworldly hopes a present reality. The resurrection is said to bring hope amid present suffering by becoming the catalyst for human effort to overcome that suffering. But trust in human effort to change the future could lead to a humanistic notion that the resurrection is merely a hopeful symbol that will spur people into action, and not necessarily a reality of God’s historical action in the world through Jesus Christ. Another concern is that the discussion of hope for this world by a transformation of political and social structures could neglect the need for personal transformation of people’s lives through conversion and repentance. While critical questions have been raised about the theology of hope, on the positive side that theology has led to examination or reexamination of the biblical doctrine of hope.</p>
<p>Biblical hope is hope in what God will do in the future. At the heart of Christian hope is the resurrection of Jesus. Paul discussed the nature, certainty, and importance of the resurrection (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-28">1 Cor 15:12-28</a>). That Paul is certain that Christian hope points to the future can be seen by his statement “If we have hope in Christ only for this life, we are the most miserable people in the world” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.19">19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The significance of Christ’s resurrection is that it not only points to his victory over death but also extends that victory to those who are his: “Christ was raised first; then when Christ comes back, all his people will be raised” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">23</a>). The apostle Peter said, “All honor to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is by his boundless mercy that God has given us the privilege of being born again. Now we live with a wonderful expectation because Jesus Christ rose again from the dead” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1 Pt 1:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In that passage, Peter attributes living hope to the resurrection of Christ and points to God’s future blessing upon those who belong to Christ. That future hope empowers the Christian to live without despair through the struggle and suffering of the present (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.18">Rom 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16-18">2 Cor 4:16-18</a>).</p>
<p>Christian hope is securely based upon the words and actions of God. The promises of God have proven to be dependable. The resurrection of Jesus becomes the ultimate basis for hope. Since God has already overcome death through Christ, the Christian can live with confidence in the present. No matter how dark the present age seems, the Christian has seen the light to come. People need to hope, and hope placed in the personal promise of God is secure. This secure hope is full of social significance, however, freeing one from bondage to materialism and its natural selfishness. Christian hope offers security for the future and loving involvement in sharing for the present.</p>

<p class="h1">HOR, Mount</p>
<p class="list">1. Mountain located at the border of the land of Edom (<a href="?bref=Num.20.23">Nm 20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.37">33:37</a>). Mt Hor was the first place to which the Israelites came (<a href="?bref=Num.20.22">Nm 20:22</a>) after wandering nearly 40 years (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.14">Dt 2:14</a>). Moses’ brother, Aaron, would not be permitted to enter Canaan because he had refused to carry out the Lord’s instructions at Meribah (<a href="?bref=Num.20.7-13,24">Nm 20:7-13, 24</a>). Stripped of his priestly garments, which were then put on his son Eleazar, Aaron died on the top of Mt Hor (<a href="?bref=Num.20.25-29">Nm 20:25-29</a>) at the age of 123. A similar punishment was later meted out to Moses, whose death on Mt Nebo is compared to Aaron’s death on Mt Hor (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.49-51">Dt 32:49-51</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Deut.10.6">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>, Aaron died and was buried at Moserah (probably the Moseroth of <a href="?bref=Num.33.30-31">Nm 33:30-31</a>), a place that must have been very close to (or perhaps a part of) Mt Hor.</p>
<p class="list-text">The location of Mt Hor remains uncertain. The traditional site, Jebel Nebi Harun (which means “the mountain of the prophet Aaron”) is almost 4,800 feet (1.5 kilometers) high and is the tallest mountain in Edom. The Muslims claim that a small building on its summit is the tomb of Aaron. But Jebel Nebi Harun is located near Petra—in the middle of Edom—and too far east of Kadesh. A more likely location is Jebel Madeira, situated on the northwest border of Edom about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Kadesh. In any event, the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">hor</span> probably means “mount” (as in <a href="?bref=Gen.49.26">Gn 49:26</a>), so that “Mt Hor” perhaps means simply “mountain of mountains” or “high mountain” rather than being a proper name.</p>
<p class="list">2. Another mountain located in the far north (<a href="?bref=Num.34.7-8">Nm 34:7-8</a>). Generally identified as either Mt Hermon or Jebel Akkar, it too was perhaps simply an unusually high mountain.</p>

<p class="h1">HORITES</p>
<p class="fl">Cave dwellers of Mt Seir, according to tradition. These pre-Edomites were called the children of Seir (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.20">Gn 36:20</a>). In the Bible they were defeated by Kedorlaomer and his allies (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.6">14:6</a>). They were governed by chieftains (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.29-30">36:29-30</a>), and eventually destroyed by the descendants of Esau (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.12,22">Dt 2:12, 22</a>).</p>
<p>The popular and biblical etymology of “Horite” has been disputed since the discovery of the Hurrians (Khurians) as ethnic predecessors of many Near Eastern tribes. The Hurrians were a non-Semite people from the mountains. About the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, they migrated into north and northeast Mesopotamia, and later moved into the regions of Syria and Palestine. Since the Hurrian language was prevalent in the western Jordan area, and since phonetically “Horite” is the OT Hebrew equivalent of the extrabiblical “Hurrian,” several scholars and translators have substituted “Hurrian” for “Horite.” Many have equated the Hivites, who were part of the Hurrian language and cultural group, with the Horites. These critics assumed an early textual corruption of the <span class="ital">r(esh)</span> in Ho<span class="ital">r</span>ite to <span class="ital">w(aw)</span> in Hi<span class="ital">v</span>ite. A certain Zibeon is called a Horite in <a href="?bref=Gen.36.20-30">Genesis 36:20-30</a>, whereas in verse <a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">2</a> the man is called a Hivite. The Septuagint of <a href="?bref=Josh.9.7">Joshua 9:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.34.2">Genesis 34:2</a> reads “Horite” instead of “Hivite” as in the Masoretic Text. Some manuscripts of the Septuagint read “Hittite” for the Masoretic Text’s “Hivite” (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.3">Jos 11:3</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.3.3">Jgs 3:3</a>). In <a href="?bref=Gen.36.2">Genesis 36:2</a>, the extant Hebrew manuscripts erroneously read “Hivite” for “Horite.” It appears that the OT references do not fit the Hurrians, nor do the personal names of the Horites correspond to Hurrian examples (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.20-30">Gn 36:20-30</a>). They seem instead to be Semitic. The Horites were from Transjordan and were the predecessors of the Edomites (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.6">14:6</a>). Later references to Horites may be to western Horites, who were perhaps Hurrians (<a href="?bref=Isa.17.9">Is 17:9</a>) and non-Semitic, but quite distinct from the predecessors of the Edomites, the eastern Horites. The Hebrew of <a href="?bref=Gen.34.2">Genesis 34:2</a> and <a href="?bref=Josh.9.7">Joshua 9:7</a> may be from a different family of manuscripts than those used by the Septuagint translators, preserving its own ethnic traditions. It seems best to think of both Hivites and Horites as ethnic groups connected with the Hurrians by language and culture.</p>

Judah dominated it again by the time of the early monarchy (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.30">1 Sm 30:30</a>). The change of the Canaanite name Zephath to Hormah when the Hebrews first conquered it is noted in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.17">Judges 1:17</a>. Hormah took David’s side during his running feud with King Saul and David rewarded the town by sending it some of the spoils of Ziklag (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-31">1 Sm 30</a>). <a href="?bref=Josh.15.30">Joshua 15:30</a> describes it as being in the south near Kesil and Ziklag, but its precise location remains unknown.

<p class="fl">Hebrew expression meaning “Save us, <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,” taken from <a href="?bref=Ps.118.25">Psalm 118:25</a>.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Ps.118.1-29">Psalm 118</a> is a declaration of confidence in the Lord’s salvation, made in a time of need. The psalm as a whole was part of a longer hymn (the Hallel) that was sung on great occasions. Verse <a href="?bref=Ps.118.25">25</a> in particular was used in the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles. At the point in the worship when this verse was read, the people would wave branches of myrtle, willow, and palm. Branches may have been waved at other times also as a general expression of jubilation. This happens in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.6-7">2 Maccabees 10:6-7</a>, at a ceremony for the rededication of the temple after it had been defiled.</p>
<p>The crowd welcomed Jesus to Jerusalem with the cry of “Hosanna” (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.9">Mt 21:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.9-10">Mk 11:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.13">Jn 12:13</a>), followed by a proclamation, “Blessed be he who enters in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Ps.118.26">Ps 118:26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This means the crowd was greeting Jesus as Messiah. Already before Jesus’ time the phrase “blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” was taken to refer to the Messiah. And it is possible that the word “Hosanna” by itself had messianic significance. Other expressions in the report of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem support this. In <a href="?bref=Matt.21.9">Matthew 21:9</a> Jesus is called the “Son of David”; in <a href="?bref=Mark.11.10">Mark 11:10</a> there is reference to “the coming kingdom of our father David”; in <a href="?bref=John.12.13">John 12:13</a>, Jesus is called “the King of Israel.” All of these have messianic overtones.</p>
<p>We need not suppose that in shouting “Hosanna” the people had a political deliverance in mind. They probably did not know in what way Jesus would be a deliverer. The most one can say is they believed Jesus was one sent by God for their salvation. Had there not been something in their response to him that Jesus could recognize as proper worship, he would hardly have accepted their praise. It would only appear later, in his death and resurrection, what his messiahship really meant.</p>

  <title>Hosea (Person)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HOSEA (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Prophet of ancient Israel whose sphere of activity was the northern kingdom. Little is known of him outside of the prophetic book that bears his name. His prophetic ministry is best placed in the third quarter of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>. His name means “help” or “helper,” and is based on the Hebrew word for salvation.</p>
<p>The evidence for placing Hosea in the northern kingdom is basically internal. The book is concerned mainly with the northern tribes, whom he frequently identifies as “Ephraim,” a common appellation for the northern kingdom. And the dialect of Hebrew in which the book was written seems to be of a northern cast.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the marriage of Hosea form the catalyst for his prophetic message. He was commanded by God to marry Gomer, who apparently was a harlot; his marriage provided an analogy with Israel, who was guilty of spiritual adultery.</p>
<p>Scholars differ as to the interpretation of this controversial account but there is little reason for doubting that it was a literal event. The act of sacrifice involved in Hosea’s obedience to God forms a marvelous picture of God’s sacrificial love for man.</p>

<p class="h1">HOSEA, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">First of the 12 minor prophets in the traditional arrangements of the OT books. It was written in the last part of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Hosea’s prophecies were proclaimed to the northern kingdom of Israel in the final years of its existence. Hosea was the only prophet to reside in the northern kingdom and also to preach there. God commissioned Hosea to reveal the widespread apostasy and corruption in the northern kingdom and to exhort his fellow countrymen to repent and return to God. Hosea had the unique privilege of illustrating—in his own life—the steadfast covenant love that God had for Israel.</p>

<p class="fl">Hosea’s ministry extended over a period of at least 38 years (c. 753–715 <span class="era">BC</span>), and he appears as a knowledgeable individual, whether he was a peasant or a member of the wealthier class in Israel.</p>
<p>Hosea’s marriage to the prostitute Gomer may have been controversial in his own day, and it has certainly caused a great deal of controversy among Bible students and commentators. It seems best to recognize that Gomer was a publicly known harlot whom Hosea was commanded to marry for the purpose of illustrating Israel’s apostasy and God’s steadfast covenant love.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Authenticity">Authenticity</p>
<p class="fl">The authenticity and unity of Hosea is not seriously questioned, even by higher criticism. But two areas of controversy are (1) passages that refer to Judah (e.g., <a href="?bref=Hos.1.1,7,11">1:1, 7, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.15">4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.5,10-14">5:5, 10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.4,11">6:4, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.14">8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.12">11:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.2">12:2</a>), and (2) those sections that refer to future blessing or national deliverance (e.g., <a href="?bref=Hos.11.8-11">11:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.2-9">14:2-9</a>).</p>
<p>Hosea’s references to Judah, however, could be expected from a man of God chagrined by the separation of Israel from the legitimate Davidic line. The northern kingdom, with its ungodly kings, was on the verge of judgment from God. Hosea evidently had received divine revelation concerning his dealings with Judah as well as Israel.</p>
<p>The references to the future blessings and deliverance of Israel do not neutralize the condemnation of the sins of Israel, any more than Hosea’s constant love for and reconciliation with adulterous Gomer neutralizes her sin. Restoration and forgiveness need not ignore guilt.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Hosea lived during the prosperous days of the northern kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>). He also saw its defeat and the deportation of its people after the invasion by the Assyrians (722 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Hos.1.1">Hosea 1:1</a> the following kings are named: from the southern kingdom of Judah—Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah; and from the northern kingdom of Israel—Joash and Jeroboam. Uzziah was a contemporary of both Joash and Jeroboam. Ahaz was king of Judah when Israel was taken captive by Assyria. Hezekiah may have been a co-regent with Ahaz at the time of the Assyrian captivity.</p>
<p>Jeroboam reigned over Israel for 41 years and followed the evil example of his father, Nebat (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23-24">2 Kgs 14:23-24</a>). Though Israel was prosperous and successful during Jeroboam’s reign, the corruption in the government and the degeneracy in the spiritual lives of the people set the stage for more tumultuous times in the days of subsequent kings and paved the way for the fall of Israel. The rich landowners (including the king) oppressed the peasants and caused the lower-class landowners to migrate from the farms to the cities. The social repercussions were soon to engulf Israel in a wave of corruption. Anarchy was a product of those times (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.1-2">Hos 4:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.7.1-7">7:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.3-4">8:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.15">9:15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Hosea’s prophetic ministry commenced with the reign of Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>) and extended to that of Hezekiah of Judah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Several factors indicate that Hosea continued prophesying under Hoshea of Israel (732–722 <span class="era">BC</span>): (1) “Shalman” (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.14">Hos 10:14</a>) may be Shalmaneser of Assyria, who invaded Israel early in the reign of Hoshea (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.3">2 Kgs 17:3</a>). (2) “Jareb” (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.13">Hos 5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.10.6">10:6</a>, both <span class="sc">kjv</span>) may be Sargon II (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>). (3) Predictions of the Assyrian invasion appear to refer to an imminent event (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.5-6">10:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.15-16">13:15-16</a>). (4) Mention of Egypt and Israel’s dependence on that nation seem to fit the reign of Hoshea (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.11">7:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.11">11:11</a>). These factors confirm that the compilation of Hosea’s messages may have taken place very near to the time of Israel’s fall (722 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginandDestination">Origin and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">Hosea prophesied while residing in Israel. He refers to the king in Samaria as “our king” (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.5">Hos 7:5</a>). His descriptions of Israel show that he was familiar with the geography of the northern kingdom. Gilead is mentioned by Hosea as though he knew that area from personal observation (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.8">6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.11">12:11</a>). Hosea was probably the only prophet to the northern kingdom who actually lived there throughout his ministry.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Hosea proclaimed to Israel the need to repent and return to God. He presented the God of Israel as a patient and loving God who remained faithful to his covenant promises. This emphasis is characteristic of Hosea (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.2.19">2:19</a>).</p>
<p>“Loving-kindness” is the word that best represents the covenant faithfulness and love of Yahweh, and Hosea’s family life was a living illustration of that loving-kindness.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The major divisions and topics of the book of Hosea may be outlined as follows.</p>
<p>The first three chapters of Hosea are concerned with the example of Hosea’s life, stressing Hosea’s faithfulness and love for his unfaithful wife.</p>
<p>God commanded Hosea to marry the harlot Gomer and to have children by her (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.2-3.5">1:2–3:5</a>). This command has caused difficulties for some commentators, since priests and prophets in Israel simply did not marry prostitutes. Medieval Jewish writers, therefore, regarded the material as symbolic but unhistorical. Some later scholars drew a distinction between chapters <a href="?bref=Hos.1.1-11">1</a> and <a href="?bref=Hos.3.1-5">3</a>, regarding the latter as an intimate description by Hosea of his marriage; the first chapter was held to contain rather general recollections of his early days as a prophet. Other commentators regarded both chapters as literal fact, while certain scholars thought that chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.1.1-11">1</a> was historical whereas chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.3.1-5">3</a> represented an allegorical interpretation of the marriage by Hosea himself.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the sexual activities of Gomer have also been discussed widely. Two views predominate. (1) Gomer was a faithful wife to Hosea in their early years of marriage. “A wife of harlotry” (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.2">1:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), which is not the common term for “prostitute,” has reference to her sinful and wayward nature, which God later caused to be exposed as an illustration of Israel’s idolatry. (2) Gomer was a publicly known harlot whom Hosea was commanded to marry in order to illustrate Israel’s idolatry and God’s faithful and steadfast love. This latter view seems to have the greatest appeal to evangelical scholars, and is the simplest interpretation within a literal, grammatical, and historical framework of Bible interpretation.</p>
<p>Why it was necessary for her to be ransomed by Hosea is not evident, nor is it known why part of the price was paid in grain and the remainder in money. Perhaps the entire transaction was meant to symbolize God’s deliverance of Israel from future exile, although as far as it is known, the 10 northern tribes did not return from exile in Assyria. Such an interpretation could hardly apply to Judah, since Hosea’s message was not directed at the southern kingdom, although Judah did receive a warning (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.11">6:11</a>).</p>
<p>The children born to Hosea and Gomer were given symbolic names. The first child was a son named Jezreel (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.4">1:4a</a>), signifying God’s judgment on the house of Jehu for Jehu’s slaughter of the house of Ahab in the valley of Jezreel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1-11,30">2 Kgs 10:1-11, 30</a>).</p>
<p>Lo-ruhamah was the second child (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.6">Hos 1:6a</a>), whose name means “not compassioned or pitied.” The judgment of Israel was thus symbolized. The spiritual corruption of the northern kingdom had run its course, and it would be defeated and taken away into captivity (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.6">1:6b</a>).</p>
<p>Lo-ammi was the third child, a second son, whose name means “not my people” (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.8-9">1:8-9</a>). This rejection of Israel as God’s covenanted people was to be temporary (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.10-2.1">1:10–2:1</a>). God’s covenant promises to Abraham (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.1.10">1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.22.17">Gn 22:17</a>) and to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-7">Ex 19:1-7</a>) would be fulfilled in spite of the disobedience of any particular generation.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with her relationship to her husband, Gomer sought other lovers. Israel pursued the same elusive satisfaction in her flirtation and adultery with heathen deities. The good that their merciful God had bestowed upon them they attributed to pagan gods (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.8,12">Hos 2:8, 12</a>). Repentant Israelites would return to their first love after discovering that there was no lasting satisfaction in their season of sin.</p>
<p>Hosea’s declaration of divorce from Gomer for her adultery depicts Yahweh’s divorce from Israel for her adultery (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.2">Hos 2:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.3.1-4.2">Jer 3:1–4:2</a>). Their children represent the individual members of the nation of Israel in Hosea’s day (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.2-5">Hos 2:2-5</a>).</p>
<p>The illustration of restoration in chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.3.1-5">3</a> highlights a concise summary of Israel’s history. Israel’s bondage to sin and Satan (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.2.14-15">Heb 2:14-15</a>) is symbolized by the price paid by Hosea for Gomer (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.2">Hos 3:2</a>). The price was that of a female slave, since Gomer had become the slave of her adultery (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.21.32">Ex 21:32</a>). The days of Gomer’s isolation, like the days of Israel’s exile, were established for cleansing (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.3">Hos 3:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.21.13">Dt 21:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.2">30:2</a>).</p>
<p>After the exile period (“afterward”), and “in the latter days,” Israel will return to her husband to enjoy the blessings of the renewed relationship. In a messianic reference, David “their king” will be resurrected to lead Israel to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.5">Hos 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>The last major section of Hosea deals in detail with what has already been illustrated and briefly explained in chapters <a href="?bref=Hos.1.1-3.5">1–3</a>. Israel’s apostasy (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.1-7.16">4:1–7:16</a>), punishment (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.1-10.15">8:1–10:15</a>), and restoration (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.1-14.9">11:1–14:9</a>) are prophesied by Hosea.</p>
<p>Israel was totally given over to ungodly activities and had separated itself from God (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.1-2">4:1-2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">Ex 20:1-17</a>). The people had rejected the word of God through their own indifference and the deception of the priests (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.6-9">Hos 4:6-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.5.13">Is 5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.11-12">Am 8:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.6">Zep 1:6</a>). Israel followed the example of corrupt spiritual leaders in the same way her kings followed the corrupt leadership of their predecessors (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.9">Hos 4:9</a>). In place of God’s word, Israel turned to idolatry and divination for guidance (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.4.12-13">12-13</a>). Finally, Israel lost its priestly character (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.6">4:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>) because the priests were chiefly responsible for national apostasy (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.1">Hos 5:1</a>).</p>
<p>Upon revealing his case against the northern kingdom, God then issues a caution (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.8-14">5:8-14</a>). The trumpet will be raised in the hills of Benjamin (v <a href="?bref=Hos.5.8">8</a>), the buffer zone between Israel and Judah. The alarm in that region will indicate that Israel is being overrun and Judah is endangered (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.5.9-12">9-12</a>). The northern kingdom had depended upon the commandment of man, not God (v <a href="?bref=Hos.5.11">11</a>). Israel had turned to Assyria for aid but received treachery and defeat at its hands (v <a href="?bref=Hos.5.13">13</a>). In this prophecy of the fall of Israel to the Assyrians (722 <span class="era">BC</span>), Hosea depicts God as the ultimate chastiser (v <a href="?bref=Hos.5.14">14</a>).</p>
<p>God’s call for repentance comes hard upon the heels of the revelation of chastisement (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.15-6.3">5:15–6:3</a>). (The division of chapters at this point is unfortunate. <a href="?bref=Hos.6.1-3">Hosea 6:1-3</a> belongs with <a href="?bref=Hos.5.15">5:15</a>.) The exhortation to return to Yahweh could have been Hosea’s own heart response to the revelation he had received. However, it is best to take <a href="?bref=Hos.6.1-3">6:1-3</a> as the words employed by the future returning remnant. Assyria did not offer healing, nor would any other nation, but God will heal Israel spiritually, politically, and physically (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.1">6:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.15.26">Ex 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.39">Dt 32:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.53.5">Is 53:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-14">Ez 37:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.2">Mal 4:2</a>).</p>
<p>After the call to repentance, God returns to his concern for Israel (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.4-11">Hos 6:4-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.4.15">4:15</a>). Israel has turned from its Creator and has disobeyed his message (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.7">6:7</a>). Gilead is but one example of the murderous character of Israel (v <a href="?bref=Hos.6.8">8</a>). Even the priests are known for their violence (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.9">6:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12-17">1 Sm 2:12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.5.31">Jer 5:31</a>). The sin of Israel is “horrible” (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.10">Hos 6:10</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.7.1-16">7</a> presents God’s conclusion concerning Israel. Every attempt of God to bring Israel to repentance only reveals more fully the extent of their sin (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.1">7:1</a>). They believe they can sin without God taking account (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.2">Hos 7:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.90.8">Ps 90:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.36-37">Mt 12:36-37</a>). Their leaders rejoice that the people are as wicked as the king and the princes themselves (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.3">Hos 7:3</a>). All Israel is characterized by habitual adultery (v <a href="?bref=Hos.7.4">4</a>). Israel has not separated itself from the heathen (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.8">Hos 7:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.34.12-16">Ex 34:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-7.1">2 Cor 6:14–7:1</a>). Like “a cake not turned” (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.8">Hos 7:8</a>), Israel is not well balanced spiritually or politically but has one side done to a turn and the other side raw.</p>
<p>In the area of foreign affairs, Israel has flitted about from Egypt to Assyria and back again “like a silly dove” without understanding (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.11">Hos 7:11</a>). They did not seek the Lord’s counsel in their time of need but depended upon worldly powers. The lack of faith in Yahweh and the lack of separation from sin will bring chastisement from God (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.12">Hos 7:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.32">1 Cor 11:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.5-15">Heb 12:5-15</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.8.1-14">8</a> deals with Israel’s reaping of judgment (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.8.7">Hos 8:7</a>). An alarm is sounded to warn the people of the approach of the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.2-21">Ez 17:2-21</a>). They would come against Israel (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>) because of their transgression of the Sinai covenant (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.27.9–29.29">Dt 27:9–29:29</a>) and disobedience to the law of Moses. Crying falsely to God for deliverance from his rod of punishment (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.10.5">Is 10:5</a>), Israel will receive no answer and Assyria will continue to pursue the 10 tribes (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.2-3">Hos 8:2-3</a>). Other reasons for God’s judgment include setting up kings without God’s direction (v <a href="?bref=Hos.8.4">4</a>a) and idolatry (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.4.1-6.11">4b-6</a>). Israel’s sacrifices were unacceptable because of the nation’s disobedience (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.22">1 Sm 15:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.11-15">Is 1:11-15</a>). Thus they would go into exile just like the earlier exile in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.13">Hos 8:13</a>).</p>
<p>The theme of exile is continued in chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.9.1-17">9</a> of Hosea. There is no joy for Israel (v <a href="?bref=Hos.9.1">1</a>). The produce of the land will not sustain her because she will no longer dwell in the land (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.9.2-3">2-3</a>). Some Israelites will flee to Egypt in exile, while others will be taken captive to Assyria. All the sacrifices will cease and the sacrificial wines and meats will be drunk and eaten to satisfy their own needs (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.9.4-5">4-5</a>). Those Israelites who flee to Egypt will be slain by the Egyptians (v <a href="?bref=Hos.9.6">6</a>).</p>
<p>The recompense of Israel’s evil is further described in chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.10.1-15">10</a>. Israel is like a luxuriant vine (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.1">10:1</a>), but its bounty is misappropriated, being poured out as sacrifice on heathen altars. They are guilty before God, and he is about to destroy their altars and take away their king (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.10.2-3">2-3</a>). Gibeah is mentioned again (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.9.9">9:9</a>), reminding Israel that apostasy is not only infectious, it is also indelible (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.9">10:9</a>). The “two crimes” (<span class="sc">njb</span>) of verse <a href="?bref=Hos.10.10">10</a> may refer to the two calf idols in Bethel and Dan that brought chastisement from God. The punishment will be a sentence of hard labor under a heavy yoke (v <a href="?bref=Hos.10.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>Chapters 11 through 14 close the prophecies of Hosea with a message concerning the restoration of Israel at a future time. The steadfast love of the Father is first given as the ground of future restoration (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.1-12">11:1-12</a>). Israel, as a nation, had been called out of Egypt as a son of Yahweh (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.1">Hos 11:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.4.22-23">Ex 4:22-23</a>). Yet Israel did not return the Father’s love, but sought pagan alliances (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.5">Hos 11:5</a>) that would only bring judgment upon them (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.11.5-7">5-7</a>). The words of Yahweh reveal his irreversible judgment in his absolute holiness and righteousness (<a href="?bref=Hos.12.1-13.16">12:1–13:16</a>). The sins of Israel can only be responded to with just recompense (<a href="?bref=Hos.12.1-2">12:1-2</a>). The responsibility for the destruction of the northern kingdom rests upon Israel herself. In spite of Israel’s sin, God can yet be her help (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.9">13:9</a>).</p>
<p>Israel should have repented quickly, but she did not (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.13">13:13</a>). Yet the mercy of Yahweh would ultimately bring about the death of death itself so that Israel might live—spiritually, politically, and perhaps physically (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">Hos 13:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-14">Ez 37:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1-2,13">Dn 12:1-2, 13</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Hos.14.1-9">14</a> of Hosea sets forth the Father’s loving invitation for Israel to repent and return to him in confession, prayer, and praise (<a href="?bref=Hos.14.2">Hos 14:2</a>). “Calves of our lips” (v <a href="?bref=Hos.14.2">2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) refers to the thank offering, which normally included young bulls (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.5">Ex 24:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.11-15">Lv 7:11-15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.51.17-19">Pss 51:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.30-31">69:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.15-16">Heb 13:15-16</a>). Part of Israel’s confession will involve recognizing that there is no salvation in either Assyria (political alliance) or idols (<a href="?bref=Hos.14.3">Hos 14:3</a>).</p>
<p>God repeatedly promises blessing to Israel in their restoration (note “I will,” <a href="?bref=Hos.14.4-5">14:4-5</a>). Yahweh will heal Israel spiritually, love them freely, prosper them completely, and protect them fully (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.14.4-7">4-7</a>). Israel will be as beautiful as the lily, durable as the cedar, and fruitful as the olive tree.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Message">Message</p>
<p class="fl">The primary emphasis of Hosea is summarized in the last verse (<a href="?bref=Hos.14.9">14:9</a>). The wise will live godly lives, and the foolish will live ungodly lives. The godly will have restoration, victory over death (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">13:14</a>), and blessing (<a href="?bref=Hos.14.4-7">14:4-7</a>).</p>
<p>Idolatry is essentially anything that usurps the sole place of God in the human heart. In place of Yahweh’s counsel, aid, blessing, and salvation, Israel had substituted heathen deities (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.12-19">4:12-19</a>), national pride (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.5">5:5</a>), religious ceremony (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.6">6:6</a>), political expediency (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.3">7:3</a>), political alliances (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.11">7:11</a>), civil government (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.4">8:4</a>), building projects (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.14">8:14</a>), selfish affluence (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.1">10:1</a>), and idolatry (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.2">13:2</a>). Only in God could they find true blessing and security (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.4,9">13:4, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.4-7">14:4-7</a>).</p>
<p>Apostasy is presented by Hosea as infectious. The cycle of apostasy may begin with the spiritual leaders or with the people and spread from one to the other (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.9">4:9</a>). Apostasy is punished according to the degree of responsibility (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.9">13:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.4">14:4</a>).</p>

<p class="list">2. Son of Elah and the last of the 20 kings of the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-6">2 Kgs 17:1-6</a>). He reigned for nine years (732–723 <span class="era">BC</span>) before being taken captive by the Assyrians. In the later years of the northern kingdom, Assyria (under the rule of Tiglath-pileser III) had gained control of most of the Middle East and had reduced the scope of the northern kingdom to Ephraim, Issachar, and the half of Manasseh west of the Jordan.</p>
<p class="list-text">Earlier, the northern kingdom, under Pekah (740–732 <span class="era">BC</span>), entered into an alliance with Rezin of Damascus (Syria) and attempted to coerce King Ahaz of Judah (735–715 <span class="era">BC</span>) to join them in action against Tiglath-pileser (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.5">2 Kgs 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-6">Is 7:1-6</a>). Assyria came to Judah’s aid, and at this point Hoshea was one of a group of conspirators who assassinated Pekah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.30">2 Kgs 15:30</a>). Tiglath-pileser rewarded Hoshea by making him king over the remnant of the northern kingdom. Hoshea ruled only as a vassal of Assyria and paid heavy tribute, remaining loyal to Assyria until the death of Tiglath-pileser in 727 <span class="era">BC</span>. When Shalmaneser V succeeded to the throne of Assyria, he did not trust Hoshea’s loyalty and marched against him, thereby continuing the forced annual tribute (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.3">2 Kgs 17:3</a>). In a short time Hoshea attempted to assert independence. He withheld tribute and entered into negotiations with So, king of Egypt (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.4">4</a>), finding a favorable response, because Egypt would be in a precarious position if Assyria were to control Palestine. Therefore, Egypt was quite willing to support Hoshea in his resistance to Assyria in the hope that Samaria would remain a buffer between Egypt and Assyria. Soon, Shalmaneser directed his army against Samaria (724 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Hoshea discovered that the alliance with Egypt was of little value. Hoshea was taken prisoner, and Assyria apparently besieged Samaria for three years. The city fell in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Sargon II, who had succeeded Shalmaneser about 726 <span class="era">BC</span>, deported many Israelites to various places in Assyria, thus ending the northern kingdom.</p>

  <title>Hospitality</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HOSPITALITY</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical concept often used with the terms “guest,” “stranger,” and “sojourner.” It is useful to limit the meaning of “hospitality” to benevolence done to those outside one’s normal circle of friends, as is implied in the literal meaning of the Greek word meaning “love of strangers.” Although the concept is thoroughly endorsed in the Bible, it is clearly found in nonbiblical cultures as well, especially among the nomadic peoples, where definite obligations to provide food, shelter, and protection are recognized.</p>
<p>The normal exercise of hospitality in the OT can be seen in the examples of Abraham and the three visitors (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.2-8,16">Gn 18:2-8, 16</a>), Laban’s reception of Abraham’s servant (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.15-61">24:15-61</a>), and Manoah’s treatment of the angel (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.15">Jgs 13:15</a>). But there are also cases in which the host felt compelled to take extreme steps to protect his guest, even to the harm of his own family (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-8">Gn 19:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.14-24">Jgs 19:14-24</a>). The hospitality of the Shunammite family is also noteworthy, although Elisha was no stranger to them (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.10">2 Kgs 4:10</a>).</p>
<p>According to the NT, Jesus relied on the general practice of hospitality in sending out the disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.7">Lk 10:7</a>), as well as in his own travels. As the gospel was spread by traveling missionaries, Christians were commended for entertaining them in their homes (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.2">Heb 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.9">1 Pt 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=3Jn.1.5-8">3 Jn 1:5-8</a>). Church leaders must not exempt themselves from this ministry (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.2">1 Tm 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.8">Ti 1:8</a>); to do so is grounds for judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.43-46">Mt 25:43-46</a>).</p>

  <title>Host, Host of Heaven*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HOST, HOST OF HEAVEN*</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew expressions found frequently in the OT and literally meaning “army” and “army of the skies.” “Host” is basically a military term, occurring nearly 500 times in the OT, and can mean “army” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17">2 Kgs 18:17</a>), “angels,” “heavenly bodies,” or “creation.”</p>
<p>The phrase “host of heaven” has various applications in the Bible. Ancient writers sometimes referred symbolically to the sun, moon, and stars as an army (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.19">Dt 4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.20">Jgs 5:20</a>). In the astrological cults of antiquity, it was believed that celestial bodies were animated by spirits and thus constituted a living army that controlled heavenly destiny. The worship of the host of heaven was one of the earliest forms of idolatry, and was common among the Israelites in their times of regression from serving God (<a href="?bref=Jer.19.13">Jer 19:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.42">Acts 7:42</a>). Although warned against such pagan beliefs (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.19">Dt 4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.3">17:3</a>), the Israelites fell into the practice of worshiping heavenly bodies, particularly during the Assyrian and Babylonian periods (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.16">2 Kgs 17:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.3-5">21:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.3-5">2 Chr 33:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.2">Jer 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.5">Zep 1:5</a>). The corrective to this pagan practice is belief in the Lord as the Creator of heaven and earth, the Almighty, the one who marshaled the heavenly bodies at his command and ordained them to perform a special function (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.14-19">Gn 1:14-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1">2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.6">Neh 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6">Pss 33:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.21">103:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.148.2">148:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.26">Is 40:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.12">45:12</a>).</p>
<p>God is frequently called “the Lord God of hosts,” that is, of the celestial armies (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.14">Jer 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.38.17">38:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.7">44:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.5">Hos 12:5</a>). The heavenly host includes angels or messengers who are associated with the Lord’s work in heaven and on earth. God presides over a heavenly council composed of angels or “sons of God” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26">Gn 1:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19">1 Kgs 22:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.1.6">Jb 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.82.1-8">Ps 82</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Is 6</a>) whose messengers are sent from the Lord’s council to accomplish his purpose (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.12-15">Gn 28:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.13">Lk 2:13</a>).</p>
<p>Though the hosts are sometimes understood as the stars or angels, the tribes of Israel are also called “the host of the Lord.” The “host of heaven” in <a href="?bref=Dan.8.10-11">Daniel 8:10-11</a> appears to be figurative language referring to Israel, “the holy people,” and God, the King of Israel, is called “the Prince of the host.”</p>
<p>The Greek words translated “host” occur only twice in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.13">Lk 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.42">Acts 7:42</a>). “Lord of hosts” is used by Paul and James (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.29">Rom 9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.4">Jas 5:4</a>) as a title for the Lord. The term expresses God’s sovereign might and majesty in history, but the precise identification of the “hosts” that stand at his command is uncertain.</p>

  <title>Humility</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HUMILITY</p>
<p class="fl">A condition of lowliness or affliction in which one experiences a loss of power and prestige. Outside of biblical faith, humility in this sense would not usually be considered a virtue. Within the context of the Judeo-Christian tradition, however, humility is considered the proper attitude of human beings toward their Creator. Humility is a grateful and spontaneous awareness that life is a gift, and it is manifested as an ungrudging and unhypocritical acknowledgment of absolute dependence upon God.</p>
<p>In biblical literature there is not a clear distinction between humility and meekness or patience. In early stages of Israel’s history, the humble were identified as the poor, the afflicted, and the powerless. The Lord delivers the humble but brings down the proud (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.7">1 Sm 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.22.28">2 Sm 22:28</a>). Before the power and glory of God, the patriarch Abraham confessed that he was but dust and ashes (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.27">Gn 18:27</a>). Israel began as a nation subjected to slavery and knew themselves as a people chosen not because of numerical strength or material wealth but because of God’s love (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.7-8">Dt 7:7-8</a>). By attributing the source of all wealth and power to the Lord, those two major sources of human pride and arrogance are brought under control (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.9.23-24">Jer 9:23-24</a>).</p>
<p>The humble poor are the constant concern of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.6,11">Ex 23:6, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.4,7">Dt 15:4, 7</a>). Consequently, the humility of the poor became the symbol of the righteous God-fearer (<a href="?bref=Num.12.3">Nm 12:3</a>). In the development of the concept of humility in the OT, humility is nearly equated with righteousness and is identified, along with justice and mercy, as the requirement of God (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">Mi 6:8</a>). In the Psalms particularly, “the afflicted” is almost a technical term for the righteous (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.26">Pss 22:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.25.9">25:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.147.6">147:6</a>).</p>
<p>In addition, humility is the appropriate response of the sinner in the presence of the holiness of God. The prophet Isaiah, confronted by the glory of God in the temple, cried, “My destruction is sealed, for I am a sinful man” (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.5">Is 6:5</a>). Thus humility became more of a character trait than a term that reflected a state of material poverty or affliction. It became a concept reflective of the essence of piety and godliness expected of all people who have God as their Lord.</p>
<p>Only rarely in the NT does humility refer to an objective condition of poverty, affliction, or oppression.The humility motif is developed in connection with Jesus as Messiah. The religious ideal of humility that the OT attributed to the coming King certainly applied to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zec 9:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.21.4-5">Mt 21:4-5</a>). As Son of God, Jesus took no thought for himself but lived a life of obedience and trust in God the Father. The apostle Paul attributed to the incarnate Son of God a self-emptying by which he “humbled himself” and took on the form of a servant (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-8">Phil 2:5-8</a>). Jesus’ character exhibited no pride or arrogance.</p>
<p>Though bold in the face of hypocrisy and unflinching in his repudiation of pretentious religion, Jesus was “gentle and humble in heart” (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29">Mt 11:29</a>). He could, therefore, issue a severe warning against desire for status and openly rebuke the Pharisees for their violence against the poor and oppressed (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.11">Lk 14:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.12">Mt 23:12</a>). At the same time, he was humble before those whose servant and helper he had become (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.27">Lk 22:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>). The highest dignity of Jesus and his willingness to accept the cross in submission to the Father’s will are one. So his teaching on poverty of spirit rang true as a testimony of his own life. He ascribed all glory to his Father and lived in total dependence upon him (<a href="?bref=John.5.19">Jn 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.38">6:38</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.15">7:15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.28,50">8:28, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.10,24">14:10, 24</a>). By washing his disciples’ feet, he assumed the role of servant with no loss of dignity or self-worth. And he set forth such service as a model of a life that finds happiness in preferring others over one’s self (<a href="?bref=John.13.1-20">Jn 13:1-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-4">Phil 2:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>Consequently, disciples of Jesus are also summoned to a life of humility. Turning their backs on status, security, and success, Christians seek an opportunity to gain themselves in serving others. Humility, thus, is the all-embracing life principle by which love seeks the good of others, and thus fulfills the law (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.12.10">Rom 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">13:8-10</a>).</p>

  <title>Hunting</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HUNTING</p>
<p class="fl">Practice of tracking and pursuing animals for food, animal products, or sport—a practice as old as man. In Bible times hunting was practiced all over the biblical world. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.9">Genesis 10:9</a> refers to a certain Nimrod who was “a mighty hunter in the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s sight” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>); this was long before the patriarchs. In earliest human history hunting was an essential means of obtaining food, clothing, and tools, and even when civilization developed, hunting provided supplemental food for an agricultural diet.</p>
<p>In lands surrounding Israel, hunting is well represented in paintings and bas-reliefs. In ancient Egypt, hunting became a sport, and Egyptians hunted for game and birds often with the help of dogs and cats. Wild game was driven by dogs or humans into enclosures or toward pits and traps. Similarly, in Mesopotamia, hunting was widely practiced, as is evident from many bas-reliefs depicting stags and deer caught in nets. In Assyria wild animals, like lions, were commonly hunted. The bas-reliefs of Nineveh provide many fine pictures of the hunter’s skill.</p>
<p>Palestine was a land where hunting was practiced very early. This is clear from the bones of hunted animals found in the excavation of early sites. Certainly by the middle Bronze Age (c. 1800–1500 <span class="era">BC</span>), which approximates the patriarchal age, hunting was widely practiced. The reference to Esau as a skillful hunter (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.27">Gn 25:27</a>) would be typical of a time when both agricultural and hunting pursuits were followed. The Egyptian “Tale of Sinuhe”, from the 20th century <span class="era">BC</span>, mentions hunting with hounds.</p>
<p>The Bible text gives a number of glimpses into the kinds of birds and animals that were hunted. Lists of animals that were “clean” are provided in <a href="?bref=Deut.14.4-6">Deuteronomy 14:4-6</a>. An interesting variety of animals was available to the people of Israel; many were domestic, but there was a variety of wild animals to test the ingenuity of the hunter: the goat, the hare, the gazelle, the roebuck (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kgs 4:23</a>), the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the mountain sheep. In every case the blood of the animal had to be poured out. There was a proverb current in Israel about a slothful man who caught no prey—or if he catches it, doesn’t cook it (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.27">Prv 12:27</a>).</p>
<p>Some passages in the OT record the killing of animals in self-protection (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.6">Jgs 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.34-37">1 Sm 17:34-37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.20">2 Sm 23:20</a>). Shepherds normally carried a club and a sling to protect their flocks from marauding beasts (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.40">1 Sm 17:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.23.4">Ps 23:4</a>).</p>
<p>A variety of birds was hunted, as for example, the partridge referred to in <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.20">1 Samuel 26:20</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.14.11-18">Dt 14:11-18</a>). There are references also to some of the devices used in hunting: bows and arrows (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.3">Gn 27:3</a>), clubs (<a href="?bref=Job.41.29">Jb 41:29</a>), sling stones (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.40">1 Sm 17:40</a>), nets (<a href="?bref=Job.19.6">Jb 19:6</a>), fowlers’ snares (<a href="?bref=Ps.91.3">Ps 91:3</a>), camouflaged pits (<a href="?bref=Ps.7.15">Pss 7:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.7">35:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.14">Prv 22:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.26.27">26:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.17-18">Is 24:17-18</a>). Of the traps mentioned in the Bible one seems to have been an automatic device (<a href="?bref=Amos.3.5">Am 3:5</a>) that would spring up from the ground when an animal touched it (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.69.22">Ps 69:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.8">Hos 9:8</a>) or when the fowler pulled a cord (<a href="?bref=Ps.140.5">Ps 140:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.5.26">Jer 5:26</a>). The method of driving animals into a trap seems to be referred to in <a href="?bref=Jer.16.16">Jeremiah 16:16</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.8">Ezekiel 19:8</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">HURRIANS*</p>
<p class="fl">People (also called Mitannians) who spoke a language different from Semitic and Indo-European and yet played a significant cultural role in the Near East during the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, particularly in transmitting the culture of Sumer and Babylon to western Asia and to the Hittites. That the Hurrians were in an area can be inferred from the presence of Hurrian texts, the presence of people with Hurrian names (or Indo-Iranian as explained below), and from statements in other ancient literature, including the OT.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second millennium, and even somewhat before, Hurrians are found in the northernmost parts of Mesopotamia, having come there presumably from still farther north. They are found in the 18th century <span class="era">BC</span> at Mari and Alalakh, and in the 15th and 14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span> at Nuzi, Ugarit, Alalakh, a few cities in Palestine, and especially in their political center of Mitanni. During this latter period, their rulers were actually an aristocracy of Indo-Iranian extraction, who often retained their Indo-Iranian names, but who in other respects had adopted Hurrian language, religion, and general culture, and so were for all practical purposes Hurrians.</p>
<p>The main question concerning Hurrian presence is the extent to which they were influential in Palestine, and here the evidence is not clear. The Amarna letters, written by the Mitannian/Hurrian kings and by petty kings of Palestine to the Egyptian pharaohs during the 14th century <span class="era">BC</span>, refer to a few Palestinian kings with Hurrian (some Indo-Iranian) names such as Abdikhepa of Jerusalem. However, the letters, written in Akkadian by the scribes of these Palestinian kings, betray a local Canaanite rather than Hurrian speech. Interestingly, the Egyptians referred to Palestine as the land of the Hurrians, and indeed one pharaoh claimed to have captured 36,000 Hurrians there, but this could mean inhabitants of Palestine rather than ethnic Hurrians. In view of the evidence of the Amarna letters, it is likely that Palestine was only nominally Hurrian.</p>

When his counsel was not followed, Ahithophel hanged himself, probably anticipating the disastrous outcome (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.32-37">2 Sm 15:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.15-17.23">16:15–17:23</a>). Hushai belonged to the Archite family from Ataroth, a town on Ephraim and Benjamin’s border (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.2,7">Jos 16:2, 7</a>).</p>

  <title>Hyksos*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HYKSOS*</p>
<p class="fl">Term used by Egyptian historian Manetho (c. 280 <span class="era">BC</span>) to designate the foreign rulers of the 15th and 16th dynasties in Egypt (1730?–1570? <span class="era">BC</span>). Once called the shepherd kings, that expression is now thought to have come from a misrendering of an Egyptian text.</p>
<p>The Hyksos were Semites, probably entering Egypt from Syria and Palestine, though their exact origin is unknown. They gradually infiltrated Egypt during the 18th century <span class="era">BC</span>, and it is possible that some intermarriage took place. This infiltration was aided by a weakening of Egyptian power as a result of internal dynastic rivalries. Some of the Hyksos may have held Egyptian administrative posts before the actual Hyksos takeover, which was probably more of a swift political maneuver than a great military conquest.</p>
<p>The Hyksos capital was probably established at Qantir in the delta region of northeastern Egypt. From there they could maintain ties with their cultural base in Palestine and Syria. Qantir was close to Goshen, the Egyptian territory inhabited by the Israelites during their sojourn in Egypt.</p>
<p>The Hyksos introduced the war chariot into Egypt, a military device later used to drive the Hyksos aliens out of Egypt. Horse and chariot warfare became the norm in the following centuries. The Hyksos presence also forced the Egyptians to acknowledge the surrounding Middle Eastern world. Previously Egyptians generally had viewed other peoples as barbarians and themselves as the cultural center of the world. When the Hyksos were evicted by Ahmose in 1570(?) <span class="era">BC</span>, Egypt embarked on a course of conquests initiating its empire period (16th–12th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>). No monuments from the Hyksos era have been found, and whatever monuments did exist were probably destroyed when Egyptian rule was reestablished.</p>
<p>The relation of the Hyksos to Israel’s history is debated and depends on a correct interpretation of <a href="?bref=Exod.1.8">Exodus 1:8</a>: “Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.” If Joseph died just before 1800 <span class="era">BC</span>, and if the Hyksos takeover in Egypt was about 1730 <span class="era">BC</span>, then the “new king” was a Hyksos ruler who did not know of Joseph, or perhaps had no reason to respect Joseph’s descendants even if he had known Joseph. The new rigor of servitude described in <a href="?bref=Exod.1.9-14">Exodus 1:9-14</a> would, according to that interpretation, have been introduced by the Hyksos. If so, it may be that the Hyksos were fewer in number than the Hebrews and feared some kind of uprising (v <a href="?bref=Exod.1.9">9</a>), or the Hyksos may have feared an alliance between the Hebrews and the Egyptians, which also might have led to the Hyksos being deposed (v <a href="?bref=Exod.1.10">10</a>). In this view, the pharaoh who ordered the Hebrew midwives to kill newborn Hebrew boys (v <a href="?bref=Exod.1.15">15</a>) ruled Egypt after the Hyksos had been overthrown. Thus there would be a gap of at least 150 years between verse <a href="?bref=Exod.1.14">14</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.1.15">15</a>.</p>
<p>The other interpretation places Joseph’s arrival in Egypt sometime during the Hyksos rule, not prior to it. Here it is assumed that a Semitic people such as the Hyksos would not be averse to having another Semite in their government, nor would they oppose the settlement of Jacob’s family in Egypt. Further, the location of Jacob’s family and descendants in Goshen fits with the known fact that the Hyksos had their center of control in that region. This view might also explain why Egyptian records do not mention Joseph—his name would have been offensive to later Egyptian national feeling, and therefore removed from any records. If this line of reasoning were accepted, then the king “who did not know Joseph” came to the throne after the Hyksos had been overthrown. With the Hyksos eliminated by the revived Egyptian dynasty, it follows that the Hebrews, another Semitic group, would be brought into subjection also.</p>
<p>In either case, it is clear that the Hyksos and the Hebrews were not in agreement on religious matters. The Hyksos worshiped the Canaanite gods, especially Baal, in their own lands, and they combined that worship with Egyptian sun-god worship when they ruled in Egypt.</p>

<p class="h1">HYMENAEUS</p>
<p class="fl">Believer, probably of Ephesus, cited by Paul as one who “rejected conscience” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.19-20">1 Tm 1:19-20</a>) and “swerved from the truth” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.18">2 Tm 2:18</a>). In the first instance, Hymenaeus (mentioned with Alexander) is viewed as having rejected correct beliefs and made a shipwreck of his faith. The seriousness of his offense is evident, as Paul sternly relates that he has delivered him over to Satan. The meaning of this phrase is uncertain, although it might have involved physical affliction, as well as severance from the body of other Christians. The harsh action was meant to bring about, not ultimate destruction, but eventual and lasting benefit to Hymenaeus so he might learn not to blaspheme (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>). Apparently, this censure was not successful. In <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.17-18">2 Timothy 2:17-18</a>, Hymenaeus appears as one who is “upsetting the faith.” He (along with Philetus) was teaching that the resurrection had already taken place. Most probably, he was teaching that the resurrection takes place at the time of spiritual rebirth and baptism, based on a faulty interpretation of <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-11">Romans 6:1-11</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.3.1">Colossians 3:1</a>. Hymenaeus thus sought to teach a spiritualized resurrection taking place as the soul awakens from sin.</p>

  <title>Hypocrisy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">HYPOCRISY</p>
<p class="fl">The act of pretending to be what one is not, especially the false appearance of being religious or virtuous. Our modern understanding of the word “hypocrisy” is determined by its use in the NT, especially by Jesus. In both the NT and subsequent understandings the term most often meant deceit, misrepresenting the truth, or claiming virtues or qualities one does not possess.</p>
<p>In contrast to its consistently negative meaning in the Bible, hypocrisy as first used by the Greeks was a neutral word. In its verb form it meant “to explain, to interpret, or to expound.” Although the noun “hypocrisy” could mean “answer,” the other noun form, “hypocrite,” almost always meant “actor” and probably came from the verb meaning “to expound.”</p>
<p>Originally, a hypocrite could be a speaker or actor who interpreted the words of a poet or the music of a composer. The actor, or hypocrite, tried to make intelligible for his audience what the poet or composer had written. On a larger scale the hypocrite could be one actor among others in a drama performed on a stage. A good hypocrite faithfully interpreted his assigned role, while an undesirable hypocrite interpreted his role poorly. Because of the word’s essential neutrality, accompanying words were necessary to set its direction.</p>
<p>In Hellenistic times (c. 325–125 <span class="era">BC</span>), the world was commonly viewed as a stage and all human conduct as the art of acting. One’s role and script were written for him by his familial, cultural, and religious environment and could be performed either successfully or poorly. When used in this sense, hypocrisy did not carry the idea of pretense or sham. Nevertheless, there are instances where the term “hypocrite” was used to describe a person who performed life’s role deceptively. The image presented to the public was only a mask behind which the true and different self lay hidden.</p>
<p>The Gospels often use the terms “hypocrisy” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.28">Mt 23:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.15">Mk 12:15b</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.1">Lk 12:1</a>) and “hypocrite” (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.5">Mt 7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.51">24:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.42">Lk 6:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.15">13:15</a>) to record the conflict between Jesus and his opponents. With respect to the Pharisees and Sadducees, Jesus detected a blatant contrast between their outward forms of righteousness and their failure to embrace the more substantive aspects of righteousness: mercy, justice, humility, forgiveness, and love toward the unlovely (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.38,42">Lk 11:38, 42</a>). They hid their failure in this matter behind pious pretense (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-13">Mk 7:1-13</a>). Inwardly they were full of greed and wickedness (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.39">Lk 11:39</a>). Hypocrisy defines the one who presents an outward appearance of righteousness but who is inwardly marked by wickedness (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.28">Mt 23:28</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus condemned hypocrisy because it distorts God’s righteous command. Rather than pursue an authentic inward holiness, the hypocrites distorted righteousness into a rigid mold whose chief usefulness was exhibition before people (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.2-7">Mt 23:2-7</a>). Their idea of righteousness revealed a warped conception of God and a perverse understanding of how he reconciles sinners to himself (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.15">Lk 16:15</a>). The hypocrites, who claimed to interpret God to humans, actually misrepresented him. Consequently, their falsification led sinners away from God rather than toward reconciliation with him (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.52">Lk 11:52</a>). Hypocrites not only keep others from entering the kingdom of God, they refrain from going in themselves (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.13">Mt 23:13</a>).</p>
