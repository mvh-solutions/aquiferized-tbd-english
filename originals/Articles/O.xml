  <title>Oath</title>

<p class="h1">OATH</p>
<p class="fl">Solemn vow or promise to fulfill a pledge. There are two terms in Hebrew that mean “oath”: <span class="hebrew">‘ala</span> and <span class="hebrew">sebu’a</span><span class="ital">.</span> The latter, more general term in ancient times meant to enter into a solemn (even magical) relationship with the number seven, although ancient connections are lost. Even so, when Abraham and Abimelech entered into an oath at Beersheba (the well of seven, or the well of the oath), Abraham set aside seven ewe lambs as a witness to the fact that he had dug a well (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.22-31">Gn 21:22-31</a>). The former term <span class="hebrew">‘ala</span><span class="ital">,</span> often translated “oath,” properly means “curse.” At times the two terms are used together (<a href="?bref=Num.5.21">Nm 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.10.29">Neh 10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.11">Dn 9:11</a>). Any breach of one’s undertaking affirmed by an oath would be attended by a curse. The Lord affirmed that he had established a covenant and a curse with Israel—that is, a breach of covenant would be followed by a curse (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.14-29">Dt 29:14ff</a>.).</p>
<p>An oath was taken to confirm an agreement or, in a political situation, to confirm a treaty. Both in Israel and among its neighbors, God (or the gods) would act as the guarantor(s) of the agreement and his name (or their names) was invoked for this purpose. When Jacob and Laban made an agreement, they erected a heap of stones as a witness (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.53">Gn 31:53</a>). If either party transgressed the terms, it was a heinous sin. For this reason one of the Ten Commandments dealt with empty affirmations: “Do not misuse the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God. The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.7">Ex 20:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The people of Israel were forbidden to swear their oaths by false gods (<a href="?bref=Jer.12.16">Jer 12:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.14">Am 8:14</a>). To breach an international treaty, where the oath was taken in the Lord’s name, merited death (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.16-17">Ez 17:16-17</a>). It was one of the complaints of Hosea that the people of his day swore falsely when they made a covenant (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.4">Hos 10:4</a>). Judgment would attend such wanton disregard of the solemnity of an oath. Certain civil situations in Israel called for an oath (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.10-11">Ex 22:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.5.1">Lv 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.3">6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.5.11-28">Nm 5:11-28</a>). This practice provided a pattern for the Israelite covenantal oath of allegiance between God and his people.</p>
<p>Christ taught that oaths were binding (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.33">Mt 5:33</a>). In the kingdom of God oaths would become unnecessary (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.5.34-37">34-37</a>). At his trial before Caiaphas, Jesus heard an imprecatory oath from the high priest (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.63-65">26:63-65</a>), and Paul swore by an oath on occasion (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.23">2 Cor 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.20">Gal 1:20</a>). God himself was bound by his own oath (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.13-18">Heb 6:13-18</a>) to keep his promise to the patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.24">Gn 50:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.19-37,49">Pss 89:19-37, 49</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-4">110:1-4</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Practically nothing is known about Obadiah the prophet. Not even the name of his father or his home region is given in the superscription (<a href="?bref=Obad.1.1">Ob 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">It would seem likely that Obadiah came from Judah, because he expresses deep concern over the inroads made into his land by the Edomites in the day of Judah’s destruction (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.12">12</a>). He probably had his vision concerning Edom (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.1">1</a>) shortly before the fall of Jerusalem and the devastation of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nebuchadnezzar may have invaded Edom in 582 <span class="era">BC</span>, although no certain reference to such an invasion exists. The Babylonian king Nabonidus stayed at Teima for several years, and the town of Tell el Kheleifeh near the Gulf of Aqaba flourished early in the century. However, Edom entered a period of decline in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, due to interference from its trading partners from Arabia and the south, such as Teima and Dedan.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">Edom’s fall is announced by the prophet (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.1-4">1-4</a>). Evidently, a coalition of neighboring Arab tribes was conspiring to attack Edom, which added weight to his message (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.1">1</a>). Little did these tribes know that their planned assault on Edom was part of the divine plan.</p>
<p>Edom’s destruction is declared (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.2-9">2-9</a>) and its actual downfall is described (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.2-4">2-4</a>). Edom, apparently strong and safe in the rocky bastion in the high mountains (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.3">3</a>), would be brought low (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.4">4</a>). Edom’s overthrow would be complete (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.5-6">5-6</a>). As thieves and marauders ravage a place by night, so Edom would be stripped, its houses and vineyards plundered. Edom would know no merciful alleviation as sometimes happens when robbers raid a house. Even allies would prove treacherous (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.7">7</a>), confederates would deceive, and guests would set snares. Taken by surprise, Edom would fall an easy prey. When the day of Edom’s doom came, the wise would be destroyed (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.8">8</a>) and soldiers demoralized and slaughtered (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>Edom’s wrongdoing is spelled out (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.10-15">10-15</a>). Edom showed ill will toward Judah on the day when the Babylonians attacked. Rather than helping Judah, Edom stood aloof and behaved like one of Judah’s foes. To make matters worse, Edom gloated over Judah’s misfortune, jeered at the people, and laid hands on their property. Edom collaborated with Babylon, cutting off Judah’s refugees from escape and handing them over to Judah’s enemies. Such deeds would return to Edom.</p>
<p>On the Day of the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.15-21">15-21</a>), guilty Edom would be caught up in the wider scale of God’s judgment on all nations. Beyond the day of disaster endured by Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> stood another day, a day of vindication and judgment in Israel’s favor.</p>
<p>Positively, the remnant of Judah (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.17,21">17, 21</a>) would be preserved; the sacred site, Mt Zion, would be rehabilitated; and the Edomites would come under the control of the remnant of Israel. Like a fire, Israel would consume the stubble of Edom (v <a href="?bref=Obad.1.18">18</a>) and regain lost territories (vv <a href="?bref=Obad.1.19-20">19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalSignificance">Theological Significance</p>
<p class="fl">Theologically, the prophecy stresses divine sovereignty in the midst of the cruel invasion of Judah’s restricted sovereignty. The Lord of history works out his purposes in the midst of past and present events. In the future, he would execute judgment on Israel’s foes. Zion would be reestablished as the proud capital of a glorious nation, freed from pagan defilement forever.</p>

<p class="h1">OBED-EDOM</p>
<p class="list">1. Man under whose care David placed the ark of the covenant when he was transferring it from Gibeah to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.10-12">2 Sm 6:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.5-14">1 Chr 13:5-14</a>). He is called a Gittite, which indicates that his birthplace was Gath. This was not the Philistine city of Gath but the Levitical town in the territory of Dan known as Gath-rimmon (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.45">Jos 19:45</a>). It is likely that Obed-edom was a Levite and therefore qualified to care for the ark of the covenant. Uzzah’s rash action in steadying the ark when the oxen stumbled brought upon him immediate death. David’s consternation and fear at this turn of events led him to reconsider his intention of bringing the ark to Jerusalem. Apparently Obed-edom’s home was nearby and it was convenient to leave the ark in his care. When David was informed after three months that the Lord had greatly blessed Obed-edom, he realized that the judgment that fell on Uzzah was incurred because the ark was carried contrary to the method prescribed in the Law (<a href="?bref=Num.4.15">Nm 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.9">7:9</a>) and not because the Lord was angry with Uzzah. He ordered that the ark be taken from Obed-edom’s home and carried to Jerusalem in the proper manner (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.25-28">1 Chr 15:25-28</a>). Apparently Obed-edom was rewarded for his faithful service by being appointed a gatekeeper for the ark in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.24">15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.4,8,15">26:4, 8, 15</a>).

  <title>Obedience</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">OBEDIENCE</p>
<p class="fl">Act or instance of submitting to the restraint or command of an authority; compliance with the demands or requests of someone over us. The general words for obedience in both Hebrew and Greek refer to hearing or hearkening to a superior authority. Another major Greek word includes the idea of submission to authority in the sense of arranging or ordering oneself under someone in a place of command. A third Greek word suggests obedience that is a result more of persuasion than of submission.</p>
<p>Obedience to God and human authorities is an obligation stressed in both the OT and NT. Abraham was additionally blessed on one occasion because he obeyed God in offering Isaac on the altar (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.18">Gn 22:18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.26.5">26:5</a>). God’s continued blessing upon Israel by virtue of the Sinai covenant was contingent upon their obeying his voice and keeping his covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5">Ex 19:5</a>). On the verge of entering Canaan, Moses placed before Israel a blessing and a curse—the former if they listened to and obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and the latter if they did not (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.22-28">Dt 11:22-28</a>).</p>
<p>Deuteronomy warns that the penalty for stubborn and rebellious children is, first of all, chastisement, and then death by stoning if they persistently refuse to listen (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.18-21">Dt 21:18-21</a>).</p>
<p>One evidence that a person is a child of God is continued obedience to the commandments of God (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.3-5">1 Jn 2:3-5</a>). Jesus said that those who love him would keep his commandments (<a href="?bref=John.14.15">Jn 14:15</a>). And Peter, speaking of Christians, calls them “obedient children” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14">1 Pt 1:14</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Heb.5.9">Heb 5:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.8">11:8</a>).</p>
<p>Christians are to render obedience to a variety of people: believers to the Lord (<a href="?bref=John.14.21-24">Jn 14:21-24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.10">15:10</a>), wives to their husbands (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.22-24">Eph 5:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.18">Col 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.5">Ti 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1,5">1 Pt 3:1, 5</a>), children to their parents (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.1">Eph 6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.20">Col 3:20</a>), citizens to their governmental officials (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.1-7">Rom 13:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.1">Ti 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.13-14">1 Pt 2:13-14</a>), and servants to their masters (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.5">Eph 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.22">Col 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.9">Ti 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.18">1 Pt 2:18</a>).</p>
<p>However, in spite of the strong stress on obedience in the Bible, such obedience is never made the grounds for justification before God. Paul declares that salvation is a gift of God that will produce good works (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.8-10">Eph 2:8-10</a>). So, too, James speaks of works of obedience as flowing from faith (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">Jas 2:14-26</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus himself, on the night of his betrayal, emphasized by repetition that love for him is measured by obedience to his commandments (<a href="?bref=John.14.15,21,23-24">Jn 14:15, 21, 23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.10">15:10</a>). He underscored this by asserting that his own love for the Father was evidenced by his obeying the Father’s commands (<a href="?bref=John.14.31">14:31</a>). The Bible mentions many people whose obedience to God comes from their faith and love for him (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-40">Heb 11</a>). For example, Abel believed God and offered a more excellent sacrifice (v <a href="?bref=Heb.11.4">4</a>); Noah put his faith in God’s word and prepared an ark (v <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">7</a>); by faith Abraham left Ur at God’s direction, not knowing his destination (v <a href="?bref=Heb.11.8">8</a>); Moses put his faith in God and refused the privileges of being called Pharaoh’s son, choosing rather to identify with Israel, God’s people (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.11.24-25">24-25</a>). The greatest example of obedience based on trust in God is Jesus Christ himself. He emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant; he humbled himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.7-8">Phil 2:7-8</a>).</p>

  <title>Offend, Offense</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">OFFEND, OFFENSE</p>
<p class="fl">Words used two ways in the Bible: doing what is wrong oneself, or causing someone else to do wrong or to stumble.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DoingWrong">Doing Wrong</p>
<p class="fl">In both the Hebrew of the OT and the Greek of the NT there are several words for sin or wrongdoing having a variety of different translations. With the word “offend” or “offense,” the emphasis is on the sin being against a person or against the law, an offense against either God or man.</p>
<p>Sin is fundamentally an offense against God. For example, the people of Edom had grievously offended in taking vengeance on Judah, and so the hand of the Lord was against them in judgment (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.12-13">Ez 25:12-13</a>). Israel commited an offense in their worship of Baal (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.1">Hos 13:1</a>). The breaking of God’s law is spoken of as an “offense committed” (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.15">Dt 19:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.22.26">22:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.25.2">25:2</a>). In the NT, James (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.10">Jas 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.2">3:2</a>) speaks of offenses against God and against his law.</p>
<p>There are many passages in the Bible addressing one man’s offense against another: for example, Abraham’s against Abimelech (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.9">Gn 20:9</a>), or Pharaoh’s chief butler and chief baker against their master (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.1">40:1</a>). Sometimes it is an alleged offense and no actual wrong has been done (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.31.36">Gn 31:36</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.14">2 Kgs 18:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.37.18">Jer 37:18</a>). Paul, in his defense before the Roman governor Festus, said, “Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all” (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.8">Acts 25:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Finally, the Bible speaks about dealing with real offenses against God and people. Offenses should be acknowledged and confessed (<a href="?bref=Hos.5.15">Hos 5:15</a>). One’s proper resolution before God is “I will not offend any more” (<a href="?bref=Job.34.31">Jb 34:31</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). One needs to make amends for offenses (<a href="?bref=Eccl.10.4">Eccl 10:4</a>) and to forgive the offenses of others (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.9">Prv 17:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.19.11">19:11</a>). Jesus Christ died for our offenses (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.15-21">5:15-21</a>), so that in turning to him there is forgiveness for all sins.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CausingAnothertoSin">Causing Another to Sin</p>
<p class="fl">The noun “offense” and the verb “offend” are also used in reference to a person being caused to stumble or to do what is wrong. There are three ways in which this may happen:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. There may be something in the individual that causes him or her to stumble. Jesus expressed the seriousness of this, and though speaking metaphorically, he indicated the strenuous steps of prevention (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.29-30">Mt 5:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.8-9">18:8-9</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. There may be something in a person that causes offense to others. Jesus said, “Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!” (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.7">Mt 18:7</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). There are, in fact, many NT passages that insist that one should live so as not to cause others to stumble (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.13">Rom 14:13</a>). The apostle Paul says, “Don’t tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, there is nothing wrong with these things in themselves. But it is wrong to eat anything if it makes another person stumble. Don’t eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another Christian to stumble” (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.20-21">Rom 14:20-21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.32">1 Cor 10:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.3">2 Cor 6:3</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. However, people may be offended at the truth through no fault of the person who presents it. Isaiah speaks of God as “a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall” (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.14">Is 8:14</a>) in that people would not always accept his demands and the way of faith in him. The NT takes these same words and applies them to the offense of the gospel of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.32-33">Rom 9:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.8">1 Pt 2:8</a>). In the time of his ministry there were those who were offended at Jesus—at his lowly birth (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.57">Mt 13:57</a>), at what he said and did (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.12">15:12</a>), or because of the cost of following him (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.21">13:21</a>). Even disciples were capable of being offended and turning aside (<a href="?bref=John.6.61">Jn 6:61</a>). In the end all were offended and fled from him (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.31,56">Mt 26:31, 56</a>). Finally, the apostle Paul spoke of the offense in the preaching of the cross of Christ. He could have chosen to preach a popular message and avoided persecution, a “message that doesn’t offend anyone” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.11">Gal 5:11</a>). He chose rather to preach the cross even though it was a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.23">1 Cor 1:23</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES</p>
<p class="fl">Major ritual expressions of religious life with accompanying rites, such as libations, effusions, and sacred meals. The ideology expressed in Israel’s ritual complex made its religion unique in the ancient Near East. The concepts of OT ritual also underlie NT theology with regard to sin and reconciliation to God through the atoning death of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PerformanceandOrderofSacrifices">Performance and Order of Sacrifices</p>
<p class="fl">The main source for a description of the correct performance of sacrificial ritual is the opening section of Leviticus (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-7.38">Lv 1–7</a>). It consists of two separate parts. The first (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-6.7">1:1–6:7</a>) is didactic, dealing with two categories of sacrifice: those of a “pleasing odor,” namely, the burnt (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-17">1:1-17</a>), the grain (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.1-16">2:1-16</a>), and the peace offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.1-17">3:1-17</a>); and the expiatory sacrifices, namely, the sin (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.1-5.13">4:1–5:13</a>) and the guilt or trespass offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.14-6.7">5:14–6:7</a>). Attention is paid to the minute details of each ritual, and they are grouped according to their logical or conceptual associations.</p>
<p>The grain (or cereal) offering follows the burnt offering because it always accompanied it in actual practice (<a href="?bref=Num.15.1-21">Nm 15:1-21</a>; chs <a href="?bref=Num.28.1-29.40">28–29</a>); it also went with the peace offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.12-14">Lv 7:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.3-4">Nm 15:3-4</a>). Special emphasis is placed on burning the inward parts of a sacrifice on the altar to make a “pleasing odor to the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.9,17">Lv 1:9, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.2.2,9,12">2:2, 9, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.3.5,11,16">3:5, 11, 16</a>). When the Lord smelled the pleasing odor (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.21">Gn 8:21</a>), it was a sign of divine favor; refusal indicated God’s displeasure (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.31">Lv 26:31</a>). The officiating priest evidently knew how to read the signs and would tell the offerer whether his sacrifice had been accepted (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.19">1 Sm 26:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.5.21-23">Am 5:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>The sin and guilt offerings were expiatory (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.1-6.7">Lv 4:1–6:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-27">20</a>). The situations requiring such offerings are listed, and special emphasis is laid on the handling of the blood in the ritual.</p>
<p>The second major section in this passage (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.8-7.38">Lv 6:8–7:38</a>) stresses the administrative details for the various offerings. This section consists of a series of “instructions” for each type of offering pertaining to the distribution of the sacrificial materials. Some went to the priest(s), some went to the offerer, and others were burned on the altar or disposed of outside the camp. Those sacrifices designated as “most holy” were to be eaten only by qualified members of the priesthood (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.3,10">Lv 2:3, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.10.12-17">10:12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.14.13">14:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.18.9">Nm 18:9</a>).</p>
<p>The burnt offering is discussed first because it was entirely consumed on the altar (and thus not eaten by anyone). After it, there follow the sacrifices distributed to the officiants (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.17,26,29">Lv 6:17, 26, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.1,6">7:1, 6</a>), and at the end come the peace offerings, a significant portion of which was returned to the offender.</p>
<p>The order in which the sacrifices are treated in this passage also corresponds to their relative frequency in the rituals of the sacred calendar (<a href="?bref=Num.28.19">Nm 28:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.31.3">2 Chr 31:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.17">Ez 45:17</a>). This would be particularly important for the priests and Levites on duty at the temple because they were responsible for the logistics of the daily sacrificial ritual, especially on the high holidays; management of the temple storehouse was a formidable task (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.28-32">1 Chr 23:28-32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.15,20-22">26:15, 20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.10-11">2 Chr 13:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.30.3-19">30:3-19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.9-11">34:9-11</a>).</p>
<p>Each section concerning a particular offering concludes with the logistic or administrative details peculiar to it. There then follows a summary of the matters treated thus far (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.7-10">Lv 7:7-10</a>), and the section concludes with a treatment of the peace offerings (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.7.11-36">11-36</a>). The latter did not play a role in the sacred calendar except during the Feast of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.19-20">23:19-20</a>); on all other occasions, with the two exceptions of the Nazirite vow and the installation of the priesthood, peace offerings were purely voluntary sacrifices and thus not subject to any fixed bookkeeping.</p>
<p>In other biblical contexts, the sacrifices are listed according to the same “bookkeeping” or “administrative” order: burnt, grain, and drink; sin (or guilt); and sometimes peace offerings. An example is the roster of donations made by the tribal leaders for dedication of the altar (<a href="?bref=Num.7.1-89">Nm 7</a>). The information is organized like an everyday ledger from the temple storehouse; the summary classifies the animals as burnt, grain, sin, and peace offerings (vv <a href="?bref=Num.7.87-88">87-88</a>) in accordance with the respective entries from each donor (vv <a href="?bref=Num.7.15-17">15-17</a>). The Levitical scribe had two purposes for such a record: to credit the offerers and to record the treasures and food supplies coming in. Much of the foodstuffs being given as offerings was actually apportioned to the officiating priests (<a href="?bref=Num.18.8-11">Nm 18:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.31.4-19">2 Chr 31:4-19</a>).</p>
<p>When prescriptions were made as to the type and number of offerings to be brought (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.15.24">Nm 15:24</a>), the “bookkeeping” order is generally followed. This was true of the calendarial sacrifices; burnt and grain offerings and libations were listed, followed by a sin offering for each of the following: New Moon (<a href="?bref=Num.28.11-15">Nm 28:11-15</a>), each day of Passover (vv <a href="?bref=Num.28.19-22">19-22</a>), the Festival of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.18-19">Lv 23:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.27-30">Nm 28:27-30</a>), Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Num.29.2-5">29:2-5</a>), Day of Atonement (vv <a href="?bref=Num.29.8-11">8-11</a>), and each day of the Feast of Tabernacles (vv <a href="?bref=Num.29.12-16">12-16</a>).</p>
<p>For sacrifices required in specific cases, the instructions as to what offerings to bring follow this sequence (e.g., the purification of a woman after giving birth, <a href="?bref=Lev.12.6-8">Lv 12:6-8</a>). Note also the offerings given at the successful termination of a Nazirite vow; the Nazirite brought burnt, sin, and peace offerings (with some special grain offerings, <a href="?bref=Num.6.14-15">Nm 6:14-15</a>). However, the priest conducted the actual ritual according to a different order; the sin offering was made first, followed by the burnt offering and finally the peace offering (vv <a href="?bref=Num.6.16-17">16-17</a>). In the case of an incomplete vow, the first step was to offer a sin offering and then a burnt offering to renew the vow (v <a href="?bref=Num.6.11">11</a>). The reconsecration of the Nazirite required a separate guilt offering—a distinct ritual act (v <a href="?bref=Num.6.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>The description of the offerings made by the prince of Israel in the latter days presents the same contrast between the two orders of sacrifices. On festival holidays the prince brought burnt, grain, and drink offerings, but he offered them as sin, grain, burnt, and peace offerings (<a href="?bref=Ezek.45.17">Ez 45:17</a>). This second order of sacrifices in which the sin offering precedes the burnt offering was also followed in the rededication of the altar (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.18-27">43:18-27</a>).</p>
<p>The same “procedural” sequence of sacrifices appears in other instances: the purification of the leper—guilt and sin offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.19">Lv 14:19</a>), followed by a burnt offering (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.14.12-20">12-20</a>); the man with a discharge—sin and burnt offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.15">15:15</a>); likewise the woman with a discharge (v <a href="?bref=Lev.15.30">30</a>). The same order is followed for the sacrifices on the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.3-6,11,15,24">16:3-6, 11, 15, 24</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Leviticus furnishes two examples of the proper order in which sacrifices were offered. One is the ordination of Aaron and his sons. The sin offering came first and then the burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.10-18">Ex 29:10-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.14-21">Lv 8:14-21</a>). The focal point in this ritual was the sacrifice of ordination, or literally “installation,” a special form of peace offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.19-34">Ex 29:19-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.22-29">Lv 8:22-29</a>). The second passage is the formal inauguration of the sacrificial system at the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Lev.9.1-24">Lv 9</a>). The sacrifices for Aaron were sin and burnt offerings, followed by those for the people: sin, burnt, grain, and peace offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.9.7-22">9:7-22</a>).</p>
<p>The same sequence is followed at the cleansing and restoration of the temple in Jerusalem conducted by King Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.20-36">2 Chr 29:20-36</a>). A great sin offering was first, followed by the burnt offerings accompanied by music and song. Then the king proclaimed that the people had committed themselves to the Lord; in this new state of purity they could now share in the sacrifices of devotion (burnt offerings) and thanksgiving (peace offerings).</p>
<p>The procedural order of the sacrifices embodies the OT ideology of how God may be approached. First, atonement for sin had to be made and then total consecration of self; these are symbolized by the sin and/or guilt offerings and the burnt and grain offerings, respectively. When these conditions were met, the offerer could express his continued devotion by more burnt offerings and also take part in the fellowship sacrifices (peace offerings) in which he himself got a large portion of the slaughtered animal (to share with his friends and the poor in his community; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.17-19">Dt 12:17-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DescriptionofSacrifices">Description of Sacrifices</p>
<p class="fl">The ensuing description of the different types of sacrifice will treat them in accordance with the “procedural” order, that is, as symbolic stages in one’s approach to God.</p>
<p class="h3">Expiation</p>
<p class="fl">These two offerings were required for making atonement for sins and trespasses:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.1-5.13">Lv 4:1–5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.24-30">6:24-30</a>). Different animals were specified in accordance with the rank of the offerer. A high priest had to bring a young bull (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.3">4:3</a>), as did the congregation as a whole (v <a href="?bref=Lev.4.14">14</a>), except when the matter was a ritual infraction (<a href="?bref=Num.15.24">Nm 15:24</a>). A ruler would bring a male goat (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.23">Lv 4:23</a>), but a commoner could provide a female goat (v <a href="?bref=Lev.4.28">28</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.27">Nm 15:27</a>) or a lamb (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.32">Lv 4:32</a>). If he was indigent, he could offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons (one of which would be a burnt offering; <a href="?bref=Lev.5.7">5:7</a>), or if he was extremely poor, he might even substitute a tenth of an ephah of fine flour (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.11-13">Lv 5:11-13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.22">Heb 9:22</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="SacrificialOffering"/>
<p class="list-text">The offerer brought the animal to the entrance of the temple court and laid his hand on it (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.4">Lv 4:4</a>). He did not confess his sin in this act because the animal was not being sent away (cf. the goat for Azazel, <a href="?bref=Lev.16.21">16:21</a>); rather, he was identifying himself with the sacrifice. The offerer had to kill the animal on the north side of the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.24,29">4:24, 29</a>). The animals were never slaughtered on the altar proper. The officiating priest collected the blood; when it was a bull for himself or for the congregation, he sprinkled some of the blood before the veil inside the tent of meeting and put some on the horns of the incense altar (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.4.5-7">5-7</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.4.16-18">16-18</a>). On the Day of Atonement he brought the sacrificial blood for himself and for the people into the Holy of Holies (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.14-15">16:14-15</a>). From all other animals, the blood was applied to the horns of the altar of burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.25,30,34">4:25, 30, 34</a>); the blood of fowl was sprinkled on the side of the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.9">5:9</a>). Finally, the remaining blood from any offering was poured or drained out at the base of the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.7">4:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The choicest of the internal organs, namely, the fatty tissue over and on the entrails, the two kidneys and their fat, and the appendage to the liver, were all offered to the Lord on the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.8-10">Lv 4:8-10</a>). The carcass and the other entrails were burned outside the camp when it was a bull for the priest or for the people. This was also true of the bull for the ordination of the priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.10-14">Ex 29:10-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.14-17">Lv 8:14-17</a>). Otherwise, the priest who conducted the rites received the edible flesh as his portion. He had to eat it within the temple area, and its preparation was governed by strict rules of ritual purity (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.25-30">Lv 6:25-30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.10.16-20">10:16-20</a>). A sin offering of one male goat was presented at each of the sacred holidays: the New Moon (<a href="?bref=Num.28.15">Nm 28:15</a>), each day of Passover (vv <a href="?bref=Num.28.22-24">22-24</a>), the Festival of Weeks (v <a href="?bref=Num.28.30">30</a>), the Festival of Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Num.29.5">29:5</a>), the Day of Atonement (v <a href="?bref=Num.29.11">11</a>), and each day of the Feast of Tabernacles (vv <a href="?bref=Num.29.16,19">16, 19</a>). The high priest also offered a bull for himself and then sacrificed one of the two goats on the Day of Atonement. Certain purification rites required lesser sin offerings, namely, lambs or birds: childbirth (<a href="?bref=Lev.12.6-8">Lv 12:6-8</a>), cleansing from leprosy (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.12-14,19-22">14:12-14, 19-22</a>), and abscesses and hemorrhages (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.14-15,29-30">15:14-15, 29-30</a>) or after defilement while under a vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.10-11">Nm 6:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Guilt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.14-6.7">Lv 5:14–6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.1-7">7:1-7</a>). The guilt or trespass offering was a special kind of sin offering (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.5.7">5:7</a>) required whenever someone had been denied his rightful due. Reparation of the valued amount that had been defrauded had to be made, plus a fine of one-fifth (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.16">5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.5">6:5</a>). The animal was usually a ram (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.15,18">5:15, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.6">6:6</a>). The cleansed leper and the defiled Nazirite had to bring a male lamb (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.12,21">Lv 14:12, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.12">Nm 6:12</a>). The offerer apparently handled the sacrifice as he would a sin offering, but the priest had to sprinkle the blood around the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.2">Lv 7:2</a>). Viscera were burned on the altar as usual (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.7.3-5">3-5</a>). Some of the blood was then applied to the tip of the cleansed leper’s right ear and to his right thumb and big toe (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.14">14:14</a>). Again the priest received most of the animal’s flesh for food (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.6-7">7:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.14.13">14:13</a>). A guilt offering was required whenever another party had suffered some loss. Ritual infractions, such as eating the “holy things” without proper authorization (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.14-19">5:14-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.14">22:14</a>), called for payment of the sum that should have gone to the Lord plus the fine of one-fifth that went to the priest (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.16">Lv 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.16">2 Kgs 12:16</a>). The leper belongs in this category, since during the time of his infection he was unable to render service to God (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.12-18">Lv 14:12-18</a>). The same applies to the Nazirite who had suffered defilement while he was set apart to God by the vow; thus a guilt offering was required (<a href="?bref=Num.6.12">Nm 6:12</a>). Violation of another person’s property rights could be expiated only by the guilt offering and its additional one-fifth. Such matters included cheating on deposits or security, robbery or oppression, failing to report the find of some lost property, or false swearing or failing to testify (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.1-5">Lv 6:1-5</a>). Intercourse with a betrothed slave girl was also a violation of property rights (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.20-22">19:20-22</a>). If the offended party was no longer living and had no surviving kinsmen, the payment went to the priest (<a href="?bref=Num.5.5-10">Nm 5:5-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Consecration Offerings</p>
<p class="fl">These rituals usually come to mind when one hears the word “offering.” They represent acts of personal commitment that must accompany the repentance expressed in the sin and guilt offerings. They were also a prerequisite for the fellowship or communal sacrifices that might follow.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.3-17">Lv 1:3-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.8-13">6:8-13</a>). The burnt offering could be a bull, a sheep, or a bird. The offerer presented the animal, laid his hand on it, and killed it on the north side of the altar. The bird was simply given to the priest. The latter collected the blood, presented it before God, and then sprinkled it around the altar. When the offering was a bird, he wrung off its head and drained the blood at the side of the altar. Though the slaughtering and sprinkling of the blood relates the burnt offering to the expiatory sacrifices of the previous section, the main emphasis here is on killing the animal, washing its unclean parts, and then carefully arranging all of the pieces on the altar. All of this was then consumed on the altar as a pleasing odor to the Lord. Since burnt offerings were offered morning and evening, a good supply of wood by the altar was necessary. The officiating priest, dressed in proper garments, had to keep the fire burning continuously (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.8-13">6:8-13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Burnt offerings played a prominent role in the sacrifices of the ritual calendar. The continual burnt offering was made twice a day, a male lamb morning and evening (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.38-42">Ex 29:38-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.1-8">Nm 28:1-8</a>). Two additional lambs were sacrificed each Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Num.28.9-10">Nm 28:9-10</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Except for these daily offerings, a sin offering of one goat was usually made along with the burnt offerings on the following holidays: For the New Moon at the beginning of each month, two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs were offered (<a href="?bref=Num.28.11-14">Nm 28:11-14</a>). The same were required for each day of the Passover festival (vv <a href="?bref=Num.28.19-24">19-24</a>) and again on the Feast of Weeks (vv <a href="?bref=Num.28.6-29">6-29</a>). On the Festival of Trumpets and the Day of Atonement, the requirement was one bull, one ram, and seven lambs (<a href="?bref=Num.29.2-4">29:2-4</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The great Feast of Tabernacles was characterized by a series of elaborate burnt offerings, plus one goat per day as a sin offering. On the first day, 13 young bulls, 2 rams, and 14 male lambs were offered (<a href="?bref=Num.29.12-16">Nm 29:12-16</a>). Each successive day, the number of bulls was decreased by one until on the seventh day there were only seven (the rams and lambs remained the same; <a href="?bref=Num.29.17-25">29:17-25</a>). On the eighth day the animals required for Trumpets and Atonement were offered, namely, one bull, one ram, and seven lambs.</p>
<p class="list-text">Certain rituals of purification also required burnt offerings in addition to sin offerings: after childbirth (<a href="?bref=Lev.12.6-8">Lv 12:6-8</a>), abscesses (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.14-15">15:14-15</a>), and discharges (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.15.29-30">29-30</a>); or after defilement while under a Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.10-11">Nm 6:10-11</a>). Though it is not stated that grain offerings were required in these cases, they certainly were for the cleansing from leprosy (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.10,19-22,31">Lv 14:10, 19-22, 31</a>) and the completion of the Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.14-16">Nm 6:14-16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Grain (Cereal) offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.1-16">Lv 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.14-23">6:14-23</a>). The Hebrew term referring to this particular offering means “gift,” or “offering,” including animals (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-5">Gn 4:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.6.18">Jgs 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.17">1 Sm 2:17</a>). But in the specific sacrificial context it signifies a combination of fine flour, olive oil, and frankincense that could be made up in the form of baked loaves, wafers, or morsels. The offering of firstfruits was to be crushed heads of new grain (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.14">Lv 2:14</a>). No leaven or honey was permitted on the cakes, although those same commodities could be accepted as a firstfruit offering. They would not go to the altar but were given to the priest. The offerer had to bring the prepared loaves or wafers to the temple. The priest would burn one handful on the altar as its “memorial portion” (v <a href="?bref=Lev.2.2">2</a>), keeping the remainder for his own food (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.16">6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.9">7:9</a>). But when the priest was making a grain offering on his own behalf, he burnt it all on the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.22-23">6:22-23</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">A grain offering was usually given with every burnt offering, especially those pertaining to the sacred calendar (<a href="?bref=Num.28.1-29.40">Nm 28–29</a>). The amounts of flour and oil were set according to the animal being sacrificed: three-tenths of an ephah of flour and one-half a hin of oil for a bull, two-tenths ephah and one-third hin for a ram, and one-tenth ephah plus one-fourth hin for a lamb (<a href="?bref=Num.15.2-10">15:2-10</a>). Other happy occasions for a grain offering included the cleansing of a leper (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.10,20-21,31">Lv 14:10, 20-21, 31</a>; unspecified quantity of grain with a bird) and the successful consummation of a Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.13-15">Nm 6:13-15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Peace offerings were invariably followed by grain offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.12-14">Lv 7:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.4">Nm 15:4</a>). The priest received one of each pair of cakes or wafers. The remainder was returned to the offerer to be eaten with the flesh of the sacrificial animal at a place of his choice.</p>
<p class="list-text">A special case where such offering was used was the one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal required in the jealousy ritual. It was to have no oil or frankincense (<a href="?bref=Num.5.15,18,25-26">Nm 5:15, 18, 25-26</a>). A very poor individual was permitted to bring one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour without oil or frankincense as a sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.11-13">Lv 5:11-13</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Drink offering (<a href="?bref=Num.15.1-10">Nm 15:1-10</a>). The standard libation was one-fourth of a hin of wine for a lamb, one-third for a ram, and one-half for a bull. The wine (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.40">Ex 29:40</a>), also called “strong drink” (<a href="?bref=Num.28.7">Nm 28:7</a>), is probably an intentional substitute for the blood used by other nations (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.4">Ps 16:4</a>). The libation was classed as a “pleasing odor” offering (<a href="?bref=Num.15.7">Nm 15:7</a>). As with the burnt offering, the entire drink offering was expended; nothing was given to the priest (<a href="?bref=Num.28.7">28:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Drink offerings accompanied the daily offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.40-41">Ex 29:40-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.7">Nm 28:7</a>) and the Sabbath offering (<a href="?bref=Num.28.9">Nm 28:9</a>), as well as the New Moon festival. Reference is also made to them in connection with the second and following days of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=Num.29.18,21">29:18, 21</a>); for the first day their absence is probably unintentional. The same might hold true for the Passover, Firstfruits, and Feast of Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Num.28.16-29.11">Nm 28:16–29:11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.11">Ez 45:11</a>). A libation was required for the rites concluding a Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.17">Nm 6:17</a>) but not for cleansing a leper (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.10-20">Lv 14:10-20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Fellowship Offerings</p>
<p class="fl">These sacrifices were voluntary on the part of the offerer and generally not imposed by regulations except for the Nazirite (<a href="?bref=Num.6.17">Nm 6:17</a>) and the Feast of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.19-20">Lv 23:19-20</a>). An offerer who had already fulfilled the ritual requirements for atonement and personal consecration was permitted to make a fellowship offering. Burnt offerings often accompanied the fellowship sacrifices as a further expression of devotion.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Peace offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.1-17">Lv 3</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.11-36">7:11-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.22">Am 5:22</a>). This is the basic class of all fellowship or communal offerings; the others are simply subclasses of the peace offering. In terms of holiness, or restrictedness, they were not so rigidly confined as the other offerings. Animals from the herd or flock, male or female (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.1,6,12">Lv 3:1, 6, 12</a>), were permitted. The usual stipulation of freedom from blemish was in force, except in the case of the freewill offering, in which the animal could have one limb longer than the other (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.23">22:23</a>). Unleavened cakes were also required, at least for the thank (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.12-13">7:12-13</a>) and Nazirite (<a href="?bref=Num.6.15-19">Nm 6:15-19</a>) offerings. Each of these three types of peace offerings will be discussed below, with their special features.</p>
<p class="list-text">The first parts of the ritual—the presentation and laying on of the hand—were identical to those of the other sacrifices. However, the animal was slaughtered at the door of the sanctuary courtyard and not on the north side of the altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.1-2,7-8,12-13">Lv 3:1-2, 7-8, 12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.29-30">7:29-30</a>). The priest collected the blood and tossed it against the altar as he did with the burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.2,8,13">3:2, 8, 13</a>). The choice viscera were offered up as a “pleasing odor” (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.3-5,6-11,14-16">3:3-5, 6-11, 14-16</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The priest also received a certain portion of the offering. He was allowed to eat it in any ritually clean place and to share it with his family (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.14,30-36">Lv 7:14, 30-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.20">Nm 6:20</a>), in contrast to his portion of other sacrifices, which he had to eat somewhere in the temple compound (<a href="?bref=Num.18.10-11">Nm 18:10-11</a>). He received one of the cakes and the breast as a wave offering and the right thigh as a contribution for the offerer. This latter is the so-called “heave offering”; the technical term developed from a root signifying “to be high” and meaning “that which is lifted up.” The heave offering did not really represent a special kind of ritual ceremony.</p>
<p class="list-text">The ritual act of the peace offering culminated with a fellowship meal. Except for those parts on the altar or given to the priest, the body of the animal was returned to the man who offered it. He had to prepare it as a communal meal for himself, for his family, and for the Levite in his community (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.12,18-19">Dt 12:12, 18-19</a>). This would have to be at the official sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.6-7,11-12,15-19">Dt 12:6-7, 11-12, 15-19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3-4">1 Sm 1:3-4</a>) and the participants had to observe strict rules of purity (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.19-21">Lv 7:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.5-8">19:5-8</a>). It may be contrasted with the ritual slaughtering of animals for a banquet that was permitted at any local altar (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.16,20-22">Dt 12:16, 20-22</a>). The flesh of the thank offering had to be eaten on the same day of the sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.15">Lv 7:15</a>), while that of the votive or freewill offerings could be finished off on the following day (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.7.16-18">16-18</a>). Whatever remained then had to be burned before the time limit expired.</p>
<p class="list-text">Only three times is there a specific demand for a peace offering: in the Feast of Weeks (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.19-20">Lv 23:19-20</a>), upon completion of a Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.17-20">Nm 6:17-20</a>), and at the installation of the priesthood (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.19-22,28">Ex 29:19-22, 28</a>). Other public ritual occasions included the inauguration of the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.63">1 Kgs 8:63</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.5">2 Chr 7:5</a>). Events on a national level that evoked the peace offering were the successful conclusion of a military campaign (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.15">1 Sm 11:15</a>), the end of a famine or pestilence (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.25">2 Sm 24:25</a>), confirmation of a candidate to the throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.9,19">1 Kgs 1:9, 19</a>), or a time of religious revival (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.31-36">2 Chr 29:31-36</a>). On the local level, they were offered at the annual family reunion (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.6">1 Sm 20:6</a>) or other festive occasions, such as the harvest of the firstfruits (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.29-31">Ex 22:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.11-14,22-24">1 Sm 9:11-14, 22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.4-5">16:4-5</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Wave offering. The first portion of the peace offering was “waved” before the Lord to signify that the priest was eating it as a representative of God (the actual motion evidently resembled the wielding of a saw or a staff, <a href="?bref=Isa.10.15">Is 10:15</a>). The same technical term, “wave offering,” was also used for other kinds of offering: precious metals donated for making the cultic artifacts (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.22">Ex 35:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.29">38:29</a>) and the guilt offering of the cleansed leper (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.12">Lv 14:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Freewill offering. These gifts, brought to the holy convocations that took place three times per year (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.16">Ex 23:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.20">34:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.10,16-17">Dt 16:10, 16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.8">2 Chr 35:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.5">Ezr 3:5</a>), were voluntary (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.16">Lv 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.18,21-23">22:18, 21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.28">23:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.3">Nm 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.29.39">29:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.6,17">Dt 12:6, 17</a>). Like the voluntary offering, the freewill offering could be a burnt rather than a peace offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.17-24">Lv 22:17-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.46.12">Ez 46:12</a>). If it was the latter, the flesh could be eaten on the second day but must be burned before the third (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.16-17">Lv 7:16-17</a>). Unlike some other peace offerings, the animal being sacrificed could have one limb longer than the other (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.23">22:23</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Installation offering. This Hebrew term refers to the settings of precious stones (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.7">Ex 25:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.9,27">35:9, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.2">1 Chr 29:2</a>), so “installation” seems an appropriate translation. It had to do with “filling the hand,” a ritual act that consecrated someone to divine service (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.41">Ex 28:41</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.32.29">32:29</a>) and required ritual purity and spiritual devotion (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.31">2 Chr 29:31</a>). The details of the original ceremony at the installation of the first priest is described in two passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.19-34">Ex 29:19-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.22-32">Lv 8:22-32</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">OG</p>
<p class="fl">King whose fame partly came from his being a giant. “King Og of Bashan was the last of the giant Rephaites. His iron bed was more than thirteen feet [4.1 meters] long and six feet [1.8 meters] wide” (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">Dt 3:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Og, king of Bashan, fell before Moses’ assault immediately after the defeat of King Sihon the Amorite (<a href="?bref=Num.21.33-35">Nm 21:33-35</a>). Bashan lay along the northern part of the Transjordan. Og’s land stretched northeastward from the lower course of the Jarmuk (Yarmuk) River, and lofty mountain ranges protected him on the east from scorching desert winds.</p>
<p>Og and his people had several settlements, primarily Ashtaroth and Edrei (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.12">Jos 13:12</a>). Og had fortified his land with 60 walled cities and was probably overconfident before Moses’ army. Moses completely destroyed the populace of those cities; he spared only the livestock and the spoils of war (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.5-6">Dt 3:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>Three tribes of Israel found the Transjordan particularly suitable for grazing their herds. So at the defeat of Sihon and Og, Moses assigned the newly won lands to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Num.32.33">Nm 32:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.4-6">Jos 12:4-6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">OHOLAH AND OHOLIBAH</p>
<p class="fl">Names given to the northern kingdom (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Aholah”), with its capital at Samaria, and to the southern kingdom (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Aholibah”), with its capital at Jerusalem, respectively, by Ezekiel in his allegory depicting the unfaithfulness of God’s people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.1-49">Ez 23</a>). The names characterized the basic attitude of each of the twin kingdoms toward God and his worship. Samaria (Oholah) had “her own tent” (the literal meaning of the name) and had invented her own centers of worship; Jerusalem (Oholibah, literally “my tent is in her”) prided herself in being the custodian of the temple.</p>
<p>Rather than being true to the Lord, Samaria had committed spiritual adultery. Not being content with her spiritual infidelity in wooing the gods of Egypt, she had lusted after the idols of Assyria and the worldly attractions that the Neo-Assyrian culture held out before her. Both courses of action are adequately documented by archaeological discoveries from the ancient Near East, such as Jehu’s act of homage as portrayed on the Black Obelisk of King Shalmaneser III of Assyria (859–824 <span class="era">BC</span>). Samaria’s conduct had been judged by God; her newfound desire had proved to be her destruction, God giving her over into the hands of the Assyrian conqueror.</p>
<p>Far from learning from Israel’s example, Judah had not only courted Assyria and its idolatry (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10-18">2 Kgs 16:10-18</a>) but also had added to her affections the Neo-Babylonian Empire (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.14-18">20:14-18</a>) and then had turned once again to Egypt (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.37.1-21">Jer 37</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-28">46</a>), her earlier lover (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.11-21">Ez 23:11-21</a>). Therefore, God would sorely punish her at the hands of the Babylonians, and she would know the just judgment of God.</p>
<p>Ezekiel closes his allegory with a rehearsal of God’s charges against the two kingdoms. God’s people were doubly guilty. Not being content with their apostasy, they had gone so far as to profane the sanctuary of God and his Sabbath by entering the temple with hands bloodied in the sacrifice of their own children in pagan rites.</p>

<p class="list-text">The absence of her name from the other lists of Esau’s wives (see <a href="?bref=Gen.26.34">Gn 26:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.9">28:9</a>) has occasioned a great deal of discussion. The considerable variation in these lists may indicate either a confusion in the scribal transmission or may point to the use of alternate names, gained either at marriage or as a result of some memorable event in the women’s lives.

  <title>Oil</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">OIL</p>
<p class="fl">Substance most commonly produced from the olive berry, although the word could also apply to oil of myrrh (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.12">Est 2:12</a>). Oil was used primarily in cooking, but additionally as a cosmetic for anointing the body, for medicinal purposes, as a source of light, for anointing kings and priests, and in religious offerings.</p>
<p>The growth of olive trees was widespread, and the Israelites took advantage of this major crop to establish a thriving trade in oil with Tyre and Egypt. Like precious metals and animals, oil became an established medium of exchange. Solomon used it as part of the payment to Hiram for construction expenses connected with the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.11">1 Kgs 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.17">Ez 27:17</a>).</p>
<p>Because oil was essential for everyday life, it was an effective and acceptable medium of barter. Oil was used in the preparation of most food (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.12-16">1 Kgs 17:12-16</a>). The common cake or patty of grain, which formed the basis of the noon meal, would be cooked on a griddle with a little oil.</p>
<p>As a cosmetic, oil was used for anointing the body after a bath (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.3">Ru 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.20">2 Sm 12:20</a>). It was frequently used on festive occasions, and at Egyptian banquets the heads of both the guests and the female entertainers were anointed. In the NT, the anointing of the sick is mentioned (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.14">Jas 5:14</a>). Olive oil could also be taken internally as a medicine for the relief of gastric disorders. It had a soothing effect and was also used as a mild laxative. It was applied externally as an ointment for bruises, burns, cuts, and abrasions (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.6">Is 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.13">Mk 6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.34">Lk 10:34</a>).</p>
<p>As soon as the sun set, the only source of light was the oil lamp. Often the small portable one could be placed easily on a shelf, but in large homes, palaces, synagogues, or temples, the lamp could rest on a tall metal base like a standard lamp. The wick of flax (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.3">Is 42:3</a>) or hemp was placed in the oil that gave out a flame until it was extinguished or the supply of fuel ran out. Torches were used in the streets both to light the way and for additional security. They added immeasurably to the festive atmosphere of evening processions. Torches were an essential part of the wedding procession, and normally those carrying the torches brought a quantity of oil in a container in case there was a delay and their supply was exhausted. This scene is vividly portrayed in Jesus’ parable of the wise and foolish virgins (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.1-13">Mt 25:1-13</a>).</p>
<p>In other ceremonial events, oil had a special meaning when used for the anointing of kings (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">1 Sm 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.39">1 Kgs 1:39</a>) and priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.7">Ex 29:7</a>). It was symbolic of the office and of the recognition of God’s blessing on the officeholder.</p>
<p>Quantities of oil were used in the temple. It was donated as part of the firstfruit offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.29">Ex 22:29</a>) and was also subject to tithing (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.17">Dt 12:17</a>). Oil was frequently used for the ceremonial aspect of temple life or as part of the offering. The grain offering was mixed with oil (<a href="?bref=Lev.8.26">Lv 8:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.19">Nm 7:19</a>), and the oil in the lamp that burned in the sanctuary constantly needed replenishing (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.2">Lv 24:2</a>). The daily sacrifice required the use of oil (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.40">Ex 29:40</a>), although the sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.11">Lv 5:11</a>) and the jealousy offering (<a href="?bref=Num.5.15">Nm 5:15</a>) specifically did not use oil.</p>
<p>A pestle and mortar, or a stone press, pressed oil from the olives (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.20">Ex 27:20</a>). Where the latter was used, the pulp initially produced by the press was often trodden out or subjected to further extensive pressing. Stone presses were set up to process the quantities of berries available at the Mt of Olives. The word for “oil press” was <span class="ital">gatt-semen,</span> hence the name Gethsemane.</p>
<p>Oil was symbolically associated with joy, festivity, ceremony, honor, light, and health (both spiritual and physical), while its absence spelled sorrow (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.10">Jl 1:10</a>) and the withdrawal of all that is good in life.</p>

<p class="h1">OINTMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Various preparations, generally of a spicy nature with an oil base. In Palestine, olive oil was the chief base of ointments and was itself considered an ointment. The OT does not distinguish between “oil” and “ointment.” In Egypt and Mesopotamia, numerous vegetable oils and animal fats formed the basis of ointments. Among the vegetable oils, some of the more important include castor oil, sesame oil, linseed oil, radish oil, colocynth oil, and oil from various nuts.</p>
<p>Ointments played an important and visible role in antiquity. In the hot and dry climate of the Near East, ointments gave a measure of protection. Widespread medicinal uses, soothing qualities, and effectiveness in masking odors made the use of ointments a virtual necessity among all classes. The OT mentions apothecaries or perfumers (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.13">1 Sm 8:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.14">2 Chr 16:14</a>), artisans who were organized into guilds (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.8">Neh 3:8</a>).</p>
<p>In general, ointments were made by boiling aromatic substances in oil (cf. <a href="?bref=Job.41.31">Jb 41:31</a>). Perfumed ointments were combinations of certain raw materials with specially prepared oil. In the OT, qualifying terms such as “fragrant” (<a href="?bref=Song.1.3">Sg 1:3</a>) or “precious” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.7.1">Eccl 7:1</a>) signify perfumed oils. Ointments could be stored in a variety of vessels, but flasks made of alabaster were preferred. An alabaster jar held the expensive ointment with which Mary anointed Jesus in Bethany (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.3">Mk 14:3</a>).</p>
<p>Ointments had a variety of uses. Among the Semites in particular, ointments acquired important associations. Aaron, his sons, the tabernacle, and its furnishings were all consecrated by holy anointing oil. This compound consisted of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia mixed with olive oil (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.23-25">Ex 30:23-25</a>). Kings and prophets were anointed, but not with the holy anointing oil mixture.</p>
<p>As a cosmetic, perfumed ointments controlled unpleasant odors. Applications were made to the body (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.20">2 Sm 12:20</a>), clothing (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.8">Ps 45:8</a>), or personal objects (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.17">Prv 7:17</a>). Women utilized ointments for cleansing the skin and enhancing the attractiveness of their skin (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.12">Est 2:12</a>). The fragrance of certain ointments attracted the attention of the opposite sex (<a href="?bref=Song.4.10">Sg 4:10</a>). Not surprisingly, the Song of Songs has several references to fragrant ointments.</p>
<p>The use of ointments to refresh and soothe guests was a mark of hospitality in the ancient Near East. Cones of ointment placed on the heads of guests and allowed to drip down over the body were used by the Egyptians (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.133.2">Ps 133:2</a>). As a sign of respect and honor, the head of a guest was anointed with oil. Jesus chided a Pharisee who neglected this traditional mark of hospitality (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.37-40">Lk 7:37-40</a>). Mary anointed Jesus with a costly flask of nard, a fragrant ointment obtained from the roots of an aromatic herb from India (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.3">Mk 14:3</a>).</p>
<p>Ointments were used in the burial process. In the NT a corpse would be washed (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.37">Acts 9:37</a>) and anointed with ointments (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mk 16:1</a>). The body was wrapped in linen garments with spices and ointments (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.56">Lk 23:56</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.40">Jn 19:40</a>). Both the Jews and the Romans utilized nard for burials. A mixture of myrrh and aloes was used in the burial of Jesus.</p>
<p>Medicinal uses of ointment were frequent. Oil was applied to wounds (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.34">Lk 10:34</a>). Balm (probably an aromatic gum) had well-known medicinal uses and is associated with Gilead (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>). Balm was an item of export from Palestine (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Gn 37:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.17">Ez 27:17</a>). Biblical reference is made to a famous eye ointment produced and exported by the city of Laodicea (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.18">Rv 3:18</a>). Ointments formed an important commodity for merchants in the Roman period (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.13">18:13</a>).</p>
<p>Anointing with oil came to be associated with gladness and joy (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.7">Ps 45:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.3">Is 61:3</a>). Thus, one was to refrain from anointing during times of mourning (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.2">2 Sm 14:2</a>). The lack of oil for anointing was viewed as judgment (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.15">Mi 6:15</a>). Shields were anointed with oil to make them supple and possibly to help deflect projectiles (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.21">2 Sm 1:21</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">OLIVES, Mount of</p>
<p class="fl">Prominent ridge running north-south in the Judean mountains, lying due east of Jerusalem and the Kidron Valley. Three summits with two intervening valleys distinguish the mountain. The northern summit is Mt Scopus. To its south is a small saddle through which the ancient Roman road to Jericho passed. The central hill is the traditional Mt of Olives (2,684 feet, or 818.1 meters) standing across from the temple platform (the <span class="ital">Haram esh-Sherif</span>). Here Constantine built the great Church of the Ascension dedicated to his mother, Helena. Another saddle to the south contains the modern road to Bethany. The southern hill, overlooking Jebusite Jerusalem and the city of David, is called the “Mt of Offense” since here Solomon built temples for his foreign wives. Beneath it is the Arab village of Silwan and the confluence of the Kidron and Hinnom valleys.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfTheMountOfOlives"/>
<p>The Mt of Olives gained its name from its extensive olive groves, which were renowned in antiquity (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.4">Zec 14:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.1">Mk 11:1</a>). Its western face collects rainfall from the Mediterranean, which, together with decomposed limestone, makes for fertile orchards. The eastern side marks the boundary of the arid Judean wilderness. Bethany and Bethphage are two NT villages hugging these eastern slopes.</p>
<p>In the OT the Mt of Olives is first mentioned when David fled from Absalom’s conspiracy. He departed from Jerusalem, went up the Mt of Olives in the east, and continued on toward the Rift Valley (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.30">2 Sm 15:30</a>). Solomon chose this mountain for the construction of “high places” for the foreign deities of Sidon, Moab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.7">1 Kgs 11:7</a>), and Ammon—each of which was later destroyed by Josiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.13">2 Kgs 23:13</a>). Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.23">Ez 11:23</a>) records the vision of the glory of God departing from the temple and resting on the Mt of Olives. The most famous description appears in Zechariah’s apocalyptic vision (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.1-5">Zec 14:1-5</a>): “On that day [the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s] feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east. And the Mount of Olives will split apart, making a wide valley running from east to west, for half the mountain will move toward the north and half toward the south” (v <a href="?bref=Zech.14.4">4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>In the NT Jesus appears at the Mt of Olives during Passion week. The only exceptions are the Bethany stories when Jesus visits Mary and Martha (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">Lk 10:38-42</a>) and raises Lazarus from the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.17-44">Jn 11:17-44</a>). On his triumphant entry to Jerusalem, Jesus came from Jericho, crossed the mountain from the east, and then descended into the Kidron Valley (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.1-10">Mk 11:1-10</a>). On his descent he paused and wept over the city (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.41-44">Lk 19:41-44</a>).</p>
<p>During his final week, Jesus taught on the Mt of Olives (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>) and spent his evenings there (<a href="?bref=Luke.21.37">Lk 21:37</a>, although this may refer to Bethany). Following the Last Supper, Jesus came to this mountain for prayer (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.26">Mk 14:26</a>). In a garden near an olive oil press (“Gethsemane”), he was arrested (v <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32">32</a>). The final event of Christ on earth, his ascension, was viewed from the mount by his followers (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.12">Acts 1:12</a>).</p>

  <title>Omri</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">OMRI</p>
<p class="list">1. King of Israel who first appears in Scripture as general of the army during the reign of Elah, king of Israel. In 885 <span class="era">BC</span> Elah sent Omri to besiege the Philistine fortress of Gibbethon. During the siege, Zimri, another military leader, launched a coup against Elah, killed him, and immediately wiped out all of Elah’s male relatives. When Omri heard of the assassination, he had the army declare him king and marched to the capital at Tirzah to deal with Zimri. When Zimri saw that the siege of Tirzah was going to be successful, he set fire to the king’s palace and died in the flames after only seven days on the throne.</p>
<p class="list-text">But Omri’s rule over Israel was not yet established. Tibni seized control of part of the state and held it for about four years. Finally, Omri was able to crush Tibni and extend his power over all Israel. He established Israel’s fourth ruling dynasty, which was destined to continue through three more generations after his own. His reign lasted a total of 12 years (885–874 <span class="era">BC</span>), including the years of sovereignty disputed with Tibni.</p>
<p class="h2-list">International Developments</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">To the northeast of Israel, the Arameans of Syria were building a strong state with its capital at Damascus. A few years before Omri took the throne, Asa of Judah had sought the help of Syria against Baasha of Israel. Soon Syria would become a threat to both Hebrew kingdoms.</p>
<p class="list-text">Farther east, Assyria was growing in strength under the leadership of Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 <span class="era">BC</span>), the founder of the empire. He marched into Phoenicia, but Israel was spared Assyrian attack until the days of Omri’s son Ahab.</p>
<p class="h2-list">Omri’s Reign</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">Since the purpose of Scripture is not to provide a political, military, or even social history of Israel or the countries surrounding it, administrations of the kings of Israel and Judah are often very briefly treated. For a fuller picture, it is necessary to turn to nonbiblical sources. From Assyrian records, it is evident that Omri must have been an impressive ruler. Generations later, Assyrians still spoke of Israel as the “land of Omri.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Perceptive leader that he was, Omri recognized that the nations needed a capital that was centrally located and militarily defensible. He settled on the site of Samaria, the third and most significant capital of the realm (Shechem and Tirzah had previously served as capitals). Located seven miles (11.3 kilometers) northwest of Shechem on the main road leading to Galilee and Phoenicia, it perched on a free-standing hill that rose some 300 to 400 feet (91.4–121.9 meters) above the surrounding plain. Thus it could be quite easily defended; it had a prosperous hinterland to supply it with food and taxes; and it was conveniently located on a main road. Omri bought the hill from Shemer and named the city after its owner. Then he leveled the top of the hill and built the palace compound. He also built a 33-foot- (10.1-meter-) thick wall around the summit of the hill.</p>
<p class="list-text">Omri’s expansionist activities are not mentioned in 1 Kings, but Scripture is supplemented by discovery of the Moabite Stone in 1868 at Dibon, east of the Jordan River. On this stela, Mesha, king of Moab, tells that Omri conquered Moab. Israel had continued to subjugate the land in the days of Ahab, but during his days, Mesha successfully rebelled against Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4">2 Kgs 3:4</a>). That Omri could mount a successful war against Moab soon after becoming king shows that he was a capable ruler, because previously the kingdom of Israel had been greatly weakened by insurrection and political instability.</p>
<p class="list-text">Omri also reestablished the friendly relations with Phoenicia that had been initiated in the days of David and Solomon. Presumably, he made a full alliance with King Ethbaal of Tyre and then sealed it with the marriage of his son Ahab to the Phoenician princess Jezebel. Such an alliance would have been mutually beneficial, for it would have brought cedar, beautifully crafted goods, and Phoenician architectural and technical expertise to Israel, and it would have provided Israelite grain and olive oil to Phoenicia. Moreover, it would have linked their forces against the threat of the rising power of Assyria.</p>
<p class="list-text">This pact was destined to corrupt Israel, however, for it brought Baal worship into the land. Probably this is what the writer of Kings had in mind when he said that Omri “did worse” than the other kings of Israel before him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.25">1 Kgs 16:25</a>) because he practiced the idolatrous ways of Jeroboam. Baal worship was regarded as more degrading than the calf worship Jeroboam had introduced. Omri, and his son Ahab after him, subscribed to both.</p>
<p class="list-text">Omri was one of the most powerful kings of Israel, building its new capital, winning for the state a reputation for prowess, and setting a course for future kings to follow. But unfortunately that course was morally corrupt; the introduction of Baal worship was one of the terrible results of Omri’s alliance with Tyre.</p>

  <title>Onias</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ONIAS</p>
<p class="fl">Onias is the family name of four high priests in the intertestamental period. They were descendants of Zadok, the high priest in Solomon’s reign. Their lives spanned a period from the end of the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> down to the second. In their times the high priesthood was not only a religious office but included great political power.</p>
<p>Little is known of Onias I, except that he was son and successor to Jaddua, who was high priest at the time of Alexander the Great (336–323 <span class="era">BC</span>). Onias II was his grandson. He eventually succeeded his father, Simon I, after two relatives had held office until he was old enough to take over. According to Josephus, Onias II was an old man by the reign of Ptolemy III of Egypt (246–221 <span class="era">BC</span>). It was probably to Onias II that King Arius of Sparta sent the famous letter preserved in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.20-23">1 Maccabees 12:20-23</a>, claiming that the Jews and Spartans were both descended from Abraham. Josephus claims that Onias III was the recipient, but there is no knowledge of a Spartan king Arius in his period. During this time, Judea was under the control of Egypt. Onias II attempted to secede by refusing to pay taxes. During the period of office of his successor, Simon II, Palestine changed hands and became subject to the Seleucid kings of Syria.</p>
<p>The powerful family of the Tobiads became political rivals to the Oniads, especially to Simon’s son and heir, Onias III, who succeeded him about 180 <span class="era">BC</span>. Their rivalry included religious tensions, since Onias stood for orthodox Judaism, while the Tobiads represented liberal concessions to Hellenism. In the power struggle Onias III was denounced as being pro-Egyptian, after a Syrian attempt to plunder the temple failed (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.3.4-40">2 Macc 3:4-40</a>). In 175 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the Seleucid king Antiochus IV came to the throne, he was removed from office and exiled to Antioch. His brother Jason was appointed high priest in his place. Eventually Jason, in turn, was succeeded by Menelaus, who had bribed the Syrians to displace Jason. Fearing opposition from the exiled Onias, Menelaus arranged to have him assassinated (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.33-38">4:33-38</a>). Eventually, the Syrians deposed Menelaus.</p>
<p>The legitimate successor, Onias IV, son of Onias III, was prevented from taking over and fled to Egypt. In Egypt he built a temple at Leontopolis, probably as a sanctuary for the local Jewish military colony rather than as a religious center for Egyptian Jews generally, who continued to support the Jerusalem temple. According to the Jewish Mishnah, the religious authorities in Jerusalem apparently regarded its sacrifices as legitimate but refused to allow its (authentically Zadokite) priesthood to officiate in the temple at Jerusalem. It remained in use until the Roman emperor Vespasian had it closed down in <span class="era">AD</span> 73.</p>

  <title>Only Begotten*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ONLY BEGOTTEN*</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase deeply entrenched in Christian language as descriptive of Jesus. The word traditionally translated “only begotten” does not carry the idea of birth at all. Literally, it means “only one of its kind,” “unique.” This can be readily seen in the way it is used in the NT and in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT).</p>
<p>The Greek word for this phrase appears nine times in the NT, but only five of these occurrences, all from the Johannine writings, make reference to Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.1.14,18">Jn 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.16,18">3:16, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.9">1 Jn 4:9</a>). Three of the other occurrences are of an only son or daughter (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.12">Lk 7:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.42">8:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.38">9:38</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.11.34">Jgs 11:34</a> in the LXX). Because of its frequent use for an only child, the word often conveys the idea of something especially favored or precious. The remaining non-Johannine reference, in <a href="?bref=Heb.11.17">Hebrews 11:17</a>, is to Isaac as Abraham’s “favored” or “unique” son. Isaac was not Abraham’s “only begotten,” since he had other children, but Isaac was his favored and unique son fulfilling God’s promise. In the Septuagint for <a href="?bref=Ps.22.20">Psalm 22:20</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.35.17">35:17</a>, the psalmist, in his plea for deliverance, even uses this word of his own soul as that which is of great value. The Hebrew word that stands behind each of these OT texts also means “only” and does not carry any idea of birth.</p>
<p>Where the word is used of Jesus, its meaning is likewise not “only begotten” but “only” or “unique.” The word is used with “son” and should be understood as God’s <span class="ital">only</span> Son, indicating both God’s favor toward him and his uniqueness (<a href="?bref=John.3.16,18">Jn 3:16, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.9">1 Jn 4:9</a>). The statement at the baptism and transfiguration of Jesus in the Synoptics (“This is my beloved son”) expresses virtually the same idea. In fact, the word “beloved” is used in the Septuagint as an equivalent to the word “only” to translate the same Hebrew word. In <a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a> the word “only” is used by itself to stress that the incarnate Word comes as a unique one from the Father. The final reference (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">Jn 1:18</a>) is especially interesting because of the fact that some texts read “the only son” while others read “the only God.” Because scribes could easily have written “only son” due to their familiarity with the other texts in John and because of the superiority of the texts that read “only God,” this latter reading is preferred. The attitude expressed toward the incarnate Word is the highest possible. No one has ever seen God, but the unique (or only) God who is in the bosom of the Father has revealed him.</p>

<p class="h1">OPHIR (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Place to which Solomon sent a fleet of merchant ships to bring back gold and all sorts of precious and exotic products. The location of Ophir is not certain; most scholars place it in southwest Arabia. There may be a relationship between the place and the man named Ophir who appears in the table of nations as a son of Joktan (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.29">Gn 10:29</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.23">1 Chr 1:23</a>), a descendant of Shem. The names of Joktan and his sons are connected with the southern and western parts of Arabia.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">First Kings 9:26-28</a> reports that Solomon built a fleet of merchant ships at Ezion-geber, which was near Elath on the Gulf of Aqaba. Hiram, king of Tyre, provided seamen to accompany those of Solomon. This expedition returned with 420 talents of gold for Solomon. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.11">First Kings 10:11</a> adds that the fleet of Hiram brought from Ophir a great amount of almug wood and precious stones.</p>
<p>Later, Jehoshaphat built “ships of Tarshish” to go to Ophir for gold, but the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab of Israel, offered to send his men with the seamen of Judah, but Jehoshaphat refused (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48-49">1 Kgs 22:48-49</a>).</p>
<p>The premier product of Ophir was fine gold. Eliphaz the Temanite comments that the Almighty should be one’s gold rather than the gold of Ophir (<a href="?bref=Job.22.24">Jb 22:24</a>). Job himself declares that wisdom is far more valuable than all the gold of Ophir (<a href="?bref=Job.28.16">28:16</a>). In his description of the glories of the king, the psalmist describes his queen at his right hand as wearing jewelry of finest gold from Ophir (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.9">Ps 45:9</a>).</p>
<p>Some suggest that the ships of Tarshish mentioned (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.22">1 Kgs 10:22</a>) were those ships that went to Ophir and returned every three years with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Traders brought the products, some from as far away as India, to the ports of Ophir, where Solomon’s representatives bought them.</p>

  <title>Oracle</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ORACLE</p>
<p class="fl">Divine revelation communicated through God’s spokesperson (prophet, priest, or king), usually pronouncing blessing, instruction, or judgment. Contrary to Balak’s request for Balaam to curse Israel, Balaam spoke an oracle of blessing (<a href="?bref=Num.24.3-16">Nm 24:3-16</a>). God instructed Moses through “living oracles” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.38">Acts 7:38</a>), and entrusted them with the Jewish people (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.2">Rom 3:2</a>). The book of Proverbs records two oracles of wisdom: one given by Agur, Jakeh’s son (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.1">Prv 30:1</a>), and the other by King Lemuel (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.1">31:1</a>). Oracles of judgment were uttered against kings Joram of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.25">2 Kgs 9:25</a>) and Joash of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.27">2 Chr 24:27</a>).

Nahum delivered one against Nineveh (<a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">Na 1:1</a>); Habakkuk, one against Judah (<a href="?bref=Hab.1.1">Hb 1:1</a>); and Malachi, one against Israel (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.1">Mal 1:1</a>).

  <body>
<p class="h1">ORDAIN, ORDINATION</p>
<p class="fl">The act of officially investing someone with religious authority. Several synonyms are “appoint,” “institute,” “make,” and “establish.” In current usage, the words “ordain” and “ordination” are applied to persons, signifying selection and appointment to God’s service.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Throughout the OT, emphasis falls upon God’s choosing and appointing whom he wills. Priestly functions passed very early from the head of each household to the divinely chosen tribe of Levi (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.8-11">Dt 33:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.17.13">Jgs 17:13</a>). Through all subsequent clan rivalries—“Zadokite,” “Aaronic,” “Hasmonean”—this claim to inherited privilege persisted. Divine appointment through Levi was traced back to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.14">Ex 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.28.41">28:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.29.9">29:9</a>), claimed for the Ephraimite Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.28">1 Chr 6:28</a>), and still celebrated by Sirach (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.45.6-22">Ecclus 45:6-22</a>, c. 180 <span class="era">BC</span>). As the book of Hebrews states (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.1,4">Heb 5:1, 4</a>), no one takes the honor upon himself; he is “called by God, as Aaron was,” by birth into an inherited status.</p>
<p>The first Levites were presented at the tabernacle in the presence of the people, and acknowledged by “the laying on of hands” (<a href="?bref=Num.8.10,14-18">Nm 8:10, 14-18</a>). Similarly, Moses received instructions for the week-long consecration of Aaron and his sons, with elaborate sacrifices, vestments, anointing, and ritual (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.1-46">Ex 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.1-36">Lv 8</a>). In both cases, the careful preservation of these detailed instructions suggests that the ceremonies were retained, to some degree, in later years, though no repetition is recorded.</p>
<p>Alongside the priests there existed establishments of recognized prophets, or prophetic communities, sometimes with royal patronage (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.9-10">1 Kgs 1:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.17-19">18:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.35">20:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.5-28">22:5-28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.3-7">2 Kgs 2:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.2">23:2</a>). The line of prophecy was also traced back to earliest days (see <a href="?bref=Gen.20.7">Gn 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.34.10">Dt 34:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.4">Jgs 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.25">Jer 7:25</a>). The phrase “sons of the prophets,” and an obscure hint in <a href="?bref=Jer.35.4">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, may imply that prophecy, like priesthood, was sometimes hereditary, but the manner of appointment and installation is unknown. The outstanding prophets were frequently opposed to the prophetic “schools” (Elijah, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-24">1 Kgs 17</a>; Micaiah, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.5-28">1 Kgs 22:5-28</a>; Jeremiah, <a href="?bref=Jer.27.14-16">Jer 27:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-17">28</a>). Such men were appointed by direct, divine call (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.17">21:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Is 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.1.1-19">Jer 1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.15">Am 7:15</a>), though by God’s instruction Elisha was called and anointed by Elijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16">1 Kgs 19:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Is 61:1</a>). Authentication of the prophet’s message lay not in appropriate installation ceremonies but in its self-evident truth; in the case of predictions, in their fulfillment (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.13-14,26-28">1 Kgs 22:13-14, 26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.5-9">Jer 28:5-9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Christian ordination is also a matter of divine choice. Neither Jesus, nor any disciple, came from the professional religious classes. In ordaining the 12 apostles, Jesus called to him those whom he desired, later insisting, “You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you” (<a href="?bref=John.15.16">Jn 15:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The selection of Matthias rested upon prayer and the divine lot (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.24-26">Acts 1:24-26</a>). Paul contended that he had been set apart by God before he was born and did not receive his apostleship from or through men (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.1,15">Gal 1:1, 15</a>). Paul and Barnabas were commissioned by direction of the Spirit during worship, probably through a Christian prophet. Similarly, Timothy was first chosen as assistant to Paul by prophetic utterances that pointed to him (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.18">1 Tm 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">4:14</a>).</p>
<p>At Corinth, various ministries of speaking, teaching, healing, and administration were directly conferred as gifts of the Spirit, who apportions as he sees fit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.8-11,28">1 Cor 12:8-11, 28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>). Elders of the church at Ephesus were made guardians of the flock by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</a>). The divine prerogative is everywhere clear: any attempt to obtain the privilege of ministry by personal initiative and unworthy means meets with sharpest condemnation (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.18-24">8:18-24</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the assembled church “nominated” Barsabbas and Matthias before submitting the final choice to God (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.15,23">Acts 1:15, 23</a>). The believers chose the seven servers, then presented them to the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.2-6">6:2-6</a>). An assembled church, at the Spirit’s command, commissioned and sent off Paul and Barnabas (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.3">13:3</a>). Paul and Barnabas themselves appointed elders (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">14:23</a>), as Titus is instructed to do (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>), and probably Timothy also (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.22">1 Tm 5:22</a>). Elders at Lystra and Iconium, with Paul, obeying a Christian prophet, appointed Timothy to leadership (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">1 Tm 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6">2 Tm 1:6</a>). By the time letters were written to Timothy and Titus, elaborate lists of qualifications were required for church leaders (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.1-13">1 Tm 3:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.2">2 Tm 2:2</a>).</p>
<p>The congregation of believers also participated in selecting leaders. This could have involved prayer, fasting, and casting lots (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.26">Acts 1:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.6">6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.2-3">13:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">14:23</a>); sometimes “selection by hands” (Greek, <span class="greek">cheirotonein</span><span class="ital">,</span> originally meaning “election by raising hands,” later “selection by pointing to”; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.19">2 Cor 8:19</a>); and sometimes selection by group choice (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.15,23">Acts 1:15, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.2-5">6:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.3">13:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.2">16:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">1 Tm 4:14</a>).</p>

The occasion for this execution was Gideon’s surprise attack on the Midianite encampment at the hill of Moreh in the valley of Jezreel. The Midianites’ line of retreat eastward required them to recross the Jordan River. Gideon sent word to the Ephraimites to seize the fording places on the river to prevent the Midianites from escaping. The Ephraimites, following the orders, intercepted a contingent of fleeing Midianites, including the prominent leaders Oreb and Zeeb. They beheaded these two leaders and sent their heads as a war prize to Gideon, who was then pursuing the Midianites on the east side of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.3">8:3</a>).</p>
<p>During Israel’s later history, the deaths of Oreb and Zeeb were recognized as a great triumph of God over the enemies of his people. The psalmist implores God to overthrow the nobles among Israel’s current enemies just as he did the Midianite chieftains (<a href="?bref=Ps.83.11">Ps 83:11</a>). The Lord, speaking through his prophet Isaiah, pledged that the Assyrians would be overthrown like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.4">Is 9:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.26">10:26</a>), implying that the earlier victory amounted to more than the capture of two leaders; it was an important and strategic defeat of the Midianite invasion force.</p>

God challenged Job to attempt what only God could do—loose Orion’s fetters (<a href="?bref=Job.38.31-32">Jb 38:31-32</a>). The real significance of the question lies in the fact that the appearance of the Pleiades ushers in the spring and Orion ushers in the winter, both under the direction of God.</p>

<p>The countries that form the Fertile Crescent include Syria, which powerfully affected Israel’s history, principally through the cities that stood on the Orontes; for example, the city of “Hamath the great” (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.2">Am 6:2</a>) on the Orontes against which Solomon fought (<a href="?bref=2Chr.8.3-4">2 Chr 8:3-4</a>) and which Jeroboam II much later recovered for Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.28">2 Kgs 14:28</a>).

<p class="h1">ORPHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Word coming from a Hebrew root meaning “to be alone” or “bereaved,” often rendered as “fatherless.” The idea describes any person who is without legal standing in the covenant community of Israel, who is unprotected or needy, and who is especially exposed to oppression. It also speaks of one who is bereft of one or both earthly parents (cf. <a href="?bref=Lam.5.3">Lam 5:3</a>).</p>
<p>Since God has a special concern for the fatherless (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.22-24">Ex 22:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.18">Dt 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.10.14,18">Pss 10:14, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.27.10">27:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.5">68:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.146.9">146:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.17">Is 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.3">Hos 14:3</a>), OT legislation made special provision for them by protecting their rights of inheritance (<a href="?bref=Num.27.7-11">Nm 27:7-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.17">Dt 24:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.10">Prv 23:10</a>), ensuring their freedom to glean the fields and vineyards (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.19-21">Dt 24:19-21</a>), allowing their participation in the great annual feasts (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.11,14">16:11, 14</a>), and allotting them a portion of the tithe crops collected every three years (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.29">14:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.26.12">26:12</a>). Strong condemnation awaits those who oppress them (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.17">Dt 24:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.19">27:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">Mal 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>While the orphans of Israel were sometimes aided by friends and relatives (<a href="?bref=Job.29.12">Jb 29:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.31.17">31:17</a>), there was general failure to meet the requirements of the law, as is witnessed by the accusations of the inspired writers (<a href="?bref=Job.6.27">Jb 6:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.22.9">22:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.24.3,9">24:3, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.6">Ps 94:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.23">Is 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.2">10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.5.28">Jer 5:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.7">Ez 22:7</a>). Consequently, the prophets never tire of pleading the orphan’s cause (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.6">Jer 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.3">22:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.10">Zec 7:10</a>).</p>
<p>The word is used only twice in the NT—once in a general sense to describe those who are “desolate” or “comfortless” (<a href="?bref=John.14.18">Jn 14:18</a>), and once in the specific sense to describe the “fatherless” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.27">Jas 1:27</a>).

Some religious ideas were involved in calling a coffin a “body eater” (Greek, <span class="greek">sarx</span><span class="ital">,</span> “flesh,” and <span class="greek">phagein</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to eat”). In many cases, the burial was not completed until the bones were taken up from the earth or from the sarcophagus. The bones were cleaned and put into their final deposit, that is, into an ossuary, usually a small coffin of stone. The tendency to postpone the final burial, where it involves exhumation or the collection of bones, is accentuated by making a common ossuary for a number of the departed. This exhuming and collecting the bones is connected with the idea of final reunion with one’s fathers.</p>

<p class="fl">Part of a person outwardly observed. Used in contrast to “inner man,” the term is not to be confused with other terms, both biblical and extrabiblical, such as “old man and new man,” “natural man and spiritual man,” “body and soul.” Near Eastern, and particularly Semitic, thinking dealt in wholes instead of dichotomies, so the inner and outward man were viewed as parts of a whole rather than as irreconcilable opposites.</p>
<p>Although the phrase appears only in <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>, similar terms, such as “outward appearance,” are found elsewhere in Scripture (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.7">1 Sm 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.27-28">Mt 23:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.7">2 Cor 10:7</a>).

<p class="h1">OVERSEER</p>
<p class="fl">Word appearing 12 times in the OT (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) and once in the NT. The <span class="sc">niv</span> uses it at least six times in the NT to translate the word <span class="greek">episkopos</span><span class="ital">,</span> which is derived from “peer” or “watch over.” In the OT “overseer” is used to translate three words, which literally mean (1) one with authority who visits, (2) the preeminent one, or (3) the head writer.</p>
<p>Joseph was given authority to watch over and administer all aspects of Potiphar’s house (<a href="?bref=Gen.39.4-5">Gn 39:4-5</a>), advising Pharaoh to appoint 50 men to regulate and watch over the abundant harvest for seven years (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.34">41:34</a>). Solomon appointed 3,600 overseers (“supervisors,” <span class="sc">nasb</span>) to make the people work (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.18">2 Chr 2:18</a>). In Josiah’s time of temple renovation, there were overseers over all the workmen in every job (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.13,17">34:13, 17</a>). Nehemiah appointed men to oversee the rebuilding of the wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.9,14">Neh 11:9, 14</a>), to oversee the Levites (v <a href="?bref=Neh.11.22">22</a>), and to be in charge of the Levitical singers (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.42">12:42</a>).</p>
<p>The word “overseer” speaks of the highest person of authority who exercised oversight over others. Included in this authoritative oversight was the idea of watching, directing, and protecting the master’s interests. The NT carries these ideas also in regard to men appointed to serve the church on behalf of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Phil 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.1-2">1 Tm 3:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.7">Ti 1:7</a>).
