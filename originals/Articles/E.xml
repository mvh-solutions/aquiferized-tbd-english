  <title>Earth</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EARTH</p>
<p class="fl">Term used for our inhabited planet; the world, as distinguished from heaven and hell; land; soil; and in several other ways. Biblical usage is as broad as modern usage.</p>
<p>One Hebrew word translated “earth” is also used generically for “man,” or Adam (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7,19">Gn 2:7, 19</a>). That word refers to reddish soil from which Adam’s body was made. Another Hebrew word translated “earth” or “land” can refer to a country (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.21">21:21</a>). A word translated “dust” can mean simply earth or dry ground (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.19">3:19</a>). In the NT one Greek word translated “earth” can refer to a land or country (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.45">Mt 27:45</a>). The Greek word from which “ecumenical” is derived refers to the whole inhabited earth (<a href="?bref=Luke.21.26">Lk 21:26</a>) or the Roman Empire of those days (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1">2:1</a>).</p>
<p>In the beginning “God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. . . . And God said, ‘Let the earth put forth vegetation’” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.10-11">Gn 1:10-11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In some passages “the earth” is used in essentially the modern sense for the whole planet (<a href="?bref=Job.1.7">Jb 1:7</a>), hanging in empty space (<a href="?bref=Job.26.7">26:7</a>). References to the earth’s four corners (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.12">Is 11:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.2">Ez 7:2</a>) allude to the points of a compass, not to the earth’s shape. The circle of the earth probably refers to the circumference of the horizon (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.22">Is 40:22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Job.38.13">Jb 38:13</a>). The earth is sometimes pictured as supported on pillars (<a href="?bref=Job.9.6">Jb 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.75.3">Ps 75:3</a>) or foundations (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.5">Ps 104:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.8.29">Prv 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.18">Is 24:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.37">Jer 31:37</a>). Since many of the biblical usages are found in figurative passages of poetry or prophecy, they reveal little about the Hebrews’ cosmological understanding.</p>
<p>“Earth” sometimes refers to the soil or ground that a farmer works (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.17">2 Kgs 5:17</a>). According to the Bible, the original condition of the earth (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.6">Gn 2:6</a>) was affected by the curse of human sinfulness (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.17-19">3:17-19</a>). (Modern ecologists seem to agree that the earth suffers because of human greed and arrogance.) After Abel’s blood was spilled on the ground, Cain’s difficulty in making the soil produce for him was a constant reminder that he had murdered his brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.8-12">4:8-12</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelites were instructed to let the land rest every seventh year (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.10-12">Ex 23:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.4-5">Lv 25:4-5</a>), allowing the soil to replenish nutrients used up by crops. After seven such “sabbath years,” in the 50th “jubilee year” the land reverted back to original family holdings (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.10-17">Lv 25:10-17</a>). That provision not only reminded the people of God’s ultimate ownership but kept potential “land barons” from amassing huge estates.</p>
<p>The Mosaic law instructed the Israelites that the land’s condition would be a spiritual barometer of their relationship with God. Drought or lack of productivity was a sign that the relationship had been broken (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">Lv 26</a>; Dt 28). Israel was warned that their wickedness could become so great that the Lord would evict them from his land (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.26.37">Lv 26:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.64">Dt 28:64</a>). Even if that happened, however, God would eventually restore his people so they could again be “wedded” to the land (<a href="?bref=Isa.62.4">Is 62:4</a>).</p>
<p>Many passages point to a “coming age,” when the earth will be set free from its “bondage to decay,” a deliverance for which the whole creation is said to be “groaning” in anticipation (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-23">Rom 8:19-23</a>). The Bible pictures a period of prodigious renewal of the earth’s fertility (Ez 47; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.18">Jl 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.13-15">Am 9:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.6-9">Zec 14:6-9</a>). One day, however, “the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10">2 Pt 3:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Yet in the apostle John’s apocalyptic vision, he saw “a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rv 21:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

  <title>Earthquake</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EARTHQUAKE</p>
<p class="fl">Shaking or trembling of the earth originated by volcanic or tectonic activity. Earthquakes occur frequently in Palestine due mostly to the volcanic nature of the regions around the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. The primary centers of earthquakes in Palestine are upper Galilee, the Samaritan country near Shechem, and the western edge of the Judean Mountains near Lydda.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for “earthquake” indicates a great noise or a tremendous roaring, suggesting that the Israelites were impressed with the rumbling connected with earthquakes.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="ReportsOfAncientEarthquakes"/>
<p>Instances of earthquakes are (1) at Mt Sinai, in connection with God’s giving the law to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.18">Ex 19:18</a>); (2) during the wilderness wandering of the Israelites, when Korah and his followers rebelled against Moses and were destroyed as punishment for their rebellion (<a href="?bref=Num.16.31-33">Nm 16:31-33</a>); (3) among the Philistines on the occasion when Jonathan and his armor bearer fought a garrison of Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.15">1 Sm 14:15</a>); (4) after Elijah killed the prophets of Baal and, fleeing Jezebel’s wrath, sat under a juniper tree feeling sorry for himself (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.7-9,11">1 Kgs 19:7-9, 11</a>); (5) in the reign of King Uzziah (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">Am 1:1</a>); (6) at the death of Jesus on Calvary (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.51-54">Mt 27:51-54</a>); (7) at the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.2">Mt 28:2</a>); and (8) at Philippi while Paul and Silas were in jail (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.26">Acts 16:26</a>). Earthquakes are also mentioned as one of the phenomena in connection with the “Day of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.4-5">Zec 14:4-5</a>) and the consummation of this age (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.12-24">Rv 6:12-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.19">11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.18">16:18</a>).</p>

The Lord used an east wind to drive back the waters of the Red Sea for the Israelites to cross (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.21">Ex 14:21</a>). The east wind also depicts God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.8">Is 27:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.11">Jer 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.17">18:17</a>).

  <title>Ebal, Mount</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EBAL, Mount</p>
<p class="fl">Mountain just over 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) high in the central hill country of Israel. Mt Gerizim is usually mentioned with it (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.29">Dt 11:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.13">27:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.33">Jos 8:33</a>). There is no certain known meaning to the word. It is quite unlikely that it was connected in any way with a son of Shobal, whose name is spelled the same as the mountain (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.23">Gn 36:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.40">1 Chr 1:40</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.22">1 Chr 1:22</a>, where Ebal is a variant of the spelling Obal of <a href="?bref=Gen.10.28">Gn 10:28</a>).</p>
<p>Years before the entrance into the Promised Land, God, through Moses, designated the twin mountains Ebal and Gerizim as the place for the recitation of the curses and blessings of <a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-28.68">Deuteronomy 27–28</a>. According to <a href="?bref=Deut.27.12">Deuteronomy 27:12</a>, six tribes of Israel were to stand on Gerizim and shout the blessings. These were Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. “Joseph” here would mean the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in whose territory these two mountains belonged. The other six tribes—Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali—were to recite the curses from Mt Ebal. It is interesting that Ebal is north of the east-west valley that separates the two mountains and it is the more northerly tribes that stand on it.</p>
<p>The fulfillment of the divine directive is recorded in <a href="?bref=Josh.8.33">Joshua 8:33</a>. Joshua also obeyed in another matter—that of building on Mt Ebal an altar of unhewn stones (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.30">Jos 8:30</a>) as Moses had commanded (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.4">Dt 27:4</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">EBLA TABLETS*</p>
<p class="fl">Tablets, dating c. 2220–2240 <span class="era">BC</span>, discovered in the ancient Syrian city-state of Ebla, now identified with the site of Tell Mardikh.</p>
<p>Ebla was a commercial center, manufacturing items of textiles, wood, ceramics, gold, silver, and other metals. A large number of the clay tablets unearthed are economic documents, recording transactions with many other cities, stretching from Asia Minor to Egypt and from Cyprus to Iran (Persia). Thousands of cities are named in these documents. Included are many familiar biblical names, such as Hazor, Megiddo, Dor, Joppa, Gaza, and Uru-salim (Jerusalem, or possibly “city of Salem”). In one text we also see Sodom, Gomorrah, and Zoar. Zoar is described as “in the territory of Bela” (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.14.2">Gn 14:2</a>). According to the biblical account, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed in the days of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.24-29">Gn 19:24-29</a>); hence, the details recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Genesis 14</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">19</a> could not have been reconstructed at a later date unless there was a living tradition recording the events.</p>
<p>Many personal names appear in the tablets from Tell Mardikh that have biblical equivalents, e.g., Abram <span class="ital">(ab-ra-mu),</span> Israel <span class="ital">(ish-ra-ilu),</span> Saul <span class="ital">(sha-u-lu),</span> and David <span class="ital">(da-u-du).</span> To some, this fact raises questions, while others find it to be a confirmation of the biblical record. For example, it might be asked how the name “Israel” could be found four or more centuries before God gave the name to Jacob. The Bible does not suggest that the name was new. Names in those days were often composed of the name of a deity plus a verbal form (e.g., Isaiah = “Yah is salvation”). It is entirely conceivable that parents named their children <span class="ital">ish-ra-ilu,</span> “El [God] has prevailed,” before the days of Jacob. What was new in the biblical experience was the personal encounter with God and the blessing that it brought on Jacob.</p>
<p>A number of the names from Ebla seem to appear in two forms, one compounded with <span class="ital">-ilu</span> (El), the other with <span class="ital">-ya</span> (Yah). Thus the names <span class="ital">mi-ka-ya</span> (Micaiah, Micah) and <span class="ital">mi-ka-il</span> (Michael) are reported by Pettinato, along with other theophoric (God-bearing) names. The appearance of the ending <span class="ital">-ya,</span> if it has been properly interpreted as a divine name (Yah, the Lord), raises an important question. According to <a href="?bref=Exod.6.3">Exodus 6:3</a>, God told Moses that he appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El Shaddai, “but by my name Yahweh I did not make myself known to them.” This seems to say that the name Yahweh was not known prior to the revelation to Moses at Sinai. On the other hand, the name Yahweh is found many times in Genesis, not only in narrative portions (where a later author or editor might have inserted a name, such as was done with certain place-names), but also in oaths taken in the name of Yahweh and in quotations that imply that the name of Yahweh was actually in use. This problem has long been recognized, and biblical scholars have divided into two groups: those who held that the name was <span class="ital">not</span> known prior to the time of Moses, and those who held that the name <span class="ital">was</span> known but that it took on a new meaning in the light of the Sinai-exodus event. If the interpretation of the Eblean materials proves to be correct—namely, that <span class="ital">-ya</span> is a divine-name element in personal names—then we shall have to conclude that the name Yah(weh) was known in patriarchal times but that its true significance, that Yahweh is the ever-living and life-giving God, only began to be fully revealed in his deliverance of his people from Egyptian bondage.</p>
<p>The Eblean materials have certainly opened a new door to a rich storehouse of knowledge. It will be many years before all the implications of this discovery are fully realized. But certain facts are already clear, and among these is this very important truth: the patriarchal stories in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-35.29">Genesis 11–35</a> can no longer be ascribed to authors of the eighth or seventh centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. To assume that such an author could have included hundreds of names of places and persons, items of trade, and the many details that are found in these chapters, and then to suggest that it is mere coincidence that has brought to light the same names, places, trade relationships, and countless other details through modern archaeological discoveries, is simply unreasonable. Ebla has delivered the coup de grâce to such theories.</p>

  <title>Ecbatana</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ECBATANA</p>
<p class="fl">Greek name for the capital of the ancient Median Empire, later one of the capital cities of the Persian and Parthian empires. It is often spelled Achmetha (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.2">Ezr 6:2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), approximating its Aramaic name. The Old Persian name, Hangmatana, may have meant “place of assembly.” Modern Hamadan covers most of the ruins of the ancient city.</p>
<p>The city is at 6,300 feet (1,920.1 meters) on the eastern slopes of Mt Oronte (Alvand), a granite peak reaching to a height of 12,000 feet (3,657.4 meters) above sea level, part of an impassable range broken only by the pass leading to Ecbatana. Major trade routes converged on this pass and gave Ecbatana its strategic importance.</p>
<p>The altitude of the city also accounted for its popularity as the summer residence of Persian and Parthian kings. In the winter, blizzards pile snow several feet deep and temperatures plummet below zero, but the summer climate is cool and comfortable; mountains shade the afternoon sun, while melting snows bring ample water. Greek general Xenophon reported that the Persian king Cyrus annually spent three months of spring in Susa, seven months of winter in Babylon, “and in the height of summer two months in Ecbatana.”</p>
<p>The Greek historian Herodotus recorded that the city was established by Deioces, founder of the Median dynasty, early in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. In 550 <span class="era">BC</span> Cyrus captured the city from a Median king, Astyages. It was from Ecbatana that Cyrus issued his 538 <span class="era">BC</span> decree that all Jews throughout his kingdom might return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezr 1:2-4</a>). Later, an Aramaic memorandum regarding this decree was found in the records of Ecbatana after a fruitless search of the archives in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.1-12">6:1-12</a>). After Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>) quelled a revolt in securing the throne, he had the famous Behistun inscription carved in the side of Mt Orontes high above the city. The city was taken and pillaged by Alexander the Great in 330 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Although <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.2">Ezra 6:2</a> is the only explicit biblical reference to the city, Ecbatana could have been one of the Median cities receiving exiles from the northern kingdom (722 <span class="era">BC</span>), if the city were in existence before fortification by Deioces (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.6">2 Kgs 17:6</a>). The book of Tobit places Jewish exiles in Ecbatana in the seventh century (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.3.7">3:7</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.7.1">7:1</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.14.14">14:14</a>), though that is of questionable historical worth. The book of Judith records a battle between a Median king, Arphaxad, and an Assyrian king, Nebuchadnezzar, in which the Assyrians capture Ecbatana (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.1-2,14">1:1-2, 14</a>), but the account is dubious because the identity of those kings is unknown. Antiochus Epiphanes may have died there in 164 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.9.1-3,19-28">2 Macc 9:1-3, 19-28</a>).</p>
<p>Ecbatana is the only one of the three Persian capitals that has yet to be completely excavated, since it lies partly within the modern city of Hamadan, Iran. Ancient Greek authors gave elaborate descriptions of the city and its wealth. Polybius, for example, reported that it “greatly exceeded all the other cities in wealth and the magnificence of its buildings.” Incidental archaeological discoveries of two foundation inscriptions in silver and gold from the time of Darius I and column bases from Artaxerxes II suggest the great promise of excavations there. Excavations have been forestalled, however, because extensive demolition of modern Hamadan would be necessary for access to much of the ancient city below.</p>

  <title>Ecclesiastes, Book of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ECCLESIASTES, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">OT book of Wisdom Literature. Ecclesiastes is philosophical in character, posing deep questions about the meaning and nature of human existence.</p>
<p>“Ecclesiastes” is the Greek title for the book and has come into English from the Septuagint (Greek translation of the OT). In keeping with an early Jewish practice of adopting the first few words of a book as the title, the Hebrew title of Ecclesiastes is “The Words of Koheleth, the Son of David, King in Jerusalem.” It is also known simply as “Koheleth.”</p>
<p>The term “Koheleth” is the author’s title for himself throughout the book (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.1-2,12">Eccl 1:1-2, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.27">7:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.8-10">12:8-10</a>). It is the Hebrew participial form of a verb meaning “to assemble,” and thus it seems to designate one who speaks in an assembly. The word has often been translated “the Preacher” in English. Because of the philosophical nature of the book, however, the title possibly indicates the author’s function or station as a leader in the community of wise men.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The authorship of Ecclesiastes presents complex questions, on which biblical scholars disagree. Early Jewish tradition was divided over the issue, ascribing the book to King Hezekiah and his school, as well as to King Solomon.</p>
<p>Internal evidence is often appealed to for support of Solomon as the author of Ecclesiastes. The first verse ascribes the authorship of the book to “the son of David.” Other passages (e.g., <a href="?bref=Eccl.1.16-17">1:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.6-7">2:6-7</a>) also seem to refer to Solomon, who succeeded David as king of the united kingdom of Israel. Those who reject Solomonic authorship interpret such references as literary devices, written by a later unknown author in order to use Solomon’s devotion to wisdom as a context for his own ideas about life’s purpose and meaning.</p>
<p>A number of passages in the book have been appealed to in support of non-Solomonic authorship. Some scholars allege that if the book had been written by Solomon, he would not have used the past tense about his reign “over Israel in Jerusalem” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.12">1:12</a>). Proponents of Solomonic authorship point out, however, that the Hebrew verb “was” can also mean “became,” thus stating that Solomon had become king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It is also alleged that <a href="?bref=Eccl.1.16">1:16</a> supports a date of writing by an author who lived much later than Solomon. They say that Solomon could not have said that he was wiser than “all who were over Jerusalem before me,” for that would point to a long succession of kings before him. But the author may have meant prominent wise men rather than kings (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.31">1 Kgs 4:31</a>).</p>
<p>One of the chief difficulties with Solomonic authorship is the fact that OT history does not record a period of spiritual revival in Solomon’s life as a context for the book of Ecclesiastes. That is not a conclusive argument, however, for the thoughts recorded in the book are intensely personal in nature. The historical books of the OT deal primarily with historical developments, mentioning personal aspects of human life only where they bear upon God’s purposes as reflected in the national history. It would, in fact, be surprising if the extremely personal struggles recorded in Ecclesiastes were cited by the historical writers.</p>
<p>The question of authorship is a difficult one, but there seems to be no conclusive evidence against Solomon as the author of Ecclesiastes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The majority of scholars who hold to the Solomonic authorship of Ecclesiastes date the book in Solomon’s final years as king (c. 940 <span class="era">BC</span>). The book would then have been written in the golden era of Israelite wisdom, by one of the foremost proponents of wisdom teaching.</p>
<p>Those who deny Solomonic authorship disagree among themselves as to when the book was written, but most date it in the postexilic period. A Maccabean date (c. 165 <span class="era">BC</span>) is difficult to maintain, because fragments of the book, dated in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, have been found at the Dead Sea site of Qumran. Also, the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus, probably written in the early second century <span class="era">BC</span>, was heavily influenced by Ecclesiastes. Such factors would allow little time for the writing and circulation of the book in the Maccabean period.</p>
<p>A number of conservative scholars, such as Franz Delitzsch and E. J. Young, have assigned a fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> date to the book. Many others consider it a third-century <span class="era">BC</span> document.</p>
<p class="h3">Internal Evidence</p>
<p class="fl">Attempts have been made to determine the date of the book of Ecclesiastes from alleged historical allusions. But the somewhat gloomy observations found in such passages as <a href="?bref=Eccl.1.2-11">1:2-11</a> and <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.1-15">3:1-15</a> need be nothing more than the author’s conclusions about the emptiness of life. They do not necessarily indicate that the book was written in a time of national decline or social decay within Israel, a time that would not fit with the reign of Solomon.</p>
<p>It is also alleged that the book contains allusions to Greek philosophical concepts. That would indicate that it was written sometime after the Hellenization of the Syro-Palestinian world effected by the conquests of Alexander the Great (356–323 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>One of those philosophical concepts is the “golden mean” propounded by Aristotle. The golden mean calls for avoiding extremes in the pursuit of satisfaction in life, and it is reflected in <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.14-18">Ecclesiastes 7:14-18</a>. The same concept is found in Egyptian wisdom literature (<span class="ital">Instruction of Amen-em-opet</span> 9.14), as well as in Aramaic wisdom literature. In one of the finest examples of Aramaic wisdom, <span class="ital">The Words of Ahiqar,</span> the golden mean is expressed in the words “Be not (too) sweet, lest they [swallow you]; be not (too) bitter [<span class="ital">lest they spit you out</span>].” But the golden mean concept need not indicate one particular period of thought; it may simply represent a basic kind of wisdom shared by people of all times and all ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p class="h3">Linguistic Considerations</p>
<p class="fl">The most critical issue in dating Ecclesiastes is the nature of the book’s language. The Hebrew of Ecclesiastes is unique, differing stylistically and linguistically from such fifth-century OT books as Ezra, Nehemiah, and Zechariah.</p>
<p>Some scholars maintain that the language of Ecclesiastes was heavily influenced by Aramaic, and thus the book was written at a time when the Aramaic language was influential in the Hebrew-speaking world. Others have argued that the peculiarities of the Hebrew should be understood as affinities with Canaanite-Phoenician dialects.</p>
<p>It is often asserted that the Hebrew of the book is similar to later Mishnaic Hebrew, particularly in its use of the relative pronoun. Yet the language of Ecclesiastes is dissimilar to the Mishnah in other ways.</p>
<p>The linguistic evidence could point to a late date for the book, but it is also possible that Solomon wrote in a literary style that was heavily influenced by Phoenician literature. Such a style may have become a standard for the literary genre into which Ecclesiastes falls. During the reign of Solomon, contacts between Palestine and Phoenicia were quite common.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Ecclesiastes demonstrates the meaninglessness of a worldview that does not press beyond the limits of human experience to include God. It seeks to show that meaningful satisfaction may be attained in a universe that seems to be nothing more than a succession of wearying cycles—a universe into which people are locked with no apparent means of escape. According to Koheleth, freedom can be achieved by fearing God and believing that God will ultimately judge everything fairly. Thus, life has a goal and purpose that it will reach, although in the course of history and the processes of the physical world, it may not look that way.</p>
<p>The book’s chief theological tenet is that God is not disinterested in the course of human events with its gross injustices. He will judge every deed. Life, therefore, has a purpose, and human deeds have meaning.</p>
<p>Koheleth is often accused of having a pessimistic view of life. One cannot read such passages as <a href="?bref=Eccl.1.12-14,18">1:12-14, 18</a> and <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.1-9,18-23">2:1-9, 18-23</a> without feeling his helplessness as he viewed what seemed an empty existence. But Koheleth’s pessimism had to do with life apart from God. To him such a life had no meaning.</p>
<p>A positive good emerges from the book, however, even though it is often overlooked. Koheleth speaks in terms of absolutes as he spins his argument. There is an absolute good for people as they live in a seemingly meaningless world. That good is the enjoyment of God’s gifts to his people. Thus Koheleth is not an utter pessimist. When he lifts the horizons of his worldview to include the hand of God at work in the world, he becomes an optimist. But when he looks at life without God, he is pessimistic, for such a view offers only despair.</p>
<p>Koheleth’s “theology of contentment” is clear in such passages as <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.24-25">2:24-25</a>, <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.10-13">3:10-13</a>, and <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.22">3:22</a>. The first passage seems to express a hedonistic view of life, making eating and drinking the main purpose. The expression “eat and drink” is a Semitic idiom that seems to express the everyday routines of life (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.22.15">Jer 22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.17.27-28">Lk 17:27-28</a>). Koheleth’s use of the phrase, then, simply means that one should enjoy God’s providence. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not endured.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.10-13">3:10-13</a> Koheleth sets forth the great enigma of humankind: God has put the knowledge of eternity in the human mind. That is, he has made the mind able to go beyond the limits of physical existence. Yet even that ability to conceptualize the eternal does not explain all of God’s purposes. Therefore, it is good for a person simply to accept human limitation and enjoy whatever knowledge God gives.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Eccl.3.16-4.3">Ecclesiastes 3:16–4:3</a> is a difficult section of the book. There Koheleth observes the inequities of life and concludes that God allows such things for the purpose of “sifting” people to show them that they are no more than animals. The same principle appears in <a href="?bref=Eccl.8.11">8:11</a>, where Koheleth observes that when evil goes unpunished, the wicked are encouraged to continue to do evil. In <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.18">3:18</a> he asserts that injustice is present in the world to distinguish the good from the wicked. The Hebrew in that assertion should be translated “in and of themselves.” That is, viewed alone, apart from God, humankind is no better than animals. If one adopts a worldview that omits God, there can be no way of knowing what lies beyond the grave (<a href="?bref=Eccl.3.21">3:21</a>). The inequities that Koheleth observes will be corrected only in the Day of Judgment. Thus, it is best for a person to be content with God’s providence and not to be anxious about tomorrow (<a href="?bref=Eccl.3.22">3:22</a>).</p>
<p>The key to understanding the book of Ecclesiastes is the recurring phrase “under the sun.” That phrase defines Koheleth’s perspective. He is not judging all human experience as vain. Rather, he is observing life “under the sun,” or apart from God, as vain. The apostle Paul rendered the same verdict on the created world in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.20-23">Romans 8:20-23</a>, but he went on to say that God uses all things in his world to work out good results for his people (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.28">Rom 8:28</a>). Koheleth’s viewpoint is similarly helpful.</p>
<p>Koheleth has often been interpreted as expressing an Epicurean view of life, that eating and drinking are humanity’s highest good. In <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.1-8">2:1-8</a>, however, he tests pleasure and finds it futile. He concludes that pleasure is not an absolute good. The passages that speak of eating and drinking refer only to the enjoyment of those good and necessary things that come from God’s hand.</p>

<p class="h3">The Vanity of the Cycle of History and Nature (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.1-11">1:1-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Koheleth begins his recital of the vanity of life by observing its emptiness and the apparent lack of purpose in the processes of nature. Human toil is fruitless (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.3">1:3</a>), and the endless cycle of life and history is meaningless (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.4-11">1:4-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Vanity of Koheleth’s Own Experience (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.12-2.26">1:12–2:26</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this dramatic section Koheleth looks back to observe the futility of aspects of his life that some might have regarded as possessing great value. He recalls his search for wisdom, but pronounces human philosophy futile (<a href="?bref=Eccl.1.12-18">1:12-18</a>). His search for pleasure (<a href="?bref=Eccl.2.1-11">2:1-11</a>) also ended in futility. In the light of this conclusion, Koheleth hardly sets forth the attainment of pleasure as life’s highest good. The search for valid philosophical verities is wearisome and futile in its outcome (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.12-17">12-17</a>). Human toil is also vain (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.18-23">18-23</a>), because one can never be sure who will inherit the reward of one’s toil (v <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.21">21</a>). Koheleth concludes that the greatest good is to accept God’s providence joyfully (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.24-26">24-26</a>), an optimistic note in his message.</p>
<p class="h3">The Plight of Humanity apart from God (<a href="?bref=Eccl.3.1-22">3:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Koheleth’s familiar statement that everything in life has its time (<a href="?bref=Eccl.3.1-9">3:1-9</a>) has often been interpreted as crassly fatalistic. But those verses more probably set forth the unalterability of life’s circumstances. Humankind is locked into a continuum from which there is no escape, yet people are able to think in terms that go beyond the physical (v <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.11">11</a>). That is the enigma of humankind. Viewed apart from God, people really are no better than animals (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.3.19-20">19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Conclusions Resulting from Koheleth’s Observations (<a href="?bref=Eccl.4.1-16">4:1-16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The author begins with a gloomy outlook on life (<a href="?bref=Eccl.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>) but goes on to draw conclusions of permanent value. He points out, for example, that life’s difficulties are better faced with a partner than alone (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.4.9-12">9-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Vanity of Living Only for Oneself (<a href="?bref=Eccl.5.1-6.12">5:1–6:12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Koheleth gives a powerful denunciation of a self-seeking life by focusing on God (<a href="?bref=Eccl.5.1-2,4-6">5:1-2, 4-6</a>). His condemnation of the misuse of riches and his concern for the poor (<a href="?bref=Eccl.5.8-6.9">5:8–6:9</a>) are themes later emphasized in the NT.</p>
<p class="h3">Wisdom for Living (<a href="?bref=Eccl.7.1-8.17">7:1–8:17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This fine example of OT Wisdom Literature uses a proverbial pattern (<a href="?bref=Eccl.7.1-13">7:1-13</a>) and personal references (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.23-29">23-29</a>) to give insight into how one may find true satisfaction. The whole passage upholds the virtue of godly wisdom. Koheleth’s theology of contentment underlies his observation that God is the source of adversity as well as prosperity (v <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.14">14</a>). He affirms that one should accept both as coming from God. Applying wisdom to governmental authority (<a href="?bref=Eccl.8.2-9">8:2-9</a>), Koheleth counsels the reader to obey the authorities. The apostle Paul gave the same advice in <a href="?bref=Eccl.13.1-14">Romans 13</a>. Koheleth strikes an optimistic note (<a href="?bref=Eccl.8.13">Eccl 8:13</a>), exalting the fear of God. The author is not totally pessimistic, for he shows that fearing God leads to genuine satisfaction.</p>
<p class="h3">Observations on Life’s Seeming Injustices (<a href="?bref=Eccl.9.1-18">9:1-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">“Under the sun,” that is, apart from God, there are no apparent differences among human beings (<a href="?bref=Eccl.9.1-6,11-12">9:1-6, 11-12</a>). Great deeds often go unnoticed and unthanked (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.13-16">13-16</a>). A person should nonetheless be content, for life does offer certain benefits (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.7-10">7-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Wisdom and Folly (<a href="?bref=Eccl.10.1-20">10:1-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Wisdom in the OT basically means knowing God, and folly is rejection of God. Koheleth shows how wisdom can lead to honor and satisfaction, and folly can lead to ruin.</p>
<p class="h3">Koheleth’s Conclusion—Fear God (<a href="?bref=Eccl.11.1-12.14">11:1–12:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Ecclesiastes began with a pronouncement of vanity on all creation, and it ends with Koheleth looking beyond his gloomy vistas to see God. Chapter <a href="?bref=Eccl.11.1-10">11</a> begins with a statement of human inability to understand the ways of God. Though people are meant to enjoy life, they must remember that the future will bring God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Eccl.11.9-10">11:9-10</a>). After giving a beautiful description of old age (<a href="?bref=Eccl.12.1-8">12:1-8</a>) and encouraging the reader to fear God in youth, Koheleth states his conclusion. A person’s whole duty is to fear God (vv <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.13-14">13-14</a>). The pleasure of youth will burst like a bubble and, without God, one will finally have nothing. Satisfaction can come only as one fears God. Life without God is the ultimate vanity.</p>

<p class="h1">EDOM, EDOMITES</p>
<p class="fl">Land and its inhabitants found on the high plateau to the south and southeast of the Dead Sea. The biblical term Edom, meaning “red,” denotes either the name of the land or the name of Esau, in remembrance of the red pottage or stew for which he exchanged his birthright (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">Gn 25:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1,8,19">36:1, 8, 19</a>). The country of Edom was also known as Seir (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.3">Gn 32:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.30">36:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.24.18">Nm 24:18</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">The northern boundary of Edom was the Wadi Zered, the “Brook of the Willows” (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.7">Is 15:7</a>). In ancient geological times the area was thrust up to a considerable height, and dark-red sandstone cliffs were exposed along the western side where the land falls steeply into the Arabah, the southern extension of the deep depression in which the Dead Sea and the Jordan Valley lie. The Edom Plateau rises to over 5,000 feet (1,523.9 meters), reaching over 5,600 feet (1,706.8 meters) in places. The area divides into two unequal parts. The region of Punon forms something of a valley between the smaller northern part and the longer southern part. The northern section is not quite so high, though in a limited area near Radhadiyeh it reaches 5,300 feet (1,615.4 meters). The southern section is longer and generally higher, being over 5,000 feet (1,523.9 meters) throughout the central ridge and touching 5,687 feet (1,733.3 meters) at one point. To the east, the escarpment does not fall below 4,000 feet (1,219.1 meters), except in the north. The desert lies beyond and limits expansion eastward. To the west, the land falls away rather steeply into the Arabah. The extent of Edom to the west varied from time to time. It was comparatively easy to gain access to the Negev of southern Judah in this area, and Edomite encroachments were made from time to time. The southern frontier was marked by an extensive limestone scarp at the southern edge of the plateau. This ran eastward from Ain Gharandal in the Arabah. Beyond this barrier to the south lay rocky, uninhabitable desert, through which merchants must have journeyed to the port at Ezion-geber for trade.</p>
<p>The land of Edom was, on the whole, inhospitable, though there were areas where farming could be undertaken, particularly to the northeast. Here herds of animals could be grazed. Edom’s wealth, however, came largely from the caravan trade that came up from the south and brought goods from India and South Arabia to the Mediterranean coast and Egypt. The important King’s Highway (<a href="?bref=Num.21.22">Nm 21:22</a>) passed through Edom on its way north.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">Biblically, the name Edom does not appear in the genealogy in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Genesis 10</a>. It first appears in the story of Esau in <a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">Genesis 25:30</a>. Esau was called Edom from the red color of the pottage for which he sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob. In <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1-43">Genesis 36</a> there is reference to an Edomite kingdom at a time well before the appearance of an Israelite kingdom, though it is possible that the “chiefs” of Edom were tribal chieftains or non-dynastic leaders like the Israelite judges.</p>
<p>The earliest nonbiblical references come from Egypt and seem to confirm this. Amarna Letter 288 (early 14th century <span class="era">BC</span>) refers to the “lands of Seir,” and the crossing of the Shashu tribes of Edom into Egypt is mentioned by Seti II (1214–1208 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Ramses III (1198–1166 <span class="era">BC</span>). There are no Egyptian references to towns or rulers, only to tribal Bedouin from Seir-Edom. There is some evidence that Ramses II was in Transjordan about 1280–1270 <span class="era">BC</span>, but there is no clear evidence that there was a centralized government before the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Rather, the land was occupied mainly by seminomadic people. From then on, permanent settlements began to appear, a fact that has relevance for the date of the exodus. The Song of Moses in <a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Exodus 15</a> refers to the “chiefs of Edom.” By the time of the exodus, there appears to have been a kingdom of Edom (<a href="?bref=Num.20.14,18,20-23">Nm 20:14, 18, 20-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.37">33:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.34.3">34:3</a>). The Israelites skirted Edom on their journey to the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.4">Jgs 5:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.17-18">11:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>At the time of the rise of the Israelite monarchy, Saul fought successfully against Edom (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sm 14:47</a>). Doeg the Edomite was the chief of Saul’s herdsmen (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.7">21:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.9,18-22">22:9, 18-22</a>). At the beginning of the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>, David defeated Edom in the Valley of Salt and killed many Edomites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.13">2 Sm 8:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.12">1 Chr 18:12</a>). Thereafter, David placed garrisons in Edom, and the Edomites became his subjects (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.14">2 Sm 8:14</a>). It is not clear whether David saw in these people a military threat or whether he was interested in the supply of copper from their land and the potential wealth that would flow from the caravan traffic passing through Edom. David’s successes resulted in the flight of a certain Hadad, who was “of the royal house of Edom” to Egypt (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.14-17">1 Kgs 11:14-17</a>), where he married a member of the Egyptian royal family (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.18-20">18-20</a>). On David’s death, Hadad returned to Edom, where he became king. It would seem that a monarchical form of government had developed by David’s time. Solomon continued to exert influence in Edom. He had access to the port of Ezion-geber (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26">9:26</a>).</p>
<p>The biblical records provide no information about Edom from the end of Solomon’s reign until the days of Jehoshaphat of Judah (872–848 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jehoshaphat was able to occupy the port of Ezion-geber, although his ships were wrecked there, possibly by the Edomites (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48">1 Kgs 22:48</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.36-37">2 Chr 20:36-37</a>). Israel combined with Judah and Edom in an unsuccessful campaign against King Mesha of Moab (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4-27">2 Kgs 3:4-27</a>). Edom was able to throw off Judah’s authority under King Jehoram (853–841 <span class="era">BC</span>) and set up a king of its own (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">8:20-22</a>). It remained independent until the days of King Amaziah of Judah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>), who conquered Edom as far south as Sela, defeating a large army of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.7">2 Kgs 14:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.11-13">2 Chr 25:11-13</a>). This gave Judah control of the copper mines in the Punon area. King Uzziah of Judah (792–740 <span class="era">BC</span>) was able to push his control south to Elath (near Ezion-geber; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.22">2 Kgs 14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.26.1-2">2 Chr 26:1-2</a>). Before the end of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, in the days of Ahaz (735–715 <span class="era">BC</span>), Edom defeated Judah and recovered Elath (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.6">2 Kgs 16:6</a>). Thereafter, Judah lost control over Edom.</p>
<p>During the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Assyrians began to move into Transjordan. About 800 <span class="era">BC</span> Adad-nirari III (810–782 <span class="era">BC</span>) claimed to have conquered several of these western states and to have imposed the payment of tribute. Then Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) received tribute from Qaus-malaku of Edom. Sargon II (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>) spoke of an unnamed ruler of Edom who was involved in the rebellion of Ashdod in 713 <span class="era">BC</span>. Sennacherib (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) spoke of a certain Aiarammu, who brought gifts from Edom. Esarhaddon (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>) referred to Qaus-gabri, king of Edom, who came to Nineveh with 22 vassals to swear allegiance. Under Ashurbanipal (669–627 <span class="era">BC</span>), Edom appears on Assyrian records. Thereafter, Assyria itself was defeated by the Babylonians. Under the Babylonians, Edom seems to have remained a subservient vassal, although in 594 it joined other small nations in discussing rebellion (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-22">Jer 27</a>). When Nebuchadnezzar attacked these, however, Moab and Edom were not involved. In the overthrow of Jerusalem in 586, Edom remained neutral and even allowed some refugees from Judah to shelter there for a time (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.11">40:11</a>). The prophet Obadiah castigated Edom for not assisting Judah at the time of the Babylonian invasion (<a href="?bref=Obad.1.11">Ob 1:11</a>). Instead, they raided Judah, handed over captives to Babylon, and possessed lands in the Negev area to the south (<a href="?bref=Ezek.35.1-15">Ez 35</a>).</p>
<p>A long history of enmity existed between Judah and Edom, and several prophets spoke unfavorably about Edom (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.14">Is 11:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.5-17">34:5-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.29">Ez 32:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.19">Jl 3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.11-12">Am 1:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.1.2-4">Mal 1:2-4</a>). In the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Edom entered a period of decline. Several cities were abandoned. At the same time Edomite colonies west of the Arabah in the southern hill country of Judah emerged, and by Roman times there was a province of Idumea, which was the descendant of the Persian province of Edom, with its administrative center at Lachish. In the old Edomite homeland, Arab groups began to move in. Finally, ancient Edom became the home of the Nabateans.</p>

It was located on the southern branch of the Harmuk River, which was the southern border of Bashan. At this strategic point Og could look over the neighboring region for invaders from the south or from the east, where the land turned into a desert.

<p class="h1">EDUCATION</p>
<p class="fl">The act or process of educating or being educated. The original purpose of Jewish education was to teach children to know and understand their special relationship with God, to teach them to serve him, and to educate them in holiness. Later Jewish education included character development and the history of God’s people (particularly through rehearsing his acts of deliverance). Because of that education, the Jews knew the Mosaic law and their own history, and so, during periods of subjection to foreign powers, they were able to maintain their national pride. In modern times they have reestablished themselves as a nation (1948).</p>

<p class="h2" id="EducationintheHome">Education in the Home</p>
<p class="fl">The priority given to education stemmed from the value of children in the Jewish family. Children were a great joy and reward (<a href="?bref=Ps.127.3-5">Ps 127:3-5</a>). Education in the home began soon after a child could talk, and certainly by the age of three. Parents taught prayers and songs, which children learned by repetition, just as children today learn nursery rhymes.</p>
<p>At home, children became aware of certain religious items and symbols. They were encouraged to ask about the meaning of the annual Passover ritual (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.26">Ex 12:26</a>), which served throughout Hebrew history as a fundamental means of instruction about the nature and significance of God’s power in human life. Children undoubtedly had questions about objects they encountered, whether sacred vessels, ornaments, or clothing used in the tabernacle or temple worship, or more mundane things of everyday life.</p>
<p>Parental responsibility for education was clearly defined. A father was expected to give his son instruction in religion and in the history of the Hebrew people. He was also specifically required to teach his son a trade, often his own, since a boy without a trade was thought to have been trained for life as a thief. A father’s other responsibilities included finding his son a wife and teaching him to swim.</p>
<p>Rabbis held that women could not study the Law because they were “of light mind.” Nonetheless, influential women in the Bible include Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.4-5">Jgs 4:4-5</a>), Jael (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.4.18-24">18-24</a>), the wise woman of Tekoa (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.2-20">2 Sm 14:2-20</a>), the wise woman of Abel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.16-22">20:16-22</a>), Lois, Eunice, and Priscilla (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.3">Rom 16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.5">2 Tm 1:5</a>).</p>
<p>The Jewish mother played a considerable role in a child’s education, particularly in the earliest years. A mother was expected to assist in teaching her sons, but her major responsibility was to train her daughters. Since daughters were less highly esteemed than sons, a girl’s education took place entirely in the home. The mother was responsible for educating her daughters to be successful homemakers: obedient, capable, and virtuous wives. Girls learned the skills of cooking, spinning, weaving, dyeing, caring for children, and managing slaves. They learned how to grind grain and at times helped with the harvest. Occasionally they were expected to help guard the vineyard or, if they had no brothers, to help care for the flocks.</p>
<p>Girls probably learned music and dancing and were expected to have good manners and high moral standards. They were taught to read, and some learned to write and reckon weights and measures. In exceptional circumstances a girl might receive an advanced education privately at home from a tutor.</p>
<p>Even when education was entirely home-centered, it is probable that most wealthy and especially royal children were instructed by a tutor, following a tradition established by other Near Eastern peoples.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ReligiousEducation">Religious Education</p>
<p class="fl">At an early age children accompanied their parents to religious services. At the great festivals they were introduced to important episodes in Jewish history. The Jews, an agricultural people, believed that agricultural knowledge had been revealed by God and that tending the ground was a basic human responsibility. Like some other Near Eastern nations, they believed that the land belonged to God. They were merely tenants. If a crop failed, it was because God withheld rain, but he would do that only if the people were sinful.</p>
<p>The celebrations of the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles were associated with the harvest. Throughout the biblical period, those festivals remained closely identified with the growing season. Such occasions became educational opportunities for children. They learned that the Passover commemorated the deliverance of their ancestors from slavery in Egypt. At Pentecost the Jewish people remembered God giving the law to Moses on Mt Sinai. The Feast of Tabernacles, with its green booths made from tree branches, commemorated God’s faithfulness to the Jews on their seemingly endless journey to the Promised Land.</p>
<p>An example of a ceremony used as a teaching tool is the Passover ritual, which, of the three great festivals, was the least directly connected in origin with the harvest. That feast, which was immediately followed by a seven-day period known as the Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.6">Lv 23:6</a>), was associated with the beginning of the barley harvest in April. (The exodus from Egypt had taken place at that time of year.)</p>
<p>In the Passover ceremony the priest would take one of the first sheaves of the barley harvest and wave it before the Lord (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.9-11">Lv 23:9-11</a>). Before that, the men would choose a barley field at random and bind some of the best sheaves, leaving them standing. The following evening three men would go out to that field with sickles and baskets to reap those specifically prepared sheaves. As onlookers (including the children) gathered to observe the ceremony, the reapers would ask the crowd certain traditional questions. Year by year the children saw that ritual and heard the answers. The barley was cut and taken to the temple court, where it was threshed and winnowed. Some of it was mixed with oil and incense and used as an offering. The remainder went to the priests.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FormalEducation">Formal Education</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish education during the biblical period helped Jews to know of the Law, study the history of the Jewish people, and become proficient in reading, writing, and a certain amount of arithmetic. To that, incidental information such as the medicinal value of certain herbs (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.33">1 Kgs 4:33</a>) might sometimes be added.</p>
<p class="h3">Teachers</p>
<p class="fl">Priests instructed the people in the knowledge of God. As officers of the synagogue, the Levites also performed a teaching role (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.33.10">Dt 33:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.3">2 Chr 35:3</a>). Before the exile, the prophets assumed the role of instructors, teaching the historical heritage of the people and acting as critics of injustice and improper social behavior. Their responsibility was to interpret the law for contemporary society. By the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the prophets’ role as instructors had passed to the scribes and to others designated as teachers.</p>
<p>In the centuries before Christ, scribes not only transcribed and preserved the traditions in written form but were students and interpreters of the law. The scribes were known as “doctors of the law” (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.17">Lk 5:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), lawyers (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.35">Mt 22:35</a>), and rabbis (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.8">23:8</a>). All higher education was in their hands, and they developed a complex system of instruction known as “the tradition of the elders” (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.2-6">15:2-6</a>). Although the scribes needed leisure for their scholarly pursuits, they did not despise laborers. Most of them, in fact, practiced a trade as a means of support when necessary.</p>
<p>Although the scribes were influential in the time of Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-2">Mt 23:1-2</a>), they undoubtedly found, like the prophets before them, that their words were not always heeded. The scribes, who exercised an important influence over contemporary life and morals, were notable for their fierce opposition to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.6">Mk 2:6</a>) and to the early church (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.5">Acts 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.12">6:12</a>).</p>
<p>By the NT era, the entire community was expected to establish and maintain elementary schools. The community was also responsible for financing the education of poor or orphaned children. Out of high regard for earlier priests, prophets, and scribes, and because of the eminent position given to education, teachers were highly esteemed by the Jewish people. Because God had given them the law, it was of greatest importance. One who worked as God’s servant expounding the law was therefore the most important person in the community. To be a teacher was life’s highest privilege and the most significant task a man could perform.</p>
<p>Teachers were expected to demonstrate exceptional character along with their academic qualifications. They were expected to keep children from having contact with anything harmful. They were not to show bitterness or give preference to one child over another. Rather than threatening, they were to explain right and wrong and the harmfulness of sin. Teachers were expected to keep promises to children lest the students grow accustomed to broken words and lies. Teachers were to be eventempered, never impatient or lacking in understanding, always prepared to repeat explanations. It was said that children should be treated like young heifers, with their burdens increased daily. Yet any teacher who was too severe was dismissed.</p>
<p class="h3">Subject Matter</p>
<p class="fl">Early education consisted of learning the law through listening and oral repetition, along with the study of the written text. The content of the law covered three main areas: ceremonial, civil, and criminal. Students needed to master these, preparing themselves to take responsibility for observing the law as adults.</p>
<p>The Scriptures contained such a variety of writings that pupils learned about religion, history, law, morals, and manners, plus reading, writing, and arithmetic. They studied from great literature; along with the Law, they used the books of Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes extensively as texts. The Dead Sea Scrolls have shown that some classical Hebrew was still being spoken in NT times. Students who commonly spoke Aramaic or Greek were faced with a difficult situation when learning the Hebrew of the OT. The problem was especially complex because the Hebrew was written without any vowel sounds. Those had to be memorized in association with the consonants of the text.</p>
<p>Since the ancient Hebrews were generally regarded as the most proficient musicians and singers in the Near East, it is probable that basic instruction in singing and playing instruments, such as the pipe and harp, was received at home. Although no Hebrew hymns have survived in musical form, temple singers would almost certainly have been familiar with the kind of music theory known among the Canaanites. (A musical text recovered from Ugarit [Ras Shamra] consisted of a ballad or a hymn inscribed on clay with curious musical symbols that long defied identification. Dating to perhaps 1800 <span class="era">BC</span>, that Canaanite text has been described as the “oldest sheet music in the world.”)</p>
<p>During the exile especially, great emphasis was placed on recording and preserving ancient customs and ceremonies in order to maintain the distinctiveness of Hebrew culture. The captives recognized the importance of keeping alive their national heritage and the Law during the years they were living in an alien culture.</p>
<p>The synagogue developed during the exile as a place for the study of religion and for prayer, becoming the center of instruction in the Jewish faith. Previously, the temple at Jerusalem had been the only place for sacrifice. Because that ritual could not be performed in Babylon, it was natural for the synagogue to increase in importance in worship as well as in education.</p>
<p>The exile brought about fundamental changes in Jewish life in areas other than the purely religious. Education received considerable stimulation from the Jewish exiles’ contact with the more sophisticated culture of the Babylonians. The Babylonian law code was a precise and well-established feature of life. Schools and libraries in Babylonia had been in existence for many centuries. Mesopotamian knowledge of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, architecture, and engineering was far superior to that of the Jews. In that intellectual environment the literature of the Jews took on new meaning; it was from that period that the books of Ezekiel and Daniel emerged.</p>
<p>In the postexilic period, teaching was based extensively on Proverbs and the apocryphal books of Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon. From those works the Jews received practical training for a successful life. The scribes taught that wisdom came from God and that those who obeyed the commandments would bring joy and honor to others.</p>
<p>Under Persian rule in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Jews had been encouraged to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. After 332 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Alexander the Great defeated the Persian king Darius, strong efforts were made to Hellenize the conquered peoples. The Greek language was introduced along with Greek religion, political procedures, and educational methods. The drive for Hellenization continued under the rule of the Ptolemies (a Macedonian family line that ruled Egypt) and the Seleucids (a Syrian dynasty). Coincident with the establishment of foreign rule came the dominance of the Jewish priesthood in Judean political matters. Greek influence was seen in the enriched aesthetic appreciation typical of certain Jewish rulers.</p>
<p>Although Greek philosophy and sports remained outside the realm of Jewish education, there was a noticeable decline in Jewish religious and moral standards in the Hellenistic period. Some Jews were eager to obtain advancement from the foreign masters by adopting the Greek culture. Others fought desperately to preserve their Jewish heritage. During Roman times, the foreign influence was again ignored by faithful Jews whenever possible.</p>
<p class="h3">Teaching Methods</p>
<p class="fl">Teaching methods, developed from memorizing the Law, stressed the importance of retention and recollection. Children were taught to memorize as soon as they could talk, and they were trained to repeat the exact words so that no nuance of meaning would be altered. The alphabet was taught and memorized by being repeatedly written and drilled. Students copied and recopied passages from the written Law in precise, neat handwriting. Any piece of writing containing a mistake was considered dangerous, since it might imprint the wrong word or spelling on the learner’s mind. Reading aloud was recommended as an aid to memorization.</p>
<p>To aid learning, each boy was also given a personal text beginning with the first letter of his name and ending with the last. As soon as he demonstrated his ability to read, he received a scroll that contained the first words of <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>: “Hear, O Israel: The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> our God is one <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). That was recited every morning and evening in postexilic times, along with the Hallel (or psalm of praise), the story of Creation, and the main part of the Law contained in Leviticus.</p>
<p>Teachings also came in the form of proverbs or parables, a device later used by Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.1-2">Mk 4:1-2</a>). An open sharing of knowledge occurred in question-and-answer periods (for example, the visit of the 12-year-old Jesus to the temple in Jerusalem, <a href="?bref=Luke.2.46-47">Lk 2:46-47</a>).</p>
<p>Very little information is available on education in the early Christian era. We know that Jesus could read and expound the Scriptures and was knowledgeable enough to discuss theology with the learned men in the temple. He probably learned at home and received the elementary education common to most Jewish boys at that period.</p>
<p class="h3">Discipline</p>
<p class="fl">Discipline, almost always an important element in education, was important to the ancient Hebrews. A system of reward and punishment was used in which corporal chastisement was normal. Punishment was considered to be an outward symbol of God’s love and concern for the instruction of his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.8-13">Ps 94:8-13</a>), although the Jews as a people did not always learn from those corrections (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.3">Jer 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.6-13">Am 4:6-13</a>). A child was thought to need “breaking” like a horse: “A horse that is untamed turns out to be stubborn, and a son unrestrained turns out to be wilful” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.30.8">Ecclus 30:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Adult Education</p>
<p class="fl">When Ezra the scribe returned from Babylon with a copy of the Book of the Law, he taught it to the Levites and to the people. That material, together with the book of Proverbs and literature from the preexilic and exilic periods, became basic in Jewish education. In the postexilic period, priests traveled to the towns, addressing people in the synagogue on the Sabbath and in the square on market days, when a large crowd would be gathered. Some individuals may have extended their learning through discussion with the elders (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">Ez 8:1</a>).</p>
<p>For those who continued their education, the next phase was probably instruction by scribes. The scribes, leaders of a Jewish sect called Pharisees, had developed Ezra’s principles into strict rules on tithing, ritual purity, and synagogue worship. As a young man, Saul of Tarsus came to Jerusalem to study with Gamaliel, an honored rabbi (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">Acts 22:3</a>). At that time the curriculum was an advanced study of theological law, both written and oral, along with the rites and ceremonies of Jewish culture.</p>
<p class="h3">School Buildings</p>
<p class="fl">By NT times, some schools operated in special buildings and others in the teachers’ own houses, but most were attached to the synagogue. When a separate building was designed, it was considered inadvisable to construct it in a crowded area. In a large town the community was expected to provide two schools, especially if a river divided the town. A school did not operate in the heat of the day (between 10 <span class="sc">am</span> and 3 <span class="sc">pm</span>), and would meet only four hours a day in July and August. Class size was expected to be 25, with a teacher and an assistant for 40 students and two teachers for 50. At school the boys sat on the ground at the teacher’s feet and learned from the Scriptures. Thus, the school became known as the “House of the Book.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="LiteracyamongtheJews">Literacy among the Jews</p>
<p class="fl">The extent of literacy among Jews over the centuries is difficult to determine, but indications can be found from specific examples. The book of Joshua describes three men chosen from each tribe who had to prepare a written report about the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.4-9">Jos 18:4-9</a>). Later, Gideon captured a youth who was able to make a written list of the important men of the city (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.14">Jgs 8:14</a>). Writing was probably a common skill since the Israelites were exhorted to use it frequently (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.9">Dt 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.2-8">27:2-8</a>). Simple mathematical terms could be written and understood by boys, and there are indications of familiarity with the geometrical relationship of a circle’s radius and circumference (the concept of pi; see <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.2">2 Chr 4:2</a>). The development of cursive script implies widespread use of writing from at least the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>. It is noteworthy that a synagogue service could be performed by any ten men in the congregation, which presupposes that there were more than 10 men in any synagogue who were literate enough to fulfill that duty.</p>
<p>When fears of Hellenism were strong and the existence of Judaism was threatened in the first century <span class="era">BC</span>, it was decreed that every Jewish boy should attend elementary school. Since such a system probably already existed, that decree merely made attendance compulsory for all males up to 16 or 17 years of age. No doubt the reason was that thorough knowledge and careful observance of the Law were vital to the survival of the Jewish heritage.</p>
<p>Joshua ben-Gamala (high priest <span class="era">AD</span> 63–65) is considered the founder of universal education. His instructions for setting up schools in towns and villages were precise, requiring attendance of boys from the age of six or seven years. The community was responsible for setting up a school and maintaining a teacher in any town where there were at least ten Jewish families. Fathers were required to see that their sons attended school. When a family lived in an isolated area, a teacher often lived with the family. Teachers were probably paid either by the family or from a community tax, although scribes were not paid directly for the instruction they gave. It is difficult to know if the goal of universal elementary education was attained.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EducationinSurroundingCultures">Education in Surrounding Cultures</p>
<p class="fl">The theological emphasis of Hebrew education contrasted sharply with the aims of education in Greece and Rome. Those societies, however, were also concerned with developing a particular type of character.</p>
<p>In Sparta the purpose of educational training was to develop young men to be fighters who would subject themselves to the welfare of the state. Character development was achieved by eliminating luxuries and by systematically disciplining mind and body through physical activity. Survival techniques encouraged resourcefulness and initiative. Girls received the same education, since it was considered important to develop women who could give birth to strong warriors.</p>
<p>In Athens education was deemed essential to life. Because transmission of culture would enable boys to become perfect citizens, they were taught letters, music, morals and manners, mathematics, and gymnastics (development of a healthy body). Education was ideally a noble pursuit—a training of the mind, the birthright of every citizen—but in practice it was restricted to a small section of the aristocracy. The educated despised earning a living as a way of life suitable only for slaves. Women received no education. The teacher in elementary schools was a lowly individual.</p>
<p>Roman education prepared a boy mentally and physically for farm, battlefield, or wherever his services were required by the state. Education was a family responsibility—the boy learning first from his mother, then from his father. Basic reading, writing, arithmetic, language, structure, and debating skills were taught, sometimes by private tutors. When schools were developed, they seem to have been noisy, storefront activities operated by poorly paid teachers. Girls were taught housekeeping skills at home.</p>
<p>Egyptian boys attended the “House of the Books” for their studies and learned reading and elementary arithmetic. Writing in hieroglyphs on papyrus was the most difficult task. Like students in other cultures, boys were subject to corporal punishment. Egyptian teachers considered that “a boy’s ears are in his back,” following up that conviction with frequent use of a cane.</p>

<p class="fl">Egypt figured significantly as a stage on which the biblical narrative was enacted. Here Abraham lived in time of famine. Joseph, his great-grandson, was sold into slavery in Egypt and rose to a position equivalent to that of prime minister. Through Joseph’s intercession, Jacob and the rest of the Hebrew patriarchal family living in Palestine came to reside in the eastern delta region of Goshen—again as a result of famine. Initially treated favorably, they were later reduced to bondage; crying to God, ultimately they were released through the 10 plagues. Thereafter, for 40 years, they wandered in the Egyptian Sinai, where they received the law, specifications for building the tabernacle, and instructions for the priestly and sacrificial systems.</p>
<p>After the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, a group of Jews forced Jeremiah to go with them to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.6-7">Jer 43:6-7</a>), where they became numerous during the intertestamental period and gradually forgot their Hebrew. At Alexandria, Jews translated the OT into Greek (the Septuagint) between about 250 and 150 <span class="era">BC</span>. This became the Bible of the early church, especially of those Christians outside Palestine.</p>
<p>When the NT period opened, Egypt served as a refuge for Joseph, Mary, and Jesus as they fled to escape the assassination attempts of Herod the Great (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-23">Mt 2:13-23</a>). At several other points, Hebrew and Egyptian history intersected—for example, when Shishak I invaded Palestine in the days of Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-28">1 Kgs 14:25-28</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">Egypt is the gift of the Nile, without which it could not exist. From time immemorial the Nile has deposited a thin layer of rich silt each year as it overflowed its banks. This ribbon of loam along its course contrasts vividly with the sterile sands that stretch from the river valley often as far as one can see. Then, having deposited this soil, the Nile provides water for its irrigation. This is necessary in a land that receives only six to eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of rainfall per year along the Mediterranean, two inches (5.1 centimeters) or less per year at Cairo, and less than that farther south.</p>
<p>The Nile Valley is a tube, shut in on either side by cliffs and corked up at the southern end by cataracts, six places where the river has failed to cut a clear channel and where rocks are piled in irregular masses in the streambed. From cliff to cliff the Nile Valley ranges from about 10 to 31 miles (16 to 50 kilometers) in width between Cairo and Aswan. But the cultivated area along this stretch is only about six to ten miles (10 to 16 kilometers) wide, and narrows to one or two miles (1.5 to 3 kilometers) in width around Aswan. This cultivated tract is only about 5,000 square miles (8,045 square kilometers) in total.</p>
<p>But Egypt is more than the valley. It is also the delta, a pie-shaped area north of Cairo also deposited by the Nile over the millennia. The delta measures some 125 miles (201.1 kilometers) north and south, and 115 miles (185 kilometers) east and west. Its more heavily populated southern region provided ancient Egyptians with some 5,000 square miles (8,045 square kilometers) of farmland, making the total of valley and delta about 10,000 square miles (16,090 square kilometers), roughly equal to the state of Maryland.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="BoatsOnTheNileRiver"/>
<p>West of the Nile extends a chain of oases, the largest of which is the Fayum, about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) southwest of Cairo. In the center of the Fayum is Lake Qarun, which today covers 90 square miles (144.8 square kilometers) and is about 17 feet (5.2 meters) deep. It is surrounded by about a half million acres of good farmland.</p>
<p>Ancient Egypt extended some 125 miles (201.1 kilometers) from the Mediterranean to Cairo (Lower Egypt) and another 600 miles (965.4 kilometers) from Cairo to Aswan (Upper Egypt). At the height of its power, Egypt also controlled the valley from the first cataract at Aswan south to the fourth cataract (Nubia). Thus its domain extended a total of some 1,100 miles (1,769.9 kilometers) south from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Egypt’s most important resource was the rich loam along the Nile. On it, in antiquity, farmers raised grains, such as barley, emmer, and wheat. Onions, leeks, beans, and lentils were common vegetables. Dates, figs, and grapes were the most widely grown fruits. Oil came from castor oil plants and sesame rather than from the olive, as in other Mediterranean lands. Flax provided linen for clothing. Domesticated animals included oxen, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, donkeys, and horses.</p>
<p>Another important resource was an abundant supply of stone. Granite mountains rise between the Nile and the Red Sea, and deposits of alabaster and other fine stone are found in the same region. South of Aswan stand the granite mountains of Nubia. The quarries of Syene at Aswan are famous for their extremely hard and durable red granite. Gold was reasonably plentiful in the Nubian Mountains, and gold-bearing quartz veins were found in the mountains east of the Nile. Egyptians controlled the copper and turquoise mines of the Sinai during much of their important historical periods. In early antiquity some timber was available in Nubia for building the barges that carried the huge loads of stone for construction of pyramids, temples, and other magnificent structures.</p>
<p>The Nile itself was an all-weather highway. One could float northward with the current and sail southward against the weak current (3 miles, or 5 kilometers, per hour) by means of the prevailing northerly winds. In fact, the Nile was the road of ancient Egypt. Land routes normally conducted traffic only to the river’s edge. In addition to the massive north-south commerce, ferry boats regularly moved from shore to shore.</p>
<p>Along the river grew papyrus reeds, from which writing material could be made. And along the Nile, clay was deposited from which could be made pottery and sun-dried bricks for the houses of the poor.</p>
<p>The ancient Egyptians lived in comparative isolation and peace in their valley home. The cataracts on the south, the deserts on east and west, and the harborless coast of the Mediterranean protected them from invasion and left them free to develop a homogeneous culture. Outside influences could sift in chiefly at the two northern corners of the delta. There were Semitic incursions from the east, and Libyans (possibly of European origin) from the west. Defenses were erected to protect against both. The security of their valley home and the regular provision of the sun and the Nile gave the Egyptians a sense of confidence and well-being that was not the lot of other peoples of the ancient Near East.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">It is wrong to think of the contemporary rulers of Egypt as descendants of the pharaohs or the present inhabitants of the land as Egyptians in any but a geographic sense. Egypt as an area of distinctive civilization ended with the Arab conquest in the seventh century <span class="era">AD</span> and was greatly diluted during the several preceding centuries by Greco-Roman influences.</p>
<p class="h3">Origins</p>
<p class="fl">Though the origins of the ancient Egyptians are imperfectly understood, physically they show affinities to Hamites, Semites, and Mediterraneans. Hamites with negroid characteristics moved north from Nubia. Asiatics migrated across the Isthmus of Suez into the delta, and the small, brown, finely boned Mediterranean people dominated the Nile Valley from early times. However diverse their origins may have been, Egyptians of the ancient period were conscious of themselves as a nation, a distinctive people. Men stood about five feet six inches (1.7 meters) in height and women about five feet (1.5 meters). They were slight but strong-boned, with round heads and oval faces. The men had little face or body hair, and throughout antiquity they were commonly smooth-shaven, while Semites were bearded.</p>
<p>Archaeologists list a series of successive predynastic cultures—Fayumic, Meridian, Tasian, Badarian, Amratian, Gerzean, and Semainean—who mastered basic techniques and learned how to build a civilization with minimal resources. Of course, they developed an irrigation system for the maintenance of an effective agricultural program. At a very early time they discovered how to turn flax into linen and thus to produce clothing. Boats were made from papyrus reeds and trees that grew along some of the streambeds in the south. Sun-baked bricks provided building material, and clay was available for pottery. The latter was made by hand; the pottery wheel did not appear until dynastic times.</p>
<p>Writing appeared in Egypt about the end of the predynastic period. Their hieroglyphs, or sacred signs, were called “the words of God” and were believed to be of divine origin. By 2700 <span class="era">BC</span>, they had learned how to make “paper” by crisscrossing strips cut from the pith of the papyrus plant and forming them into sheets. About the same time they developed techniques for cutting stone from the quarry. Commonly they cut a groove along a line where a block was to be split off. There they drove in wedges of dry wood and wetted them to swell the wood and split the block off. Sometimes they lit a fire along the groove to heat the stone and then poured water over it to split it away from the main rock.</p>
<p class="h3">Unification of Egypt</p>
<p class="fl">In the period just before about 3100 <span class="era">BC</span>, Egypt consisted of the two separate kingdoms: Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt. Then the king of Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt and unified the two lands under his sole rule. But the division was never quite forgotten, and Egypt was referred to as the “Two Lands” throughout its history. The pharaohs wore a double crown, a combination of the low red crown of Lower Egypt and the white crown of Upper Egypt. The king’s palace was called the “double palace,” and even the royal granary was double. The Hebrews recognized this duality, for throughout the OT they called Egypt <span class="hebrew">Mitzrayim</span>—a word with a dual ending.</p>
<p>The pharaoh who was credited in the ancient sources with the unification of Egypt was sometimes called Narmer and sometimes Menes; presumably these were different names for the same person. Narmer-Menes began the first dynasty of united Egypt. Though the ancient Egyptians did not reckon in dynasties, modern historians follow the practice of Manetho, an Egyptian priest of the mid-third century <span class="era">BC</span>, who compiled a list of kings down to the Persian period and divided it into 30 dynasties; later others added a 31st dynasty. The ancients did not use such terms as “Old Kingdom” and “Middle Kingdom” either, but modern scholars find them a convenient way of organizing Egyptian history.</p>
<p class="h3">Early Dynastic Period (3100–2700 BC)</p>
<p class="fl">Kings of the first two dynasties ruled at This, or Thinis, some 300 miles (482.7 kilometers) south of Cairo, but they built Memphis as another administrative center. They consolidated their hold over the land and developed the theory that the king was divine. Contacts with the outside world were considerable, and there are many indications in Egypt of influences from Mesopotamia at this time.</p>
<p class="h3">Old Kingdom (2700–2200 <span class="era">BC</span>; Dynasties 3–6)</p>
<p class="fl">The Old Kingdom is especially remembered for its building operations. The pyramids were erected at that time. The capital was located at Memphis (biblical Noph), southwest of modern Cairo. Contacts with Phoenicia were numerous, and some believe Egyptians were so heavily involved there and elsewhere that it is proper to speak of the “Old Empire.” Artistic standards were being developed, and literary and medical beginnings were significant. Egypt was an absolute monarchy. The divine king was served by an army of officials; the whole population might be regimented during his lifetime to prepare his tomb.</p>
<p>The first king of the third dynasty was Djoser, who built the step pyramid at Saqqara. The earliest great stone structure in the world, it consists of six layers, or steps, rising to a height of 204 feet (62.2 meters). The architect was Imhotep, his vizier or prime minister, who later was deified and credited with the beginnings of architecture, literature, and medicine, and identified by the Greeks with the god of medicine, Asklepios.</p>
<p>The fourth-dynasty pharaohs were the great pyramid builders. They were responsible for erecting the three great pyramids at Giza between about 2600 and 2500 <span class="era">BC</span>. The greatest of these, attributed to Khufu, covers 13 acres, originally rose to a height of 481 feet (146.6 meters), and contains about 2.3 million blocks of limestone averaging two and a half tons each. The second pyramid stands 447½ feet (136.4 meters) high and is accompanied by the sphinx, a couchant lion with the face of the king. The third pyramid is 204 feet (62.2 meters) high. These pyramids are not isolated examples. Several more small pyramids were built at Giza, and there were nine pyramid fields in all, scattered along the western bank of the Nile south of Memphis. During the fifth and sixth dynasties, there appeared the pyramid texts, carved and painted inscriptions, magical spells, and hymns that were supposed to aid the deceased in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The artistic standards of Egypt were established during the Old Kingdom. The king and the gods were portrayed in a stylized form. Art tended to be conceptual rather than perceptual; that is, instead of reproducing what he saw, the artist painted what he knew to be there. For example, a school of fish became individual fish painted whole instead of being pictured naturally with one fish obscuring part of the fish next to it. In a similar manner the saddlebags on a donkey were shown with the one facing the viewer reproduced in a natural way; the other one, known to be behind the donkey’s back, was flipped up in the air above the donkey’s back.</p>
<p>The importance of an individual determined his size in a pictorial representation. In a battle scene the pharaoh would be the largest figure, his commanding officers next in size, the common soldiers smaller yet, and enemy troops smallest of all.</p>
<p>Egyptian art was intended to tell a story: much of it was more like a motion picture than a snapshot. A wine-making scene might include picking the grapes, treading out the juice (normally done by stomping with bare feet), and storing the juice in jars.</p>
<p>Evidently Egyptian medical knowledge was also developing during the Old Kingdom. Though the sources for knowledge of Egyptian medicine are the great papyri of the Middle Kingdom, there is some indication that medical knowledge claims far greater antiquity. Numerous archaic expressions appear in the texts. Perhaps Egyptians knew something of the circulation of the blood; they talked about feeling the “voice of the heart.” Egyptian medical practice combined a hodgepodge of home remedies, charms and incantations, and scientific expertise. The Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus is a remarkable study dealing especially with the treatment of broken bones.</p>
<p>During the sixth dynasty, the Old Kingdom began to break up as a result of poor rulers, aggressive nobles, fiscal difficulties, Nubian incursions in the south, and Asiatic attacks in the northeast.</p>
<p class="h3">First Intermediate Period (2200–2050 <span class="era">BC</span>; Dynasties 7–11)</p>
<p class="fl">During the Old Kingdom, there was political stability and prosperity. The Nile flood came predictably and not devastatingly. There was enough for all to eat. If one behaved himself and worked hard and studied diligently in school, he could count on the proper promotions and general success in life. Familiar social, political, economic, and religious institutions remained constant and could be counted on to assume their regular place in the rhythm of life. Now the old aristocracy had fallen. The central government had broken down; nobles ruled many districts and took the title of kings. It was no longer true that if one did certain things he could count on success. The collapse of the whole philosophy of life of the Old Kingdom brought a spiritual upset and spawned attempts at reevaluation of life. Some of the literature of the time advocates the hedonistic approach of drowning one’s problems in pleasure, and some recommended a stoical approach—to steel oneself against the hardships of life.</p>
<p class="h3">Middle Kingdom (2050–1780 <span class="era">BC</span>; 12th Dynasty)</p>
<p class="fl">Late in the 11th dynasty, princes of Thebes (440 miles, or 708 kilometers, south of Memphis) struggled to restore order and royal control and were partially successful. The Middle Kingdom was the period of the 12th dynasty, native Thebans who made their capital at Lisht in the Fayum. The six rulers of this dynasty took the names of Amenemhet and Sesostris. Each of them ruled some 30 years, and most of them took their sons on the throne as co-regents before death, eliminating the danger of a usurper. Since these kings did not dare to deprive the nobles of their largely independent power, a feudal condition existed during much of the period.</p>
<p>Unable to function as absolute kings, these pharaohs had to rule by persuasion and the development of goodwill. Their rendering of <span class="hebrew">ma’at</span> (social justice) was constantly emphasized, and if a person could not obtain <span class="hebrew">ma’at</span> at the hands of the nobles, he was promised it at the hands of the king. Their propaganda program also portrayed the pharaoh as concerned with responsible leadership instead of merely exercising authority. The pharaoh was the shepherd of his people.</p>
<p>Middle Kingdom pharaohs were wise enough not to exhaust the treasury on great pyramids; instead, they undertook public works, such as a massive effort to increase cultivable acreage in the Fayum, construction of a defensive wall across the isthmus of Suez, and systematic working of the Sinai copper mines. Trade was extensive with Crete, Lebanon, Syria, and Punt.</p>
<p>The Middle Kingdom was a time when Amon began to emerge as the great god of Egypt. He was grafted onto the sun god Re as Amon-Re and came to supersede the gods who had formerly stood for Thebes. As god of the nation, he was to become the great imperial god under the empire and thus to assume a universal quality. Religious texts, which had graced the walls of the pyramids during the Old Kingdom, now were inscribed on coffins instead, and their use was available to nobles as well as kings.</p>
<p>A literary flowering occurred during the Middle Kingdom. Scientific literature is represented by such outstanding works as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Smith Surgical and Ebers Medical papyri. The “Instructions of Merikare” portrays something of the wisdom literature of the period, and the “Tale of Sinuhe” introduces the genre of entertainment literature.</p>
<p>If one holds to the early date of the exodus (c. 1446 <span class="era">BC</span>) and adds 430 years for the period of Israelite sojourn in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Ex 12:40</a>), he will conclude that the Israelites entered Egypt about 1876 <span class="era">BC</span>. This would be early in the reign of Sesostris III (of Senwosret, or Sen-Usert; 1878– 1840 <span class="era">BC</span>). Sesostris was a vigorous king who extended Egyptian control south to the second cataract and campaigned up into Syria. He was also able to reverse the feudalistic conditions of the earlier period; he took away the power of the nobles and appointed royal officials in their stead. Possibly this achievement was somehow related to famine in Joseph’s day and Joseph’s use of that famine to fasten royal control on all the populace of the land (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.13-26">Gn 47:13-26</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Second Intermediate Period (1780–1570 <span class="era">BC</span>; Dynasties 13–17)</p>
<p class="fl">With the passing of the strong 12th dynasty, Egypt relapsed once more into a period of disintegration. The Hyksos (“rulers of foreign lands”), Semites from Syria and Palestine, gradually infiltrated into the delta region and took control there about 1730 <span class="era">BC</span>, maintaining their capital at Tanis, or Avaris, in the eastern delta. Meanwhile, Theban princes ruled weakly in the south and were commonly vassals to the Hyksos.</p>
<p>Apparently as a result of Egyptian hatred of the Hyksos and stringent efforts to obliterate their memory, the Hyksos are a very shadowy people. Little remains on which to base a reconstruction of their history. Presumably they were responsible for introducing new kinds of bronze swords and daggers, the powerful compound bow, and above all the horse and chariot. The Egyptians adopted these with good success and used them to overthrow Hyksos power and then to build an empire in Palestine and Syria. The struggle of Theban princes to gain release from Hyksos control was prolonged and apparently fierce at times. The effort began late in the 16th century <span class="era">BC</span> and was completed by Ahmose I (1570–1546 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Empire Period (1570–1090 <span class="era">BC</span>; Dynasties 18–20)</p>
<p class="fl">Ahmose launched the 18th dynasty, and may be viewed as initiating the empire, or New Kingdom, period as well. After defeating the Hyksos in Egypt, he carried on successful campaigns against Nubia and Sharuhen in southern Palestine. Subsequently he was forced to subdue nobles who had managed to gain independence from the central government during the Hyksos era. Amenhotep I (1546–1525 <span class="era">BC</span>) was also forced to fight the Nubians in the south and Libyans in the northwest.</p>
<p>Dying without a son to succeed him, Amenhotep was followed on the throne by his sister Ahmose, who married a Thutmose (Thutmose I, 1525–1508 <span class="era">BC</span>), probably a relative. Thutmose had to resubjugate rebellious Nubians during the first year of his reign and in subsequent campaigns considerably expanded Egypt’s Nubian holdings. Between those two Nubian attacks, he mounted an offensive in Syria; thus he could claim an empire that stretched from the Euphrates to the third cataract of the Nile. Moses may have been born early in his reign. Thutmose began the practice of carving out royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings west of Thebes.</p>
<p>Evidently the only surviving child of the union of Thutmose and Ahmose was a daughter, Hatshepsut, who was married to Thutmose II (1508–1504 <span class="era">BC</span>), a son of Thutmose I by a secondary princess. Thutmose II had to quell rebellious Nubians, but little else is known of his reign. Since his marriage to Hatshepsut produced two daughters but no sons, he decided to marry his daughter Marytre to a son by a minor wife (Thutmose III, 1504–1450 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Hatshepsut continued to rule during the minority of Thutmose III and refused to step aside when he came of age. She dominated Egypt from 1504–1482 <span class="era">BC</span>. During her reign, Egypt enjoyed economic prosperity. Her building activities were considerable; not the least of her achievements was the erection of two great obelisks at the temple of Karnak at Luxor. The one remaining shaft stands 97½ feet (29.7 meters) high and weighs about 700,000 pounds (317,800 kilograms). She also conducted trade expeditions to the land of Punt. Hatshepsut is sometimes identified as the pharaoh’s daughter who rescued Moses from the Nile (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.5">Ex 2:5</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, in 1482 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hatshepsut met an untimely end, probably at the hands of Thutmose III as he burst his bonds and assumed rule over the realm. Within 75 days he had assembled an army and was leading it north into Palestine-Syria to subjugate rebellious princes there. A great initial victory at Megiddo and a sack of the city after a seventh-month siege cowed northern Palestinians but did not break their will to resist. Thutmose found himself campaigning in Palestine or Nubia almost annually for the next two decades.</p>
<p>What started out as an Egyptian impulse to punish the Hyksos turned into a spirit of imperialism, which enjoyed a sense of power in victory. As the frontiers expanded, there was almost always a peril to attend to somewhere during subsequent generations; some of them were real and some remote. Thus the sense of security that Egyptians had enjoyed during earlier centuries when they were shut up in their valley home gave way to a feeling of insecurity. And as the god Amon-Re smiled on Egyptian military efforts, he was rewarded with quantities of booty and handsome gifts. In time the temples gained so much wealth and power that they came to exercise great clout in political and economic circles. Especially great was the power of the priesthood of Amon at the temple of Karnak.</p>
<p>Thutmose III was one of the greatest of Egypt’s ancient pharaohs. A conqueror and empire builder, he is often called the Napoleon of ancient Egypt. There was hardly a city of any size in the kingdom where he did not engage in building activities. With him began an effort to glorify the pharaoh as sportsman, athlete, and warrior that was to last for several generations; he had the powers of a god in conducting the affairs of men. If one accepts the early date of the exodus, Thutmose III is often considered to have been the pharaoh of the great oppression of the Hebrews.</p>
<p>Thutmose was succeeded by his son Amenhotep II (1452–1425 <span class="era">BC</span>), who may have been the pharaoh of the exodus. Serving briefly as co-regent with his father, he enjoyed an easy transition to sole rule over the empire. Though forced to conduct two campaigns into Syria and Palestine to subdue rebellious towns, he seems generally to have enjoyed a peaceful reign. Like his father, he sought to be known for his prowess as a sportsman and his ruthlessness as a warrior.</p>
<p>After the little-known reign of Thutmose IV (1425– 1412 <span class="era">BC</span>), Amenhotep III (1412–1375 <span class="era">BC</span>) ascended to the throne of Egypt. Frequently called “the magnificent,” he reveled in the wealth that poured in from the empire. Once, in the brief space of only 14 days, he had excavated for his wife a lake 6,400 feet (1,950.6 meters) long and 1,200 feet (365.7 meters) wide. Here on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes a royal barge could float about while musicians aboard provided entertainment for the king and queen. Amenhotep built several temples, including a mortuary temple at Thebes, to which were attached the famous colossi of Memnon, seated statues of the king about 70 feet (21.3 meters) high. Though artists dutifully represented him as a great conqueror on temple walls, he seems to have engaged in stifling only one uprising in Nubia and probably never set foot in Palestine or Syria.</p>
<p>Just as Amenhotep III made no effort to maintain the empire, neither did his son Amenhotep IV (1387–1366 <span class="era">BC</span>). Because of ill health, Amenhotep III made his son co-regent in 1387 <span class="era">BC</span>, but the son paid little attention to the affairs of state. Of a mystical bent, he devoted himself to the establishment of the cult of the sun god Aton at a new capital named Amarna. Aton worship was almost monotheistic (the king being worshiped along with the god) and thus constituted a virtual religious revolution, but it had few adherents outside the court. Religious changes, political changes connected with the move of the capital, and artistic changes were three of the main elements of the so-called “Amarna Revolution.” The loose naturalism in art, almost bordering on caricature, was not new, however, since it had been accepted as early as the reign of Thutmose IV. Amenhotep IV took the name Akhnaton (“spirit of Aton”).</p>
<p>Akhnaton paid no attention to numerous appeals (the Amarna letters) from royal princes of Palestine and Syria for help to repel invaders, and the empire disintegrated. Acceptance of the early date of the exodus would place the Hebrew conquest and the subsequent settling-in process during the reigns of Amenhotep III and IV, precisely when Egyptian power over Palestine disappeared. However, the Habiru, which some of these appeals name as attackers, should not be identified as Hebrews. Much of what is said about them could not have been true of Hebrews.</p>
<p>When Amenhotep IV died, Tutankhamen (1366–1357 <span class="era">BC</span>) succeeded to the throne. A young boy of eight or nine, he was associated with Eye, a favorite of Akhnaton, as co-regent. When Tutankhamen died nine years later, Eye continued to rule until 1353 <span class="era">BC</span>. Because of the discovery of his magnificently furnished, unrifled tomb in 1922, Tutankhamen has received attention out of proportion to his significance in antiquity. The thousands of objects from his tomb illustrate the wealth, grandeur, and artistic achievements of ancient Egypt and help to demonstrate what it meant for Moses to turn his back on the riches of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.26">Heb 11:26</a>).</p>
<p>When Eye died, Harmhab, commander-in-chief of the army, succeeded to the throne (1353–1319 <span class="era">BC</span>). He reorganized the state and reestablished a strong government. Dying childless, Harmhab designated as his successor Ramses I, commander of the army and vizier, or prime minister. Ramses (1319–1318 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Seti I (1318–1299 <span class="era">BC</span>) made valiant attempts to restore the Asiatic empire lost by Akhnaton. In connection with their efforts, the capital was moved to Tanis in the delta, from which military campaigns could be more effectively launched.</p>
<p>Ramses II (1299–1232 <span class="era">BC</span>) continued the effort to restore Egyptian control in Palestine. In the fifth year of his reign, he met the Hittites in battle at Kadesh on the Orontes in Syria and narrowly missed destruction of his forces. Subsequently, he fought battles all the way from southern Palestine to northern Syria. If the Hebrews were then in the land, as an early date of the exodus requires, they probably never made contact with the Egyptians because they were shepherds and vinedressers in the hills of Palestine, and Ramses moved along the coastal road. Finally, in his 21st regnal year, Ramses made a peace treaty with the Hittites and kept it to the end of his days. He built massively all over Egypt, notably at his capital of Tanis, at Thebes, at Abu Simbel (south of Aswan), and at Memphis. Many of those who accept a later date for the exodus believe he was the pharaoh of the exodus.</p>
<p>Ramses’ 13th son, Merneptah (1232–1222 <span class="era">BC</span>), was the only Egyptian king who claimed to have defeated the Hebrews in battle. But some scholars argue that he never invaded Asia and that this statement is to be interpreted as a customary claim of victory over the king’s opponents in surrounding lands, whether or not he ever met them in battle.</p>
<p>Ramses III (1198–1164 <span class="era">BC</span>) also fought off a Libyan invasion of the delta in his 5th and 11th regnal years, and in his eighth year he repulsed an invasion of Sea Peoples, among whom were Philistines. He was the last ruler of the empire period to maintain outposts in Palestine and Syria. In his later years the Egyptian economy deteriorated, and inflation and breakdown of the government’s ability to meet the public payroll brought great suffering. Hunger marches resulted.</p>
<p>During the reigns of Ramses IV–XI (1167–1085 <span class="era">BC</span>), there was a steady decline of the state. Graft and inflation increased. During the reign of Ramses IX (1138–1119 <span class="era">BC</span>) unpaid mercenary troops seem to have roamed as marauders in the delta, and tomb robbery reached epidemic proportions. Finally Herihor, viceroy of Nubia and commander of military forces in the south, seized control of Upper Egypt and made himself high priest of Amon in Thebes. The empire had come to an end.</p>
<p class="h3">The Postempire Period</p>
<p class="fl">In the postempire period, Egypt came under the rule of Libyan kings (945–712 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Ethiopian kings (712–670 <span class="era">BC</span>). After a brief period of Assyrian domination (670–663 <span class="era">BC</span>), a native dynasty asserted itself (663–525 <span class="era">BC</span>). Then the Persians conquered and held the land until Alexander the Great marched through in 331. Thereafter, the Ptolemies ruled Egypt until the death of Cleopatra in 30 <span class="era">BC</span>. At that point the Romans took over. They controlled the land when Mary and Joseph fled there after the birth of Jesus. During the Greco-Roman period, Hellenistic culture dominated Egypt.</p>
<p>During the early postempire period, when Egyptian culture was still dominant, several kings figured in biblical history. During the fifth year of Rehoboam, king of Judah (probably 926 <span class="era">BC</span>), Shishak I of Egypt invaded Judah and wrought great havoc there (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-26">1 Kgs 14:25-26</a>). He even marched into the territory of Israel, as archaeological discoveries show. About 700 <span class="era">BC</span>, in the days of King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, Tirhakah of Ethiopia led an army into Palestine to help the Jews against invading Assyrians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.9">2 Kgs 19:9</a>). Near the end of the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>, Pharaoh Neco led an army through Judah to come to the aid of weakened Assyria. When King Josiah tried to stop him, the Hebrew monarch lost his life (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.28-30">2 Kgs 23:28-30</a>). During the last days of the kingdom of Judah, while Nebuchadnezzar was besieging Jerusalem (588–586 <span class="era">BC</span>), Pharaoh Hophra invaded Palestine in a vain effort to aid the Hebrews and defeat the Babylonians. Jeremiah predicted the Egyptians’ destruction (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.30">Jer 44:30</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="SocialLife">Social Life</p>
<p class="h3">Social Classes</p>
<p class="fl">In theory and in practice, the king owned all the land of Egypt. He was divine, and the gods had assigned to him the deeds to all the land. Of course, he made gifts—to the gods for the support of the temples, to his most loyal supporters, and for the maintenance of his own worship cult after his death. Thus, large parts of the kingdom slipped from his hands, but much remained as the possession of the crown. Although by the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, nobles held great tracts of land, the king managed to sweep aside their power and repossess a considerable amount of acreage. During the Empire, the king made large grants to the temples, especially the temple of Amon at Thebes. This generosity enhanced the power of the priesthood at the expense of the crown.</p>
<p>As increasing amounts of land passed out of the control of the crown, and as social and economic life became more complex, a complicated class structure developed. The major division in Egyptian society was between the educated elite and the uneducated masses, but such an observation is too simplistic. At the top were the royal family and the great nobles. Below them was a group of lesser nobles and officials. Lower yet was a class of craftsmen who served both upper classes. Then, at least during the Empire, there were farmers who owned small plots which they worked themselves. At the bottom of the social structure were free serfs and slaves. Slavery became common only under the Empire, when slaves were obtained as prisoners of war, primarily in Palestine and Syria to the north and Nubia to the south. Some slaves found their way into domestic service at the palaces and on the large estates, but most of them worked on the land and some served in the mines. Slavery was never as important in Egypt as in other Near Eastern countries.</p>
<p class="h3">Family Life</p>
<p class="fl">Egyptians apparently married in early adolescence. Children were weaned at three. Boys were circumcised between the ages of 6 and 12. Although education was designed for boys of the upper classes, girls—especially of royal families—frequently received some formal education. Egyptian women evidently enjoyed much greater freedom and prestige than women of other Near Eastern countries. They went about rather freely; they accompanied their husbands in the conduct of business and even at social events. The family might even accompany the husband and father on an outing when he went fishing or hunting, though they did not take part in the action. Egyptians normally were not monogamous, the size of the harem being dictated by economic considerations. But the status of the chief wife was protected, and her first son was her husband’s heir. Professions open to women included the priesthood, midwifery, mourning, dancing, and perhaps scribal activity (there was a feminine word for scribe).</p>
<p>Furniture was meager in an Egyptian house. Beds, chairs, stools, footstools, and stands for water jugs seem to have been the main items. Dining tables do not appear to have been used; there were stands on which trays of food might be placed. The poor simply sat on the floor, slept on mats on the floor, and spread out their meals on the floor.</p>
<p>Houses were normally built of mud brick. Those of the wealthy were set amid gardens and frequently had decorative pools. Rooms might be color-washed on the inside and even decorated with frescoes. Roofs were flat and provided a second bedroom in the hottest months. Houses sometimes had a second story. Though remains of two or three villages of workmen on government projects have been found, virtually nothing is known of the layout or size of the important cities of ancient Egypt.</p>
<p class="h3">Dress</p>
<p class="fl">Women wore long linen garments extending from the armpits to the ankles and held up by straps over the shoulder. During the Empire period, the skirt was made fuller and pleated. Men wore loincloths fastened with a belt and extending to the knee. The upper classes often wore it pleated in front. During the Middle Kingdom and the latter part of the Empire, the loincloth was extended to midcalf, and men sometimes also wore a short-sleeved tunic. As a result of Asian influence, Egyptians of the upper classes frequently wore colored clothing during the Empire, instead of the prevailing white of other periods.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="EgyptianWallPaintings"/>
<p>Men were clean-shaven, but the king and a few top officials wore false beards for ceremonial purposes. Both men and women wore wigs, and both men and women used eye paint for medicinal and decorative purposes. Women wore lipstick and rouge and applied henna to their nails, the palms of their hands, and the soles of their feet. Men and women of the upper classes wore a variety of jewelry. People of all classes applied oils and fats to their skin to protect them in the hot, dry climate. The use of perfume was also universal.</p>
<p class="h3">Entertainment</p>
<p class="fl">There were no organized games in ancient Egypt. Sportsmen went out alone or with their families. They might hunt in the desert with bows and arrows and dogs, go fishing, try to knock down birds with a boomerang in a marsh, or go driving in a chariot. Boys and young men among the peasants especially enjoyed wrestling. Soldiers participated in war dances, which were a sort of physical drill. A game like checkers was the chief indoor game of men and women alike.</p>
<p class="h3">Law and Punishment</p>
<p class="fl">The king was viewed as the source of all law, and apparently there was no written code to which all could appeal. Courts followed precedent set in past cases, and periodically the king modified the legal system by new edicts. Procedure in the courts involved administering an oath to tell the truth, speeches by accuser and accused, judgment of the court, and note taking by a court recorder. In some cases torture was used to extract a confession.</p>
<p>Treason, murder, and perjury were among the capital crimes. The latter was so serious because the court oath was taken “by the life of Pharaoh”; thus, swearing falsely meant injury to the king. Other serious crimes were punishable by mutilation (cutting off nose or ears) or hard labor in the mines and quarries (a living death). A person convicted of theft might be sentenced to repay double or triple what he had taken. Beating was the usual punishment for minor offenses. During the Empire, Egypt had a kind of police force with a contingent in each town.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Religion">Religion</p>
<p class="fl">All of Egyptian life was bound up with religious considerations. As the “gift of the Nile,” Egypt worshiped the great river as Hapi. The sun, which gave life to all things, was deified under such names as Amon-Re and Aton. The king was the offspring of the gods and was in some sense god incarnate. The 10 plagues in Moses’ day were an attack on the gods of the Egyptians. Turning the Nile into blood, bringing intense darkness on the land, and smiting the firstborn of the divine pharaoh involved a discrediting of Egyptian gods, as did the other plagues in various ways.</p>
<p>The greatest concern of all individuals was immortality and the blessing of the gods upon them in the next life. Egyptians were not morbid in that they were preoccupied with death; they sought to project or continue as many of the pleasant aspects of this life as possible into the next life.</p>
<p>Ancient Egyptians, unlike modern Western peoples, had no concept of an inanimate world. All natural phenomena were personalized and acted as friendly or unfriendly beings whenever they affected human activity. The gods were looked on as patrons of various activities or functions. Thus, Bes, a bandy-legged dwarf, was the patron of music and conception, and the goddess Taurt (a combination of hippopotamus, lioness, and crocodile) was associated with childbirth. Charms of both were made in abundance, and these two seem to have been more widely regarded among the masses than the chief gods of Egypt.</p>
<p>Most important of all the gods was Re, or Ra, the sun god. The pharaoh was his physical son and earthly embodiment. When he died, he rejoined his divine father in the sky. Re generated the god Shu, personification of air, and the goddess Tefnut, personification of moisture. These gave birth to two children, Geb the earth god and Nut the sky goddess. The legends present different stories of how mankind came into being. One legend has Re generating them with his tears; another has Khnum forming them on his potter’s wheel. During the Empire, the god of Thebes, Amon, was identified with Re, and the sun god henceforth became known as Amon-Re. The great triad of Thebes was Amon, his consort Mut, and their son Khonsu (the moon god).</p>
<p>Rivaling Amon-Re in importance was Osiris, god (king) of the dead. Legend has it that the benevolent ruler Osiris was murdered by his brother and brought back to life by his wife, Isis, through various magical devices; thereafter, he ruled in the west as king of the blessed dead. Eventually the experience of Osiris became that of every human being. Through magical formulas of the sort used by Isis, the individual could come to Osiris and even in some sense become Osiris. In addition to the knowledge and pronouncement of such formulas, the individual had to appear at a judgment for the weighing of his heart in the balance of righteousness. If declared innocent of wrongdoing, he was allowed to enter the kingdom of Osiris and enjoy a blessed hereafter.</p>
<p>Some of these notions about exiting to the next life began to appear on the walls of pyramid tombs in the Old Kingdom (“pyramid texts”). During the Middle Kingdom, they were recorded on coffins (“coffin texts”). During the Empire, they were compiled as the “Book of the Dead.” Portions continued to be inscribed on the walls of tombs from the Empire period to about <span class="era">AD</span> 300.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LearningandCulture">Learning and Culture</p>
<p class="h3">Language and Writing</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient Egyptian was related to both Semitic and Hamitic languages. By about 311 <span class="era">BC</span>, both hieroglyphics (pictorial characters used in inscriptions and more formal writing) and hieratic (a more running hand) were in use. Hieroglyphs may stand for a letter, a syllable, a sound, a word, or an idea. Francois Champollion cracked the decipherment of the hieroglyphs in 1822, primarily with the help of the Rosetta Stone. About 700 <span class="era">BC</span>, a more rapid script called demotic came into being and continued to be written until early Christian times. Thereafter, Coptic, the ancient Egyptian language, came to be written down in a Greek script with a few extra letters.</p>
<p class="h3">Education</p>
<p class="fl">Egyptian education, available almost exclusively to upper-class boys, was designed to provide trained personnel for the priesthood, government offices, or the professions. Few had a chance to obtain any education at all. Boys began their training at an early age, commonly about four. Classes started early in the morning and normally ended about noon, in order to avoid the heat of the day. Reading, writing, and arithmetic were the standard fare. Good handwriting and the ability to compose letters were essential for all leaders in society. Eloquence was also valued. Learning by imitation was achieved through copying handwriting samples and model letters. Pieces of stone and potsherds provided inexpensive writing tablets, with papyrus being reserved for final drafts of important compositions. Knowledge of arithmetic was especially important for workers in government offices where taxes were collected in kind.</p>
<p>The highest form of education was priestly training, and a prince might enroll in a school for priests. But often he was educated by tutors in classes held at the palace. Such classes normally were designed for children of the harem; princesses and nonroyal children might also attend them.</p>
<p>After lower school, a boy might attend a “House of Life,” a kind of academy or senior college. There outstanding persons might lecture on a variety of subjects (including medicine). Presumably resembling Plato’s academy in Athens, such “Houses” did not have a prescribed curriculum or regular examinations. They were equipped with libraries.</p>
<p class="h3">Science</p>
<p class="fl">The ancient Egyptians excelled in applied mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. The annual flood of the Nile required an early development of the ability to resurvey the land rapidly after waters receded. Engineering skills were necessary to produce the irrigation system on which all Egyptian life depended. Moreover, their massive building projects necessitated a knowledge of mathematics. Egyptians could add and subtract but had cumbersome procedures for multiplication and division. They could calculate the area of a square, a triangle, a rectangle, and a circle and could do simple exercises in geometry. It is thought that experience rather than mathematical reasoning ability was responsible for most of their mathematical successes. They understood that the calendar must have 365¼ days in it, and they divided the year into 12 months and the months into three 10-day weeks. As early as 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>, they had invented an adequate water clock.</p>
<p>With their elaborate practice of embalming, one would expect their knowledge of anatomy to be superior. They distinguished between injuries and diseases and performed some amazing surgery. Treatment was, however, a curious combination of scientific and superstitious efforts. Egyptian scientists, with a practical rather than theoretical motivation, amassed a vast collection of facts about astronomy, chemistry, geography, medicine, surgery, mathematics, and natural history.</p>
<p class="h3">Architecture</p>
<p class="fl">As the ancient Egyptians built their great temples, they were most concerned with stability and enduring qualities. They were built to last forever. Thus they were made of stone (commonly limestone or sandstone) and roofed with great stone slabs supported on massive columns. The capitals generally were lotus, papyrus, or palm leaf in design. Great statues of a king were placed inside these temples; as mere architectural decoration, these sculptures appear stiff and formal. Light entered the temple through windows in the side of the raised central hall; the side aisles were lower. Though the roofs of these temples were flat, Egyptians knew how to construct a round arch by at least 2700 <span class="era">BC</span>. Greatest of the remaining temples is the temple of Karnak at Luxor. The hypostyle hall there, built by Ramses II, has a forest of 134 sandstone columns, the central avenue of which has 12 columns that soar to a height of 70 feet (21.3 meters), the tallest columns in the ancient world.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="EgyptianPyramid"/>
<p>Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom built great pyramids as burial places along the west bank of the Nile south of Memphis. Pharaohs of the Middle Kingdom constructed smaller pyramids in the Fayum area. During the empire period, they carved tombs out of the cliffs west of Thebes. Pharaohs as divine beings covered the walls of their tombs at Thebes with religious scenes. The nobles had their tombs decorated with scenes of everyday life—a life that they wished to perpetuate beyond the grave.</p>
<p>Houses were constructed of sun-dried brick; a few remain at Amarna and in a couple of abandoned workers’ camps.</p>
<p class="h3">Music</p>
<p class="fl">All that is known of Egyptian music must be gleaned from musical instruments found in tombs or representations of musical instruments painted on tomb walls. Three instruments used in religious exercises were the sistrum, tambourine, and castanets. The sistrum was a metal loop fastened to a handle. Holes were cut in the sides of the loop so that three metal rods could be loosely fastened in it. When the sistrum was shaken, the rods would rattle. This is the instrument referred to in <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Samuel 6:5</a>. Miriam used the Egyptian timbrel, or tambourine, in the celebration after crossing the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>).</p>
<p>Stringed instruments in ancient Egypt included the harp, lyre, lute, and a kind of guitar. Wind instruments included the single and double flute and the trumpet, the latter apparently used only for military purposes. At first, instruments were used singly to accompany a singer or dancer. Orchestras existed during the Empire period, when Israel escaped from Egyptian bondage.</p>

<p class="h1">EKRON, EKRONITES*</p>
<p class="fl">Most northerly city among the major Philistine settlements. During the Hebrew conquest of Palestine, Ekron was not taken by Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.3">Jos 13:3</a>). When the land was divided among the 12 tribes, Ekron was given first to Judah and then to Dan (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.11,45-46">15:11, 45-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.43">19:43</a>). It was eventually taken by Judah (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.18">Jgs 1:18</a>), but it subsequently fell back to the Philistines.</p>
<p>Ekron played a prominent role in the story of the capture of the ark of the covenant. After the ark brought disaster to Ashdod and Gath, it was taken to Ekron (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-10">1 Sm 5:1-10</a>). The Ekronites did not want the ark, so they consulted with the “lords of the Philistines” and proposed that the ark be sent back to Israel (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>After David killed Goliath, the Israelites pursued the Philistines to the gates of Ekron, which at that time apparently was the nearest walled city in which fugitives could take refuge (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.52">1 Sm 17:52</a>).</p>
<p>Ekron was apparently the center of the worship of the god Baal-zebub. When Ahaziah injured himself and lay ill, he preferred to consult with Baal-zebub rather than with God. Elijah was sent by God to denounce Ahaziah and tell him that he would die (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.2-18">2 Kgs 1:2-18</a>). Baal worship may have been increasing in Israel at this time. Ekron is included in the denunciations of several prophets: Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.20">25:20</a>), Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.8">1:8</a>), Zephaniah (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.4">2:4</a>), and Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.5-7">9:5-7</a>).</p>
<p>Assyrian records inform us that Ekron revolted against Sennacherib in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>. The rebels deposed Padi, the ruler of Ekron, who was loyal to Assyria, and handed him over to Hezekiah in Jerusalem for imprisonment. Sennacherib moved against Ekron, and Ekron called for aid from the king of Mutsri (either Egypt or a district of northwestern Arabia). Sennacherib lifted his siege of Ekron long enough to defeat the army of Mutsri, and then returned to take Ekron. He executed the rebels, made captives of their followers, forced Hezekiah to release Padi, and restored Padi as ruler of the city. Padi also received some territory taken from Judah. Padi’s successor, Ikausu, was not so fortunate. He, along with Manasseh of Judah, was forced to pay heavy tribute to both Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal.</p>
<p>In 147 <span class="era">BC</span> the king of Syria, Alexander Epiphanes, gave Ekron to Jonathan Maccabeus as a reward for his loyalty (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.89">1 Macc 10:89</a>). In the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span> it still had a large Jewish population.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">EL*</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient Semitic name for deity, perhaps meaning “power” (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">Gn 17:1</a>); used by the Hebrews generally in a poetic sense to denote the true God of Israel. The same word was used for the senior Canaanite god and the god in Ugaritic mythology. The “Il” or “El” of ancient Canaanite mythology (before 3500 <span class="era">BC</span> in the region of Syria) was not as active as the god Baal, who struggled with Death and triumphed over Chaos. But Il was the father god of the Canaanite pantheon. OT critics have suggested that the Hebrews adopted the clan gods of the Canaanites, including Il. Yet Phoenician and Ugaritic literature use Il in the feminine form for the names of goddesses. The Hebrew avoids such usage. El is combined with other adjectives to describe the numerous attributes of God; for example, God Most High (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18-24">Gn 14:18-24</a>), the seeing God (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.13">16:13</a>), the jealous God (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.5">Ex 20:5</a>), the forgiving God (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.17">Neh 9:17</a>), and the gracious God (v <a href="?bref=Neh.9.31">31</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ELAM (Place), ELAMITES</p>
<p class="fl">Occupying an area roughly the size of Denmark, Elam was located in southwest Asia, east of Babylonia and north of the Persian Gulf, on a plain known to the Iranians since the Middle Ages as Khuzistan. The region today corresponds to southwest Iran. Mountainous areas to the north and east, known as the Anshan range, formed a peripheral part of Elam. The land’s fertility was linked to several waterways, the most significant of which—the Karkheh—forms Elam’s western boundary.</p>
<p>A people with a culture and history spanning more than 2,000 years, the Elamites seem to have lived in constant strife with the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and finally the Persians, by whom they were absorbed. As a race, the Elamites were a mixture of dark-skinned aboriginals of questionable origin and Semites who had spilled over into the land from Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Western civilization would know virtually nothing of Elam were it not for the biblical witness. Elam is mentioned in conjunction with Shem’s progeny (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.22">Gn 10:22</a>), and in the book of Acts it is reported that among the Israelites present in Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost were some from the old area of Elam (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.9">Acts 2:9</a>). Isaiah prophesied that the Jews carried away in the Babylonian exile would return from such places as Elam (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>); however, these were most likely Aramaic-speaking Jews who had decided not to return to their homeland following the repatriation edict of Cyrus of Persia (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezr 1:1-4</a>). The name Kedorlaomer, king of Elam (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1">Gn 14:1</a>), is demonstrably an authentic Elamite name, thereby lending additional support to the accuracy of the historical narrative in Genesis. Daniel’s vision at Shushan in the province of Elam (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.2">Dn 8:2</a>) reveals precise knowledge of the geography of the area and its waterways. In such accounts the Bible shows itself to be a valuable adjunct to extrabiblical literature for the history of the ancient Near East.</p>
<p>In the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Isaiah summoned Elam to participate in the shattering of Babylon as an act of the Lord’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.2">Is 21:2</a>); there is little information, however, about Elam’s role in the overthrow of Babylon in 540 <span class="era">BC</span>. Elam, with other rebellious nations, would eventually experience the cup of God’s wrath (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.15-26">Jer 25:15-26</a>). Even its world-renowned archers would prove no match for the Lord of hosts (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.6-12">Is 22:6-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.35">Jer 49:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.24">Ez 32:24</a>). Ezekiel’s dirge over Elam dramatically illustrates the horror of a godless grave (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.24-25">Ez 32:24-25</a>). Jeremiah warns the Elamites that they cannot escape the judgment of God, made certain by the presence of his throne among them (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.38">Jer 49:38</a>). Yet Elam’s destruction, though politically complete in Persia’s conquest, would not be altogether irremediable (v <a href="?bref=Jer.49.39">39</a>). Though its dislocation would rival those of its contemporaries, Jeremiah spoke of a time when God would extend mercy to descendants of the Elamites. Such an expectance, following the phrase, “in the latter days,” may point to the messianic age. The prophet may well have envisioned that momentous Day of Pentecost, when many from Elam would be among those in Jerusalem upon whom the Spirit of the Lord fell.</p>

It probably owed its named (which means “grove of trees”) to the many palm trees in the area and may have been located in a grove of sacred trees. Elath was strategically located along a primary trade route running from southern Arabia and Egypt to Phoenicia, making it a valuable city to possess.</p>
<p>Elath was taken by Kedorlaomer from the Horites (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5-6">Gn 14:5-6</a>).

From about 753 <span class="era">BC</span> onward, it remained an Edomite city until it was abandoned sometime between the sixth and fourth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. Then the Nabateans, who controlled the area, built a city a little farther east of the original site and renamed it Aila.</p>

  <title>Elder</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELDER</p>
<p class="fl">Person who, by virtue of position in the family, clan, or tribe; or by reason of personality, prowess, stature, or influence; or through a process of appointment and ordination, exercised leadership and judicial functions in both religious and secular spheres in the ancient world, both among biblical and nonbiblical peoples. The roots of the development of the presbytery (group of elders) in the NT and postapostolic church originate in Judaism and the OT, though the figure of the elder or groups of elders can also be found in the world surrounding ancient Israel and in the Greco-Roman world of the NT period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The elder, or the institution of elders, is closely linked with the tribal system. Tribes were composed of clans, and clans of large, extended family units. By virtue of age and function in a patriarchal society, the father of a family ruled. This fact of age, as well as the wisdom and maturity invested in older persons, is undoubtedly the origin of the authority that these elders exercised. A clan was ruled by the heads of the families constituting it, forming a council of elders. In time of war, each clan furnished a contingent; these were led by a chief, probably chosen from the ranks of the elders.</p>
<p>In Israel’s premonarchy period, local administration and judicial action was largely in the hands of those elders. In the exodus narrative, it was the elders of Israel (heads of families) who were instructed by Moses concerning the first Passover meal (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.21-22">Ex 12:21-22</a>). It was these elders who, in <a href="?bref=Exod.18.12">Exodus 18:12</a>, met with Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, and from whose ranks were chosen worthy representatives to assist Moses in the interpretation of the law of God and the administration of justice (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-23">18:13-23</a>). Similarly, according to <a href="?bref=Num.11.16-17">Numbers 11:16-17</a>, Moses was instructed by God to select 70 men from among the elders of Israel to assist him in leadership of the people. In this latter account, the elders were marked by a special endowment of God’s Spirit. In the former the elders—chosen as coadministrators with Moses—were those known to be trustworthy.</p>
<p>A central function of elders was the administration of justice. They were the “judges,” who sat “in the gate,” the traditional courtroom of ancient villages and towns. Here disputes and trials were settled by the elders, and community affairs were discussed and decisions made (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.10,18">Gn 23:10, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.29.7">Jb 29:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.24.7">Prv 24:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.31.23">31:23</a>). The preservation and application of the law was clearly in the hands of elders who sat at the gate of the town (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.12">Dt 19:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.19">21:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.15">22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.25.7-10">25:7-10</a>). <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.1-12">Ruth 4:1-12</a> provides an excellent description of such a process.</p>
<p>During the period of the monarchy, local administration and judicial authority continued to be invested in councils of elders. At the end of Saul’s reign, David sent messages and gifts to the elders of the towns of Judah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.26">1 Sm 30:26</a>), obviously recognizing that his efficient rule would depend on their goodwill and allegiance. In the time of Jehu (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.5">2 Kgs 10:5</a>), we hear of elders in Samaria, side by side with a governor and master of the palace. To facilitate her plot against Naboth, Jezebel wrote instructions to the elders and nobles of Jezreel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.8-11">1 Kgs 21:8-11</a>). Again, Josiah convened the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to hear the reading of the law and to enter with him into a new covenant of obedience (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.1">2 Kgs 23:1</a>). It is clear that the elders of Israel were now responsible for the application of the law within their jurisdictions. Besides administrative and judicial functions, elders also assumed cultic roles (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1,9">Ex 24:1, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.4.14-15">Lv 4:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>The institution of the elders survived the collapse of the royal institutions. Elders were present during the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">Ez 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.1">14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.1-3">20:1-3</a>) as well as after the return (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.16">Ezr 10:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="InJudaismoftheNewTestamentPeriod">In Judaism of the New Testament Period</p>
<p class="fl">While use of the title “elder” to designate officers of various Greek cult associations and village magistrates may have influenced the development of community structure in the gentile churches, the Christian office (or function) of elder stems from a very similar institution within Judaism. In the first three Gospels and in Acts there are numerous references to elders as functionaries within the communal and religious life of Judaism. Generally they are mentioned together with one or more other groups of functionaries (quoting the <span class="sc">rsv</span>): “elders and chief priests and scribes” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21">Mt 16:21</a>); “chief priests and elders of the people” (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.23">21:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.3,47">26:3, 47</a>); “scribes and elders” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.57">26:57</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.41">27:41</a>); “chief priests and elders” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.1,3,12,20">27:1, 3, 12, 20</a>); “rulers and elders and scribes” (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.5">Acts 4:5</a>); “rulers of the people and elders” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.4.8">8</a>). From these NT passages we cannot determine what exactly their functions were, or how they differed from rulers or scribes. However, the duties of Jewish elders are clearly described in the tractate <span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> in the Mishnah, as well as in the community rule books of the Qumran ascetics, discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p>Each Jewish community had its council of elders, who had general administrative oversight and represented the community in relations with Roman authorities. Their primary duty was judicial. They were custodians of the law and its traditional interpretations (see <a href="?bref=Matt.15.2">Mt 15:2</a>), and they were charged with both its enforcement and the punishment of offenders. The most important of these councils of elders was the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, a group of 71 men who acted as the final court for the entire nation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheChristianCommunity">In the Christian Community</p>
<p class="fl">Since the primitive church eventually regarded itself as the new Israel (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.43">Mt 21:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.16">Gal 6:16</a>), it is easy to see why it should gradually adopt the institution of elders. Though it is difficult to make out the order that prevailed in the first Christian communities, because it apparently varied according to place and time in both form and extent, the presence and functioning of elders was part of the reality of early church life.</p>
<p>In Luke’s account of the origin and spread of Christianity, the elders are already present in the church at Jerusalem. In Acts we see Christians at Antioch sending famine relief “to the elders [of the Judean churches] by Barnabas and Saul” (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a>). On their first missionary journey, Paul and Barnabas “appointed elders in every church” (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">14:23</a>). Later, Paul and Barnabas were sent from Antioch to Jerusalem “to the apostles and elders” about the question of circumcision of gentile Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.2">15:2</a>), and were “welcomed by the church, and the apostles, and the elders” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.4">4</a>), who gathered to hear the case and resolve the issue (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.6-23">6-23</a>).</p>
<p>Who these elders were, and how they were chosen, we are not told. It seems possible to argue, on the basis of Jewish precedent, that age and prominence gave them the privilege of rendering special service within the community. Veneration for age was a deeply rooted sentiment among Jews, and the name “presbyter” (elder) was derived from Jewish usage. It is also possible that, like the appointment of “the seven” for special service by the laying on of hands (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">6:1-6</a>), the first elders in the Jerusalem church were appointed by the apostles. Apparently they functioned in the Christian community in ways comparable to the elders in the Jewish communities and the Sanhedrin (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.2-6,22-23">15:2-6, 22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.4">16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.18">21:18</a>).</p>
<p>Paul apparently continued the practice among the gentile churches, though elders are not mentioned in the earliest Pauline writings. They are mentioned only in the Pastoral Epistles (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.17,19">1 Tm 5:17, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>). On his last journey to Jerusalem, Paul summoned the elders of the church at Ephesus to Miletus (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.17">Acts 20:17</a>) to bid them farewell, and to instruct them to be faithful in their task of overseeing and caring for the Christian flock, the church of God (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">20:28</a>).</p>
<p>Although elders are not explicitly mentioned in Paul’s early letters, they may have been among the leaders who presided over the congregations (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.8">Rom 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.12-13">1 Thes 5:12-13</a>). <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Philippians 1:1</a> certainly reveals a definite stratification of leadership (“overseers and deacons”) within a young Pauline congregation. And <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.17">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, reflecting what is often considered a later phase in the development of church government, attributes the functions of preaching and teaching to the ruling elders. Further, that Christian elders exercised pastoral functions may be inferred from <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1-5">1 Peter 5:1-5</a> and <a href="?bref=Jas.5.14">James 5:14</a>.</p>
<p>There is one passage where we find a possible identification of an apostle (Peter) as also being an elder: “I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1">1 Pt 5:1a</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This text may indicate that elders were appointed and functioned as extensions of apostolic servanthood. Paul’s practice of appointing elders in the churches before his departure may support such a suggestion. The fact that in the tradition of the later church the “elder” of 2 and 3 John was identified as the apostle John points in a similar direction. Though such an identification is implicit, the apostles could function as elders but not the other way around.</p>
<p>The elders had several functions. For example, <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.17">1 Timothy 5:17</a> speaks of elders as involved in preaching and teaching; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.14">James 5:14</a> sees them involved in a healing ministry; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.2">1 Peter 5:2</a> exhorts them to tend the flock. Thus, the prophets and teachers who led the church at Antioch (according to <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-3">Acts 13:1-3</a>) may well have been the elders of this community.</p>
<p>The diaconate, too, whose roots are to be seen in the selection of “the seven” for service to those in need (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-3">Acts 6:1-3</a>), was not restricted to purely external service. Two of these men, whom Luke introduces to us as deacons, appear at the same time as evangelists who were particularly effective as preachers of the Word, performers of miracles, expounders of the Scriptures (Stephen, <a href="?bref=Acts.6.8-10">Acts 6:8-10</a>; Philip, <a href="?bref=Acts.8.4-13,26-40">Acts 8:4-13, 26-40</a>).</p>
<p>Whereas in the later church bishops and elders were clearly distinguished, the NT reflects an early period when these offices were virtually synonymous. In Paul’s farewell speech at Miletus (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.1-38">Acts 20</a>), addressed specifically to the Ephesian church elders (v <a href="?bref=Acts.20.17">17</a>), he tells them that the Holy Spirit has made them “overseers, to care for the church of God” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">28</a>). Whether “overseer” is used here in the later technical sense of bishop or the more general sense of guardian is not clear. However, in <a href="?bref=Titus.1.5-7">Titus 1:5-7</a>, the elders of verse <a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">5</a> are clearly the same persons as the bishops of verse <a href="?bref=Titus.1.7">7</a>. Again, the bishops of <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Philippians 1:1</a> are likely to be understood as the elders appointed by Paul upon his leaving this mission station.</p>
<p>It is clear that church government in the NT period was still relatively fluid, but the seeds for the later structures were surely planted. The institution of the elders, on the basis of Jewish precedent, was central. The episcopate (overseers/bishops) probably emerged out of the presbyterian (elders), one elder being appointed as overseer by the entire council of elders.</p>

It was Eleazar’s function as Joshua’s counselor to inquire of the Lord (v <a href="?bref=Num.27.21">21</a>). He also had his share in the census taking at Shittim. He took part in the partitioning of Canaan, the east bank (<a href="?bref=Num.34.17">34:17</a>), and the west bank (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.1">Jos 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.4">17:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.51">19:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.1">21:1</a>).</p>

  <title>Elect, Election</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELECT, ELECTION</p>
<p class="fl">In modern English, terms referring to the selection of a leader or representative by a group of people. An element of choice is involved, since usually there are several candidates out of whom one must be chosen.</p>
<p>When the verb “elect” is used theologically in the Bible, it usually has God as its subject. In the OT it is used for God’s choice of Israel to be his people (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.13.17">Acts 13:17</a>). Israel became God’s people, not because they decided to belong to him, but because he took the initiative and chose them. Nor did God’s choice rest on any particular virtues that his people exemplified, but rather on his promise to their forefather Abraham (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.7-8">Dt 7:7-8</a>). God also chose their leaders, such as Saul and David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.24">1 Sm 10:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.21">2 Sm 6:21</a>), apart from any popular vote by the people. The word thus indicates God’s prerogative in deciding what shall happen, independent of human choice.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheMysteryOfElection"/>
<p>The same thoughts are found in the NT. God’s people are described as his “elect” or “chosen ones,” a term used by Jesus when speaking of the future time when the Son of Man will come and gather together God’s people (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.20,27">Mk 13:20, 27</a>). He will vindicate them for their sufferings and for their patience in waiting for his coming (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.7">Lk 18:7</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Peter 2:9</a>, God’s people are called a “chosen [elect] nation.” This phrase was originally used of the people of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.43.20">Is 43:20</a>), and it brings out the fact that the people of God in the OT and the Christian church in the NT stand in continuity with each other; the promises addressed to Israel now find fulfillment in the church.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">Romans 9–11</a> Paul discusses the problem of why the people of Israel as a nation have rejected the gospel, while the Gentiles have accepted it. He states that in the present time there is a “remnant” of Israel as a result of God’s gracious choice of them. This group is “the elect.” They are the chosen people who have obtained what was meant for Israel as a whole, while the greater mass of the people have failed to obtain it because they were “hardened” as a result of their sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.5-7">Rom 11:5-7</a>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, God’s choice of Israel to be his people has not been canceled. Most Jewish people have aligned themselves against the gospel, so that the Gentiles may come in and receive God’s blessings in their place; however, they still are loved by God, and God will not go back on his original calling of them (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.28">Rom 11:28</a>). Consequently, Paul is confident that in due time there will be a general return to God by the people of Israel.</p>
<p>The word translated “elect” is generally found in the plural and refers either to the members of God’s people as a whole or to those in a particular local church (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.33">Rom 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.4">1 Thes 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10">2 Tm 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.1">Ti 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1-2">1 Pt 1:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.10">2 Pt 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.14">Rv 17:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.16.13">Rom 16:13</a> and <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.13">2 Jn 1:13</a>, which have the singular form). The use of the plural may partly be explained by the fact that most of the NT letters are addressed to groups of people rather than to individuals. More probably, however, the point is that God’s election is concerned with the creation of a collective people rather than the calling of isolated individuals.</p>
<p>The word “election” emphasizes that membership of God’s people is due to God’s initiative, prior to all human response, made before time began (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.4">Eph 1:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.15.16,19">Jn 15:16, 19</a>). It is God who has called men and women to be his people, and those who respond are elect. God’s call does not depend on any virtues or merits of humankind. Indeed, he chooses the foolish things by worldly standards to shame the wise, the weak to confound the strong, and the lowly and insignificant to bring to nothing those who think that they are something (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.27-28">1 Cor 1:27-28</a>). The effect of election is to leave no grounds whatever for human boasting in achievement and position. Whatever the elect are, they owe it entirely to God, and they cannot boast or compare themselves with other people.</p>
<p>God’s elect are a privileged people. Since they now have God to uphold them, no one can bring any accusation against them that might lead to God’s condemnation (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.33">Rom 8:33</a>). They constitute a royal priesthood; they are God’s servants with the right of access to him (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>). It is for their sake that the apostles endured hardship and suffering, so that they might enjoy future salvation and eternal glory (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10">2 Tm 2:10</a>).</p>
<p>The elect are distinguished by their faith in God (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.1">Ti 1:1</a>), and they are called to show the character that befits God’s people (<a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>). They must make their calling and election sure; that is, they must show that they belong to God by the quality of their lives (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.10">2 Pt 1:10</a>). They must continue being faithful to the One who called them (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.14">Rv 17:14</a>).</p>
<p>The relationship between God’s call and human response is explained in <a href="?bref=Matt.22.14">Matthew 22:14</a>: “For many are called, but few are chosen.” Although God calls many through the gospel, only some of those respond to the call and become his elect people. The text sheds no light on the mystery of why only some become God’s people. Certainly, when a person does respond to God’s call, it is because the gospel comes to him or her “in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.4-5">1 Thes 1:4-5</a>). When men and women refuse the gospel, it is because they have become hardened as a result of sin and their trust in their own works. Scripture does not go beyond that point in explanation, and neither should Christians.</p>
<p>“Election” can also be used of God’s choice of people to serve him. Jesus chose the 12 disciples out of the larger company of those who followed him (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.13">Lk 6:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.2">Acts 1:2</a>). The same thought reappears in John’s Gospel; Jesus commented that although he chose the Twelve, one of them turned out to be a devil (<a href="?bref=John.6.70">Jn 6:70</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.18">13:18</a>). When a replacement was needed for Judas, the church prayed to Jesus and asked him to show them which of the two available candidates he would choose to fill the gap in the Twelve (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.24">Acts 1:24</a>). Peter attributes his evangelism among the Gentiles to God’s election of him for that purpose (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.7">15:7</a>). Similarly, Paul was an elected instrument for God’s mission to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.15">9:15</a>). The initiative in Christian mission rests with God, who elects people to serve him in particular ways.</p>

<p class="fl">Greeting found in <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.1">2 John 1:1</a>. The phrase has been interpreted two ways.</p>
<p>Some interpreters regard 2 John as addressed to a particular woman. Ancient Greek manuscripts show that the word <span class="greek">kuria</span> (translated as “lady” or “mistress”) was used by letter writers as a personal term for family members or close friends of either sex. Thus, the phrase could be translated, “to my dear friend, Eklete.” Some scholars associate the elect lady with Martha of Bethany (whose name in Aramaic also means “mistress”).</p>
<p>Other interpreters regard the phrase as signifying a local congregation. John possibly portrayed this Christian community as a mother, the members as her children, and other congregations as sisters (<a href="?bref=2Jn.1.13">2 Jn 1:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Pt 5:13</a>).

<p>Some scholars, thinking this a strange name for an altar, have suggested that the combination of names reflects later scribal emendations of the scriptural texts. They argue that the Septuagint corrects the difficulty by saying that Jacob had called “upon” the God of Israel.

  <title>Elemental Spirits*, Elements</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELEMENTAL SPIRITS*, ELEMENTS</p>
<p class="fl">Alternative translations of a Greek word used in the NT, “elemental spirits” being spiritual forces at work in the world, and “elements” being either the basic constituents of the physical world or of human life or the basic principles of a system of thought. In three passages the meaning is clear (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">Heb 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10,12">2 Pt 3:10, 12</a>). The other four passages, however, have caused considerable debate. The difficult phrase “the elements of the world” appears in three of the four passages (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.3">Gal 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.8,20">Col 2:8, 20</a>). The meanings of “elements” in the fourth passage (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.9">Gal 4:9</a>) is probably the same as in the other three because of its similar context.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RangeofMeanings">Range of Meanings</p>
<p class="fl">The principal meaning of the Greek word is “basic or fundamental component.” The word, however, occurs frequently in ancient Greek literature and takes on a variety of connotations in the different contexts in which it appears. Most frequently it was used literally to refer to the physical elements of the world: earth, air, water, and fire. This is probably the meaning of the term in <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.10-12">2 Peter 3:10-12</a>, which states that the world’s elements, the physical matter, will be destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>In antiquity the word also commonly referred to the letters in a word, notes in music, the “elementary” rules of politics, or the foundations or basic principles in science, art, or teaching (particularly logical propositions basic to the proof of other propositions). The last is clearly the meaning of the word in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">5:12</a>), which describes people’s need to have someone teach them the basic principles or elementary truths of God’s Word.</p>
<p>In the third century <span class="era">AD</span> another meaning of “elements”—elemental spiritual beings—became current. The development of this meaning has led to the current debate over its suitability in Paul’s context.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElementarySpirits">Elementary Spirits</p>
<p class="fl">A difficulty with Paul’s use of “elements” is that any of three possible meanings makes sense. One can understand “elements” to mean spiritual beings and view Paul’s reference as similar to his mention of the principalities and powers (e.g., in <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Eph 6:12</a>). Translating <a href="?bref=Gal.4.3">Galatians 4:3</a> according to this view (as in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>), Paul would have been saying that before conversion a person is enslaved to spiritual forces who rule this world. In <a href="?bref=Gal.4.9">4:9</a>, he asks how the Galatians could wish to be enslaved to these forces again. The references to “beings that by nature are no gods” (v <a href="?bref=Gal.4.8">8</a>) and to angels through whom the law was mediated (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.19">3:19</a>) are both used to substantiate the meaning “elemental spirits.”</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Colossians 2:8</a> would be warning Christians against being led away captive through the philosophical speculations and empty deceit that are perpetrated by human traditions and the elemental spirits. Only two verses later Paul declares that Christ is the head of every principality and power (<a href="?bref=Col.2.10">Col 2:10</a>). Many commentators now believe that Paul intended “principalities and powers” to refer to demons who temporarily ruled various spheres of life in the world. Paul announces that Christ has conquered them and displayed them publicly as captive in his triumphal procession (v <a href="?bref=Col.2.15">15</a>). Thus, <a href="?bref=Col.2.20">Colossians 2:20</a> might mean that Christians have “died” to those elemental spirits as elsewhere Paul wrote of “dying” to sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.2">Rom 6:2</a>).</p>
<p>However, despite the fact that Paul spoke of the principalities and powers as spiritual forces, and despite the ease with which this meaning fits Paul’s use of “elements of the world,” many scholars regard this interpretation as the least likely of the three possibilities. The earliest certain evidence for the use of “elements” to mean spirits is from the third century <span class="era">AD</span>, which is far too late to reflect common usage in Paul’s day. In addition, nowhere else did Paul speak of Christians being in bondage to angels or having died to demonic powers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElementaryPrinciples">Elementary Principles</p>
<p class="fl">Some scholars understand “the elements of the world” to refer to elementary religious teaching (as in <a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">Heb 5:12</a>). Paul may have been appealing to the “ABCs of religion,” perhaps the elementary character of the law (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.3.24">Gal 3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.1-4">4:1-4</a>) or pagan religious teaching (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.8">4:8</a>). The “weak and beggarly elements” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) may be explained by the fact that the Galatians were legalistically observing special days, months, seasons, and years as if their righteousness before God depended on it.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Colossians the elements of the world seem to be parallel to human traditions (<a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Col 2:8</a>). The problem again is the same as in Galatians, legalism (vv <a href="?bref=Col.2.16,20-23">16, 20-23</a>). In both contexts the bondage warned against is bondage to elementary religious thinking that comes merely from humans and would be equivalent to contrasting a kindergarten level of thought with the advanced teaching that comes in Christ. Some scholars believe that this interpretation has more in its favor than the meaning “elemental spirits,” but others argue that it is not precise enough.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElementaryExistence">Elementary Existence</p>
<p class="fl">By far, the most frequent use of “elements” in ancient literature is literal, referring to the physical elements of the world, which were usually considered to be earth, air, water, and fire. The third interpretation, which many scholars prefer, draws on this understanding of “elements of the world.” The meaning of the phrase “of the world” determines how the passages in question are to be interpreted. In the NT writings “world” was not merely physical. Frequently, “world” was viewed in an ethical sense, standing for human life apart from God or even lived in opposition to God and Christ. The world often represented unregenerate humanity with its culture, customs, worldview, and ethics—the part of creation that had not yet been redeemed and was helpless to save itself. Thus, the elements of the world, in this view, are the “basics” of a merely human existence. According to this interpretation, Paul warned the Colossian Christians against being led away captive by philosophical speculation and empty deceit that were in accord with human traditions and with the basics of a merely human existence and not in accord with what they had in Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Col 2:8</a>). They had died from the basics of a merely human life (v <a href="?bref=Col.2.20">20</a>), and being no longer bound to that level of existence, they possessed a life that came from Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>This interpretation still leaves the precise meaning of <a href="?bref=Gal.4.1-3">Galatians 4:1-3</a> uncertain. Was Paul addressing both Jews and Gentiles or only Jews (the “we” in <a href="?bref=Gal.4.3">Gal 4:3</a>)? No doubt Paul viewed both Jews and Gentiles as being in bondage to a merely human existence. Even though the Jews possessed God’s law, it was ineffectual for salvation. Christ’s coming broke that bondage and brought the Holy Spirit, who would give Christians a completely new quality of human life. Therefore, Paul warned against becoming enslaved again to such weak and poverty-stricken basics of a merely human existence (v <a href="?bref=Gal.4.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>In this view, then, the elements of the world are the “basics” of existence before and outside of Christ. Paul nowhere recorded specifically what he included in those basics. The contexts of both Galatians and Colossians, however, seem to imply that the basics at least included the law and “the flesh” (that is, life lived ethically apart from God). Such a view of “elements” accords well with the wider context of these passages and with other passages (especially <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-8.39">Rom 6–8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.2-3,23-25">Gal 3:2-3, 23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.1-10">4:1-10</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ELEPHANTINE PAPYRI*</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic documents from the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> discovered at Elephantine, an island in the Nile River. At the time of the documents’ writing, Elephantine was a Persian military outpost, manned in part by a group of Jewish mercenaries with their families. The documents, numbering over 100, belong primarily to three archives—two familial and one communal. The archives contained many complete scrolls that were still tied and sealed at the time of their discovery, along with numerous broken papyri and fragments.</p>
<p>The manuscripts are of considerable archaeological importance. Several centuries older than most of the Dead Sea Scrolls, they portray the social, political, and religious life of a Jewish community outside Palestine. Several points of contact are made with the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>
<p>Since most of the documents are legal texts, they are an important link in the history of law in the ancient Near East. The texts also provide valuable information about the Aramaic spoken in the period and illustrate the daily life of a Persian frontier military colony.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="ElephantineIslandOnTheNileRiver"/>
<p class="h2" id="AncientElephantine">Ancient Elephantine</p>
<p class="fl">Elephantine was located on the southern tip of a small island in the Nile River a few kilometers north of the first cataract, opposite its twin city, ancient Syene (modern Aswan). The Bible probably includes the twin cities of Elephantine and Syene in two occurrences of the phrase “from Migdol to Syene” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.10">Ez 29:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.6">30:6</a>), that is, from Egypt’s northern border to its southern border. The city’s name was an Aramaic version of an Egyptian name meaning “city of ivories” and was translated into Greek as <span class="ital">Elephantine.</span> Because of its strategic importance on Egypt’s southern boundary with Nubia, it was probably fortified as early as the third dynasty (27th century <span class="era">BC</span>) and figured repeatedly in Egypt’s military history.</p>
<p>Elephantine was also a major commercial center. Since the first cataract was just upstream from Elephantine/ Syene, the twin towns were the terminal ports for deep water navigation. Both towns had wharves and were fortified with garrisons to protect the trade in ivory, animal skins, spices, minerals, slaves, and food. Also a religious center, Elephantine was the temple city of Khnum, the Egyptian god of the cataract region, who presided over the flood cycles of the Nile.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DiscoveryofthePapyri">Discovery of the Papyri</p>
<p class="fl">Elephantine came into archaeological prominence with the discoveries of the papyri. The discoveries were made in three stages. The first group to be published (in 1906) had been gathered by purchases from antiquities dealers and was housed in the Cairo Museum. That first publication stimulated German and French excavations at Elephantine in the hope of discovering more papyri. The Berlin Museum was rewarded for its efforts with a second group of papyri, published in 1911. Ironically, a group of papyri discovered in the late 19th century was the last to be studied and published. American scholar C. E. Wilbour purchased papyri in 1893 from some Arab women at Aswan. In storage until Wilbour’s daughter bequeathed them to the Brooklyn Museum, they were finally published in 1953. Since 1912, other excavations have been mounted by the pontifical Biblical Institute of Rome and the Egyptian government, but no further papyri were found.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JewishColony">Jewish Colony</p>
<p class="fl">At the time the papyri were written, the Jews were already well established in Elephantine. The legal documents among the excavated papyri give a clear picture of life in the military colony at Elephantine. In addition to the Jewish mercenaries (“men of the regiment”), Jewish civilians (“men of the town”) were also present. The soldiers were organized into military units, which also appear to have had socioeconomic functions. Though subject to military discipline, the soldiers enjoyed considerable personal freedom. They led normal family lives, engaged in all types of commerce, and bequeathed their properties to their children. Marriage at Elephantine required the consent of the bride as well as the father, and could be dissolved by either party through a public declaration that he or she “hates” the other.</p>
<p>The Elephantine Jews worshiped in their own temple, which was dedicated to the Hebrew God, whom they called Yahu (a variation on Yahweh). Political and religious leaders at Elephantine were in correspondence with officials in Jerusalem and Samaria.</p>
<p>There is no conclusive evidence regarding when the Jewish presence at Elephantine began. Jews could have entered Egypt on any of several occasions from the eighth to the early sixth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. One document from Elephantine claims that the Jewish temple there was built during a period of native Egyptian rule before the Persian conquest under Cambyses (reigned 529–522 <span class="era">BC</span>). That would give a date for the construction of the Elephantine temple by the mid-sixth century at the latest.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElephantineJudaism">Elephantine Judaism</p>
<p class="fl">In spite of the law of a single sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-11">Dt 12:1-11</a>), and in spite of the recent reforms of kings Hezekiah and Josiah in the seventh and eighth centuries <span class="era">BC</span> that centralized worship in Jerusalem, the Elephantine Jews seem to have felt no wrong in having a temple in Egypt. Neither the German, French, Italian, nor Egyptian excavations located the Jewish temple, but the documents record that the temple was oriented toward Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Elephantine Jews may have recognized Jerusalem’s primacy in religious affairs. When the temple at Elephantine was destroyed by priests of the Khnum temple in 410 <span class="era">BC</span>, an appeal was sent to Johanan the high priest (cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.12.22">Neh 12:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.28">13:28</a>) and Bagoas the governor of Judah, seeking their permission and influence for its restoration. The appeal produced no response, perhaps because of the Jerusalem leadership’s disapproval of the temple in Egypt. A second appeal, sent three years later to Bagoas, governor of Judah, and to Delaiah and Shelemiah, sons of Sanballat, governor of Samaria, produced an oral reply, recorded in a memorandum. The reply ordered the temple’s rebuilding and the resumption of meal and incense offerings. Permission to reinstitute the burnt offering, however, was not given, perhaps as a concession to Egyptian or Persian religious convictions. A deed for a piece of property, dated 402 <span class="era">BC</span>, mentions the temple of Yahu, implying that it was in fact rebuilt.</p>
<p>The Elephantine Jews probably brought with them to Egypt the popular religion that was so strongly denounced by the prophets before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple. God was central in their faith, but they also worshiped other gods, even if only in a subsidiary fashion. Evidence of departure from orthodox worship of God comes from a list of offerings that mentions two Aramean deities, Eshembethel and Anathbethel. Oaths at Elephantine were sworn almost exclusively in the name of Yahu, but they were also sworn occasionally in the names of an Egyptian goddess, Sati, and another Aramean deity, Herembethel. Salutations in letters invoked the blessings of a variety of deities. Moreover, intermarriage with surrounding peoples, forbidden in the OT because it would lead to religious apostasy (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.11-16">Ex 34:11-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-5">Dt 7:1-5</a>), had become a common practice at Elephantine. It was a contemporary problem in Israel as well under Ezra and Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1-10.44">Ezr 9:1–10:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-28">Neh 13:23-28</a>). Children of mixed marriages in Elephantine often had Egyptian names.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the archives also show that the Elephantine Jews continued to observe the Jewish feasts. An order from King Darius II in 419 <span class="era">BC</span> commanded the Jews at Elephantine to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The text, broken immediately before this reference, presumably also contained instructions to observe the Passover. Four ostraca (potsherds) also refer to the Sabbath but provide few clues regarding Sabbath observance at Elephantine.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LanguageofthePapyri">Language of the Papyri</p>
<p class="fl">Except for slight differences, the Aramaic of the Elephantine papyri is the same as biblical Aramaic. Both are a part of a dialect known as Imperial Aramaic, the international and commercial language of the Persian Empire. The personal names continued to be Hebrew, but there is no direct evidence that Hebrew was used by the community. Aramaic was the daily language, and there is no suggestion of controversy over whether or not Hebrew should be used in Jewish homes, as was the case with Nehemiah in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-25">Neh 13:23-25</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Priest in the sanctuary of the Lord at Shiloh in the period of the judges (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3,9">1 Sm 1:3, 9</a>). Shiloh, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north of Jerusalem, was the central shrine of the Israelite tribal confederation. Eli had two sons who were priests, Hophni and Phinehas (which are Egyptian names). No lineage is recorded for Eli, but there are two possible suggestions: he is a descendant of Ithamar, Aaron’s younger son (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.20">1 Sm 22:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.27">1 Kgs 2:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.3">1 Chr 24:3</a>); or he comes from the house of Eleazar (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23-25">Ex 6:23-25</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.2-3">2 Esd 1:2-3</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-28">1 Samuel 1</a>, Eli blessed the childless Hannah, Elkanah’s wife, after learning of her prayer for a son. Subsequently, Samuel was born, and when he was weaned, he was brought by his mother to Eli for service and training in the sanctuary, according to her promise to the Lord.</p>
<p>Hophni and Phinehas were corrupting the Israelites despite Eli’s protests, and for this sin God promised judgment upon Eli’s family (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.27,36">1 Sm 2:27, 36</a>). The sons of Eli were to die on the same day (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.34">34</a>), and the fulfillment came in a battle with the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.11,17">4:11, 17</a>). Eli, too, died when he heard of the defeat and the loss of the ark of the covenant to the Philistines. At his death he was 98 years old, and besides being priest, he also had judged Israel for 40 years (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.15-18">15-18</a>).

  <title>Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?*</p>
<p class="fl">One of Jesus’ cries from the cross, properly translated “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (The <span class="sc">nlt</span> uses an alternate spelling, “lema,” for the third word in the expression.) This form of the “cry of dereliction” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Mt 27:46</a>) is slightly different from its other recorded form, “Eloi, eloi, lama sabachthani?” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.34">Mk 15:34</a>). Both versions are adaptations of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1">Psalm 22:1</a> in the Aramaic, the common language of first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Palestine. The only difference in the two accounts is that Mark’s version is completely Aramaic, whereas Matthew retains the Hebrew word for God (which was not uncommon for Aramaic-speaking Jews). The fact that some of Jesus’ hearers thought he was calling Elijah indicates that Matthew’s version is probably the original. Elias (Elijah) could have been confused with “Eli” more easily than with “Eloi” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.47">Mt 27:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.35">Mk 15:35</a>).</p>
<p>The textual variants that exist suggest the difficulties copyists and interpreters have had with Jesus’ words. After meditating on the passage, Martin Luther exclaimed, “God forsaken of God! Who can understand it?” Luther’s statement of the major theological problem, that Jesus was forsaken by God, is not the only possible understanding of the text. Debate has focused on two questions: whether in fact abandonment by God was expressed by Jesus’ use of the psalmist’s words, and why the onlookers spoke of Elijah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MeaningoftheCry">Meaning of the Cry</p>
<p class="fl">At one extreme, many have been struck by the starkness of Jesus’ words. Some have even seen in them a realization on the cross that he had failed and that all hope was lost for the coming of God’s kingdom. From that perspective Jesus’ words were a cry of despair over a lost cause. However, such a view hardly fits the rest of the NT presentation of Jesus.</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme, some interpret the words as neither stark nor negative in any sense. They view the cry as an affirmation of Jesus’ faith in committing himself to God (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.46">Lk 23:46</a>). To such interpreters, the fact that Jesus began his question with “My God, my God” and used a biblical quotation indicates religious reverence and continued faith. In Jewish practice sometimes the first line of a psalm or song would be quoted to refer to the whole work. Hence Jesus might have been quoting <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1">Psalm 22:1</a> as a way of referring to the whole psalm. <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a> is clearly the lament of a righteous sufferer. Psalms of lament always expressed a prayer of confidence in God and praise to God as well as a prayer for help from God. Thus, from a certain point of view, the cry from the cross can be seen as a confident prayer.</p>
<p>Many biblical scholars find the second view as unconvincing as the first. The Gospel writers did not clarify the meaning of the cry. Yet if the words were an expression of confidence or praise, some indication would be expected in the text. As they stand, the words are hardly an expression of religious reverence. The words themselves and the fact they were expressed in a loud cry do not suggest a prayer of confidence or praise.</p>
<p>Another approach views the words as expressing Jesus’ feeling of isolation in a moment of extreme anguish but rejects the notion that he was actually forsaken by God.</p>
<p>But the interpretation that has become “traditional” is that Jesus <span class="ital">was</span> forsaken by God. In that view the context of the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.36-46">Mt 26:36-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32-42">Mk 14:32-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.39-46">Lk 22:39-46</a>) indicates the kind of conflict expressed in Jesus’ cry on the cross. Jesus’ identification with sinners was so real that taking on their sin broke the closeness of his communion with the Father. Thus, Jesus’ abandonment by God is seen as an important aspect of the atonement. Although stressing that Jesus was actually forsaken, the traditional view goes on to stress that the unity of the Trinity remained unbroken.</p>
<p>The explanation of such a paradox is not easy. Some view it as a divine mystery and make no attempt to explain it at all. Others attempt to make some kind of distinction between what happened on the cross and the reality of God’s being. For example, in the early centuries of the church the view was expressed that only Jesus’ humanity was affected by the separation, so that his deity remained intact with God. Others argue that Jesus was separated from the Father “functionally” in the work of salvation but not “really” with respect to his existence.</p>
<p>The refusal of the Gospel writers to explain Jesus’ cry should make scholars hesitate to give precise or dogmatic explanations. At the least, one can confidently state that (1) the cry reflects the reality of Jesus’ humanity in the face of death, (2) the particular kind of death (“even death on a cross,” <a href="?bref=Phil.2.8">Phil 2:8</a>) was especially scandalous, and (3) Christ’s identification with sinners was a horribly painful experience. Thus, although the cry is somehow related to the Atonement, the biblical texts do not discuss whether Jesus was absolutely abandoned. Further, they do not explain how God could recoil from sin at the same time that “in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>). In doing justice to the depth of emotion expressed in the cry, one should be cautious not to force the text to say something the author did not intend.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElijahandtheCry">Elijah and the Cry</p>
<p class="fl">Various possibilities of connections between the cry and Elijah have been offered. If the cry refers to the whole of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a>, mention of Elijah by the bystanders would show that they understood Jesus’ words as expressing confidence in salvation. A salvation mediated by Elijah would have seemed natural to the Jews, who often saw Elijah as a deliverer of the righteous oppressed. Others claim that the bystanders were willfully and maliciously distorting Jesus’ words in order to mock him. Still others view the mention of Elijah as an honest misunderstanding because of the similarity of the words. The view that one adopts will depend to some extent on how Jesus’ cry is understood.</p>

  <title>Elijah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELIJAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Ninth-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophet of Israel. Elijah’s name means “my God is the Lord”—appropriate for a stalwart opponent of Baal worship. The Scriptures give no information regarding his family background except that he was a Tishbite who probably came from the land of Gilead on the east bank of the Jordan River. He lived primarily during the reigns of kings Ahab (874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Ahaziah (853–852 <span class="era">BC</span>) of Israel. The biblical account of Elijah runs from <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-24">1 Kings 17</a> to <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1-25">2 Kings 2</a>.</p>
<p class="list-text">Elijah was called by God at a critical period in Israel’s life. Economically and politically the northern kingdom was in its strongest position since its separation from the southern kingdom. Omri (885–874 <span class="era">BC</span>) had initiated a policy of trade and friendly relations with the Phoenicians. To show his good faith, Omri gave his son Ahab in marriage to Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre. She brought Baal worship with her to Israel, a false religion whose rapid spread soon threatened the kingdom’s very existence. Elijah was sent to turn the nation and its leaders back to the Lord through his prophetic message and miracles.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WarningofDrought">Warning of Drought</p>
<p class="fl">Elijah began his recorded ministry by telling Ahab that the nation would suffer a drought until the prophet himself announced its end (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>). He thus repeated Moses’ warning (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.14-39">Lv 26:14-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">Dt 28:15-68</a>) of the consequences of turning away from God.</p>
<p class="list-text">Elijah then hid himself in a ravine on the east bank of the Jordan River by the brook Cherith (possibly the valley of the Yarmuk River in north Gilead). There he had sufficient water for his needs, and ravens brought him food twice daily. When the brook dried up, Elijah was directed to move to the Phoenician village of Zarephath near Sidon. A widow took care of him from her scanty supplies, and her obedience to Elijah was rewarded by a miraculous supply of meal and oil that was not depleted until the drought ended.</p>
<p class="list-text">While Elijah was staying with the widow, her son became ill and died. By the power of prayer, the child was restored to life and good health.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the drought’s third year the Lord told Elijah to inform Ahab that God would soon provide rain for Israel. On his return, Elijah first encountered Ahab’s officer, Obadiah, who was searching for water for the king’s livestock. Elijah sent Obadiah to arrange a meeting with Ahab. At first Obadiah refused. For three years Ahab had searched Israel and the neighboring kingdoms in vain for the prophet, no doubt in order to force him to end the drought. Obadiah was certain that while he went to bring Ahab, Israel’s most wanted “outlaw” would elude them again, thus enraging the king. When Elijah promised him that he would stay until he returned, the officer arranged for Ahab to meet the prophet.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the subsequent meeting Elijah rejected the king’s allegation that he was the “troubler of Israel” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.17-18">1 Kgs 18:17-18</a>). He was only obeying God, he insisted, in pointing out Ahab’s idolatry. Ahab had even permitted Jezebel to subsidize a school of Baal and Asherah prophets. Elijah then requested a public gathering on Mt Carmel as a contest between the prophets of Baal and the prophets of the Lord to determine who was the true God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ConfrontationonCarmel">Confrontation on Carmel</p>
<p class="fl">One of the highlights of Elijah’s ministry was the contest on Mt Carmel. Ahab assembled all Israel along with 850 prophets of Baal and Asherah. The famous challenge was issued: “How long are you going to waver between two opinions? If the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is God, follow him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.21">1 Kgs 18:21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Sacrificial animals were to be placed on two altars, one for Baal and one for the Lord, and the prophets representing each were to ask for fire from their God.</p>
<p class="list-text">All day long the pagan prophets called in vain on Baal. They danced a whirling, frenzied dance, cutting themselves with knives until their blood gushed. But there was no answer. Finally, Elijah’s turn came. He repaired the demolished altar of the Lord and prepared the sacrifice. For dramatic effect, he built a trench around the altar and poured water over the sacrifice until the trench overflowed. Then he said a brief prayer, and immediately fire fell from heaven and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.38">1 Kgs 18:38</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When the people saw it, they fell on their faces in repentance, chanting, “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is God! The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is God!” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.39">1 Kgs 18:39</a>). At Elijah’s command the people seized the prophets of Baal and killed them by the brook Kishon. Then Elijah, at the top of Carmel, began to pray fervently for rain. Dramatically, the sky became black with clouds and rain began to pour, ending the long drought. Ahab rode back in his chariot to Jezreel, 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) to the east. God’s Spirit enabled Elijah to outrun Ahab, and he arrived in Jezreel first.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jezebel, furious over the massacre of the Baal prophets, sent a message to Elijah: “May the gods also kill me if by this time tomorrow I have failed to take your life like those whom you killed” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.2">1 Kgs 19:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). When Elijah received her message, he panicked and fled to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ExperienceatHoreb">Experience at Horeb</p>
<p class="fl">Elijah left his servant in Beersheba, going another day’s journey into the desert alone. There he lay down under a broom tree and, in despair and exhaustion, asked God to take his life. Instead, an angel appeared, nourishing him twice with bread and water. After he had slept, Elijah continued on his way.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="ElijahFleesfromJezebel"/>
<p class="list-text">After 40 days, Elijah arrived at Mt Horeb, where he found shelter in a cave. There the Lord spoke to him, asking what he was doing there. The prophet explained that he was the only prophet of God left in Israel, and now even his life was threatened. In response, the mighty forces of nature—a great wind, an earthquake, and fire—were displayed before Elijah to show him that the omnipotent God could intercede on his behalf with a powerful hand. Finally God encouraged Elijah in a “still, small voice.” The Lord had further tasks for him to accomplish. God also told Elijah that he was not the only faithful person in Israel; 7,000 others remained true to the Lord.</p>
<p class="list-text">Since Elijah had faithfully delivered God’s message to Ahab, the Lord commissioned him to deliver another message, one of judgment on Israel’s continuing failure to listen to God. The instruments of retribution were to be Hazael, who would become king in Syria (c. 893–796 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Jehu, who would become king of Israel (841–814 <span class="era">BC</span>). Elijah was instructed to anoint both of them. He was also told to anoint his successor, Elisha, to be his understudy until it was time for Elisha’s full ministry to begin.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ConfrontationconcerningNaboth">Confrontation concerning Naboth</p>
<p class="fl">After his return to Israel, one of Elijah’s boldest confrontations with King Ahab was over Naboth’s vineyard. Although Ahab wanted Naboth’s property, he was sensitive to the law regarding ownership of land. Further, Ahab never completely abandoned the faith of his fathers (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.27-29">1 Kgs 21:27-29</a>). Jezebel, however, had no regard for the Mosaic law and conspired to have Naboth put to death on a false charge.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Ahab then took possession of the vineyard, Elijah branded him as a murderer and a robber. He predicted divine judgment—the fall of Ahab’s dynasty and Jezebel’s horrible death (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.17-24">1 Kgs 21:17-24</a>). Ahab repented, however, and the judgment was postponed.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AhaziahsFolly">Ahaziah’s Folly</p>
<p class="fl">The Lord’s judgment on Ahab was finally executed when the king was killed in a battle with Syria in 853 <span class="era">BC</span>. The dogs licked up Ahab’s blood, as the prophet had predicted (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.19">1 Kgs 21:19</a>). Shortly after Ahaziah had succeeded his father as king, he suffered a crippling fall. While lying ill, he sent messengers to ask Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether he would recover. The Lord sent Elijah to intercept them and give them a message for the king: a rebuke for ignoring the God of Israel and a warning of the king’s impending death.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ahaziah angrily sent a captain with 50 soldiers to arrest Elijah. They were consumed by fire from heaven at Elijah’s words. A second captain and another 50 soldiers were sent but met the same fate. The third captain who came begged the prophet to spare his and his soldiers’ lives. Elijah went with this captain and delivered God’s message to the king personally. The king would not recover but would die because he had inquired from pagan gods rather than from the true God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WarningtoJehoram">Warning to Jehoram</p>
<p class="fl">Elijah had been called primarily to minister to Israel, but he also delivered God’s word of warning to Jehoram, king of Judah, rebuking him for following Israel in its idolatry and for not walking in the godly ways of his father and grandfather (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.12-15">2 Chr 21:12-15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElijahsAscentintoHeaven">Elijah’s Ascent into Heaven</p>
<p class="fl">When the end of Elijah’s ministry drew near, Elisha refused to leave him. After a journey that took them to schools of the prophets at Bethel and Jericho, the two crossed the Jordan River miraculously; Elijah struck the waters with his mantle and they parted. Elisha requested a double portion (the firstborn’s share, cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>) of his master’s spirit, for he desired to be Elijah’s full successor. Elisha knew his request was granted because he saw Elijah pass into the heavens in a whirlwind bearing a chariot and horses of fire. The young prophets who had accompanied Elisha searched in vain for Elijah in the mountains and valleys around the Jordan; God had taken his faithful prophet home. Elijah thus joined Enoch as the only other man in the Bible who did not experience death.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElijahsMessageandMiracles">Elijah’s Message and Miracles</p>
<p class="fl">As the Baal worship of Tyre made inroads into Israel through Jezebel, Elijah was sent to check its spread by emphasizing again that Israel’s God was the only God of the whole earth. He began a vital work that was continued by Jehu, who slaughtered many of the Baal worshipers among Israel’s leaders (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.18-28">2 Kgs 10:18-28</a>). Elijah’s specific mission was to destroy heathen worship in order to spare Israel, thus preparing the way for the prophets who were to follow in his spirit.</p>
<p class="list-text">Miracles were prominent in Elijah’s ministry, given as a sign to confirm him as God’s spokesman and to turn Israel’s kings back to God. Some scholars have rejected these miracles or tried to explain them away. The OT, however, clearly testifies to their validity, and the NT affirms them.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ElijahandtheNewTestament">Elijah and the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Malachi named Elijah as the forerunner of the “great and terrible day of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” who will “turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers” (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.5-6">Mal 4:5-6</a>). Jewish writers have often taken up the same theme in their literature: Elijah will “restore the tribes of Jacob” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.48.10">Ecclus 48:10</a>); he is mentioned in the Qumran <span class="ital">Manual of Discipline</span> of the Dead Sea Scrolls; he is the central sign of the resurrection of the dead according to the Mishnah, the collection of Jewish oral law; and he is the subject of songs sung at the close of the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the NT, Malachi’s prophecy was interpreted in the angelic annunciation to Zechariah as pointing to John the Baptist, who was to do the work of another Elijah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.17">Lk 1:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Elias”) and was confirmed by Jesus himself (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.14">Mt 11:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.10-13">17:10-13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jesus also alluded to Elijah’s sojourn in the land of Sidon (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.25-26">Lk 4:25-26</a>), and the apostle Paul referred to the prophet’s experience at Mt Horeb (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.2">Rom 11:2</a>). The apostle James used Elijah to illustrate what it means to be a righteous man and a man of prayer (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.17">Jas 5:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Elijah appeared again on the Mt of Transfiguration with Moses as they discussed Jesus’ approaching death (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-13">Mt 17:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-36">Lk 9:28-36</a>). Some Bible scholars believe that Elijah will return as one of the two witnesses of the end times (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.3-12">Rv 11:3-12</a>), in fulfillment of Malachi’s prophecy that he is to come before the dreadful judgment day of God.</p>

From this union came a great-grandson, David, and the royal line in which the Messiah would eventually be born. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=RuthBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Ruth, Book of</a>.</p>

  <title>Elisha</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELISHA</p>
<p class="fl">Prophet in Israel during the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2">Background and Call</p>
<p class="fl">Elisha is first mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16">1 Kings 19:16</a>, where he is described as the son of Shaphat, who lived at Abel-meholah. That place has been tentatively identified with the modern Tel Abu Sifri, west of the river Jordan, though many scholars place it to the river’s east. The prophet Elijah had been ordered by God to anoint Elisha as his successor, but the narrative does not make it clear whether Elisha was already one of Elijah’s disciples. When the two met, Elisha was busy plowing a field, and he does not seem to have greeted Elijah with the respect that a disciple would normally show to his teacher.</p>
<p>Elisha’s use of 12 yokes of oxen in his agricultural work has been taken as a sign that he was wealthy, for normally two yoked oxen would be handled by one person. When Elijah passed by and placed his cloak on Elisha’s shoulder, the latter man knew it was a sign that he should inherit the great prophet’s mission. The nation needed a prophet, for it was increasingly indulging in Canaanite idolatry with the encouragement of King Ahab and his Phoenician wife, Jezebel.</p>
<p>After Elijah commissioned him symbolically and strode away, Elisha hurried after the prophet to request a brief interval of time to announce his new vocation to his parents before leaving home. The prophet’s reply, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.20">1 Kgs 19:20</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), helped Elisha to make up his mind immediately. Delay in implementing his vocation would almost certainly have been fatal for Elisha (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.8.21-22">Mt 8:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.61-62">Lk 9:61-62</a>).</p>
<p>To mark the change in his way of life, Elisha made a great feast for his neighbors, roasting two oxen. This is another hint that he came from a wealthy family. From that time, he was no longer a farmer; by associating with Elijah, he began to prepare for his own ministry. There is no record of Elisha being anointed to the prophetic office, but the transfer of prophetic authority by means of the cloak would leave no doubt in anyone’s mind that Elisha was the next official prophet in Israel.</p>
<p class="h2">“Sons of the Prophets”</p>
<p class="fl">That there could have been some question of Elisha’s authority is implied by the existence of groups of people known as “sons of the prophets.” The phrase meant that those persons were heirs of the prophetic teachings and traditions, though apparently none of them was a major prophet. The prophet Amos even denied any connection with such groups, which seem to have died out in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.14">Am 7:14</a>). In the time of Elisha, the “sons of the prophets” were located in Gilgal, Bethel, and Jericho, and seem to have exercised a primarily local ministry. They may have gone out under the instructions of Elijah and Elisha to teach people God’s law and to pronounce divine revelations, as in the days of Saul (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5,10">1 Sm 10:5, 10</a>).</p>
<p>Just before Elijah was taken to heaven, he and Elisha visited such prophetic groups, and Elijah tried in vain to persuade Elisha to stay behind at Gilgal and at Bethel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1-4">2 Kgs 2:1-4</a>). The prophetic group at Bethel may have been warned by God that Elijah would be taken from them, for they questioned Elisha about the matter and ascertained that he also was aware of the situation.</p>
<p class="h2">Successor to Elijah</p>
<p class="fl">After miraculously parting the waters of Jordan, Elijah asked his successor what he might do for him (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.9">2 Kgs 2:9</a>). Elisha requested a “double share” of his spirit as they parted, the share of an inheritance normally given to a firstborn son (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>). His request was granted when Elisha saw his master taken up to heaven in a fiery chariot, and it took immediate effect when Elisha parted the Jordan’s waters and crossed over (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.14">2 Kgs 2:14</a>).</p>
<p>His prophetic authority now recognized, Elisha began his ministry to Israel at approximately the end of King Ahab’s reign (c. 853 <span class="era">BC</span>). His work lasted for half a century, and in contrast with the harried, austere, and sometimes dramatic ministry of Elijah, the activities of Elisha were mostly quieter and took place among the ordinary people of Israel. But he also addressed the royal court, though not in conflicts with Canaanite priests, such as Elijah had experienced.</p>
<p class="h2">Miracles</p>
<p class="fl">The miraculous element was prominent in Elisha’s ministry. When the people of Jericho reported that the local springwater was brackish, Elisha purified it (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.19-22">2 Kgs 2:19-22</a>). To this day, it is the only significant freshwater spring in the area (Tell es-Sultan).</p>
<p>As the prophet left for Bethel, he encountered a group of youths who mocked his baldness (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.23-24">2 Kgs 2:23-24</a>). He cursed them in the name of the Lord, and two bears came from the woods and mauled the offenders. What at first sight seems to be an immoral act on God’s part was actually full of foreboding for the nation. The youths at Bethel were a generation of Israelites who had so absorbed the immoral, pagan culture of their city that they rejected both the person and the message of God’s prophets. They were not merely irreligious but also unbelievably discourteous, according to ancient Near Eastern standards, in ridiculing a bald man instead of respecting his seniority.</p>
<p>The curses Elisha pronounced “in the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” were not his own reactions to the treatment he had received, but instead were covenant curses (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">Dt 28:15-68</a>) that would come upon all who rejected the Sinaitic laws and went back on their promises to God (see <a href="?bref=Exod.24.3-8">Ex 24:3-8</a>). The two bears were also symbolic of Assyria and Babylonia, which would tear apart the nation at different times. One small incident was thus a somber forecast of what the future held for a wicked and disobedient people.</p>
<p>In one of his contacts with royalty Elisha gave a message (although unwillingly) from God to King Jehoram of Israel (853–841 <span class="era">BC</span>). The king had allied with King Jehoshaphat of Judah (872–848 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the Edomite ruler against Mesha, king of Moab. The allied forces were deep in Edomite territory when they ran out of water, and in despair they turned to Elisha, the local prophet. He refused to say anything at first, but finally predicted ample supplies of water and victory for the coalition. Both occurred on the following day (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.1-27">2 Kgs 3:1-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Miracles of Charity</p>
<p class="fl">The kind of work for which Elisha was justly renowned was usually performed for people who could not help themselves. Such a person was a poor widow who had almost pledged her two children to a creditor. Her only asset was a jar of oil. Elisha instructed her to borrow empty jars from her neighbors and fill them with the oil from her own jar. In a miraculous manner every jar was filled. Elisha then told her to sell the oil, pay her debts, and use the balance of the money for living expenses (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1-7">2 Kgs 4:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>A similar act of charity was performed for a Shunammite woman, who had persuaded her husband to provide a room where the prophet could stay when in the area. In return for her kindness Elisha predicted that the woman, previously childless, would have her own son. About a year later it happened (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.8-17">2 Kgs 4:8-17</a>). The boy later contracted a severe ailment, perhaps meningitis, and died suddenly. His mother laid the body on Elisha’s bed while she hurried to Mt Carmel to seek the prophet. Elisha was apparently unaware of the situation until the distraught mother informed him of the boy’s death. As an emergency measure Elisha dispatched his servant Gehazi to put the prophet’s staff on the child’s face. That did not revive the child, but when Elisha arrived and lay down on the body, the boy was healed and returned to his parents (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.18-37">18-37</a>).</p>
<p>Another beneficial incident was the correction of a potentially disastrous situation. When some poisonous gourds were accidentally cooked and served, Elisha rendered the mixture harmless by adding meal to the contents of the cooking pot (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38-41">2 Kgs 4:38-41</a>). A miracle similar to Christ’s multiplying of the bread loaves (see <a href="?bref=Matt.14.16-21">Mt 14:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.32-38">15:32-38</a>) occurred when someone brought the prophet several loaves of bread and fresh ears of corn. Elisha instructed his servant to set the food out for 100 people, and when that was done, the people ate and had food left (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.42-44">2 Kgs 4:42-44</a>).</p>
<p>The healing of Naaman, a Syrian commander, came through the influence of a Hebrew maid in the man’s household, who persuaded Naaman’s wife that Elisha could heal her husband. The Assyrian king sent his general to the Israelite ruler with instructions for Naaman to be healed. The afflicted man was sent to Elisha, who ordered him to wash in the Jordan River. Reluctant at first, Naaman finally obeyed and was cured of his affliction. In gratitude the Syrian leader acknowledged the power of Israel’s God (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.1-19">2 Kgs 5:1-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Encounters with Royalty</p>
<p class="fl">When Syria attacked Israel, Elisha revealed the movements of the Syrians to the Israelite king. Syrians tried to capture the prophet at Dothan, but God blinded them and Elisha led them to the Israelite capital of Samaria. Their sight returned, and Elisha advised the Israelite king to spare the captives, feed them well, and send them home. Because their evil was rewarded with good, the Syrians did not attack Israel for a while (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.8-23">2 Kgs 6:8-23</a>).</p>
<p>When the Syrian king Ben-hadad besieged Samaria years later, famine conditions there became so severe that the king threatened to execute Elisha. In response, the prophet promised an abundance of food the following day. The Syrians fled from their camp for some unspecified reason, and the prophecy was fulfilled (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.24-7.20">2 Kgs 6:24–7:20</a>). In an unusual encounter with the ailing king of Syria, Elisha was visited by Hazael, servant of Ben-hadad, who had been sent to ask about the prospects for his master’s improvement. Elisha sent back a reassuring reply, but at the same time said that Hazael would shortly succeed Ben-hadad (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.7-13">8:7-13</a>). On another occasion Elisha sent a prophet to Ramoth-gilead to anoint Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, as king of Israel to replace Joram, whom Jehu proceeded to kill in battle (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-28">9:1-28</a>).</p>
<p>Elisha’s final contact with Israelite rulers came at the time of his own death, when Joash the king visited him to lament the prophet’s illness. On that occasion, by the symbolic handling of arrows, the dying prophet promised Joash that he would defeat the Syrians in battle but would not exterminate them (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.14-19">2 Kgs 13:14-19</a>).</p>
<p>The prophet also intervened a second time on behalf of the Shunammite woman whose son he had healed, instructing her to move her household into Philistine territory during a seven-year famine in Israel. When she came back, her house and property had apparently been occupied by others, so she appealed to the king for help in recovering it. Elisha’s servant Gehazi told the ruler about her, and on interviewing her himself, the king ordered all her property to be returned (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.1-6">2 Kgs 8:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2">Continuing Influence</p>
<p class="fl">Elisha’s final miracle occurred after his death, when a corpse that was tossed hurriedly into the prophet’s tomb came abruptly to life (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.21">2 Kgs 13:21</a>). Jesus mentioned Elisha once in connection with the healing of Naaman; Jesus declared that God’s mercy was not restricted to the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.27">Lk 4:27</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ELIZABETH</p>
<p class="fl">Woman of priestly descent (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Lk 1:5</a>) and mother of John the Baptist, she was a relative of Mary, mother of Jesus (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.36">36</a>). The name Elizabeth, which derives from the same Hebrew word as Elisheba, wife of Aaron (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.23">Ex 6:23</a>), means “my God is an oath.” Only Luke’s Gospel, which characteristically focuses greater attention upon the role of women, mentions Elizabeth and her husband, Zechariah.</p>
<p>Luke emphasized Elizabeth and Zechariah’s godly character and blameless conduct (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.6">Lk 1:6</a>) before stating that the elderly couple had not been favored with children. Although in Jewish culture childlessness was regarded as a reproach (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.22-23">Gn 30:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.25">Lk 1:25</a>), the devout pair continued to steadfastly worship and serve God. Unexpectedly, an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah with the announcement that Elizabeth would conceive and bear a son, who would be the forerunner of the promised Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.13-17">Lk 1:13-17</a>). When Elizabeth conceived, she withdrew from public life for five months, during which time her kinswoman Mary visited her.</p>

  <title>Elohim*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ELOHIM*</p>
<p class="fl">General name for God in the OT. The etymology of <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> is uncertain, but it is generally agreed that it is based on a root that means “might” or “power.” The word is plural in form, but when applied to the true God, it is used in a singular sense and most frequently with verbal elements. The most common explanation for the plural form of <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> as applied to God is that it is “plural of majesty,” that is, all the majesty of deity is encompassed by him.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> also occurs as a designation of deity in other languages, such as Assyrian and Ugaritic; it is used of other nations’ gods, thus demonstrating its more general sense. It seems to be used in a general sense in the OT, particularly the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses), denoting God’s transcendence and capacity as creator of the universe. It is thus somewhat different from the designation <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">,</span> which usually connotes God in his personal relationships to people.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> is used as a designation of Israel’s rulers and judges (<a href="?bref=Ps.82.1,6">Ps 82:1, 6</a>), perhaps denoting their function as God’s earthly representatives (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.6">Ex 21:6</a>). That meaning of the word was used by Christ (<a href="?bref=John.10.34-36">Jn 10:34-36</a>) in a defense against his detractors.</p>
<p>The word is also used of angelic beings (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Ps 8:5</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.2.7">Heb 2:7</a>), and in the expression “sons of God” (<a href="?bref=Job.1.6">Jb 1:6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">EMMAUS</p>
<p class="fl">Town in Judea that appears in Luke (see <a href="?bref=Luke.24.13">24:13</a>) and also in 1 Maccabees (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.40,57">3:40, 57</a>). It was the destination of two disciples to whom Jesus appeared after the Crucifixion. Following the resurrection, Cleopas and a friend were going to Emmaus when they encountered another traveler. They walked the road and talked together, but the disciples did not recognize that the stranger was Jesus. Jesus asked them the nature of their conversation, and he was told of the Crucifixion, the empty tomb, and their discouragement that things had not worked out as they hoped. Jesus then rebuked them, and “beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.27">Lk 24:27</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). When they reached their destination, Jesus accepted an invitation to spend the night. As they ate the evening meal, he blessed the bread, broke it, and gave it to them to eat. At that moment they recognized him. After Jesus vanished from their sight, they returned to Jerusalem to report the event to the apostles.</p>
<p>Though Emmaus, which means “warm wells,” was near Jerusalem, its exact location has never been determined. Several locations have been suggested:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Colonia (Qaloniyeh), about four miles (6.5 kilometers) west of Jerusalem on the main road to Joppa.</p>
<p class="list">2. El-Qubeibeh, about seven miles (11.3 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem on a Roman road passing by Nebi Samwil. Its identification with Emmaus dates back to <span class="era">AD</span> 1099, when the Crusaders found a Roman fort there named Castellum Emmaus.</p>
<p class="list">3. Abu Ghosh, about nine miles (14.5 kilometers) west of Jerusalem. Identified with the OT Kiriath-jearim, it is also known as Kiryat el-Enab, where a Crusader church was built over a Roman fort. This site appears to be too far from Jerusalem to be the biblical Emmaus.</p>
<p class="list">4. Amwas, also known as Nicapolis, about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) west of Jerusalem on the Jaffa road. This is the Emmaus of <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.40,57">1 Maccabees 3:40, 57</a>. This site has the earliest claim to being Emmaus and also has two “warm wells.” Eusebius and Jerome accepted it as the site. The primary objection to its being the NT Emmaus is its distance from Jerusalem, which exceeds the distance stated by Luke, as given in several manuscripts.</p>
<p class="sp">No conclusive evidence has been offered to substantiate the claim for any of these sites as being Emmaus; hence its location remains unknown.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The writer of the letter identifies himself as the apostle Paul (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.1">Eph 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.1">3:1</a>). He also describes his own ministry in terms that reflect what we know of Paul (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.7,13">3:7, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.19-20">6:19-20</a>). This claim is confirmed by the testimonies of Irenaeus, Origen, Polycarp, Tertullian, and Ignatius, who in his own espistle to the Ephesians alludes to the frequent and affectionate mention made by Paul of the Christian state, privileges, and persons of the Ephesians.</p>
<p>There are some characteristics of the letter, however, that have caused many scholars to question its clear claim to Pauline authorship. Some of these characteristics would be a problem only if the letter were intended exclusively for people in Ephesus, but such was probably not the case. Otherwise, it would be hard to understand why, after establishing the church there over a three-year period, Paul would write as though author and recipients had only a secondhand knowledge of each other. It would also be strange that the warm personal words of greeting to various individuals that are found in other Pauline letters are missing here. There is instead only a general greeting to “the brothers” (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.23">6:23</a>). But all this can be easily explained once it is understood that the epistle was an encyclical for several churches.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Destination">Destination</p>
<p class="fl">This epistle was addressed, most probably, to several churches in the district around Ephesus—namely, Asia. The Epistle to the Ephesians, so-called, was not really intended to be only for the church at Ephesus. Most modern scholars are convinced that it was an encyclical that went to several churches in Asia, including Ephesus. There are several reasons to affirm this. First, the earliest manuscripts (the Chester Beatty Papyrus—P46, Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus) do not contain the words “in Ephesus” in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.1">Ephesians 1:1</a>. It appears that Paul purposely left the name of the locality out, so as to be filled in later as the letter circulated to each locality. (The Greek construction in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.1">1:1</a> calls for a prepositional phrase designating a locality to be present in the sentence.) Since Ephesus was the leading city of Asia, it was quite natural for scribes to assign this epistle to the church at Ephesus. Second, the Epistle to the Ephesians has all the marks of being a general treatise rather than an epistle to a specific local church. Paul had lived with the believers at Ephesus for three years (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.31">Acts 20:31</a>). He knew them intimately, yet in this epistle there are no personal greetings or specific exhortations. When we consider Paul’s manner in many of his other epistles, it would be quite unlike him to have excluded these personal expressions. Quite the contrary, Paul speaks to the saints whom he has only heard about and who have only heard about him (see <a href="?bref=Eph.1.15">Eph 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.1">3:1</a>). It is possible that this epistle was the one sent to Laodicea.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="PapyrusManuscriptOfEphesians"/>
<p>In all fairness it must be said that the encyclical theory has been opposed by some scholars. For example, Henry Alford makes the following objections to this theory: (1) It is at variance with the spirit of the epistle, which is clearly addressed to one set of persons throughout, coexisting in one place and as one body and under the same circumstances. (2) It is improbable that the apostle, who in two of his epistles (2 Corinthians and Galatians) has so plainly specified their encyclical character, should have here omitted such specification. (3) The absence of personal greetings is not an argument for either of the two theories, for similarly there are none in Galatians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and 1 Timothy. The better he knows the parties addressed, and the more general and solemn the subject, the less he seems to give of these individual notices.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateandOrigin">Date and Origin</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Eph.3.1">Ephesians 3:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1">4:1</a>, and <a href="?bref=Eph.6.20">6:20</a> indicate that the letter was written while Paul was a prisoner. Since he was imprisoned several times, it is necessary to narrow the options. The first major imprisonment may have been at Ephesus itself, but this is obviously not in consideration. The second was at Caesarea for two years (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.27">Acts 24:27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.23.23-24,33">23:23-24, 33</a>). It is possible that Paul wrote some letters at that time, but most scholars think that Ephesians (along with Colossians, Philemon, and probably Philippians) was written during Paul’s imprisonment at Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.16,30">28:16, 30</a>). This probably took place sometime between <span class="era">AD</span> 59 and 63 and lasted for two years. This period of time, following about 25 years of spiritual growth and 12 years or so of missionary experience, gave Paul a splendid opportunity for reflection and writing.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Ephesus was the most important city in Asia Minor, located on the Cayster River, with a harbor on the Aegean Sea. With this location it became a center for commercial travel, and major trade routes led to it from several directions. A great pagan temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis (Diana) was located in Ephesus. Paul made the city a center of evangelistic and church-building ministry (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-41">Acts 19</a>), spending three years there (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.31">20:31</a>). It was natural, therefore, for a letter intended for a wide readership in that part of Asia Minor to have Ephesus as its main destination.</p>
<p>Paul’s first visit to Ephesus (on the seacoast of Lydia, near the river Cayster) is related in <a href="?bref=Acts.18.19-21">Acts 18:19-21</a>. The work, begun by his disputations with the Jews in his short visit, was carried on by Apollos (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-26">24-26</a>) and Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.26">18:26</a>). At his second visit, after his journey to Jerusalem, and thence to the east regions of Asia Minor, he remained at Ephesus “three years” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.10">19:10</a>—the “two years” in this verse are only <span class="ital">part</span> of the time—and <a href="?bref=Acts.20.31">20:31</a>); therefore, the founding and rearing of this church occupied an unusually large portion of the apostle’s time and care. The language in the epistle shows a warmth of feeling and a free outpouring of thought, and a union in spiritual privileges and hope between him and them, such as are natural from one so long and so intimately associated with those whom he addresses. On his last journey to Jerusalem, he sailed by Ephesus and summoned the elders of the Ephesian church to meet him at Miletus, where he delivered his remarkable farewell charge (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.18-35">20:18-35</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheRelationshipBetweenEphesiansAndColossians"/>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">It may be said that the purpose of Ephesians is “doxological”; that is, it should cause the readers to glorify God, both in grateful praise and in manner of life. This is seen in the opening section, which is like a hymn in style: “Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">Eph 1:3</a>; cf. the Doxology often sung in church). Paul says three times in the first chapter that the result of God’s blessings should be praise (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.1.6,12,14">6, 12, 14</a>).</p>
<p>While the letter contains much doctrinal and moral instruction (with the latter solidly based on the former), its purpose is not only teaching or exhortation, important as these are. It is rather to lift up its readers to a new vantage point that will help them to identify with the risen, ascended Christ and to share his perspective on the church and its role in the world.</p>
<p>In this connection a significant term occurs in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">1:3</a> and elsewhere. It is perhaps best translated “heavenly realms.” It is different in form from the usual word for “heaven” and seems to have a special significance in Ephesians as the realm of Jesus’ victorious reign in the present age. This is seen in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.20">1:20</a>, read in the context of verses <a href="?bref=Eph.1.19-23">19-23</a>. Whatever beings there may be, Christ is above them all. The believer, although obviously on earth physically, “sits with Christ” in the heavenly realms (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.6">2:6</a>) and is “blessed” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">1:3</a>), drawing on the unlimited resources of heaven for his daily life. It is also in this realm that the spiritual conflict takes place (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">6:12</a>).</p>
<p>Paul thus makes it clear that Christians are not to have a limited or merely earthly viewpoint. Those who do, mistakenly think that their enemies are people (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">6:12</a>) and our resources human (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.3-4">2 Cor 10:3-4</a>). With this orientation to the heavenly world of the Lord’s present exaltation, the reader is prepared to understand that the church does not function merely to carry out routine activities here, but that it displays the wisdom of God to beings who exist in the heavenly realms (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.10">Eph 3:10</a>). Even the function of church leaders is discussed in terms of the gifts of the Christ who has ascended to the heavens (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.8-10">4:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>There is a strong sense of ultimate purpose in Ephesians. The first chapter contains a number of different expressions of purpose. The great goal of history is expressed in <a href="?bref=Eph.1.10">1:10</a>. The sense of purpose is never lost. The church is even seen, in chapter <a href="?bref=Eph.3.1-21">3</a>, as the expression of God’s eternal, secret plan. There is also a movement throughout the letter, from (1) reconciliation of individuals to God, to (2) their reconciliation to each other, to (3) their life together in the church. There is no arguing of points along the way, such as one finds in most of the letters, but rather a connected series of affirmations, each leading the reader on to the next.</p>
<p>Paul discusses a number of topics from this heavenly perspective and the sense of purpose this provides. These topics will be discussed below in such a way as to show their interconnection, rather than necessarily in the order of their importance or prominence in Ephesians.</p>
<p class="h3">The Church</p>
<p class="fl">Paul employs a number of figures of speech to describe the church, including a household, a temple, and a body (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">1:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.19-22">2:19-22</a>). Actually, it may be insufficient to call the word “body” a figure of speech, because it seems to be more than that. There is a sense in which Christ and the church have an actual organic relationship, in which he functions as the head and believers as parts of his body.</p>
<p>The church is the result of the reconciling work of Christ, whose death has made peace between mutually hostile Jews and Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-18">2:11-18</a>). The ensuing unity was long planned by God (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.2-6">3:2-6</a>), and is furthered by a proper attitude and mutual ministry (ch <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-32">4</a>).</p>
<p>An especially remarkable feature of Ephesians is the parallel drawn between the relationship between a husband and wife and that between Christ and the church (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.22-33">5:22-33</a>). In this comparison the prior reality is not marriage, with the relationship of Christ and the church only providing an illustration. Rather, the essential reality is Christ and the church.</p>
<p class="h3">The Headship of Christ</p>
<p class="fl">Not only is Christ the head of the church, but he is head over all things to the church’s benefit (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.22">1:22</a>). The meaning of <a href="?bref=Eph.1.10">1:10</a> is that the presently disparate parts and beings of the universe will be brought into order under the headship of Christ. This universal headship is anticipated in the ascension and present exaltation of Christ. The expression of universal domination—“God has put all things under his feet” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.22">1:22</a>, from <a href="?bref=Ps.8.6">Ps 8:6</a>)—fortifies this expectation.</p>
<p class="h3">The “Mystery” or “Secret Plan”</p>
<p class="fl">The Greek word “mystery” has a special meaning in early Jewish and Christian literature. It refers to the private eternal decisions of God concerning his saving work and his ultimate purposes in history, which are revealed stage by stage. The term is used in connection with the kingdom in the Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.11">Mt 13:11</a>), with the preaching of the gospel in <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.18-2.16">1 Corinthians 1:18–2:16</a>, with the destiny of Israel in <a href="?bref=Rom.11.25">Romans 11:25</a>, and elsewhere with differing applications. Finally, <a href="?bref=Rev.10.6-7">Revelation 10:6-7</a> declares that there will be no more delay, but that God’s “mystery,” initially announced by the prophets, will reach its completion.</p>
<p>The aspect of God’s plan that Paul presents in <a href="?bref=Eph.3.3-6">Ephesians 3:3-6</a> is not only the inclusion of Gentiles among God’s people but their complete integration with Jews in the church. The extent of this was not revealed prior to the time of Paul’s ministry.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The Divine Purpose: The Glory and Headship of Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.1-14">1:1-14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This whole section constitutes a “doxology.” Paul reminds readers, by expressing his own prayer of praise, of all the blessings God has given believers. These include being chosen to live in God’s presence without guilt (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.4">4</a>), being given the destiny of full sonship (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.5">5</a>), and being forgiven because Christ died for them.</p>
<p>But Paul is not only giving a recitation of what God has done; he interweaves a number of words and phrases indicating <span class="ital">why</span> God has acted, that is, what God’s <span class="ital">purposes</span> are. Various translations use different English words to represent Greek expressions of purpose, such as “chose,” “predestined,” “plan,” “will,” “secret reason,” “good pleasure,” “purpose” (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.1.4-10">4-10</a>). Perhaps the most comprehensive statement is in verses <a href="?bref=Eph.1.11-12">11-12</a>.</p>
<p>It is clear from this that the ultimate purpose of God’s saving work is not merely the happiness of believers but the glory of God through the Lord Jesus Christ. The Spirit is given to guarantee not only the believer’s security but also God’s investment, so to speak, in the believer.</p>
<p class="h3">Prayer That Christians May Realize God’s Purpose and Power (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.15-23">1:15-23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul’s prayer issues from his opening section, constituting a request that believers may appropriate all that is contained in that statement. It is here that the fact of Jesus’ death, resurrection, and ascension is cited as the basis for the believer’s present vantage point and power.</p>
<p class="h3">Steps toward the Fulfillment of God’s Purpose (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.1-3.21">2:1–3:21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first step was the death of Christ in order to save individuals from sin and death (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.1-10">2:1-10</a>). Since this was at God’s initiative, not man’s, and since man was spiritually “dead” and helpless, salvation can only be by grace.</p>
<p>The second step was the reconciliation of people not only to God but to each other (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-18">2:11-18</a>). Paul thus moves from the individual to the corporate aspect of salvation. This was particularly significant for Gentiles, who previously did not have even a formal relationship with God. One of the key words in this section is “peace” (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-17">14-17</a>).</p>
<p>Step three goes beyond reconciliation to the actual uniting of Jews and Gentiles in one “household” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.19-22">2:19-22</a>). God has not only brought people individually to himself, and to each other as individuals, but has formed a new corporate entity, a new society that is described both in political and family terms. Ultimately, believers together form a corporate body in whom God is exalted.</p>
<p>This third step is amplified in a fourth step, the revelation of God’s eternal purpose in the formation of this one body, the church (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.1-13">3:1-13</a>). Using the biblical concept of the “mystery,” Paul shows how the church displays the wisdom of God to all who may be looking on throughout the universe. This immediately gives the believer a new awareness of the reason for his salvation and participation in the church. Self-centeredness and boredom with the routine of church activity give way to a sense of meaning and purpose.</p>
<p>These steps are now summarized in a second prayer (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.14-21">3:14-21</a>). An exalted series of petitions culminate in another “doxology.” This expresses Paul’s awe over the infinite power of God to accomplish all that he has described in the epistle thus far, and his desire that this will indeed result in great glory to God both in the church and in Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">Practical Ways to Fulfill God’s Purpose in the Church (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-6.20">4:1–6:20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Doctrine and life are never separated in Paul’s thinking, but in Ephesians the connection is even more vital than usual. The believer’s life is to be lived in a manner worthy of the great purposes of God. The believer’s “calling” is not merely to be saved or eternally happy, but to participate with the entire body, the church, in bringing glory to God. This contributes to the realization of the prayer in <a href="?bref=Eph.3.20-21">3:20-21</a>.</p>
<p>The first way to fulfill God’s purpose is to maintain the unity he established in the church. This is accomplished by recognizing the strong basis for unity (“one Lord, one faith,” etc., <a href="?bref=Eph.4.5-6">4:5-6</a>). Then believers must acknowledge diversity in that unity, remembering that God has given each one special abilities (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.4.7-8">7-8</a>). These abilities are to be used to bring the church both individually and corporately to maturity. This diversity in unity constitutes the second way in which God’s purpose is fulfilled. Christian maturity enables the individual members of the church to relate to each other in love (v <a href="?bref=Eph.4.16">16</a>).</p>
<p>The third way to accomplish the purposes of God is by renewal of personal life (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.17-5.21">4:17–5:21</a>). Paul emphasizes the kind of lifestyle that is expected of a Christian by contrasting the behavior patterns that had characterized the believers before their conversion. But the new life of the believer is not simply structured as a reaction against the old. Rather, the Lord has given both his teachings and the example of his own sacrificial love (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.20-21,32">4:20-21, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>). The believer should cast off his old way of life, his old self or character. (The actual term is “old man” in Paul’s wording, not, as is often thought, “old nature.”) He should at the same time put on the “new man,” which, in Paul’s words in verse <a href="?bref=Eph.5.24">24</a>, is “created according to God” (<span class="sc">niv</span> “created to be like God”). The section closes with the important exhortation to be filled with the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.18">5:18</a>).</p>
<p>The expression of the new character in interpersonal relations is the fourth way in which believers can forward the purposes of God in the church. Unity is either achieved or broken in accordance with the presence or absence of the proper submission described in <a href="?bref=Eph.5.22-6.9">5:22–6:9</a>. The basic principle of submission is first expressed by verse <a href="?bref=Eph.5.21">21</a> as a result of the Spirit’s full control.</p>
<p>Marriage then provides the first example of mutual submission. The wife submits to the husband, and this in turn is an expression of her submission, along with that of the whole church, to the Lord. The husband loves his wife as Christ loved the church. While the husband’s love is not described as submission, in effect, love does cost the lover his freedom. Jesus thus expressed his love for the church by his death (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.25">5:25</a>). Further, husband and wife are bound together in a unity, just as God intended at the time of creation (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>, quoted here in <a href="?bref=Eph.5.31">5:31</a>). This unity portrays that spiritual unity that exists between Christ and the church.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this list of examples is similar to a pattern used elsewhere in the NT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Col.3.18-4.1">Col 3:18–4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.1-7">1 Pt 3:1-7</a>). Thus, following the example of marriage, Paul turns to the relationship that should exist between parent and child. The child obeys the father; the father refrains from excessive reactions (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.1-4">6:1-4</a>). The last example is that of slaves and masters.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheChurchDisplaysGodsManifoldWisdom"/>
<p>The final way in which believers forward God’s great purposes is to carry on the spiritual conflict by depending on spiritual resources (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.10-20">Eph 6:10-20</a>). Drawing on imagery both from the OT and from contemporary Roman warfare, Paul shows that the heavenly perspective is essential for victory. This includes dependence on God as expressed in prayer (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.6.18-20">18-20</a>). He acknowledges his own need in this respect.</p>
<p>The conclusion to the letter (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.21-24">6:21-24</a>) is a word of encouragement and an explanation of Paul’s decision to send the letter in the good hands of Tychicus. One of the concluding words is “grace,” a word that underlies the entire divine process described in Ephesians.</p>

<p class="h1">EPHESUS</p>
<p class="fl">Most important city of the Roman province of Asia, located on the western shore of Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Ephesus was built on a natural harbor whose waves, according to the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, “used to wash up to the temple of Diana.” Ephesus was described by Strabo, an early Greek geographer, as the largest commercial center west of the Taurus Mountains. It was also well known as the “guardian” of the temple of Artemis, or as the Romans called her, Diana (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.34">Acts 19:34</a>).</p>
<p>Christianity’s threat to that pagan temple and to the commerce it produced for the makers of idols almost cost the apostle Paul his life (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.24,30-31">Acts 19:24, 30-31</a>). Priscilla and Aquila were associated with the early preaching in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18-19">18:18-19</a>), as were Timothy (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.3">1 Tm 1:3</a>) and Erastus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.22">Acts 19:22</a>). According to Irenaeus, an early Christian writer, the apostle John, after his exile on the island of Patmos (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rv 1:9</a>), returned to live in Ephesus until the time of the emperor Trajan (<span class="era">AD</span> 98–117). The commendable practices of the Christian community described in the letter to the Ephesians had been largely abandoned by the time John wrote the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.4">Rv 2:4</a>).</p>

<p>Ephesus was founded by Ionian Greeks at a location where the Cayster River emptied into a gulf of the Aegean Sea. It had been a city for about 1,000 years when Paul arrived there on his third missionary journey. The worship of Artemis in Ephesus was as ancient as the city itself. The temple, built in the middle of the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, was the largest edifice in the Hellenistic world and the first of monumental size ever to be constructed entirely of marble. Two excavated images of Artemis, magnificently sculpted in marble, date to the period of the emperors Domitian and Hadrian (the lifetime of the apostle John). The temple of Diana, “mother of the gods,” was considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Although persistent effort by British archaeologist J. T. Wood resulted in the temple’s discovery in 1869, its great altar was not found until recently. Excavation has shown the altar to be larger than the later altar of Zeus at Pergamum. The original temple was partially destroyed in 356 <span class="era">BC</span> but was later rebuilt on its original plan.</p>
<p>Excavations have also uncovered the theater mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.29">Acts 19:29</a>. Situated next to the main shopping area (Greek <span class="greek">agora</span>), it is known to have seated 24,000 people in three tiers. The theater was 495 feet (151 meters) in diameter with two doors opening to the most impressive street in Ephesus. That street, leading to the harbor, was about 35 feet (10.5 meters) wide and was flanked by tall columns. It passed through a magnificent monumental gateway on its western end. In the other direction the road continued around the theater and marketplace, making its way southeast between Mt Koressos and Mt Pion. It became narrower and was bordered by lovely fountains, civic buildings, houses, shops, a library, baths, and a small theater, which probably doubled as a council chamber for city officials.</p>
<p>Ephesus was a wealthy city. The multistoried residences of its upper-middle-class society rested on the north terraces of Mt Koressos. Some homes had mosaic floors and marble walls. Two were found with heated bathrooms. Many had running water. The moral status of the city can be partially ascertained from a centrally located house of prostitution and gambling tables; fertility motifs are evident in the exaggerated sexual features of the Diana statues.</p>
<p>The impact of Christianity was felt in Ephesus for centuries. The third ecumenical council was held there in <span class="era">AD</span> 431 (in the Church of Mary northwest of the theater), a council that established Mary’s place as the “Mother of God” in Western Catholic theology. By that time Diana, whose temple had been burned by the Goths in <span class="era">AD</span> 262, was no longer influential among the Ephesians. The truth of Paul’s message that “gods made with hands are not gods” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.26">Acts 19:26</a>) had to some extent been realized.</p>

  <title>Ephod (Garment)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EPHOD (Garment)</p>
<p class="fl">Upper garment worn during religious services associated with the tabernacle or temple. “Ephod” generally referred to the ornamented vest that the high priest wore over a blue robe (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.31">Ex 28:31</a>). Included with the ephod were the Urim and Thummim, the sacred lots. Sometimes “ephod” meant the complete dress of the high priest (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.28">1 Sm 2:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.23.6,9">23:6, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.7">30:7</a>) or similar garments worn by lesser priests.</p>
<p>Made of dyed material and fine linen, the garment was embroidered in blue, purple, scarlet, and gold. At the upper end were attached two shoulder straps, each having an onyx stone inscribed with the names of Israel’s 12 tribes. The breastplate, also containing the tribal names, was bound to the ephod by an elaborate series of cords and chains (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.22-29">Ex 28:22-29</a>).</p>
<p>Jewish writers suggest various appearances for the ephod: (1) apronlike, covering the body from the chest to the heels; (2) enveloping the body only from the waist down, the upper body being covered by the breastplate; or (3) sleeved and jacketlike, with the middle of the breast uncovered so the breastplate could be inserted easily.</p>
<p>Prior to the Babylonian exile, the ephod served as a means of revelation from God, especially concerning military operations. Abiathar the priest brought the ephod into David’s camp on one occasion for consulting the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.6-9">1 Sm 23:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.7">30:7</a>). It is uncertain whether the priest donned or held the ephod whole, seeking counsel from the Lord by means of the Urim and Thummim.</p>
<p>During the period of the judges, the ephod was often misused, as by Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.27">Jgs 8:27</a>), Micah (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.5">17:5</a>), and Jonathan, grandson of Moses (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.30">18:30</a>; cf. vv 14, 17, 20). Either the garment itself or an image that represented God, on which the garment was placed, was worshiped as the people sought revelation in a manner condemned by God. Household idols (teraphim) were also associated with this ungodly practice (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.5">17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.4">Hos 3:4</a>).</p>
<p>Besides the high priest, other priests wore an ephod for certain religious services (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.18">1 Sm 22:18</a>), and even Samuel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.18">2:18</a>) and David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.14">2 Sm 6:14</a>) wore one. By the postexilic period, and perhaps as early as Solomon, the ephod was no longer consulted (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.63">Ezr 2:63</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.65">Neh 7:65</a>). There was no need for ephod or Urim revelation once there was the more complete revelation of the prophetic ministry promised by Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.15-22">Dt 18:15-22</a>). However, the high priest continued to wear this vestment until the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>

<p class="fl">Joseph’s younger son, born of Joseph and Asenath before the seven years of famine in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.52">Gn 41:52</a>). He was the ancestor of an Israelite tribe, and his name came to designate the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.5,8">Is 7:5, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.18-20">Jer 31:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.3-5">Hos 5:3-5</a>). Ephraim’s boyhood overlapped the last 17 years of his grandfather, the patriarch Jacob, who migrated to Egypt during the years of famine. Thus Ephraim could learn of God’s promises and blessings directly from Jacob. After Jacob exacted an oath from Joseph to bury him in Canaan he adopted his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh. That adoption gave the two brothers the position and legal rights equal to Jacob’s eldest sons, Reuben and Simeon (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.5">Gn 48:5</a>).</p>

<p class="list">1. Area allotted to Ephraim’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.5-8">Jos 16:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.7-11">17:7-11</a>). Ephraim and Manasseh originally were recognized as “the people of Joseph” (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.4">Jos 16:4</a>). Together they occupied the central highlands area between Jerusalem and the plain of Esdraelon. Ephraim’s territory lay to the south of Manasseh. The area was relatively high, and the expression “the hill country of Ephraim” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1 Sm 1:1</a>) was an apt description. In places the hard rocks form steep and difficult slopes, and the valleys leading to the west are steep. Roads followed the spurs between the valleys rather than the valleys themselves. Movement between Ephraim and the coastal plain along the edge of the rocky Sarida Valley was not easy, but it was possible. Another road followed by the Philistine invaders (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.1-22">1 Sm 4</a>) led up from Aphek. The expression in <a href="?bref=Josh.16.9">Joshua 16:9</a>, “the towns which were set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), suggests that there had once been a disputed boundary; however, Ephraim was evidently able to strengthen itself and to emerge as a dominant force in Israel. Indeed, the name Ephraim is sometimes used as the equivalent of Israel (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.17">Hos 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.3,11-14">5:3, 11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.6.4,10">6:4, 10</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The extent of the tribal area of Ephraim is given in <a href="?bref=Josh.16.5-8">Joshua 16:5-8</a> and <a href="?bref=Josh.17.1-11">17:1-11</a>. It would appear from the abundant detail given in these passages that the main topographical features of Ephraim’s boundaries would be easy to determine. Yet the precise identification of a number of the places mentioned is uncertain. The eastern boundary began at Micmethah, tentatively identified with Khirbet en-Nabi. It continued south through Taanath-shiloh, Janoah, Ataroth, and Naarah to a point near Jericho. The southern boundary seems to have passed westward toward Bethel, Beth-horon, and Gezer to the Mediterranean Sea. The western boundary is not defined and probably encroached on Canaanite areas in early times. The northern boundary separating Ephraim from Manasseh went from Micmethah, which was “before Shechem,” toward Tappuah and then ran along the Wadi Qana to the Mediterranean Sea north of Joppa. But it must be stressed that the precise definition of the boundaries is by no means clear. Immediately to the south of Ephraim lay the tribal area of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="list-text">The rainfall in the hill country of Ephraim is greater than that in Judea, which lay further south, and the soil is reddish in color, rich and fertile. Because of this, Ephraim was very productive. Today the country is dotted with orchards, and olive trees are abundant. The description in <a href="?bref=Deut.33.14-17">Deuteronomy 33:14-17</a> of an area which yielded “the choicest fruits of the sun, and the rich yield of the months, with the finest produce of the ancient mountains, and the abundance of the everlasting hills, with the best gifts of the earth” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) gives an excellent picture of the general nature of the region.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town near Baal-hazor to which Absalom invited his half brother Amnon in order to have him put to death (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23-29">2 Sm 13:23-29</a>) for incest with Absalom’s sister Tamar. The town lay to the north of Jerusalem and was possibly identical with Ephron (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.19">2 Chr 13:19</a>). It was no doubt the same town near the wilderness to which Jesus retired after raising Lazarus from the tomb (<a href="?bref=John.11.54">Jn 11:54</a>). It is generally identified with et-Taiyibeh, 13 miles (20.9 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem and four miles (6.5 kilometers) northeast of Bethel.</p>

The connection of this location with the territory of Ephraim is difficult. The most probable explanation is that Ephraim once extended farther to the east but that this area was lost by the tribe after its defeat by Jephthah and the Gileadites near Zaphon (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-6">Jgs 12:1-6</a>). The name may have been used while the Ephraimites held the land, or perhaps been given at a later date as a reminder of Ephraim’s defeat.

<p class="h1">EPHRAIM, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Tribe descended from the patriarch Joseph’s second son. Both Ephraim and his brother Manasseh were regarded as sons also by their grandfather Jacob and became his heirs.</p>
<p>Many Bible commentators think that in naming his son Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.52">Gn 41:52</a>), Joseph was making a play on words based on a Hebrew root meaning “to be fruitful.” In support of this theory they note that the hill country later assigned to Ephraim’s tribe was one of the most fertile areas in Palestine, and at present is still planted with vines and fruit trees, such as olive, pomegranate, and carob. Prior to Israelite settlement, the area was wooded (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.18">Jos 17:18</a>). During the monarchy, wild animals still roamed there (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.24">2 Kgs 2:24</a>).</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine the exact limits of Ephraim’s territory, since it is often mentioned with Manasseh’s tribe. Ephraim was allotted land in the heart of Canaan, the Promised Land, between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. One half of Manasseh’s allotment formed Ephraim’s northern boundary (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.5-9">Jos 16:5-9</a>).</p>
<p>Ephraim became a great tribe, and its members often held prominent positions. The first census taken in the wilderness lists the total of Ephraimite soldiers as 40,500 (<a href="?bref=Num.1.33">Nm 1:33</a>). After the wilderness wanderings, the number of warriors dropped to 32,500 (<a href="?bref=Num.26.37">26:37</a>). In Israel’s encampment around the tabernacle, Ephraim was the leader of the western camp, supported by the tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Num.2.18-24">2:18-24</a>).</p>
<p>Joshua the son of Nun, one of the 12 spies, was descended from Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Num.13.8">Nm 13:8</a>, “Hoshea”). Under Joshua’s leadership, Ephraim and the other tribes conquered Canaan and received their promised inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.1-10">Jos 16</a>).</p>
<p>In the days of the judges, the Ephraimites felt slighted when they were not called upon to assist others in their battles. They quarreled with Gideon because of his belated invitation to help against the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.1-6">Jgs 8:1-6</a>), as well as with Jephthah of Gilead, who defeated the Ammonites (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-6">12:1-6</a>). The judge Abdon came from Ephraim’s tribe (v <a href="?bref=Judg.12.13">13</a>). The idolatrous Micah (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.1">17:1</a>), as well as the prophet Samuel, lived in Ephraim (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1 Sm 1:1</a>). The military and political importance of the Ephraimites is reflected in the Song of Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.14">Jgs 5:14</a>), an ancient biblical poem.</p>
<p>Judah was Ephraim’s main rival, and even under David, that animosity was evident (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-33">2 Sm 18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.41-20.22">19:41–20:22</a>). Discontent in the north with Solomon’s rule (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.26-40">1 Kgs 11:26-40</a>), combined with a foolish decision by Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, brought about the division of the kingdom. The 10 northern tribes (Israel) were then ruled by Jeroboam I.</p>
<p>After the northern tribes seceded, the capitals of the northern kingdom—Shechem, Tirzah, and Samaria—were situated in Ephraim. The establishment of Samaria by King Omri of Israel gave the Ephraimites more direct access to the great north-south trunk road (Via Maris) through the western plain. This contact with trade routes gave the northern kingdom greater world consciousness and brought greater temptation to depart from God and his commands.</p>
<p>The prophets proclaimed that Ephraim and the other northern tribes would one day be reunited with the southern kingdom of Judah in the messianic kingdom (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.11">Hos 1:11</a>). The division introduced by Jeroboam I would be healed when a king descended from David would rule over Judah, Ephraim, and all the tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">Ez 37</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">EPICUREANS</p>
<p class="fl">Those who followed the teachings of the Greek philosopher Epicurus (342–270 <span class="era">BC</span>). Paul encountered some of them while in Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.18">Acts 17:18</a>).</p>
<p>Epicurus spent his childhood on the island of Samos, near the western coast of what is today Turkey. In his late teens he moved to Athens for military service. After his tour of duty, he devoted his time to the study and teaching of philosophy. This work took him from Athens, but he returned in 307 <span class="era">BC</span> to found a school. He attracted a considerable following, and his disciples spread his message throughout the civilized world. The fact that Paul met Epicureans over three centuries after the death of Epicurus shows both the attractiveness of his teachings and the commitment of his disciples. In the first century <span class="era">BC</span> these teachings found expression in the writing of the Roman poet Lucretius. His <span class="ital">On the Nature of Things</span> is a helpful guide to understanding Epicurus, especially since only fragments of Epicurus’s own writings remain.</p>
<p>The Epicureans were empiricists; they relied upon sense experience for knowledge. This put them in opposition to those who chose to make statements about the world on the basis of reason alone, distrusting or rejecting the data of the senses. Epicureans were concerned with natural evidence and with practicalities, thus showing a somewhat scientific character. They were unenthusiastic about mathematics because of what they took to be its abstract quality, having little to do with the important matters of living. Ethics, the study of right behavior, was their focus.</p>
<p>The Epicurean judged the value of an action or thing in terms of the pleasure or pain it brought—a position called hedonism. It was egoistic hedonism because the person sought his own pleasure rather than the pleasure of others. This description can bring to mind the image of an irresponsible glutton or lover of wild parties, but this image, encouraged by the modern sense of the word “epicurean,” is misleading. Epicurus rejected just such behavior. He realized that momentary pleasure can lead to enduring pain and that some pain can be beneficial. He viewed pleasure more as a quality of life than a series of thrills. What he sought is better called happiness. Basing his counsel on experience, he urged moderation, calm, friendship, a simple life. He avoided feasting, sexual passion, and strife. In fact, he avoided pain more than he sought pleasure. The pleasure of tranquillity, of peace, could be found in the absence of pain, and this was his aim. To ensure tranquillity, a man must tend to his stomach, but he must also attend to his mind, directing it toward wisdom.</p>
<p>Epicurus saw belief in gods as a serious threat to tranquillity. Gods were generally viewed as meddling and powerful beings who terrified ordinary mortals—sources of insecurity, not peace and happiness. Epicurus taught that the gods were not, in fact, like this but were tranquil hedonists who stayed away from men. They avoided the strife involved in contact with people on earth. In short, they were nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Epicurus taught that we, and everything in our world, are made up of atoms of different qualities. For example, the atoms of the human soul are smooth and round. Although atomic theories often lead to the conviction that all human actions are determined by the laws that rule the motion of atoms, Epicurus’s theory did not. He allowed for human freedom by claiming that some atoms spontaneously leave their straight paths, thus setting off an unpredictable chain of collisions. Man’s behavior is then free and not machinelike.</p>
<p>In spite of his freedom, man is still a collection of atoms, and when the atoms separate, the man ceases to exist; he is not immortal. Epicurus saw this as reason no longer to fear death. For after death, all experience ceases. There will be no pain, and so there is no cause for anxiety.</p>
<p>Epicurean themes can be found in the Bible—for example, moderation (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.5">Phil 4:5</a>) and the peace that comes from the exercise of wisdom (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.13-18">Prv 3:13-18</a>). But the differences are clear. The Bible reveals a God who is intimately involved in the world; the immortality of man’s soul; and the truth that genuine happiness depends upon communion with and service to God (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.6-7">Phil 4:6-7</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">EPILEPSY*, EPILEPTIC</p>
<p class="fl">Disease of the central nervous system, and one afflicted with the disease, characterized by unconsciousness and convulsions. Seizures can be either petit mal (twitching of the face or hands, brief but sharp abdominal pain, and possible momentary unconsciousness) or grand mal (convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and unconsciousness lasting from 5 to 20 minutes). Although the causes of epilepsy are still not known, drugs are available to prevent or control the seizures.</p>
<p>In biblical times, epilepsy (known as the “falling sickness”) could not be treated effectively. Jesus healed a boy evidently suffering from that affliction (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.14-18">Mt 17:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.17-27">Mk 9:17-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.37-42">Lk 9:37-42</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> description of the boy as a “lunatic” (from Latin <span class="ital">luna,</span> “moon”) is an incorrect usage. The Greek word in Matthew (literally “moonstruck”) reflected ancient belief in a connection between certain diseases and the lunar phases. According to the biblical account, the youth was healed when Jesus called forth a demon, or “unclean spirit,” from him. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MedicineandMedicalPractice_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Medicine and Medical Practice</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">ERECH</p>
<p class="fl">Important Sumerian city, located at what is now called Warka near the Euphrates River, 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) northwest of Ur and 160 miles (257.4 kilometers) south of Baghdad. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.10">Genesis 10:10</a> refers to Erech as the second of four cities founded by Nimrod. Partial excavations have uncovered the city walls (6 miles, or 9.7 kilometers, in circumference), canals, and the remains of elegant buildings with fluted walls decorated with colored cones and inscriptions. Two ziggurats are among the oldest ever discovered, and several temples date back to the late fourth or early third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. The use of clay cylinder seals began in Erech, and from the same period have come hundreds of pictographic inscriptions.</p>
<p>Ancient inscriptions indicate that Erech and its surroundings were regarded as extremely beautiful and fertile. Its religious pantheon centered on the aggressive goddess of love, Inanna, who was supposed to have brought to Erech the “divine laws” to which it owed its greatness. She helped Erech to subjugate its enemies and married King Dumuzi to ensure the fertility and prosperity of Sumer. Dumuzi, in turn, was identified with Tammuz, the fertility god widely worshiped in Mesopotamia and Palestine.</p>
<p>Among Erech’s rulers in the third millennium was Gilgamesh, hero of the great Akkadian epic. From the time of Hammurabi, Erech became part of Babylonia, and it continued to flourish until after 300 <span class="era">BC</span>. <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.9">Ezra 4:9</a> refers to “Archevites” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), or men of Arku, the Assyrian name from which the Hebrew “Erech” is derived. Strabo, Ptolemy, and Pliny mention its renown as a center of learning, chiefly astronomical.</p>

  <title>Esarhaddon</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ESARHADDON</p>
<p class="fl">King of Assyria (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>). Though probably not the eldest son of Sennacherib, he was the eldest surviving son following several interfamily murders. Sennacherib was assassinated by his sons Adram-melech and Sharezer, and civil war ensued between their supporters and those who accepted the youthful, newly proclaimed king, Esarhaddon. As the threat from the brothers was eliminated by death or exile, Esarhaddon solidified his position. He ruled from Nineveh and proclaimed his twin sons, Ashurbanipal and Samas-sum-ukin, crown princes of Assyria and Babylonia but his attempt thus to ensure a smooth changeover of rule at his own death was frustrated.</p>
<p>Esarhaddon’s immediate task was to settle the rebellious border areas, which he did by launching military campaigns. He installed governors he could rely on, and he increased substantially the level of tribute required. Some kings were replaced and others subsequently restored. Of the latter, Manasseh (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.11">2 Chr 33:11</a>), taken in chains to Babylon, later continued to reign in Jerusalem, although this incident may not have taken place until the reign of Ashurbanipal. Of the strong cities, Sidon was finally subdued, but Esarhaddon was forced to come to terms with Baslu, king of Tyre.</p>
<p>In 675 <span class="era">BC</span>, Esarhaddon invaded Egypt and destroyed the royal city of Memphis, together with many other towns and cities. Prince Taharqa, who had fled to Nubia on the initial invasion, continued to rule over Egypt and subsequently led a rebellion against Esarhaddon. During his second Egyptian campaign, Esarhaddon succumbed to a fatal sickness.</p>
<p>Esarhaddon was a strong, cruel, and fearless ruler who was proud of his achievements. He maintained dominion over a vast area, claiming control not only of Babylonia and Syria but also of Egypt and Ethiopia, the lands bordering on Assyria, and some of the islands of the eastern Mediterranean. He built a palace at Kar-esarhaddon near Nineveh and restored the fabled temple of Ashur originally constructed by Shalmaneser I about 1250 <span class="era">BC</span>. He commemorated the deeds of his reign on numerous stelae and prisms. Esarhaddon is mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.37">2 Kings 19:37</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.2">Ezra 4:2</a>, and <a href="?bref=Isa.37.38">Isaiah 37:38</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">ESAU</p>
<p class="fl">Isaac’s son, and the older twin brother of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.24-26">Gn 25:24-26</a>), who was given this name because of the hair on his body at birth. The reddish color of the baby, together with the color appearing in the episode of the lentil soup (v <a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">30</a>), led to the use of the term Edom, or “red.” The Edomites claimed to be descended from Esau, and naming their land Seir may have been an attempt to retain an association with the word <span class="hebrew">sair</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “hairy.”</p>
<p>A proficient hunter, Esau brought tasty wild meat to his father, who enjoyed its stronger flavor much more than that of the mild meat provided from the family flocks by Jacob. On a certain day Esau returned home from an unsuccessful hunting expedition; he was very hungry. Esau was persuaded by Jacob to surrender his birthright in return for food (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.29-34">Gn 25:29-34</a>).</p>
<p>Archaeological information from Nuzi shows that giving up the birthright to another member of the family was not unknown. Esau’s marriage to two local women who were not descendants of Abraham made life extremely difficult for his parents (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.34-35">Gn 26:34-35</a>). This may have been the reason why his mother, Rebekah, decided to coach Jacob to obtain the patriarchal blessing that normally belonged to his elder brother Esau (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-46">27</a>). Esau’s anger on discovering the deception of his brother prompted Jacob to leave for Haran, though 20 years later, through the generous forgiveness of Esau, the brothers were reunited (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.4-16">33:4-16</a>).</p>
<p>At birth Jacob had come into the world grasping the heel of Esau, an omen that was interpreted to show that the Edomite descendants of Esau would be subject to the offspring of Jacob. The subservient relationship between the Edomites and the Israelites in the time of David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.11-15">2 Sm 8:11-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.13">1 Chr 18:13</a>) continued until the time of Jehoram (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">2 Kgs 8:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.8-10">2 Chr 21:8-10</a>). Following a rebellion in 845 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Edomites gained their independence for a while but were reconquered by Amaziah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>). Regaining their freedom in 735 <span class="era">BC</span>, they subsequently remained independent of Judah. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=EdomEdomites_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Edom, Edomites</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Branch of theology concerned with the study of the last things, or end times, whether in relation to the individual or the world.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TopicsofEschatology">Topics of Eschatology</p>
<p class="h3">Death</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible teaches that all humans will die (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.27">Heb 9:27</a>). The only exceptions will be those who are still alive when Christ returns (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.17">1 Thes 4:17</a>). Physical death, or the “first death,” is the separation of the soul from the body. Because of the presence of sin in the world, everyone must die (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12">Rom 5:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Intermediate State</p>
<p class="fl">This refers to the condition of the person between the time of death and the resurrection. The traditional orthodox view is that believers experience a state of conscious bliss in the presence of the Lord, while unbelievers are tormented by separation from the presence of God. This, however, is a relatively incomplete state when compared with the final destiny of each. Some groups, such as Seventh-Day Adventists, have held a belief in a type of “soul sleep,” or unconsciousness, between death and resurrection. Still others, notably Roman Catholics, believe in a place of purging in preparation for the future life.</p>
<p class="h3">The Second Coming</p>
<p class="fl">Scripture teaches that at the end of time Christ will return in a personal, bodily form (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.11">Acts 1:11</a>). No one knows exactly when this will occur, and it will consequently catch some by surprise, coming as a thief in the night (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.39-40">Lk 12:39-40</a>). Although the time is not known, the fact that it will occur is very definite. Many of Jesus’ parables (especially in <a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">Mt 24–25</a>) refer to this fact and to the appropriateness of alert, faithful, and intensive activity.</p>
<p class="h3">The Resurrection</p>
<p class="fl">All who have died will come to life. This will be a bodily resurrection, a resumption of the bodily existence of each person. For believers, this will take place in connection with the second coming of Christ and will involve the transformation of the body of this present flesh into a new, perfected body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-56">1 Cor 15:35-56</a>). The Bible also indicates a resurrection of unbelievers, unto eternal death (<a href="?bref=John.5.28-29">Jn 5:28-29</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Judgment</p>
<p class="fl">There will be a time of judgment in which the Lord will determine the spiritual condition of all who have lived, based on their relationship to him. On these grounds some will be sent off to everlasting reward and others to eternal punishment. Some theologians distinguish between the times when believers and unbelievers will be judged. Some see as many as seven different judgments occurring.</p>
<p class="h3">The Final States</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible teaches the existence of heaven, a place of eternal joy, where Christians are in the presence of God. The Bible also speaks of hell (specifically Gehenna, or the lake of fire), a state of anguished separation of unbelievers from the presence of God. These are fixed states, determined by decisions made within this life.</p>
<p class="h3">The Millennium</p>
<p class="fl">Many Christians believe there will be an earthly reign of Jesus Christ, called the Millennium, immediately preceding the final judgment. This belief is based on <a href="?bref=Rev.20.4-7">Revelation 20:4-7</a>. Those who hold that Christ will return personally to inaugurate this period are called premillennialists. Others, who teach that the kingdom will be established through the progressive successful preaching of the gospel, are termed postmillennialists. Still others, called amillennialists, do not believe that there will be any earthly reign of Christ at all, interpreting the 1,000 years of <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a> symbolically.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="WatchOut"/>
<p class="h3">The Great Tribulation</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible speaks of a time of great anguish or tribulation, which will come upon the earth, exceeding anything that has ever occurred before. Some, identifying this with the 70th week of <a href="?bref=Dan.9.24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, believe it will be of seven years duration. Some believe the church will be present to experience this because the Lord will not return until the end of the period. These are termed posttribulationists. Others, known as pretribulationists, believe that the Lord’s second coming will be in two stages, or phases: (1) Christ will come for his church to take the believers away before the great Tribulation; (2) Christ will then make an open display of his glory before the whole world. Still others, known as midtribulationists, believe that the church will be present for the first half of the seven years but will be removed before the severe part of the Tribulation begins.</p>

<p class="fl">The author or compiler of 1 Esdras is unknown, and scholars disagree about its origin. Three theories seem to summarize the critical debate. Some think that 1 Esdras might be the original Septuagint (ancient Greek Old Testament) version, and that canonical Ezra and Nehemiah reflect the translation and editing of Theodotion, a second-century <span class="era">AD</span> reviser of the Septuagint. Others speculate that 1 Esdras goes back to a now-lost Hebrew text outside the Masoretic Hebrew Text tradition. Most scholars, however, think that 1 Esdras is probably an edited compilation taken from the Septuagint translation of 2 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah.</p>
<p>Esdras (or Ezra, the spelling most familiar to American Protestants) was a descendant of Aaron’s priestly line and one of those (like Nehemiah and Zerubbabel) who led parties of exiled Jews back to Judea from Babylon. His ministry of leadership, and preservation and promulgation of the law, probably can be dated to the latter part of Persian king Artaxerxes I Longimanus’s reign (465–424 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>It is certain that 1 Esdras was written before <span class="era">AD</span> 90 because first-century Jewish historian Josephus quoted from it. The best date for 1 Esdras is probably around 150–100 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">There are four books about Ezra and the history of the postexilic restoration of the Jews in Judea. Two of those books, titled Ezra and Nehemiah in Protestant versions of the Bible, are accepted as canonical by Jews, Roman Catholics, and Protestants alike. The other two books, 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras, were not included in the Hebrew canon of the OT by Jews or by Protestants, who followed Hebrew tradition in identifying the books of the OT. The two Esdras books were included in the Latin Vulgate Bible (a translation from the Hebrew by biblical scholar Jerome completed in <span class="era">AD</span> 404), and when the Roman Catholic Council of Trent (1545–1663) defined the apocryphal books that would be recognized by Catholics as part of the OT Scriptures, 1 and 2 Esdras were included. In the Vulgate, 1 Esdras is called 3 Esdras; Ezra and Nehemiah there are named 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras, respectively.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">First Esdras is a history of the Jews from the reign of King Josiah in Jerusalem (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>) through the postexilic ministry of Ezra, accentuating the career of Ezra and deletes all mention of Nehemiah. Originally written in idiomatic Greek, 1 Esdras retells the material found in <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.1-36.23">2 Chronicles 35:1–36:23</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-10.44">Ezra 1:1–10:44</a> (excluding <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">4:6</a> and placing <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-24">4:7-24</a> before <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.1">2:1</a>), and <a href="?bref=Neh.7.73-8.12">Nehemiah 7:73–8:12</a>. Esdras contains two sections of material, one minor (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.1.23-24">1:23-24</a>) and the other major, not found in the canonical records. The major addition (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.3.1-4.63">3:1–4:63</a>) is a story about three youths who are bodyguards or pages of Darius I of Persia (522–486 <span class="era">BC</span>). They engage in a contest to determine whether wine, royal power, or women are the strongest. The third youth, Zerubbabel, argues for women but adds “truth” as part of his argument, and thereby wins the verbal contest. For his reward he requests permission to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem, which Darius grants. The story concludes with the preparations for Zerubbabel’s temple-building expedition. Thus, 1 Esdras differs from canonical Ezra and Nehemiah by placing Zerubbabel’s return under Darius I rather than under Cyrus (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The core of 2 Esdras (chs <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.3.1-14.48">3–14</a>) possibly was written by a Palestinian Jew. Two additions (chs <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.1-2.48">1–2</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.15.1-16.78">15–16</a>) were written by later, unknown Christian authors. Some students of the text think it may originally have been written in Hebrew, though the extant manuscripts consist only of Greek and Coptic fragments and full Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, and Latin versions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Most textual critics date the Jewish portions of the book to around <span class="era">AD</span> 95–100. Chapters <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.1-40">1</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.2.1-48">2</a> are thought to have been written about <span class="era">AD</span> 200 or later. Chapters <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.15.1-63">15</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.16.1-78">16</a> are variously dated from <span class="era">AD</span> 120 to 300 because they seem to reflect Christian persecution conditions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Second Esdras was written in an apocalyptic style. Jewish or Christian apocalypses, often produced during periods of persecution, portray a certain prophetic viewpoint about God’s ultimate purpose in history, with highly descriptive and symbolic language. Such writings were prevalent between 200 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 350, dates that embraced the persecution of Jews in the Maccabean period, the armed conflict between zealot Judaism and Rome, and persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. A common thread among Jewish apocalypses was the destiny of Israel or Judaism. Second Esdras 14 mentions a restoration of the “sacred books” to Ezra through a series of visions as he prepared to die. Along with 24 OT books, 70 esoteric apocalypses are alluded to, indicating that to the author and his readers the apocalypse was a popular phenomenon. Jews at that time thought that prophecy had come to an end, so the author used a standard apocalyptic device of putting supposed revelations in the mouth of an earlier prophetic figure. Here the author is supposedly Ezra writing 30 years after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians.</p>
<p>The Jewish core of the apocalypse (chs <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.3.1-14.48">3–14</a>) was evidently titled “Ezra the Prophet,” or “The Apocalypse of Ezra.” It became known as 4 Esdras from the Latin Vulgate Bible (a translation from the Hebrew by biblical scholar Jerome completed in <span class="era">AD</span> 404) and is known as 3 Esdras in the Septuagint (the ancient Greek OT). The book is called 2 Esdras in Protestant versions. The Christian additions were sometimes circulated separately. Chapters <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.1.1-40">1</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.2.1-48">2</a> were called 5 Esdras, and chapters <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.15.1-63">15</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.16.1-78">16</a> were titled 6 Esdras. The so-called “Confession of Ezra” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.8.20-36">8:20-36</a>) also circulated separately, adding to the confusion of manuscripts, texts, and editions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The occasion for the writing of 2 Esdras was the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. The book attempts to provide a brighter hope for the Jews’ future.</p>
<p>The Jewish portion of the book grapples with some basic theological questions. Why does God not reward the piety of the faithful instead of letting them suffer under pagan rule? Why does God allow humans to have evil in their hearts? When God gave his law, why did he not remove people’s evil inclination so they could keep the law? Why are humans given understanding but denied answers to these questions? No final answers are given, and Ezra is reminded that God’s ways are inscrutably higher than man’s. Such problems will be solved only in the end-of-the-age occurrences themselves: the manifestation of God’s justice in a 400-year rule by the Messiah, the resurrection, the judgment, and eternal reward in heaven or punishment in Gehenna (hell). Ezra is told that God does rejoice in the righteous few, however, and Ezra and those like him are assured of their salvation.</p>
<p>Second Esdras is considered to be one of the best and most profound of the Jewish apocalypses. Its perceptive theological concern and daring analysis gave it broad appeal in the revelation of things to come. The fourth vision is of a mourning woman who is transformed into the heavenly Jerusalem, typifying Zion’s eventual redemption. In vision five an eagle with 12 wings and three heads—usually thought to be Rome’s Flavian emperors Vespasian (69–79), Titus (79–81), and Domitian (81–96)—is equated with the fourth beast in the book of Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Dn 7</a>). Ezra witnesses the eagle’s destruction by a lion, symbolizing the Messiah. A man rising from the sea and attacked by “an innumerable multitude,” which he destroys, comprises vision six and again speaks of the Messiah’s victories. In the last vision Ezra dictates the contents of 94 sacred books to five specially chosen scribes, and prepares for his assumption into heaven.</p>
<p>Chapters <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.15.1-63">15</a> and <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.16.1-78">16</a> threaten judgment on heathen nations for their unbelief and comfort God’s people who are suffering persecution.</p>

<p class="h1">ESHBAAL</p>
<p class="fl">King Saul’s fourth son, who became Israel’s king after his father’s death. Eshbaal literally means “man of Baal,” or “Baal exists” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.33">1 Chr 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.39">9:39</a>). During the period of the judges and the early monarchy, many Hebrew names were compounded with “baal,” a word that can mean “master” or “possessor.” Later generations were reluctant to speak the name “baal,” so “bosheth” (shame) was substituted (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.2.16-17">Hos 2:16-17</a>). Thus, Eshbaal was altered to Ishbosheth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8">2 Sm 2:8</a>), which means “man of shame.” Perhaps later copyists changed the name in the book of Samuel because it was read aloud in synagogue services, whereas Chronicles was not.</p>
<p>After the death of Saul and his older sons, Abner, commander of Saul’s army, installed Ishbosheth as Israel’s king (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-9">2 Sm 2:8-9</a>). Judah’s tribe, however, followed King David, who struggled with Ishbosheth for leadership of all the tribes. The conflict lasted a long time, but the house of David gradually overwhelmed the house of Saul (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.1">3:1</a>). Abner deserted Ishbosheth and was murdered by Joab, one of David’s men (v <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.27">27</a>), thus removing an important leader of Israel and causing the people to despair (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.1">4:1</a>). Soon afterward Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his captains (v <a href="?bref=2Sam.4.7">7</a>). Although David disapproved of the deaths of Abner and Ishbosheth, the last obstacles to his kingship over all the tribes had been removed.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheName">The Name</p>
<p class="fl">The sect is called <span class="ital">Esseni, Osseni, Ossaei, Essaeans,</span> and other variations; sometimes two different forms are found in the same author. No satisfactory explanation of the name has been given, but a number of scholars tend to prefer “healers,” which hardly seems likely since the term describes the Therapeutae (“Healers”), a sect that was only distantly related to the Essenes, if at all.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SourcesofInformation">Sources of Information</p>
<p class="fl">The principal sources of information about the Essenes are (1) Philo of Alexandria, a Jew who lived in Egypt from about 30 <span class="era">BC</span> to sometime after <span class="era">AD</span> 40, in his works <span class="ital">Let Every Good Man Be Free</span> and <span class="ital">Apology for the Jews;</span> (2) Flavius Josephus, a Jew of Palestine and later of Rome, who lived from <span class="era">AD</span> 37 to about <span class="era">AD</span> 100, in his works <span class="ital">War of the Jews</span> and <span class="ital">Jewish Antiquities</span>—our most extensive sources; (3) Pliny the Elder, a Roman who died in <span class="era">AD</span> 79 and who may have been in Palestine with Titus during the Jewish War, in his <span class="ital">Natural History;</span> and (4) Hippolytus of Rome, in his work <span class="ital">A Refutation of All Heresies,</span> written about <span class="era">AD</span> 230 and largely dependent on Josephus.</p>
<p>Josephus tells us that he determined to know the three Jewish “sects” intimately, so he joined the Essenes when he was 16. But since he was a Pharisee by the time he was 19, and since it took at least three years for the initiatory rites of the Essenes, we must conclude that he did not have time or opportunity to learn much about the inner life of the Essenes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginandHistory">Origin and History</p>
<p class="fl">The first mention of the Essenes, as well as that of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, is in the time of Jonathan (160–143 <span class="era">BC</span>), successor of Judas Maccabeus (see Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.5.9). Josephus calls these groups “sects” (Greek <span class="greek">haireseis</span>), a term that sometimes connotes heretical movements, but this is a later meaning of the word. Luke uses the very same term for Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.5">26:5</a>), Sadducees (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.17">5:17</a>), and Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.5,14">24:5, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.22">28:22</a>).</p>
<p>The Maccabean revolt began in 167 <span class="era">BC</span>. The background of the uprising had been a struggle between the Seleucid Greeks and the Ptolemaic Greeks, with Palestine as the object of the struggle. The Seleucids won in 198 <span class="era">BC</span>, but there were pro-Syrian and pro-Egyptian parties in Judea. Moreover, Hellenism, which was strongly promoted by the Seleucids, had taken a deep hold on many Jews. In order to participate in the athletic games, some Jews even resorted to operations to obliterate the sign of circumcision (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.15">1 Macc 1:15</a>). In 168 the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes sold the Jewish high priesthood to the highest bidder, Menelaus. When this was rejected by the Jewish populace, violent persecution broke out. Somewhere along the line a group of pious Jews came into existence, and they joined the Maccabees in the revolt. We know them as the Hasidim (or Hasideans, Assideans, “pious ones”; cf. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.42">1 Macc 2:42</a>).</p>
<p>Because of numerous similarities in doctrine, it is generally accepted that the Pharisees are either the direct descendants of the Hasidim or one of two or more groups of descendants. It is further generally accepted that the Essenes are a group that split either from the Pharisees or from the Hasidim. Qumran (the community of the Dead Sea Scrolls) is looked upon either as a branch of the Essenes or as another closely related group of separatists whose origin was at approximately the same point in time.</p>
<p>Josephus speaks of only three Jewish sects: Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.2). Therefore, it is often concluded that these were the only Jewish sects at that time. This is a false conclusion. We know of at least seven Jewish sects, and perhaps as many as twelve. There is probably some overlap, and it is not always clear whether a particular group should be described as a religious party (e.g., the Zealots). But we can argue against Josephus’s number of sects by other data he supplies. According to Josephus, there were 6,000 Pharisees (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 17.2.4) and 4,000 Essenes (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.5; cf. Philo’s <span class="ital">Every Good Man</span> 76), and the Sadducees were fewer in number than the Pharisees (cf. <span class="ital">Wars</span> 2.8.14). This would account for, at most, 16,000 persons, and the population of Judea was well beyond that figure. Moreover, Josephus himself speaks of a “fourth philosophy” (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.6), which some scholars identify with the Zealots, although Josephus never does so. We can only conclude that in Josephus’s view there were three principal sects or groups of Jews.</p>
<p>The Essenes left the cities of Palestine and lived in the towns and villages. Pliny locates them west of the Dead Sea and says, “Below them was En-gedi” (<span class="ital">Natural History</span> 5.15.73), a statement that could mean either that En-gedi was at a lower elevation or that it was to the south. Scholars are not unanimous in the interpretation of this statement.</p>

<p class="fl">Admission to the Essenes was a long, complicated process, consisting of one year as a postulant and two additional years of limited participation in the community. The novice took solemn oaths, which included his relationship to God and to his fellow members. He swore to hate the wicked and to love truth, to conceal nothing from the community and to reveal nothing to outsiders, and to transmit doctrines exactly as he received them. Until he took these oaths, he could not touch the food of the community.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CommunityLife">Community Life</p>
<p class="fl">When a new member joined the Essenes, he turned over all property to the community. The individual members were without goods, property, or homes. They lived frugally, having only what was necessary for life. They despised riches, had no slaves, and did not engage in commerce. They worked in fields or at crafts that contributed to peace, and would not make instruments of war. They dwelt in brotherhoods, ate together, held property in common, had a common purse and a common store of clothing. They always wore white clothing.</p>
<p>Evidence is somewhat confusing about their views on marriage. They either banned it entirely or disdained it, counting continence as one of their virtues. There were Essenes who did marry, but these looked upon the marriage relationship as existing only for the purpose of raising children so that the race might continue.</p>
<p>There is also mixed evidence concerning children. According to Philo, they had no children, no adolescents, not even young men. Josephus, on the other hand, tells us that they adopted children, and the Essenes who married raised children of their own.</p>
<p>The Essenes were divided into four lots or ranks and would do nothing unless ordered by superiors, except for works of mercy. They obeyed their elders. Justice was dispensed at an assembly of 100 members or more. For serious offenses the penalty was expulsion from the community, and the expelled member usually starved to death because of the tremendous oaths he had taken.</p>
<p class="h3">A Typical Day</p>
<p class="fl">Josephus describes a typical day in the life of the Essenes. They rose before dawn and recited prayers to the rising sun (which probably is not to be interpreted as sun worship). Then each man worked at his craft until the fifth hour (11 <span class="sc">am</span>). At that time the community assembled, put on linen loincloths, bathed in cold water, and then went to the building that was restricted to members, to a dining hall that was further restricted to those who were pure. Each Essene received bread and one bowlful of food. The priest said a prayer before anyone was permitted to touch the food, and another prayer after the meal. Then the members laid aside their sacred garments and resumed their work until evening. The evening meal was in the same manner as the noon meal. They ate quietly and spoke only in turn, eating and drinking only what they needed to satisfy them.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ReligiousBeliefs">Religious Beliefs</p>
<p class="fl">It is somewhat risky to attempt to reconstruct Essene theology from Josephus and Philo, for both of these writers thought in philosophical rather than theological forms.</p>
<p>The Essenes were not concerned with logic or natural philosophy, but rather devoted themselves to ethics. Josephus likens them to the Greek Pythagoreans (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 15.10.4), but he does not explain this further. The Essenes were concerned with purity and holy minds. They rejected oaths (apparently excepting the tremendous oath they took upon entering the sect), and considered their word sufficient. They observed the seventh day, going to synagogues and sitting according to age. One would read and another explain, making use of symbols and the triple use of definitions (which may be a reference to the rabbinic method of exegesis). They would do no work on the Sabbath. There is confusion concerning the matter of sacrifices; either they did not offer sacrifices (Philo’s <span class="ital">Every Good Man</span>) or they sacrificed among themselves and did not send sacrifices to the temple (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.5). They did send offerings to the temple, according to this same passage in Josephus. The name of the lawgiver (Moses? or God himself?) was an object of great veneration.</p>
<p>The Essenes studied holy books and were skilled at predicting the future. Josephus tells of one Essene, Menahem, who foretold that Herod would be king (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 15.10.5). They also studied the works of the ancients (which appears to mean works other than the Scriptures), and became proficient in the knowledge of healing, of roots, and of stones. The Essenes believed that their souls were immortal; however, as Josephus seems to have understood this doctrine, the body was “corruptible and its constituent matter impermament” (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.8.11), which may imply a denial of the resurrection.</p>
<p>The material available to us is hardly satisfactory for reconstructing Essene theology. It is clear, however, that they were Jews, devoted to the law, but with certain emphases or aberrations that set them apart from both the Pharisees and the Sadducees. They were ascetic, although some of them married, and they were pacifists, although Josephus tells of an Essene named John who was a general in the army (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.20.4). Above all, they were exclusivistic, withdrawing from other Jews and living a communal or communistic type of life.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheEssenesandtheQumranCommunity">The Essenes and the Qumran Community</p>
<p class="fl">There are many similarities between the Essenes and the people of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Both were Jewish sects. Both were communal groups that had withdrawn from the common stream of Judaism. Both were located west of the Dead Sea. Both had long and rigid processes for admission of new members. Both had an oath of admission. Both hated the wicked and loved the members of the community. Both required the handing over of all property to the sect. Both kept their secrets within their own group. The daily life—prayers, ritual bathing, common meals, the study and interpretation of the Bible, and concern with purity—is markedly similar. Scrupulous observance of the Sabbath, the division into ranks or lots, and the authority of elders and superiors are features of each group. Both had a minimum group of ten required for assembly. Both had laws of expulsion for serious offenses.</p>
<p>The differences are also noteworthy and not as often pointed out. Obviously the Qumran community could not have constituted all of the Essenes but were at most a small fraction (perhaps 200) of the 4,000 Essenes. Moreover, they were at best only one of the towns and villages of the Essenes. If Qumranians worked at crafts, we know nothing of it either from their texts or from the archaeology of Qumran. Similarly, we know nothing of their attitude toward war or the implements of war. But we do know from the War Scroll (1QM) that they had an elaborate concept of the final war, with an army, weapons, maneuvers, and the like, and they do not sound like pacifists (cf. 1QS 9:16, 22-23; 10:18; 1QSa 1:19-21). It appears that the Qumranians did engage in commerce (CD 13:14-15). We have no information about any common store of clothing at Qumran. From the Dead Sea literature we know that there were provisions for marriage, for young children, adolescents, and young men. Of course, the Qumranians may have been the marrying Essenes to whom Josephus refers. Admission to the Qumran group was a two-year process; to the Essenes, it was three years.</p>
<p>We know nothing of Qumran prayers to the sun or of daily bathing, although some of the “cisterns” were probably immersion pools. Unlike the Essenes, the Qumranians did use oaths, and there are extended sections on oaths in their literature (CD 9:8-12; 15:1-10; 16:6-18). The Qumran attitude toward sacrifices is not entirely clear, but there is provision for sending sacrifices to the temple. We know of no aversion to oil among the Qumranians, such as is described for the Essenes.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheEssenesAndChristianity"/>
<p>There is no evidence that the Qumranians used triple definitions in their biblical interpretation. There is a minimum use of symbols in their writings. There is no evidence that they studied the knowledge of healing, roots, or stones. If they were experts at predicting the future, we have no record of it.</p>
<p>The seating arrangement at Qumran was by rank and not by age, as among the Essenes. Rank was altered by an annual examination at Qumran. There is no indication that justice at Qumran was handled by 100 men; rather, it seems to have been administered by a council of 15 (1QS 8:1) or 10 (CD 9:4-5).</p>
<p>In view of the similarities, we must conclude that there was some kind of relationship between the Essenes and the Qumran community. In view of the differences, we are forced to the conclusion that they were not exactly the same. There are several possible explanations: (1) The Essenes and the Qumranians may have started out as the same split-off from the Hasidim, and then later split again. In fact, the Dead Sea Scrolls, particularly the Damascus Document (CD), hint at some kind of split in the earlier period of the group. (2) The Essenes of Josephus and Philo are about a century later than the literature of the Qumranians, and may have altered somewhat during that period of time. (3) The Essenes were located in a number of towns and villages and they may have developed significant local variations, so that Josephus may have drawn his description from one location, Philo and Pliny from others, while the Qumran group represents yet another local variant form. There is little to guide a preference for any one of these explanations.</p>

<p class="h1">ESTHER (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of two names borne by the Jewish queen of Persia. Hadassah (Hebrew “Myrtle”) apparently was her Jewish name (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.7">Est 2:7</a>), and Esther (Persian “Star”) her name as queen of Persia. Some scholars speculate about a connection with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, since exiled Jews were occasionally given pagan names (see <a href="?bref=Dan.1.7">Dn 1:7</a>).</p>
<p>Esther was an orphan from the tribe of Benjamin who lived with the Jewish exiles in Persia. She was reared by her cousin Mordecai, a minor government official and covert leader of the Jewish community (see <a href="?bref=Esth.3.5-6">Est 3:5-6</a>) in Susa, capital of the Persian kingdom. Esther became queen after King Ahasuerus (Xerxes) became displeased with Queen Vashti when she refused to obey his command to attend a banquet (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.11-12">1:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>After Esther’s coronation, she discreetly won Xerxes’ confidence by informing him of an assassination plot (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.21-23">Est 2:21-23</a>). The favor she won in the king’s eyes enabled her to deliver her family and her people from a massacre by Haman, a high official to the king.</p>
<p>The Feast of Purim was instituted to celebrate God’s deliverance of his people through Esther and Mordecai. This festival is still observed annually by Jews.</p>

  <title>Esther, Additions to</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ESTHER, Additions to</p>
<p class="fl">Six passages of about 105 verses added to the Hebrew text of Esther. The Additions to Esther was apparently the work of a Jewish writer eager to supply a spiritual and universal note that was thought to be lacking in the book. Some scholars assert that the additions were originally written in Greek, while others maintain they were translated from Hebrew or possibly Aramaic. The date cannot be determined with certainty, although 100 <span class="era">BC</span> is generally suggested, which would place them considerably later than the canonical Esther.</p>
<p>A summary of the additions is as follows:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=AddEsth.11.2-12.6">11:2–12:6</a>: Mordecai’s dream, including the plot against the king’s life. This passage preceded <a href="?bref=Esth.1.1">Esther 1:1</a>.</p>
<p class="list">2. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=AddEsth.13.1-7">13:1-7</a>: The edict of Artaxerxes. This addition follows <a href="?bref=Esth.3.13">Esther 3:13</a>, where the king is called Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="list">3. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=AddEsth.13.8-14.19">13:8–14:19</a>: The prayers of Mordecai and Esther. This passage was to be inserted after <a href="?bref=Esth.4.17">Esther 4:17</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=AddEsth.15.1-16">15:1-16</a>: The king’s anger at Esther’s appearance, and his subsequent change of attitude. This was to be inserted before <a href="?bref=Esth.5.3">Esther 5:3</a>, since it is an expansion of <a href="?bref=Esth.5.1-2">Esther 5:1-2</a>.</p>
<p class="list">5. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=AddEsth.16.1-24">16:1-24</a>: The edict of Ahasuerus relating to the Jews. This section was to follow <a href="?bref=Esth.8.12">8:12</a>.</p>
<p class="list">6. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=AddEsth.10.4-11.1">10:4–11:1</a>: The interpretation of Mordecai’s dream. This addition follows <a href="?bref=Esth.10.3">10:3</a>.</p>
<p class="sp">The additions contain discrepancies that make it clear they were never part of the original Esther. These can be seen as follows:</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Esther is an anonymous composition. The reference in <a href="?bref=Esth.9.20">9:20</a> that Mordecai “recorded these things” implies that part, if not all, of the book was written by him. The absence of God’s name in the book of Esther may be due to the fact that the author intended the book to become part of the official Persian court record. The use of God’s name might have prevented that from happening.</p>
<p>The author of the book had considerable knowledge of Persian court life and customs. Thus, Mordecai might be identified with a Morduka mentioned as a Persian court official in the reign of Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Xerxes (486–464 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandPurpose">Date, Origin, and Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Immediate impressions favor a date for the book of Esther shortly after 465 <span class="era">BC</span>, if Ahasuerus is identified with Xerxes, who died that year. Many contemporary scholars, however, favor a later date. The apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus, written about 180 <span class="era">BC</span>, refers to that period. Jewish heroes are mentioned there, but Esther and Mordecai are not included. Some also suggest the period of the Maccabees as the time of the book’s writing. Others have identified it with a cultic story from ancient Babylon, associating Esther with the goddess Ishtar and Mordecai with the god Marduk. The earliest postbiblical reference to the Feast of Purim is <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.15.36">2 Maccabees 15:36</a>, probably written about 75 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The book of Esther claims to record events in Persia sometime during the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, surrounding the selection of Esther as queen. If a later date is preferred, the book can be viewed as written to encourage Jews during a time of persecution. One definite purpose of the book of Esther is to explain the origin of the Jewish Feast of Purim (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.16-28">Est 9:16-28</a>). The term “purim” is probably related to the Assyrian word <span class="ital">puru,</span> meaning a small stone used for casting lots.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Canonicity">Canonicity</p>
<p class="fl">The major theological problem with the book of Esther is the absence of any mention of God and the lack of even an intimation of divine providence. As a result, some scholars in both Jewish and Christian circles question its canonicity. But closer observation reveals an obvious providential dimension in the book. The reference to fasting in <a href="?bref=Esth.4.16">4:16</a>, for example, implies prayer as well as abstinence from food. Esther’s being in the right place at the right time is no accident. The fall of Haman is also not accidental. On the negative side, the extreme measures taken in hanging Haman’s sons reflects a collective view of guilt that is not acceptable today (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.13-14">9:13-14</a>). Implicit, too, is the theme of God’s protection of his covenant people even in times of persecution. That fact has made the book of Esther a favorite of Jews throughout history.</p>
<p>Its practical implications, however, have not kept some from questioning the book’s genuineness as a part of the Bible. The book of Esther appears in the third part of the Jewish canon, as part of the five scrolls known as the Megilloth; its companions there are Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Lamentations. The Septuagint (Greek version of the OT) contains 107 extra verses in the book of Esther. These additions form part of the Apocrypha in English versions of the Bible. Even as late as the Reformation era, Esther’s canonicity was being debated, and some contemporary evangelicals have raised doubts about its value. Its canonicity is favored by (1) its history of acceptance in both Judaism and the Christian church, and (2) its illustrative value for teaching God’s providential care of the Jewish people (see <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">Rom 9–11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-17">Rv 7</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1-20">14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">A number of historical problems have been noted: (1) Xerxes’ known wife was named Amestris, according to the historian Herodotus. But it is likely that the king had more than one wife. (2) The implication that Mordecai went into exile in 597 <span class="era">BC</span> would have made him about 120 years old during the reign of Xerxes. But the text of <a href="?bref=Esth.2.5-6">2:5-6</a> might mean that Mordecai’s great-grandfather was the original exile rather than Mordecai. (3) Various details seem fanciful to some modern readers: a banquet lasting 180 days; Esther’s 12-month beauty treatment; a gallows 83 feet (25.3 meters) tall; the Jews killing 75,000 of Xerxes’ subjects (see <a href="?bref=Esth.1.4">1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.7,12">2:7, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.9.16">9:16</a>). But what appears mythological sometimes turns out to be historical.</p>
<p>Several elements in the book of Esther point to a genuinely historical setting for the book. Ahasuerus is usually identified with Xerxes. Xerxes’ father was Darius, from whom have come some notable inscriptions and relief sculptures, one of them showing Darius seated on his throne with Xerxes standing behind him. Xerxes is believed to have been a weak-willed man in domestic affairs, easily influenced by flattering and scheming courtiers. On the field of battle, however, he was a vigorous leader who ferociously pursued his objectives. His energetic suppression of a revolt in Egypt was a prelude to mustering a navy to attack Athens. Only the skill and daring of the Greek forces at the naval battle of Salamis (480 <span class="era">BC</span>) saved Greece from complete Persian occupation. Xerxes eventually lost the war and retired to his elegant palaces at Persepolis and Susa. He rejected the traditional gods of Egypt and Babylon and became a devotee of Ahuramazda, the Persian spirit of good.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Esther portrays the reign of King Ahasuerus, whose empire stretched from India to Ethiopia (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.1-9">1:1-9</a>). The center of his empire was in Susa (Shushan), in Persia. Because Queen Vashti disgraced the king by refusing his order to appear in court, she was removed, and a search began for a new queen (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.10-22">1:10-22</a>). A young Jewish woman named Hadassah, without parents and living with her kinsman Mordecai, was selected to replace Queen Vashti (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.1-18">2:1-18</a>). Early in her reign Esther and Mordecai helped to save the king’s life (vv <a href="?bref=Esth.2.19-23">19-23</a>). A man named Haman, who was promoted to an influential position in the palace court, plotted to kill the Jews because he hated Mordecai (ch <a href="?bref=Esth.3.1-15">3</a>). Mordecai intervened through Queen Esther, and the queen called on the Jews in Susa to fast for deliverance (ch <a href="?bref=Esth.4.1-17">4</a>). Esther’s intervention with the king led to a sleepless night for Ahasuerus (<a href="?bref=Esth.5.1-6.1">5:1–6:1</a>). He reviewed the records of “memorable deeds,” and discovered that Mordecai’s earlier help had gone unrewarded. When Haman arrived to initiate his plot against the Jews, the king ordered him to honor Mordecai (ch <a href="?bref=Esth.6.1-14">6</a>). When Haman’s plot was then discovered, the schemer was hanged (ch <a href="?bref=Esth.7.1-10">7</a>). The king honored Mordecai and sent out an edict protecting the Jews from harm (ch <a href="?bref=Esth.8.1-17">8</a>). The Jews, by the king’s permission, killed the soldiers who would earlier have killed them in Haman’s plot (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.1-16">9:1-16</a>). To celebrate their national deliverance, the Jews planned a great celebration (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.17-10.3">9:17–10:3</a>). That celebration became the Festival of Purim—a time of feasting and distribution of gifts to all, especially to the poor.</p>

  <title>Eternal Life</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ETERNAL LIFE</p>
<p class="fl">Mode of existence referred to in Scripture characterized by either timelessness or immortality; kind of life attributed to God and distributed to believers. The perspective of the biblical writers flowed from an understanding of a living God who existed prior to the world’s creation and who will continue to exist when the end of time arrives. God’s gift to those who are obedient and responsible to him is designated as “eternal life” or some such synonym. John’s Gospel provides the most definitive material on eternal life.</p>
<p>The phrase “eternal life” occurs only once in the Greek version of the OT (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Dn 12:2</a>, with the basic meaning of “the life of the age,” designating the life of the age beyond the resurrection from the dead). The primary meaning of “life” in the OT, however, is the quality of well-being in earthly existence.</p>
<p>In the intertestamental period, the rabbinic distinction between “this age” and “the age which is to come” emphasized that the concept of life in the new age consists of a qualitative, rather than simply a quantitative, distinction from the present age.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated “eternal” is derived from the word for “age” or “eon.” The setting of the NT within the context of Judaism, with its concept of a living God and the consequent promise of “the age which is to come,” gives depth and color to the meaning of the adjective “eternal.” Jesus Christ’s coming as God’s definitive revelation brings the possibility of the qualities of life in the future messianic age into present reality.</p>
<p>The rich young ruler came to Jesus and asked for directions on how to inherit eternal life (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.17">Mk 10:17</a>). He was obviously thinking of resurrection in the age to come. Jesus answered in the same terms (v <a href="?bref=Mark.10.30">30</a>).</p>
<p>In his response to the rich young ruler, Jesus equated the reception of eternal life with entrance into the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-25">Mk 10:23-25</a>). The kingdom of God is not simply a future event but is already inaugurated in Jesus’ life, ministry, and teachings. The kingdom is a gift of life available while the follower still lives within the present age. Many of Jesus’ parables emphasize this point (e.g., those in <a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-58">Mt 13</a>). The Beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">5:3-12</a>) reinforce the concept of a present blessedness that includes salvation, forgiveness, and righteousness. Thus eternal life is a present blessing available to those who submit to God’s reign and are enjoying the blessing of this new era of salvation before the final consummation at the present age’s end.</p>
<p>The definitive discussion of eternal life comes from John’s Gospel. John’s purpose delineates the crucial significance of the concept: “But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name” (<a href="?bref=John.20.31">Jn 20:31</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The earliest Johannine reference to eternal life is found in <a href="?bref=John.3.15">John 3:15</a>.</p>
<p>John clearly shared in the Jewish expectation of the age to come with its anticipated blessings (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.3.36">Jn 3:36</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.29,39">5:29, 39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.27">6:27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.25">12:25</a>). Eternal life is defined by the special gifts of the messianic age when it arrives at consummation. Lazarus’s resurrection (ch <a href="?bref=John.11.1-57">11</a>) was a living parable demonstrating the future life available to those who trust in Christ. Martha, before her brother’s actual resurrection, asserted her belief that Lazarus would be raised on the last day (v <a href="?bref=John.11.24">24</a>). Jesus responded that he himself is the resurrection and the life, and that those who believe in him will never die, even if they die physically (vv <a href="?bref=John.11.25-26">25-26</a>).</p>
<p>The central emphasis of John’s Gospel, however, does not lie in the anticipated future but in the present experience of that future life. The life of the age to come is already available in Christ to the believer. The metaphors with which Jesus defined his own mission emphasize the present new life: living water that is a spring of water welling up to eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.4.10-14">Jn 4:10-14</a>); living bread that satisfies the world’s spiritual hunger (<a href="?bref=John.6.35-40">6:35-40</a>); the light of the world who leads his followers into the light of life (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>); the good shepherd who brings abundant life (<a href="?bref=John.10.10">10:10</a>); the life giver who raises the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>); the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>); and the genuine vine who sustains those who abide in him (<a href="?bref=John.15.5">15:5</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus was very careful to note that the accomplishment of his mission did not rest in his own nature and ability but in the Father who sent him. Jesus’ submission to the Father highlights again the fact that life is a gift of God. Those who believe in the Son of God are recipients of the life that God alone gives—eternal life. Thus the promise of resurrection for all believers, made explicit in Lazarus’s resurrection and guaranteed in Christ’s resurrection as the “firstfruits” (in Pauline terminology, <span class="sc">kjv</span> <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">1 Cor 15:23</a>), is the natural consequence of God’s gift (<a href="?bref=John.5.26-29">Jn 5:26-29</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus added further content to the concept of eternal life by connecting it with knowing the true God (<a href="?bref=John.17.3">Jn 17:3</a>). In Greek thought, knowledge referred to the result of either contemplation or mystical ecstasy. In the OT, however, knowledge meant experience, relationship, fellowship, and concern (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.31.34">Jer 31:34</a>). This connotation of knowledge as intimate relationship is underlined by the usage of the verb form to designate sexual relations between male and female (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.4.1">Gn 4:1</a>). Jesus stated, “I am the good shepherd; I know my own and my own know me, as the Father knows me and I know the Father” (<a href="?bref=John.10.14-15">Jn 10:14-15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The intimate and mutual relationship of Father and Son is the model for the relationship of the Son and his disciples. This knowledge does not come by education or manipulation of the mind but by revelation through the Son (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">1:18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.14.7">14:7</a>).</p>
<p>A brief survey of the primary elements in the concept of eternal life clearly shows that it is not simply an endless or everlasting life. Although there are no final boundaries to eternal life, the Bible’s primary emphasis is on the quality of life, especially its divine elements. Eternal life is the importation of the qualities of the age to come into the present through the revelation of a faithful God in Christ, and it brings knowledge of God’s relationship with him.</p>

<p class="h1">ETERNITY</p>
<p class="fl">Duration of time that cannot be measured.</p>
<p>The OT does not have a single word corresponding to our English word “eternity.” The concept grows out of such expressions as “from generation to generation” and “from age to age.” The understanding of God as the Creator and controller of history led to the understanding of his endless life span. Thus, God himself is designated by the adjective “eternal” (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.21.33">Gn 21:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.4">Is 26:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.28">40:28</a>). The Hebrews simply understood that God is the God of the past and the God who will always be—in stark contrast to humans whose days on earth are limited.</p>
<p>The NT picked up these concepts from Judaism and the OT. In Greek the same root word is used to describe the ages of time and God’s agelessness. For example, the word “eternal” used in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.26">Romans 16:26</a> comes from the Greek root transliterated into English as “eon.” The God who rules the ages or eons is himself the ageless one who brings continuity and stability into the human life so severely bounded by this age. The clear understanding that time will come to an end, provided by NT revelation, added to the OT’s vivid understanding of creation, serves to underline and clarify the concept of an eternal God. God’s preexistence and postexistence is yet another way of expressing his eternal being.</p>
<p>The NT regularly spoke of the temporal sequences of God’s revelation in Christ in much the same way as the OT spoke of God’s self-revelation to Israel. The NT usage of prepositions with “eon” is particularly instructive: for example (translated literally) “out of the age” (<a href="?bref=John.9.32">Jn 9:32</a>), “from the age” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.70">Lk 1:70</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.21">Acts 3:21</a>), “into the age” (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.13">Jude 1:13</a>), “into the ages” (<a href="?bref=John.4.14">Jn 4:14</a>). The first two phrases reflect an indefinite time preceding the present moment, and the last two point to a future indefinable time (often translated as “forever”).</p>
<p>The biblical concept of eternity stands in contrast to that of other cultures of the time, which often thought in cyclical terms. The Greek world particularly thought of time in the analogy of a circle—an ever-recurring sequence of events. Salvation was to find an exit from that vicious cycle, thus being freed from time in order to experience timelessness. The biblical concept pictures time as a line with beginning and end guaranteed by the eternal God. Thus, in the biblical view, salvation could not occur within a designated sequence; it only occurs in the experience of the individual and moves on to the historical consummation directed by the eternal God.</p>
<p>The contrast between Greek and biblical ways of viewing time raises the question of the exact nature of eternity. Is it to be understood as merely unlimited time or, in direct contrast to present time, as timelessness? The biblical view seems to be that eternity is not timelessness and does not stand in contrast to present time as its opposite, since present time and eternity share basic qualities.</p>
<p>The NT (following Judaism) uses “eon” or “age” to divide time into “this present eon” and “the eon that is about to be” or “the coming eon.” The contrast is not simply between time and timelessness, for the “eon that is about to be” is future and shares a specific and identifiable character. The biblical picture of the start of the “coming age” is dramatically painted with broad sequential brush strokes. The new age is not simply a restoration to the primitive and naive innocence of the earliest stage, but a consummation according to the purposes of him who is and who was and who is to come (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.4">Rv 1:4</a>). Thus, it is designated as the new creation.</p>
<p>The NT clearly teaches that the “age that is to be” has now begun in the life and ministry of Christ, although there is a definite overlap in the two ages. The frequency of such terms as “the firstfruits,” “the earnest of the Spirit,” and “the last days,” reflects this understanding (e.g., <a href="?bref=Heb.6.5">Heb 6:5</a>: “and have tasted . . . the powers of the age to come”). The believer enjoys the blessings of the future age imported into the present through Christ’s redemptive work.</p>
<p>The concept of eternity, then, does not stand in opposition and contrast to time as timelessness. Eternity is the unlimited and incalculable space of time bounded at its beginning by the introduction of the kingdom of God in Christ and stretching out into the unlimited future. Both time (“the present evil age,” <a href="?bref=Gal.1.4">Gal 1:4</a>) and eternity are governed by God as the Lord of all time, the one who gives content and meaning to both.</p>

<p class="h1">ETHIOPIA</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT, Ethiopia was generally referred to as Cush (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.6">Gn 10:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.8">1 Chr 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), which is a transliteration of the only Hebrew word used to describe the land lying to the south of Egypt. The Greek version, however, spoke of this territory as Ethiopia and kept the name Cush for the lists of peoples in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.6-8">Genesis 10:6-8</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.8-10">1 Chronicles 1:8-10</a>. English translations have generally followed the Greek, except in cases where Cushi appears as a personal name (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.21-23,31-32">2 Sm 18:21-23, 31-32</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Location">Location</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew name <span class="hebrew">Cush</span> is actually an old Egyptian loanword that came into use in the early Middle Kingdom period. At that time it was used of a small area between the second and third cataracts of the Nile. Later on, in the New Kingdom period (c. 1570–1160 <span class="era">BC</span>), it was applied to a larger area that extended some distance to the south. This broader designation corresponds geographically to the modern lands of Nubia and northern Sudan. It is misleading to think that the Ethiopia of Scripture is the same territory as the Ethiopia of modern times, which in an earlier period was called Abyssinia. The name Ethiopia was of Greek origin, and according to some interpreters means “burnt-faced” (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.8.27">Acts 8:27</a>). This tradition has been perpetuated by the Arabic name Beled es Sudan, or “land of the blacks,” from which the designation Sudan comes.</p>
<p>The use of Cush by the OT writers seems to have paralleled the Egyptian geographical terminology in naming an arid land stretching south to Aswan, the Syene of <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.10">Ezekiel 29:10</a>. The borders of Ethiopia were never clearly defined, even by the Egyptians, so the territory may be regarded as extending to some indeterminate point in the Sudan beyond Meroé.</p>
<p>Ethiopia consisted predominantly of desert lying east of the Nile, and the topography of the region made travel hazardous. Even the river itself presented obstacles to navigation in the form of cataracts. Outcroppings of hard stone forced the Nile down narrow channels and produced rough water that swamped boats easily. Such forbidding natural obstacles protected Egypt against invasion from the south but also gave an inhospitable character to Ethiopia. Almost all the land suitable for farming in Egyptian Nubia and part of northern Sudan was inundated, and the Nubians were compelled to move below Aswan to Kom Ombo.</p>
<p>Since the area covered by Nubia is predominantly desert, it is hardly surprising that the rainfall is minimal, except for the upstream areas. The territory around Meroé, which was the capital during the Meroitic period, experiences seasonal rains; an area bordered on the west and north by the Nile and the Atbara, the so-called “island of Meroé,” was apparently quite fertile in antiquity and may have been heavily forested.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalReferences">Biblical References</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Esth.1.1">Esther 1:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Esth.8.9">8:9</a>, Ethiopia is described as the most distant southwesterly province in the Persian Empire. Its “rivers” were presumably the Nile and the Atbara (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.18.1">Is 18:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.10">Zep 3:10</a>). The products of Cush were referred to in <a href="?bref=Job.28.19">Job 28:19</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.45.14">Isaiah 45:14</a>, which according to Egyptian lists included semiprecious stones, animals, and agricultural products. Some prophets expected exiled Jews in Ethiopia to return (<a href="?bref=Ps.87.4">Ps 87:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.11">Is 11:11</a>), while others foresaw divine judgment coming upon the land (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.3">Is 20:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.4">Ez 30:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.12">Zep 2:12</a>). But since Cush was under God’s sovereignty, it could hope for divine blessing as well as punishment—hence, the expectation in <a href="?bref=Ps.68.31">Psalm 68:31</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.45.14">Isaiah 45:14</a>, and <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.10">Zephaniah 3:10</a> that its peoples would be converted to the Hebrew faith. The Ethiopia of <a href="?bref=Acts.8.27">Acts 8:27</a> was the kingdom of Candace (“queen”), who ruled from Meroé, where the capital of Cush had been moved about 300 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

  <title>Euphrates River</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EUPHRATES RIVER</p>
<p class="fl">Largest river in western Asia, formed by the union of two rivers in Asia Minor, the Kara-Su and the Murat-Suyu. Its source is in central Armenia. The river flows generally in a southeasterly direction for some 1,800 miles (2,896.2 kilometers) until it reaches the Persian Gulf. At Korna, about 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) from the gulf, it joins with the Tigris River. The Euphrates is shallow until it combines with the Tigris and can be navigated for about 1,200 miles (1,930.8 kilometers) by small boats only. After the union of the Tigris and Euphrates, ocean liners can proceed as far as Basra. Melting snows at the source cause the river to rise from about the middle of March until about June. Control and storage of water in flood canals during the overflow of the river made possible abundant harvests that sustained large populations in antiquity.</p>
<p>The Euphrates was one of four branches issuing from the river that watered the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.14">Gn 2:14</a>). In the promises made to Abraham, the northern boundary of the land of Israel was to be the upper division of the river (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.18">Gn 15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.7">Dt 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.24">11:24</a>). These boundaries were approximately reached during the period of kings David and Solomon (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3">2 Sm 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.16">10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.24">1 Kgs 4:24</a>). The Euphrates is called “the river” (<a href="?bref=Num.22.5">Nm 22:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.24">Dt 11:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.3,14">Jos 24:3, 14</a>) or “the great river” (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.4">Jos 1:4</a>). People living east of the Euphrates referred to Israel and its surrounding territories to the west as “beyond the river” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.10">Ezr 4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.7-9">Neh 2:7-9</a>). It was to this river that Jeremiah sent Seraiah with a book of prophecies relating to the destruction of Babylon. After reading them, Seraiah was told to throw the book into the Euphrates as a symbol of the way Babylon would sink to rise no more (<a href="?bref=Jer.51.63">Jer 51:63</a>).</p>
<p>Two NT references to the Euphrates appear in the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.14">Rv 9:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.12">16:12</a>).</p>

  <title>Evangelist</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EVANGELIST</p>
<p class="fl">NT term referring to one who proclaims the gospel of Jesus Christ. There are only three occurrences of the word in the NT. The apostle Paul exhorted the Ephesian church to walk worthy of their calling (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.1-12">Eph 4:1-12</a>). The exhortation stressed the gifts given to each within the unity of the Spirit. Paul explained that the ascended Christ has given “some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers” (v <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">11</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>). Paul was saying that Christ calls persons to these ministries and gives them to the church. The evangelist is one of Christ’s gifts to the church. The meaning of the term indicates that the task of such a person is to function as a spokesperson for the church in proclaiming the gospel to the world. An evangelist is similar to an apostle in function, except that being an apostle involved a personal relationship to Jesus during his earthly ministry (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.21-22">Acts 1:21-22</a>). The evangelist stands in contrast to the pastor/teacher. The former makes the initial proclamation, and the latter provides continuing follow-up ministry that develops maturity in the believer. The reference to Philip the evangelist (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.8">21:8</a>) supports the idea of evangelism as a gifted ministry to which Christ calls some in the church.</p>
<p>More than one gift or ministry may be performed by the same person. Paul charged Timothy with his responsibilities as a pastor and teacher, and also exhorted him to “do the work of an evangelist” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.5">2 Tm 4:5</a>). Therefore, “evangelist” can refer to a person called to that distinct ministry, and also to a function that may be performed by others.</p>

  <title>Eve</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EVE</p>
<p class="fl">First woman, “the mother of all living” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.20">Gn 3:20</a>). The book of Genesis recounts that after God had finished his creation of Adam, he saw that it was not good for Adam to be alone. He decided to create “a helper fit for him” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.18">2:18</a>). The woman is called <span class="hebrew">ezer</span> (in Hebrew lit. “help”), a word that appears elsewhere in the OT in reference to God as Israel’s help. Causing Adam to fall into a deep sleep, God took one of his ribs and used it to fashion Eve (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.2.21-25">21-25</a>).</p>
<p>Eve was given two names by Adam. The first was “woman,” a generic designation with theological connotations that denote her relationship to man (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.23">Gn 2:23</a>). The second, Eve (“life”), was given after the fall and refers to her role in the procreation of the human race (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.20">3:20</a>).</p>
<p>Adam and Eve are pictured as living in Eden, serving God and fulfilling each other’s needs. Then evil entered when Eve was tempted by the serpent to disobey God’s command, which forbade their eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.17">Gn 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.3">3:3</a>). Tricked by the serpent’s subtle persuasion, Eve transgressed God’s will by eating the fruit. Adam did the same when she brought some to him, although he was not deceived as she had been. Both then recognized their nakedness and made garments of fig leaves.</p>
<p>When God came to commune with them, they hid from him. When he demanded an account, Adam blamed Eve, and Eve blamed the serpent. God told Eve that as a result of their sin, childbirth would be a painful experience and her husband would rule over her (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16">Gn 3:16</a>). Eve later became the mother of Cain, Abel, Seth, and other children (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.1-2,25">4:1-2, 25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.5.4">5:4</a>).</p>
<p>Eve is mentioned twice in the NT. In his letter to Timothy, the apostle Paul referred to her when discussing whether or not women could teach (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.13">1 Tm 2:13</a>). He said that a woman could not teach or have authority over a man because of man’s priority in creation and Eve’s responsibility for the original transgression (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.3">2 Cor 11:3</a>).</p>

  <title>Exaltation of Christ*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EXALTATION OF CHRIST*</p>
<p class="fl">The glory and dominion which Jesus attained subsequent to the completion of his earthly work of suffering and death. It is at one and the same time the consummation of his redemptive sacrifice and the reward of his full obedience to the will of the Father. The exaltation thus includes the biblical doctrines of Jesus’ resurrection, ascension, and heavenly enthronement.</p>
<p>During his earthly ministry, Jesus predicted not only that he would suffer, die, and be buried (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.51">6:51</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.11">10:11</a>; etc.) but also that he would thereafter be exalted by the power of the Father to heavenly dominion and glory (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.26">Lk 24:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.5">Jn 17:5</a>). This humiliation-exaltation pattern was plainly indicated by Jesus on the occasion of his encounter with a delegation of proselytes who sought to meet with the Lord (<a href="?bref=John.12.20-36">Jn 12:20-36</a>). Jesus far exceeded the expectations of these Greeks by declaring that fellowship with his Father would be extended to the Gentiles in consequence of his imminent passion and resurrection. By affirming, “The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified” (<a href="?bref=John.12.23">Jn 12:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), Jesus indicated that he would be endowed with honor and splendor at his exaltation to the presence of the Father in heaven. Jesus’ teaching in respect to his exaltation to heaven provided the foundation for the church’s more explicit teaching on the subject.</p>
<p>The resurrection, the initial event in the exaltation of Jesus, is one of the central affirmations of NT teaching (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.24,32">Acts 2:24, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.15">3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.10">4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.4">1 Cor 15:4</a>). From apostolic times Christians have consistently affirmed that at a particular moment in time and in a given place its founder literally passed from a state of death to a state of endless life. The absolute uniqueness of Christ’s exaltation via bodily resurrection from the dead sets Christianity in a class by itself among the religions of the world. A reading of the NT plainly indicates that Jesus openly predicted that death was unable to defeat him. To the skeptical Jews who demanded from Jesus a sign of the authority by which he purged the temple, the Lord answered: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up” (<a href="?bref=John.2.19">Jn 2:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). After Peter’s crucial confession of Christ’s divine sonship at Caesarea Philippi, Jesus gave to his followers a more detailed account of the divine plan whereby he would be raised from the dead on the third day (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21">Mt 16:21</a>). To the disciples who assembled in Galilee shortly after his transfiguration, Jesus spoke plainly of his forthcoming exaltation: “The Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day” (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.22-23">17:22-23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In the NT, the apostolic teaching about Christ’s death is almost always accompanied by an emphasis upon the certainty of his physical resurrection after three days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the NT writers were careful to spell out the profound theological significance of Christ’s exaltation in resurrection: (1) it demonstrates Christ’s certain power over death and the grave (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.24">Acts 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.54-56">1 Cor 15:54-56</a>); (2) it confirms the validity of Christ’s teachings, particularly his claims to divine Sonship (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.36">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>); (3) it represents God’s ultimate vindication of his obedient, suffering servant (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.8-9">Phil 2:8-9</a>); (4) it is the means of the justification (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>) and regeneration (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1 Pt 1:3</a>) of the believer; and (5) it is the guarantee of the future resurrection of the Christian (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.5">Rom 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.22-24">1 Cor 15:22-24</a>). The effective cause of Christ’s resurrection is declared to be, on one hand, God (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.10">Ps 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.32">Acts 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.19-20">Eph 1:19-20</a>) and, on the other hand, our Lord himself (<a href="?bref=John.2.19">Jn 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.17-18">10:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>The ascension represents the second phase of the exaltation of Christ. According to the two NT historical accounts (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.50-51">Lk 24:50-51</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.9-11">Acts 1:9-11</a>), 40 days after his death Jesus left his disciples for the last time and ascended into heaven. Jesus, who several times in John’s Gospel specifically refers to his ascension (<a href="?bref=John.3.13">Jn 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.62">6:62</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.12">14:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.17">20:17</a>), regarded the place to which he would depart as an actual locality in the heavenly realm (<a href="?bref=John.14.2">14:2</a>). In his reflection upon this second stage of the exaltation intimated by <a href="?bref=Ps.68.18">Psalm 68:18</a>, the apostle Paul associates the ascension with Christ’s triumph over his foes and the bestowal of spiritual gifts to the church (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.8">Eph 4:8</a>). The victor triumphantly returned to his Father’s throne in order to bless his people. In what may be part of an early Christian hymn, Paul explicates what he regards as the supreme “mystery” of the Christian faith, namely, that Christ Jesus who “was manifested in the flesh” was at the close of his life “taken up into glory” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Tm 3:16</a>).</p>
<p>Alone among the writings of the NT, the Epistle to the Hebrews associates Christ’s ascension with his high priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. He who steadfastly withstood every earthly trial, having “passed through the heavens,” is fully able to empathize with his people and impart grace to the tempted and distraught (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-16">Heb 4:14ff</a>.). Employing the symbolism of the ancient Hebrew sanctuary, the writer conceptualizes the Ascension as the event whereby Christ enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.19">6:19</a>), bringing with him his own blood (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.12">9:12</a>), to the end that he might appear in the presence of God on our behalf (v <a href="?bref=Heb.9.24">24</a>).</p>
<p>The NT thus attributes considerable theological significance to this phase of Christ’s exaltation. By virtue of his exaltation to the Father, Christ (1) demonstrated his defeat of every earthly enemy (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.8">Eph 4:8</a>); (2) sent the promised Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.16.7">Jn 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.33">Acts 2:33</a>), which awaited his glorification (<a href="?bref=John.7.39">Jn 7:39</a>); and (3) formally undertook his heavenly priestly ministry (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.20">Heb 6:20</a>).</p>
<p>The third stage of Christ’s exaltation is his heavenly enthronement at the right hand of the Father. Following his passion, death, resurrection, and ascension to the heavenly realm, Christ is represented in Scripture as having taken his seat at the Father’s right hand. The biblical phrase “right hand of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.55-56">Acts 7:55-56</a>), which has been preserved in many later Christian creeds and confessions, is an anthropomorphism that figuratively describes Christ’s universal dominion, authority, and power in the presence of the Father. This aspect of Christ’s exaltation represents the fulfillment of his prayer recorded in <a href="?bref=John.17.5">John 17:5</a>: “Now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory I had with you before the world was made.”</p>
<p>In the OT the description of God seated on the throne of the universe is a sign of his sovereignty (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19">1 Kgs 22:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1">Ps 99:1</a>), majesty (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-4">Is 6:1-4</a>) and holiness (<a href="?bref=Ps.47.8">Ps 47:8</a>). That one should be invited to take a seat on the right hand of the sovereign in Eastern cultures was a token of extraordinary honor and authority (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.19">1 Kgs 2:19</a>). The fact that the exalted Christ would be accorded this particular privilege was anticipated in the Scriptures of the OT (see <a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Ps 8:5</a>, quoted in <a href="?bref=Heb.2.8">Heb 2:8</a>; and see <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Ps 110:1</a>).</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews, which shows unusual interest in the doctrine of Christ’s exaltation, represents Christ’s heavenly enthronement both as the sequel to his completed earthly sacrifice and as the commencement of his High Priestly ministration in the sanctuary on high. Affirming the superiority of Christ as High Priest of the new covenant, <a href="?bref=Heb.8.1-2">Hebrews 8:1-2</a> portrays Christ as seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the heavenlies. Christ’s enthronement affirms not only the finality of his earthly work of self-sacrifice but also his newly acquired status as mediator of the new and better covenant. <a href="?bref=Heb.10.11-18">Hebrews 10:11-18</a> pointedly contrasts the ineffectual sacrifices of the legal priests who <span class="ital">stand</span> in the performance of their ritual sacrifices with the effectual single sacrifice of Christ, who is now <span class="ital">seated</span> at the right hand of God as intercessor for the saints.</p>

<p class="h1">EXECRATION TEXTS*</p>
<p class="fl">Certain Egyptian Middle Kingdom texts containing curses (execrations) directed against the pharaoh’s enemies. Such texts have been found on 20th- to 19th-century <span class="era">BC</span> bowls from Thebes, and on 19th- to 18th-century figurines from Saqqara. The bowls or figurines, inscribed with names of rulers, cities, or persons and accompanied by a curse, were ceremonially smashed and given a ritual burial, symbolizing the curse intended for damage would be done to those named in the inscription.</p>
<p>This form of magic was aimed at both nations and individuals who constituted a threat to the kingdom. Egypt’s neighbor Libya is mentioned infrequently in the texts, but there were evidently more powerful enemies in the Sudan. Eight Egyptian individuals who were presumably part of a harem conspiracy were execrated. But the greatest threat loomed in the area of Palestine and Syria; over 60 towns or regions were singled out for execration. The list of place-names includes such well-known towns as Byblos, Ashkelon, Tyre, Jerusalem, and Beth-shan, and it provides an important source for the study of the historical geography of ancient Palestine.</p>

<p class="fl">Translation of a Greek word literally meaning “a calling of someone alongside to help.” Its primary meaning in the NT is the urging of someone to do something—particularly some ethical course of action. In some contexts, the same Greek word may also include the idea of comforting and consoling. The given context will determine which meaning to use.</p>
<p>A passage that most clearly illustrates “exhortation” in the sense of inciting or spurring people on to action is <a href="?bref=Luke.3.7-18">Luke 3:7-18</a>. John the Baptist exhorts his Jewish hearers to bring forth fruits in keeping with repentance, to stop resting on descent from Abraham as protection from punishment for sin, and to share clothing and food. He exhorted tax gatherers to collect no more money than they had a right to take, and soldiers not to take money from anyone by force, not to accuse anyone falsely, and to be content with their wages.</p>
<p>The ability to exhort is said to be a spiritual gift that God has given to some in the church for the benefit of the whole (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.8">Rom 12:8</a>). In addition, exhortation is one of the results of a proper use of the gift of prophecy, as seen in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.3,31">1 Corinthians 14:3, 31</a>. It was also one of the responsibilities that Paul commanded of Timothy: “Give attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.13">1 Tm 4:13</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>). The writer to the Hebrews also refers to an exhortation addressed to the readers lest they regard lightly the discipline of the Lord or “faint” when they are reproved (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.5">Heb 12:5</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.3-7">2 Corinthians 1:3-7</a> the Greek word for exhortation is used in the sense of consolation or encouragement. The context is one in which serious suffering for Christ is evident. Paul said that God encourages us in our times of testing so that we may be able to do the same for those experiencing similar trials. <a href="?bref=Acts.15.31">Acts 15:31</a> refers to the encouragement and consolation that came to the church at Antioch when the decree of the Jerusalem Council was read in their hearing. They had been fearful that the Judaizers might have their way and that Christians would be required to become circumcised in order to be saved. Another clear illustration of this word meaning “comfort” is in <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.18">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>, where Paul instructs the believers that those who die in Christ will not miss out on the blessings of the day of Christ; he then exhorts them to “comfort one another with these words.” <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=SpiritualGifts_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Spiritual Gifts</a>.</p>

  <title>Exodus, Book of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EXODUS, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Second book of the Bible, containing the story of God’s liberation of the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt. Few books of the OT are as important historically and theologically as the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>Historically, the exodus event was the birth of Israel as a nation. At Mt Sinai a group of tribes who were descendants of Abraham became a nation ruled by God. The book of Exodus explains how the Israelites were able to resettle the land God had promised to Abraham and gives the basis for this religious, political, and social life.</p>
<p>Theologically, the book of Exodus is so frequently referred to in the OT and NT that theologians speak of an “exodus motif.” In <a href="?bref=Ps.68.1-35">Psalm 68</a>, for example, David received assurance in remembering that his God was the same one who rescued Israel from Egypt. The prophet Jeremiah compared the future regathering of Israel to their exodus from Egypt as an even more miraculous event (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.14-15">Jer 16:14-15</a>). The return of Jesus and his parents from Egypt is associated with the exodus in <a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-15">Matthew 2:13-15</a>. The deliverance of the Jewish people from Egypt was interpreted as a prototype for God’s freeing of all his people, both Israel and the church. Thus, the message of the book of Exodus is foundational to understanding God’s plan of salvation throughout the Bible.</p>
<p>The English title “Exodus” comes from the Septuagint, a pre-Christian translation of the OT into Greek. The word means “a way out” or “departure” and refers to Israel’s rescue from Egypt. The Hebrew title is <span class="hebrew">Shemoth</span> (“these are the names”), from the book’s opening words, referring to the names of the sons of Jacob who joined Joseph in Egypt.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">According to tradition, Exodus and the entire Pentateuch (first five books of the Bible) were written by Moses. Exodus was probably written at Mt Sinai or shortly after the events there, according to this view. There is much to support that claim: (1) The book states that Moses wrote God’s words in at least one book (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.14">Ex 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.2,7">24:2, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.27-28">34:27-28</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Deut.31.9,24">Deuteronomy 31:9, 24</a>, Moses recorded God’s law in a book that was deposited beside the ark of the covenant as a witness for God. (2) Many OT writers referred to portions of Exodus as the “law of Moses” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.3">1 Kgs 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.14">2 Chr 34:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.8.1">Neh 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1">13:1</a>). The NT, including the testimony of Jesus, calls Moses the author (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.10">Mk 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.26">12:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.45">Jn 1:45</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.19">7:19</a>).</p>
<p>Various other theories about the origin of Exodus have been proposed. Some scholars credit Moses with writing nearly the entire book. One writer claims that Moses was an unknown desert sheikh who never even met the Israelites. Some critics think they detect in the book several documents from various periods in Israel’s history that were finally put together by an editor centuries after Moses’ death. Others have isolated various literary forms, such as the “Song of Moses” (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>), and traced their development. Another interpretation says that the exodus story was passed on by word of mouth for many generations before being written.</p>
<p>Although such theories are held by biblical scholars, they deny what the text of the book repeatedly affirms: that Moses wrote Exodus. The book of Exodus contains evidence of being written by an eyewitness. Only such a person would recall, for example, that there were 12 fountains and 70 palm trees at Elim (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.27">Ex 15:27</a>). The author shows a thorough knowledge of Egyptian court life, customs, and language. Some of the materials used to construct the tabernacle, such as acacia wood for its furniture (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.10">25:10</a>) and rams’ skins for the outer covering (v <a href="?bref=Exod.25.5">5</a>), are found in Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula but not in Palestine. The book thus seems to have had a desert setting.</p>
<p>Moses was not only commissioned by God to write the book of Exodus, but he was also well qualified. He was “instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.22">Acts 7:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In addition, the 40 years spent in the wilderness of Midian and Sinai gave him a thorough knowledge of the geography and wildlife of the regions through which the Israelites traveled. The events of the exodus—deliverance from the Egyptians and God’s giving of the law—were so central to the history of Israel that Moses took special care to preserve the record so it could be passed on to following generations.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">If one accepts the traditional view that Moses wrote Exodus, then the book is to be dated in the time of Moses. Two dates are generally suggested for the exodus from Egypt.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientHebrewManuscriptOfExodus"/>
<p class="h3">The “Late Date” View</p>
<p class="fl">This view says that the pharaoh who oppressed the Israelites was Seti I (Sethos, c. 1304–1290 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the pharaoh of the exodus was Ramses II (c. 1290–1224 <span class="era">BC</span>). The exodus would thus have occurred in 1290, and the conquest of Canaan would have begun in 1250. There are two principal arguments for this view: (1) According to <a href="?bref=Exod.1.11">Exodus 1:11</a>, the Israelites were forced to build the store city of Rameses; therefore, Ramses II must have been ruling at the time. But the city of Rameses could have existed earlier under a different name and then been renamed after Ramses II when he rebuilt it. Or there could have been an earlier monarch named Ramses who commissioned its construction. (2) There is archaeological evidence of movements of people and widespread destruction in Canaan around 1250 <span class="era">BC</span>. If this destruction was caused by the Hebrew conquest under Joshua, it would place the exodus around 1290. But it could just as easily have been the result of social turbulence and anarchy in the period of the Israelite judges, or of the military activities of neighboring peoples.</p>
<p class="h3">The “Early Date” View</p>
<p class="fl">This view says that the pharaoh of the oppression was Thutmose III (c. 1504–1450 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the pharaoh of the exodus was Amenhotep II (c. 1450–1424 <span class="era">BC</span>). Thus, the exodus would have occurred about 1440, and the conquest would have begun around 1400. Three chief arguments support that view: (1) If the fourth year of King Solomon was 966 <span class="era">BC</span>, then the 480 years of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kings 6:1</a> would place the exodus at 1446. (2) If the time of Jephthah was 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, then the 300 years of <a href="?bref=Judg.11.26">Judges 11:26</a> would date the conquest at 1400. (3) The late date would not leave enough time for the period of the judges, which most chronologies indicate lasted between 300 and 400 years. On the basis of such biblical references to the date of the exodus, the early date appears preferable.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Some events in Egypt during the period covered by the book of Exodus shed additional light on the biblical record. <a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Exodus 12:40</a> records that the Israelites lived in Egypt for 430 years. That would place the settling of Jacob and his family in Goshen (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.4,11">Gn 47:4, 11</a>) at about 1870 <span class="era">BC</span>, during the powerful 12th dynasty of Egypt’s Middle Kingdom. Around the turn of the century, two weaker dynasties followed. Semite invaders from Asia began to infiltrate northern (or Lower) Egypt. Those outsiders, known as the Hyksos, were able to displace the native dynasty with their own king around 1730. That was the “new king” who “did not know Joseph” (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.8">Ex 1:8</a>). Being foreigners themselves, they were naturally concerned about the Israelites, who were too many and too mighty for them (v <a href="?bref=Exod.1.9">9</a>). Enslavement was the easiest solution to the problem of the Israelites. The Hyksos kings could use the new source of labor to enlarge Rameses, at that time the capital of Lower Egypt.</p>
<p>Not until about 1580 <span class="era">BC</span> were the Egyptians, led by Ahmose, able to drive out the Hyksos and reestablish an Egyptian line of kings. Because the Israelites were still multiplying, despite their hard labor, the pharaohs of the 18th dynasty continued their bondage and decreed that all male children must be killed. When Moses was born (c. 1560 <span class="era">BC</span>), that edict was still in effect. Thutmose I (1539–1514), the great empire builder and third of that dynasty, was pharaoh.</p>
<p>Thutmose I’s only surviving legal heir was a daughter, Hatshepsut. Her husband assumed the name Thutmose II (1514–1504). When he died, another of the pharaoh’s descendants was named the successor—Thutmose III (1504–1450), who was ten years old at the time. Hatshepsut took the kingdom from the young ruler and controlled it for 22 years (1503–1482). Such a strong-willed woman could have the nerve to disobey her father’s command by saving the life of a Hebrew baby and raising him in the palace at Thebes.</p>
<p>Hatshepsut, who continued to rule despite Thutmose III’s coronation, possibly intended for Moses to have the throne, or at least a high position in the realm. Thutmose III, once he had full power after Hatshepsut’s death, would have been eager to do away with Moses. Moses’ hurried flight into the wilderness after killing the overseer fits well with such historical possibilities. Thutmose III’s death in 1450 <span class="era">BC</span> opened the way for Moses to return and confront Pharaoh Amenhotep II with God’s command, “Let my people go.”</p>

<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of the book of Exodus is to show how God’s promise to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.12-16">Gn 15:12-16</a>) was fulfilled when the Lord rescued the Israelite descendants of Abraham from Egyptian bondage. It also explains the origin of the Passover festival, the beginning of the nation by God’s establishment of a covenant with Israel, and the giving of the law on Mt Sinai.</p>
<p>The book of Exodus tells the moving story of a mighty God, creator of the universe, beyond all limitations of time and space, who intervenes in history on behalf of a helpless group of slaves. God defeats the ruler of the greatest empire on earth and then leads his oppressed people from that land to freedom. Exodus is the story of a single family that providentially grows into a multitude. Through God’s covenant a nation is formed, and through his law the nation is given stability and set apart from all its neighbors. The book of Exodus tells of an unusual man, whose 80 years of preparation are equally divided between the palace of a king and the pasture of a nomadic priest. Moses is a reluctant leader, but he defies the pharaoh, speaks with God face-to-face, and writes nearly one-fourth of the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>
<p>The God of Exodus is faithful. He makes promises and keeps them. <a href="?bref=Gen.15.13-16">Genesis 15:13-16</a> records an amazing prophecy: “Then the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to Abram, ‘Know of a surety that your descendants will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will be slaves there, and they will be oppressed for four hundred years; but I will bring judgment on the nation which they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. . . . And they shall come back here in the fourth generation’ ” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). In response to this promise, Joseph, “at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his burial” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.22">Heb 11:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>That promise provides a background for the drama of redemption on which the book of Exodus focuses. Redemption can be defined as “deliverance from the power of an alien dominion, and enjoyment of the resulting freedom.” It speaks of a deliverer and what he does to achieve deliverance. The book of Exodus is full of the vocabulary of redemption. It tells of the God who “remembers” his promise to the Hebrew patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.24">Ex 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.5">6:5</a>). God “comes down to deliver” the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.8">3:8</a>), or “save” them (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.30">14:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.15.2">15:2</a>), in order to “bring them” out of the land of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.10-12">3:10-12</a>). Redemption involves these aspects:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The Lord is the author of redemption. In <a href="?bref=Exod.6.1-8">Exodus 6:1-8</a>, as God answered Moses’ prayer to deliver his people, he used the pronoun “I” 18 times to emphasize that he was the one initiating the action. The Hebrew descendants of Abraham had known God primarily by the Hebrew name “El,” a common title in the ancient Near East for the supreme deity. But in Exodus, Israel learned that God is “Jehovah” or “Yahweh.” That is his personal name, a reminder that he is the God of the covenant who personally cares for his people’s welfare. In <a href="?bref=Exod.3.14">Exodus 3:14</a>, God told Moses, “I am who I am” or “I will be who I will be.” Some scholars think that statement shows that the name Yahweh comes from the Hebrew verb “to be.” In any case, the concept of “name” in the Hebrew culture is synonymous with “character.” To know the name of God is to know something of his character. Israel knew God as the one who is eternally self-existent yet present with them wherever they would go, acting on their behalf (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.12">Ex 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.14-16">33:14-16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. The reason for redemption was God’s promise to the forefathers of the Israelites. When God heard the groaning of the people of Israel, he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.24">Ex 2:24</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.6.5">6:5</a>). In response to their need, he selected an agent of redemption, the unwilling Moses. Moses exhausted every possible excuse, but God would not take no for an answer. Moses is a vivid example of how God prepares, empowers, and sustains his chosen servants, using them to accomplish his purpose.</p>
<p class="list">3. The motive of redemption was God’s grace and love (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.13">Ex 15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.6">20:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">34:6-7</a>). The purpose of redemption was that Israel and the Egyptians might know God (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.7">6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.7.5">7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.8.10">8:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.14.18">14:18</a>). The Lord worked so that all who were involved—Moses, the Israelites, Pharaoh, and the Egyptians—would be sure that he alone is God. The Hebrew understanding of knowledge is not primarily intellectual but experience-oriented. The desired response to God’s action is not mere mental assent but also faith and obedience.</p>
<p class="list">4. Redemption is achieved in Exodus by miracles (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.21">4:21</a>)—all natural processes controlled supernaturally by God. They are variously described as signs and wonders (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.3">7:3</a>), great acts of judgment (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6">6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.7.4">7:4</a>), and “the finger of God” (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.19">8:19</a>). Such miracles were not frivolous fireworks but purposeful works of God. Some of the miracles prove that Moses was sent by God. The miraculous plagues proved that God is supreme, for each of them was a direct challenge to one of the gods of Egypt: Osiris the river god, Yeqt the frog god, Ra (Re) the sun god, Athor the cattle god. The miracles in the wilderness proved that God fulfills all the needs of his people.</p>
<p class="list">5. The pharaoh was the villain—a picture of rebellious humanity confronted by God’s command (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.21-23">Ex 4:21-23</a>). Ten times the pharaoh hardened his heart. Yet, in a sense, it was God who hardened the pharaoh’s heart, effecting the king’s decision to defy him.</p>
<p class="list">6. The Passover marked the purchase of redemption (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.23-27">Ex 12:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.15.16">15:16</a>). It was a clear example of salvation by substitution. When the death angel saw the blood on the doorposts and lintels, he passed by.</p>
<p class="list">7. The recipients of God’s redemption in Exodus were the Israelites. God took them as his own special people (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.7">6:7</a>), and they were no longer free to do as they pleased. Even before the exodus he had claimed them, telling Pharaoh, “Israel is my first-born son, and I say to you, ‘Let my son go that he may serve me’ ” (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.22-23">4:22-23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="list">8. The demand of redemption was obedience. On the basis of his deliverance of the Israelites from bondage, God set forth the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">20:1-17</a>) and the rest of the law for them to obey. The people, though quick to pledge their obedience (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.3">24:3</a>), were even quicker to disobey (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.8">32:8</a>). Because the Lord is holy and wants his people to be holy and wholehearted in devotion (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.14">34:14</a>), he must punish iniquity. But being compassionate, he also forgives. Throughout the centuries of Israel’s history, God pleaded with his people through the prophets to remember the exodus and repent (see <a href="?bref=Mic.6.3-4">Mi 6:3-4</a>). The faithful responded in gratitude with Moses’ “song of redemption” (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.15.3-4">Rv 15:3-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Exodus can be divided into four sections, each describing one aspect of God’s dealings with the Israelites during the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Unveiling (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.1-6.30">Ex 1–6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Exodus begins with the 70 descendants of Jacob who joined Joseph in Egypt for the duration of a famine that was afflicting their land (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.46.1-50.26">Gn 46–50</a>). After more than a century of prosperity for the Israelites in the land of Goshen, a new dynasty is established in Egypt whose leaders are not friendly toward Israel. In order to stem the rapid growth of the Hebrew people, the Egyptians force them to do hard labor, building storage cities for the pharaoh.</p>
<p>A further command requires all Israelite male children to be killed at birth. The superintendents of the midwives do not comply, however, and God rewards them—not to show his approval of their lie but because they fear and obey God rather than the pharaoh. A new command calls for all male Israelite babies to be drowned in the Nile River. One special child, who escapes when Pharaoh’s daughter has his basket fished out of the Nile, is Moses. Ironically, Moses’ mother is paid by the princess to raise her own child, who grows up in the palace as the princess’s adopted son.</p>
<p>As an adult, Moses chooses to identify with his Hebrew kin, a tribute to the early instruction given him by his godly parents (see <a href="?bref=Heb.11.24-26">Heb 11:24-26</a>). He sets out to liberate Israel from the Egyptians, one man at a time. But he has to flee to Midian, at the eastern edge of the Sinai Peninsula or in Arabia beyond the northern top of the Gulf of Aqaba. Moses marries into the household of Jethro, also named Reuel. Reuel (“friend of God”) is probably the man’s personal name, and Jethro (“excellence”) his title. Because he is called a “priest of Midian” (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16">Ex 2:16</a>), some scholars have maintained a “Kenite hypothesis,” suggesting that Moses adopted the religion of his father-in-law and taught it to the Israelites. But the Bible states that Moses received his religion by a direct revelation from God. Jethro seems to believe only after he sees that God has rescued Israel from the Egyptians (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.10-11">18:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>While their future deliverer is in Midian, the Israelites continue to be oppressed and cry out to God in their misery (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.23-25">2:23-25</a>). God responds by descending to his people. He came down to rescue Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.8">3:8</a>). He appears to Moses in a burning bush and identifies himself as the same God who promised the patriarchs a land “flowing with milk and honey” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.17">3:17</a>). Moses will lead the Israelites there, assisted by his brother, Aaron.</p>
<p>Assured that God’s presence and miraculous signs will accompany him, Moses takes his wife Zipporah and his two sons and departs for Egypt. On the way, the Lord meets him and seeks to put him to death (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.24">4:24</a>). That is probably the Hebrew way of saying that God strikes him with a mortal illness. Moses, who is going to deliver God’s people, has neglected the sign of the covenant in failing to circumcise one of his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.14">Gn 17:14</a>). Moses recovers after the rite is performed and continues on to Egypt, meeting Aaron at Mt Sinai. Their reception by the Israelites is more cordial than that of Pharaoh, who refuses to honor the God who sent Moses. Instead of releasing the Israelites to offer sacrifices to their God in the wilderness, he increases their burdens. The people complain to Moses, and Moses complains to God. God appears again to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.1-30">Ex 6</a>), reassuring him that Israel will be delivered by divine power. God’s plan is not a failure—he is just beginning to put it into action.</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Deliverance (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-19.25">Ex 7–19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Chapters <a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-12.51">7–12</a> record ten plagues with which God afflicts the Egyptians. Even before the first of them, the pharaoh has hardened his heart to defy God (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.13">7:13</a>). There are three cycles of three plagues each:</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="PlagueCycles"/>
<p> The first three plagues affect both the Egyptians and the Israelites; the Israelites are protected from the final six. The Egyptian magicians are able to duplicate the first two plagues, but when the third strikes, they admit, “This is the finger of God” (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.19">8:19</a>). After the plague of flies covers the land, the pharaoh offers Moses the first of four compromises, but Moses refuses all of them (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.25-29">8:25-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.10.8-11,24-29">10:8-11, 24-29</a>). The first plagues are merely unpleasant, but the final ones are destructive and inflict much suffering. Since all of the plagues are common to that area, they themselves are not miraculous. The miracle is how the phenomena are multiplied and limited to the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>The nine plagues serve to harden the pharaoh’s heart even more, so God prepares one final stroke. The death of every firstborn male, among both animals and humans, will be the fatal blow. God warns the Israelites to get ready to leave. To avert the death angel, they must put blood from an unblemished yearling male sheep or goat on their doorways. While they are eating the Passover meal, the death angel begins moving through the land of Egypt. In anguish the pharaoh drives the Israelites from the land; the slaves are free at last. Just as he has promised, the Lord goes before the children of Israel in a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.</p>
<p>But once again the pharaoh’s heart is hardened and he gives pursuit. God parts the waters of the sea with a great wind. The literal meaning of the name given that body of water is “sea of reeds.” It could refer to any shoreline where the water is sufficiently shallow for such plants to grow (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26">1 Kgs 9:26</a>, where the same term refers to the Gulf of Aqaba near Eloth). Whatever the location, there God hands the Egyptians their final defeat. The rescue is complete.</p>
<p>Moses and the Israelites respond with renewed faith in the Lord and with a song of victory and praise (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.31-15.21">Ex 14:31–15:21</a>). Soon, however, thanksgiving turns into grumbling because of bitter water (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.22-26">15:22-26</a>), lack of meat and bread (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.1-15">16:1-15</a>), and lack of water (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1-7">17:1-7</a>). In each situation God provides for their need. He also gives them victory over the Amalekites (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-16">8-16</a>). As the Israelites approach Mt Sinai, Moses’ family rejoins him, accompanied by Jethro. Jethro now confesses his faith in the God of the Israelites and shares in a fellowship meal with the leaders. He also assists Moses in reorganizing the judicial system, then returns to Midian (ch <a href="?bref=Exod.18.1-27">18</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelites arrive at Mt Sinai, also called Horeb (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">3:1</a>), and prepare to meet the Lord who has rescued them in fulfillment of his promise to Moses (v <a href="?bref=Exod.3.12">12</a>). The Lord establishes his covenant with Israel, taking them as his own possession, “a kingdom of priests, my holy nation.” They quickly respond, “We will certainly do everything the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> asks of us” (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-8">19:5-8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Instruction (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-24.18">Ex 20–24</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The God who redeems a people, who literally “buys them back from slavery,” has a right to make certain demands of them. The commandments God gives to Israel at Sinai are not burdensome requirements but protective guidelines for living as God’s people (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-3">20:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>The Law (or Torah, meaning “instruction”) revealed at Sinai consists of three parts:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The Ten Commandments (ch <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-26">20</a>), addressing a person’s relationship to God and other people. Based on God’s nature (and therefore permanent), the Ten Commandments are unique in the history of the nations.</p>
<p class="list">2. The judgments (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-23.33">21–23</a>), social regulations for governing the people as a theocracy, similar in many ways to the law codes of Israel’s neighbors.</p>
<p class="list">3. Ordinances (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-31.18">24–31</a>) regulating religious ceremonies.</p>
<p class="fl">All of the laws are given to Moses during the weeks he spends with God on the mountain.</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments form the basis of all other laws in Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">20:1-17</a>). The first five deal with honoring the Lord, the second five with respecting one’s neighbor. The last commandment deals with one’s thoughts and intentions rather than with specific actions. It thus forms a safeguard against all sins not included in the first nine.</p>
<p>The judgments recorded in chapters <a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-23.33">21–23</a> deal with master-slave relationships (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-11">21:1-11</a>), offenses punishable by death (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.21.12-17">12-17</a>), compensation for injury to persons or damage to property (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.18-22.15">21:18–22:15</a>), various interpersonal relationships (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.16-23.9">22:16–23:9</a>), and Sabbaths, feasts, and the offering of firstfruits (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.10-19">23:10-19</a>). Many of the judgments would not take effect until Israel settled in the Promised Land. Accordingly, that section of the Law closes with a solemn warning against being rebellious and adopting pagan ways. It also contains a bright promise that God will drive out Israel’s enemies, protect his people from sickness, and grant them prosperity, if they obey the Lord’s commands (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.22">23:22</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-18">Exodus 24</a> records a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and Israel, as Moses seals it with the blood of a sacrifice. In response, God appears to the leaders of the people, giving them a glimpse of his splendor. Then Moses ascends the mountain one more time to receive the stone tablets containing the commandments, as well as further instructions regarding the meeting tent (tabernacle), the priesthood, and worship.</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Presence with his People (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.1-40.38">Ex 25–40</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After the Lord redeemed the Israelites, he told Moses, “I will make you my own special people, and I will be your God. And you will know that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God who has rescued you from your slavery in Egypt” (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.7">6:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Moses had seen that wonderful promise fulfilled, yet one further step remained: “I want the people of Israel to build me a sacred residence where I can live among them” (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.8">25:8</a>). God’s dwelling among his people is possible because God had descended to deliver the people and because they had pledged to meet his demands. God calls for a contribution from all whose hearts were willing to give, and he shows Moses a detailed pattern of the tabernacle and its furniture. Aaron and his sons are set apart to serve in the tent. Stipulations for the various offerings, including the Day of Atonement, are given. God tells Moses that he has chosen Bezalel and Oholiab to build the tabernacle and to craft its furnishings, having filled them with his Spirit.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Israelites, who so recently promised total obedience, grow impatient as Moses lingers for 40 days on the mountain. They demand that Aaron make an idol for them. Under pressure, Aaron complies and forms a molten calf, a representation of a pagan deity (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.4">32:4</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord informs Moses of the people’s idolatry, revelry, and immorality and says that he is angry enough to destroy all of them and start again with Moses’ offspring. Moses pleads for Israel until the Lord relents, then descends from the mountain to punish the people. Moses pleads again for forgiveness for Israel, and God in mercy pardons their terrible sin (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.8-10">34:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>Once more God offers to make a covenant with the people (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.10">34:10</a>). Moses spends another 40 days with the Lord, writing the commandments on tablets to replace those smashed when he saw the golden calf. When he returns to the people, his face shines from being in God’s presence, and he must keep it veiled.</p>
<p>Now that Israel has been restored to God’s favor, the construction of the tabernacle can begin. The contributions are so generous that Moses must restrain the people from bringing any more. Finally, all is ready. Moses examines the tabernacle, and it is erected on the first day of the first month, nearly a year after the first Passover. The priests are consecrated, the lamps are lit, and the first burnt sacrifice is offered. A cloud descends, filling the tabernacle with the glory of the Lord. God dwells among his people, the goal of redemption has been attained, and the drama of the book of Exodus has come to an end.</p>

  <title>Exodus, the</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EXODUS, The</p>
<p class="fl">Departure of Israel from Egypt led by Moses. The exodus was one of the most significant events in the history of the Hebrews. It was a unique demonstration of God’s power on behalf of his people, who were working under conditions of forced labor for the Egyptians. So dramatic were the circumstances in which the exodus occurred that they were mentioned frequently in subsequent OT periods. When the Hebrews were oppressed, they looked back to that great historical event and trusted God for future liberation.</p>
<p>The historicity of the exodus from Egypt is, beyond question, one of the pivotal historical and religious points of the Jewish tradition. It is quite another matter, however, to assign a firm date to the event, partly because certain scriptural references can be interpreted in various ways, and partly because little archaeological evidence from Egypt exists that bears on the question. Since the Egyptians regularly ignored defects in their records and defaced inscriptions belonging to unpopular fellow countrymen, it is improbable that anything approaching an Egyptian literary record of the exodus will ever be obtained. Much of the information regarding the date of the exodus is therefore inferential in character, and that presents biblical historians with one of the most complex problems of chronology.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateoftheExodus">Date of the Exodus</p>
<p class="fl">Determining the date of the exodus has long been a problem for biblical scholars. At the beginning of the 20th century many scholars, both liberal and conservative, placed the date toward the end of the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Not all of them agreed that the exodus was a single event, however. Some believed that the Hebrews entered Palestine twice at widely separated times. But such a view disregards the biblical account.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Exodus 12:40</a>, the length of time that Jacob’s descendants resided in the land of Egypt was 430 years. God had already predicted that interval of time to Abram (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.13">Gn 15:13</a>). The Genesis prophecy, however, did not indicate when that occupation would begin.</p>
<p>The Septuagint (the first Greek translation of the OT), in its version of <a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Exodus 12:40</a>, reduced the period of occupation in Egypt to 215 years. That may mean that two traditions of exodus history existed. A stay of four centuries may have been reckoned from the period when an Asiatic people known as the Hyksos invaded Egypt (c. 1720 <span class="era">BC</span>) and governed it for about a century and a half. The period of 215 years preserved in the Septuagint may be the interval of time between the expulsion of the Hyksos and the exodus itself.</p>
<p>More specific information from Israel’s early monarch, however, has a bearing on the time when the Hebrews escaped from Egypt. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">First Kings 6:1</a> indicates that Solomon constructed the temple in Jerusalem 480 years after the Israelites were led out of Egypt by Moses. Taking that figure at face value, and allowing a date of 961 <span class="era">BC</span> for the reference to Solomon, the exodus would have occurred about 1441 <span class="era">BC</span>. On the basis of such biblical data, some scholars argue for a 15th-century <span class="era">BC</span> date for the exodus, connecting it with the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep II (c. 1450–1425 <span class="era">BC</span>) as the time of Israel’s oppression. Other scholars feel equally persuaded that the exodus occurred in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RouteoftheExodus">Route of the Exodus</p>
<p class="fl">The biblical data concerning the route of the exodus placed the beginning of the flight at Rameses (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.37">Ex 12:37</a>). This place was identified with Tanis by early investigators, but more recent work suggests Qantir, about 17 miles (27.4 kilometers) southwest of Tanis, as the preferred site. It now seems certain that the monuments at Tanis apparently erected by Ramses have been misunderstood. None of those monuments seems to have originated at Tanis but were brought there by later kings who reused them. Thus the primary evidence for identifying Tanis with Ramses has proved to be misleading. Excavations at Qantir, on the other hand, have revealed indications of palaces, temples, and houses, all of which were local in origin. Such evidence suggests that Qantir, not Tanis, was the Rameses from which the exodus commenced. In addition, Rameses, unlike Tanis, was located beside a body of water (the “Waters of Re” mentioned in Egyptian sources), which again conforms to the biblical account.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="KeyPlacesintheExodus"/>
<p>From Rameses the Israelites moved to Succoth (<a href="?bref=Num.33.5">Nm 33:5</a>), generally identified with Tell el-Maskhuta, a fortification in the eastern area of the Wadi Tumeilat, west of the Bitter Lakes. From Succoth they journeyed to Etham (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.20">Ex 13:20</a>), which was on the frontier of the wilderness of Shur. The Hebrews were then instructed to return northwestward so that the stage might be set for the events of the exodus proper. Accordingly, they encamped between Migdol and the “sea,” close to two sites called Pi-hahiroth and Baal-zephon. Pi-hahiroth may have been a lake, the “Hi-waters,” mentioned in Egyptian documents. Baal-zephon has been identified with the later Tahpanhes (Tell Defenneh) near Qantara. Both identifications lack certainty, but these places were probably located in the northeast part of the Nile River delta area near Lake Menzaleh. The “sea” was a lake of papyrus reeds, described in <a href="?bref=Exod.15.22">Exodus 15:22</a> as the “reed sea,” the English equivalent of an Egyptian phrase meaning “papyrus marshes.” In most English translations from the time of the <span class="sc">kjv</span> onward, the Hebrew for “reed sea” was rendered as “Red Sea.”</p>
<p>Sources from the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> mention the existence of a large papyrus marsh in the area of Rameses that could be the one referred to in Scripture. Other suggestions equate the “reed sea” with the southeast extension of Lake Menzaleh, or with some body of water just to the south, perhaps Lake Ballah, all of which are reasonably close to each other. The topography can never be determined with complete accuracy, since the construction of the Suez Canal drained a series of lakes and swamps, of which the “reed sea” was possibly one.</p>
<p>At the camp at Migdol, the Hebrews were overtaken by the pursuing Egyptians and appeared to be trapped hopelessly. Then the Lord worked one of the greatest miracles of history. He first prevented the Egyptians from encountering the Hebrews that night by means of a pillar of cloud (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.19-20">Ex 14:19-20</a>). Moses raised his rod over the reed sea, and a strong east wind blew on the water all night. By morning a strip of the sea bottom had been exposed and dried out, enabling the Israelites to flee across it. When the Egyptians pursued their former slaves, Moses again raised his rod, the wind ceased, and the waters returned to normal levels, trapping the Egyptian chariots and soldiers and causing heavy losses. A victory song (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-21">Ex 15:1-21</a>), typical of ancient Near Eastern customs in warfare, was the liberated captives’ immediate response to God.</p>
<p>The parting of the waters is a phenomenon that has been observed periodically in various parts of the world. It always occurs in the same manner and involves a strong wind displacing a body of water. Shallow lakes, rivers, or marshes are parted readily under such conditions. The scriptural reference to the east wind indicates that God miraculously employed that natural phenomenon to rescue his people.</p>
<p>Having escaped successfully from the Egyptians, the Hebrews journeyed to the wilderness of Shur, three traveling days away from the bitter waters of Marah (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.22-25">Ex 15:22-25</a>). In <a href="?bref=Num.33.8">Numbers 33:8</a> the wilderness of Shur is identified with Etham, which the Israelites had already left. Thus it appears that they had moved north from Migdol, after which they moved south again to the wilderness in the area of Etham. The Israelites were not able to go into the Sinai Peninsula along the normal routes, which were guarded by Egyptian fortresses. In addition, they had been instructed not to travel along the northward road going to the “way of the land of the Philistines” (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.17">Ex 13:17</a>) into Canaan. Consequently, the best means of satisfying both conditions was to move southeastward to Sinai as unobtrusively as possible, taking care to avoid the access routes to Serabit el-Khadem in the central peninsula region, where the Egyptians mined turquoise and copper. The narratives of <a href="?bref=Num.33.9-15">Numbers 33:9-15</a> show that the Israelite camps were located in an area south of the “reed sea,” proving that the refugees had not taken the northerly, or “Philistine,” route.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheExodusThemeinScripture">The Exodus Theme in Scripture</p>
<p class="h3">Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The motif of deliverance from captivity in Egypt became etched indelibly upon the Hebrew mind, particularly since it was reinforced each year by the celebration of the Passover meal (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.12-14">Ex 12:12-14</a>). At each celebration thereafter the Hebrews were made aware that they had once been captives, but by the provision and power of God they were now free people—an elect nation and holy priesthood (<a href="?bref=Deut.26.19">Dt 26:19</a>).</p>
<p>In later periods psalms were written recounting Israel’s history in the light of the great liberating event of the exodus (<a href="?bref=Ps.105.1-45">Pss 105</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1-48">106</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.114.1-8">114</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">136</a>). Those compositions resound with triumph and thanksgiving. Hebrew accounts of the bondage in Egypt depict the rigorous life, the oppression, and the hard labor. It is now known that there were a number of foreign groups in Egypt at the time, and that the corporal punishment suffered by the Hebrews was a normal feature of everyday Egyptian life. In short, there was no discrimination against the Hebrews as a group; instead, they enjoyed the dubious distinction of being treated like ordinary Egyptian workers. Ever after, when they were oppressed, the Hebrews could look back to the great miracle of the exodus and believe that what God had done once he could do again. That was of great consolation to the faithful exiles weeping by the waters of Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ps.137.1">Ps 137:1</a>) as they looked forward to another exodus when God would lead them in triumph from a destroyed Babylon (v <a href="?bref=Ps.137.8">8</a>) back to Palestine.</p>
<p class="h3">New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">God’s mighty work at the time of the exodus was recalled on a few occasions by NT writers, even though Christ had been sacrificed as “our Passover lamb” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>) by that time. In his speech before the Jerusalem Council, Stephen gave a traditional recital of OT history, mentioning the event of the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.36">Acts 7:36</a>) as part of a demonstration of God’s power to change human affairs. The apostle Paul used the experience of the exodus to remind his hearers that many who were delivered from oppression at that time never reached the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.1-5">1 Cor 10:1-5</a>). Instead of committing themselves wholly to God in trust and obedience, the Israelites fell victim to temptations of various kinds in the wilderness. Thus, Paul stressed that since it is possible for Christians to become castaways (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.27">9:27</a>), they should cling to Christ the Rock and take their spiritual responsibilities seriously. In <a href="?bref=Heb.11.27-29">Hebrews 11:27-29</a> another historical recital lists the heroes of faith, mentioning especially Moses and his role at the exodus.</p>

<p>The ability to expel or control demons was claimed by many in the ancient Near East. Aside from the miracles of Jesus recorded in the Gospels, only in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.13">Acts 19:13</a> is there a biblical reference to exorcism among the Jews. However in <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.14-23">1 Samuel 16:14-23</a> David functioned as an exorcist by playing a lyre to cast out an evil spirit from Saul.</p>

  <title>Expiation*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">EXPIATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Atonement, purification, or removal of sin or its guilt. The term occurs in some English translations (such as <span class="sc">asv</span>, <span class="sc">erv</span>) for “reconciliation” (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.17">Heb 2:17</a>) or “propitiation” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.10">4:10</a>). “Expiation” also appears in some English translations of some OT passages (<a href="?bref=Num.35.33">Nm 35:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.43">Dt 32:43</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.3.14">1 Sm 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.9">Is 27:9</a>). The word does not appear in modern Bible translations.</p>
<p>The Hebrew family of words translated by “expiation” speaks fundamentally of a solution for sin, and the most common association is with the idea of atonement. Expiation has to do with removing the blot of sin, and hence the term is related to such words as “forgive,” “purge,” “cleanse,” or “atone.”</p>
<p>All NT references to expiation have to do with the sacrifice of Christ for human sin. In the Bible both expiation and propitiation are part of God’s atoning work. Christ’s sacrifice both propitiates (turns away) the wrath of God and expiates (covers) human sin. God’s redemptive work is both personal, or relational, and objective. When a biblical context concentrates on God’s wrath, propitiation is involved; when human sin is the focus, then redemption provides expiation.</p>

<p class="h1">EZEKIEL (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Priest and prophet during Israel’s Babylonian exile. Ezekiel was a descendant of the influential priestly family of Zadok (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.3">Ez 1:3</a>). He was probably reared in Jerusalem and was familiar with the temple ritual; it is unknown whether he served as a priest there. All that is known of his personal life is obtained from the OT book of Ezekiel.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was married (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.16-18">24:16-18</a>) and lived at Tel-abib in Babylonia (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.15">3:15</a>), in his own house (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.24">3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">8:1</a>). Most of the Judean captives had settled by the Kebar Canal (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.3">1:3</a>), which went from Babylon by Nippur to Erech. The elders of Israel there sought out Ezekiel for counsel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.1">14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.1">20:1</a>). In the fifth year of the exile, when Ezekiel was between 25 and 30 years old, he received God’s call to the prophetic office (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-3.11">1:1–3:11</a>). His wife died suddenly during the exile, but he was forbidden to mourn for her in public (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.16-18">24:16-18</a>). Her sudden death was meant to convey a striking and solemn warning of what would occur in the captives’ homeland (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.24.15-27">15-27</a>).</p>
<p>The time of Ezekiel’s ministry was unusual in many ways. It was a period of great prophetic activity. With the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel, Ezekiel spoke to the nation’s needs at the time of the Babylonian captivity. It was an era of upheaval and uprooting for the southern kingdom of Judah, and a time of persistent apostasy, idolatry, and general disobedience to the Mosaic law. It was also a period of international conflict and shifting power balances throughout the Near East.</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s ministry seems to have extended from 592 <span class="era">BC</span> to at least the 27th year of the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.17">29:17</a>). It falls into two main periods. During the first period (592–587 <span class="era">BC</span>), his messages were repeated warnings—in prose discourse and symbolic acts—intended to lead the exiles to repentance and faith in God. During the second period (586–570 <span class="era">BC</span>), after Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, the prophet comforted the exiles and encouraged them to look to the future in hope (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-48.35">33–48</a>). There were 13 years in which no prophetic utterances were delivered, namely 585 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.1,17">32:1, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.21">33:21</a>) to 572 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1">40:1</a>). The prophet learned of the fall of Jerusalem while in Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.21-22">33:21-22</a>).</p>
<p>The burden of Ezekiel’s message was that Judah was ripe for judgment. His preparation for speaking God’s message is given in the picture of his eating the written prophecies (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.8-3.3">2:8–3:3</a>). At first the messages were not accepted, but later his prophecies were vindicated as they began to come true and as the nation was purged of its idolatry. Ezekiel has been called “the father of Judaism” because of his supposed influence on Israel’s later worship. His greatest contribution to postexilic Jewish worship consisted in establishing the basis of the synagogue. He stressed the teaching of personal immortality, resurrection, and the ritual law.</p>
<p>Ezekiel carried out his messages with vivid and dramatic acts of symbolism (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-8">4:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.5.1-17">5:1-17</a>). His style has been characterized as heavy and repetitious, but it was designed with the themes of apostasy and subsequent judgment in view.</p>
<p>The place and circumstances of his death are unknown, and Ezekiel is not mentioned elsewhere in the OT.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Ezekiel was the son of Buzi (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.3">1:3</a>), a member of a priestly family. It is unclear whether he actually served in the temple as a priest, but such was his training. His writings show that he knew the regulations for sacrifices, the rituals, and the people’s expectations of a priest. In exile Ezekiel the priest spoke God’s word about the future of the temple to his fellow exiles. Settled at Tel-abib, on the canal of Kebar, the thousands of deportees eked out a meager existence. They hoped for a speedy return to Judah and a change for the better in the international situation. Their hope was enflamed by the spirited preaching of false prophets, likened to jackals among the ruins (<a href="?bref=Ezek.13.4">13:4</a>). They piously said, “The Lord declares . . . ,” but they were actually self-commissioned (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.6">6</a>). They deceived the people with a message of peace at a time when God’s judgment was about to be poured out on his people (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.10">10</a>). They had led the people to distrust prophecy to such an extent that a proverb circulated among the people that “the days grow long, and every vision comes to nought” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.12.22">12:22</a>). Much time had passed since visions of God’s judgment had been given to the people, and nothing could be interpreted as a fulfillment of those visions. Ezekiel was called to serve his community by symbolic acts, visions, and verbal messages in order to convince the people that God’s judgment was imminent (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.23">23</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateandBackground">Date and Background</p>
<p class="fl">The ministry of the prophet Ezekiel can be understood best against the backdrop of his time. If, as the church father Origen believed, the vague reference “in the thirtieth year” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1">1:1</a>) marks the prophet’s age at the time of his first vision, Ezekiel was born during the rule of King Josiah of Judah (c. 640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>). Josiah was the grandson of King Manasseh, whose sacrilegious acts had brought God’s judgment on the kingdom of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.10-15">2 Kgs 21:10-15</a>).</p>
<p>Though Judah’s political situation was perilous, Josiah led the nation in a radical reformation that began with the finding of the “Book of the Law” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1-20">2 Kgs 22</a>) in the year that Ezekiel was born (c. 621 <span class="era">BC</span>). Idolatry was done away with and the people turned back to God, but God’s judgment on Judah was unchangeable (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26-27">23:26-27</a>). Josiah erred in trying to make Judah a kingdom with which other states had to reckon. He was threatened when the Egyptian pharaoh Neco passed through Judah on his way to aid the weakened Assyrian kingdom. Josiah marched to meet the Egyptian forces, but his troops were unable to stand against the Egyptians, and he died in battle (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29">29</a>). Egypt took control of Judah, and Pharaoh Neco placed Jehoiakim in power over Jerusalem. Egyptian control did not last long, however, for in 605 <span class="era">BC</span> Egypt and Assyria were defeated by Babylonia’s king Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish. The Babylonians then pushed south to Jerusalem, and the first deportation of Judean leaders (among them the prophet Daniel) took place.</p>
<p>Jehoiakim was permitted to continue ruling over Judah as a vassal king of Nebuchadnezzar. But his dealings with Egypt brought the emperor’s wrath down upon him. Before the Babylonians could address the Judean situation, Jehoiakim died and his son Jehoiachin was crowned. When the Babylonian forces arrived at the gates of Jerusalem, Jehoiachin and thousands of the aristocracy were taken to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.10-17">2 Kgs 24:10-17</a>). Among those deportees was Ezekiel, then about 25 years old.</p>
<p>Although the book says otherwise, many scholars think that Ezekiel lived and taught in Judah for the duration of the siege and the fall of Jerusalem (586 <span class="era">BC</span>). They conclude this from Ezekiel’s familiarity with idolatry in the temple and his vivid descriptions of Jerusalem’s last days (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.11">Ez 8:11</a>). Others believe that Ezekiel ministered both to the exiled community and to the Judeans living in Judah. Neither interpretation does full justice to the claims of the book itself. Ezekiel was exiled in 597 <span class="era">BC</span>. He was called to bring God’s word to the deportees at Tel-abib; he was granted a vision of the horrible practices in the temple court; and he was familiar with Jerusalem and Judah from having lived there and from reports on affairs in Jerusalem coming to the exiles through messengers. Jeremiah, Ezekiel’s contemporary, was prophesying in Jerusalem, but there is no evidence that Jeremiah and Ezekiel knew of each other’s ministry. If Ezekiel had brought God’s word to Jerusalem during the siege, some reference to Jeremiah might appear in his writings. If Jeremiah was supported by Ezekiel’s ministry in Jerusalem, he probably would have included a positive word for his colleague in his book. The book of Ezekiel plainly says that Ezekiel lived and preached in exile (see <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-3">1:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.24-25">11:24-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The prophecy of Ezekiel is easily outlined by subject matter and chronology. The chronology of the period permits a division before and after 586 <span class="era">BC</span> (the fall of Jerusalem). Chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-24.27">1–24</a> cover the pre-586 ministry of Ezekiel, whereas chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-48.35">33–48</a> represent his post-586 ministry. Chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.1-32.32">25–32</a> (oracles against the foreign nations) function as a transition between the book’s two major divisions.</p>
<p>The book’s outline according to subject matter divides into four parts: Ezekiel’s call (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-3.21">1:1–3:21</a>); prophecies of judgment against Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.22-24.27">3:22–24:27</a>); oracles against the nations (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.1-32.32">25:1–32:32</a>); and proclamation of hope (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-48.35">33:1–48:35</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Ezekiel’s Call (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-3.21">1:1–3:21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prophet’s call in one sense was similar to that of Isaiah and Jeremiah. Isaiah received his mission in a vision of God’s glory in the temple (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Is 6</a>). Jeremiah was called unexpectedly in his youth, and received signs that solemnly set forth the nature of his mission (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.11-15">Jer 1:11-15</a>). The call of Ezekiel combined those two elements. Revelation of God’s glory to the prophet at the same time revealed the nature of the prophet’s mission. Ezekiel’s call contained a full description of God’s glory. Isaiah briefly stated that he saw the Lord enthroned in the temple, and he concentrated on the seraphim representing and magnifying God’s glory. Ezekiel elaborated on the revelation of the Lord’s glory as well as on the ministering angels who went before the Lord as part of his royal entourage. The vision of God’s glory, though difficult to understand, is the key to the book of Ezekiel.</p>
<p>Ezekiel, as a priest, was concerned about the future of the temple. That sacred place had been ordained by God as his home among his people. The glory, presence, and holiness of God were symbolized in the temple (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>). In exile Ezekiel could not serve his people as a priest, for they were far from Jerusalem, the city God had chosen. Against all expectations the Lord revealed himself to Ezekiel in the land of Babylon. In calling Ezekiel to a prophetic ministry, God assured his servant that he had not forsaken his people, even though they had been banished from the Promised Land.</p>
<p>The prophet’s vision began with a storm. As a large cloud approached from the north, Ezekiel saw a brightness surrounding the cloud, four creatures, and four wheels. The combination of creatures and wheels suggests that the Lord appeared in a chariot. God’s chariot is a familiar OT representation of his coming in judgment (see <a href="?bref=Isa.66.15-16">Is 66:15-16</a>). The wheels within wheels and the position of the four living creatures may signify God’s total control over the whole earth, so he could move his “chariot of judgment” in any direction. It is also possible that the living creatures with their four faces, and the wheels full of eyes, may be separate symbols showing that God sees all that happens and thereby knows the plight of the exiles. In the vision the prophet’s attention was drawn to a throne above the heads of the creatures. On the throne was “the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.28">1:28</a>). In his vision of God’s coming in judgment, Ezekiel received his call to the prophetic ministry: “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.3">2:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). During a dark hour of Israel’s history, Ezekiel had to prophesy, rebuke his fellow exiles (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.11">3:11</a>), and be responsible as a watchman over the house of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.17">3:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-9">33:1-9</a>). Symbolic of his mission was a scroll filled with lamentations and woe (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.9-10">2:9-10</a>), which when eaten became sweet as honey (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.1-3">3:1-3</a>). Difficult as the mission was, God’s presence and the certain fulfillment of the prophecies sweetened Ezekiel’s task. Such encouragement was intended to take away any fear of the rebellious Israelites (<a href="?bref=Ezek.2.6-7">2:6-7</a>). Instead of being elated with his mission, however, Ezekiel became despondent.</p>
<p>A week later, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel to remind him of his important role as a watchman (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.16-17">3:16-17</a>). Ezekiel became responsible for Israel as a nation, not just for individuals. His witness to Israel had the express aim of national repentance (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.3.18-19">18-19</a>).</p>
<p>Ezekiel was confined to his house by God (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.24-25">3:24-25</a>). The house ministry was to be carried on only with those Israelites who sought God’s will, for the Lord had abandoned those who continued in their apostasy. The prophetic word would not help the apostates (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.3.26">26</a>). The principle of Ezekiel’s ministry is found in <a href="?bref=Ezek.3.27">3:27</a>: “Whenever I give you a message, I will loosen your tongue and let you speak. Then you will say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> says!’ Some of them will listen, but some will ignore you, for they are rebels” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.11.15">Mt 11:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.43">13:43</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Prophecies of Judgment against Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.3.22-24.27">3:22–24:27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Symbolism figures prominently in Ezekiel’s writing. His priestly background and preparation probably suited him to receive and communicate God’s word in symbolic acts and speech. Chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-17">4</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.5.1-17">5</a> contain four symbolic acts: (1) Jerusalem’s siege is portrayed on a brick (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.1-3">Ez 4:1-3</a>); (2) Israel’s iniquity is represented by Ezekiel’s lying on his sides (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.4-8">4-8</a>); (3) Jerusalem’s grief and horror in the last days of the siege are represented by Ezekiel’s food and drink (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9-17">9-17</a>); (4) Jerusalem’s fate is represented by the prophet’s hair being cut off (<a href="?bref=Ezek.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s instructions were further illuminated by God’s explanation of Israel’s apostasy (<a href="?bref=Ezek.5.6-7">5:6-7</a>) and his judgment on Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.5.8-12">8-12</a>). The judgment will last until the Israelites admit that in covenant faithfulness their Lord has inflicted righteous judgment on them (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.5.13">13</a>).</p>
<p>God would direct his judgment first against the people and the city of Jerusalem. Next in line were the mountains of Israel (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.6.1-14">6</a>) and the land (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.1-27">7</a>). God’s wrath included the cities and cultic sites in the hill country of Judah, leaving no protection for the people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.6.3-6">6:3-6</a>). Abominations that were practiced throughout the land caused God’s judgment to fall on the land as well as on the people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.7.2-3,10-11,23">7:2-3, 10-11, 23</a>). But because God is righteous, he judged the people according to their ways of life, desiring that they would once more acknowledge him as their God (<a href="?bref=Ezek.7.27">7:27</a>).</p>
<p>The prophet then (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1-11.25">8–11</a>) focused on the abominations practiced in Jerusalem, particularly idolatry in the temple courts, which caused the judgment announced in chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-7.27">1–7</a>. An idol had been erected in the inner court (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.3-5">8:3-5</a>). By the wall of the court, elders of the city were paying homage to the idols that surrounded the court (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.11-12">11-12</a>). Closer to the temple, women were weeping for the god Tammuz (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.14">14</a>), and men were worshiping the sun (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.16">16</a>). In preparation for the ultimate judgment on the land, the prophet placed a mark on the foreheads of the few faithful Israelites so that they would survive (<a href="?bref=Ezek.9.4-6">9:4-6</a>). Then (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">10</a>), the glory of God, which had filled the temple from the time of Solomon, gradually left: “Then the glory of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> went up from the city and stopped above the mountain to the east” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.23">11:23</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The people, now without divine protection, were being handed over to the Babylonians (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>The message of doom for Jerusalem contains four elements of hope: restoration of the people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.17">11:17</a>), restoration of the land (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.17">17</a>), purification of the people (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.18">18</a>), and renewed fellowship between God and his people (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.19-20">19-20</a>). The prophet develops those four themes in chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-48.35">33–48</a>.</p>
<p>The visions of chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">10</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.1-25">11</a> made clear that when God removed his presence from Jerusalem, the exile was approaching. Those who were already in Babylon were unwilling to believe that such an extensive devastation of Jerusalem would happen or that the people would all be exiled and the land become desolate.</p>
<p>Ezekiel acted out the certainty of God’s word of judgment by packing his bags and showing the baggage to his fellow exiles. First, he placed the bags in the courtyard outside his modest home. Next, he went out by making a hole through the wall. Finally, the prophet walked about the settlement with his bags in full view. Skeptical observers did not understand Ezekiel and probably thought he was crazy. The believers who saw him understood. His strange actions dramatized how the king’s aides would do all they could to help King Zedekiah escape just before the fall of Jerusalem. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-30">Second Kings 25</a> tells how the king and his soldiers left Jerusalem for the wilderness, to be overtaken by the Babylonians at Jericho and brought before Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah. As a captive, Zedekiah witnessed the murder of his sons; then his eyes were put out, and he was sent into exile with the other Judeans (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.13">Ez 12:13</a>). The prophet’s explanation concluded with a word of comfort. Because of his covenant with Abraham, God promised not to destroy the people completely. A remnant who overcame the sword, famine, and pestilence would live to tell the story of God’s judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.15-16">15-16</a>).</p>
<p>Ezekiel further illustrated the nation’s plight by eating as though full of fear, depicting the great trauma that all of Judah’s inhabitants would soon undergo.</p>
<p>Both symbolic acts, packing his belongings and eating, emphasized the truthfulness of God’s word. The people needed to face the nature of their God: He is magnificent, and when he speaks, his words are powerful and come to pass. Thus, the devastation of the land and the people’s exile were a fulfillment of God’s word through the prophets. The judgment was meant to produce a recognition of the Lord, repentance, and a return to God. Some in Judah doubted the efficacy of God’s prophecies, saying, “Time passes, making a liar of every prophet” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.12.22">12:22</a>). Others thought God’s word would come true in the distant future (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.27">27</a>). The prevailing attitude of distrust in God’s word had been stimulated by the popular preaching of false prophets (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.1-23">13</a>). Never commissioned by the Lord, they deceived God’s people by lying and misdirecting them with messages of peace (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.8-10">8-10</a>). Wickedness, lying, and deceit were encouraged among the people by such false prophets (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.22">22</a>). The magnitude of their sin and their great responsibility for Judah’s fall would be matched by the Lord’s heavy judgment. Yet God would save his people from such evil and will prepare a righteous nation with whom to maintain his covenant (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.23">23</a>).</p>
<p>The certainty of the judgment has been connected with the truthfulness of God’s word. Ezekiel’s difficult task of affirming the doom of Jerusalem to stubborn hearers was intensified by the people’s idolatry. Their whole way of life denied the existence of God. They practiced idolatry in their worship, and they had set up idols in their hearts (<a href="?bref=Ezek.14.3">14:3</a>). Before the covenant with God could be restored, they had to be purified from their idolatry. Even so, repentance would not guarantee immunity from judgment. Sword, famine, wild beasts, and plagues would ravage the population (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.21">21</a>). After the execution of his judgment, God would take back those survivors who had turned to him for mercy. God would surely accomplish all that he intended for his people’s good (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.23">23</a>).</p>
<p>In chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.15.1-17.24">15–17</a> Ezekiel uses three parables to set forth the apostasy, present uselessness, and judgment of Israel. Jerusalem and Judah are compared to a piece of charred wood, an adulterous woman, and a vine.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.15.1-8">15</a> reviews Jerusalem’s case. Jerusalem is compared to a piece of wood, both ends of which have been charred with fire, so that the wood is of no value. As the whole piece of wood is burned instead of being saved, so Jerusalem would undergo complete devastation (<a href="?bref=Ezek.15.7-8">15:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">16</a> presents God’s case against Jerusalem from a different perspective, stressing his care for Jerusalem in the past. The beginnings of her history are compared to the birth of a female child, left abandoned by her mother (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.3-5">16:3-5</a>). God adopted the child and washed and clothed her (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.6-7">6-7</a>). He made a covenant with her (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.8">8</a>), making her his own possession. He generously gave her all the fine things of life (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.9-13">9-13</a>). In the height of her development, Jerusalem’s fame spread to the nations (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.14">14</a>). Her self-reliance made her a spiritual prostitute as she took up the religious practices and way of life of the nations (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.15-34">15-34</a>). The cities of Sodom (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">Gn 19</a>) and Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.6">2 Kgs 17:6</a>), known for their immorality, are called Jerusalem’s sisters (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.46">Ez 16:46</a>). They had been judged by God, but the corruption of those cities was little compared to the lewdness of Jerusalem (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.48-51">48-51</a>). Thus, Jerusalem also would surely fall and become desolate. Yet Ezekiel anticipates the judgment’s final outcome; Jerusalem will be restored to covenantal blessing (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.62-63">62-63</a>) after her repentance.</p>
<p>The third parable (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.1-24">17</a>) focuses on God’s sovereignty over political developments. Assyria was no longer a power to be reckoned with. Babylon and Egypt both exercised dominion, although the balance of power was veering in favor of Babylon. Their extension of power is likened to an eagle. Nebuchadnezzar, pictured as “a great eagle with broad wings full of many-colored feathers,” took control over the affairs of Judah by removing Jehoiachin, “the highest branch of a cedar tree,” from office and by exiling him with young leaders of the Judean state (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.3-4">17:3-4</a>). Ezekiel was among them. Nebuchadnezzar let the Judeans control their own affairs under Zedekiah but expected them to be subject to Babylon and not to any other power. But Judah (likened to a vine) tried to ally itself with Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt, “another great eagle with broad wings and full plumage” (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.7">7</a>), against Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah’s folly in turning to Egypt would cause Nebuchadnezzar to pull up the vine by its roots and make it wither (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.9-10">9-10</a>). In explaining the parable, God told the exiles that Judah’s fall was a result of its unfaithfulness to King Nebuchadnezzar, to whom Judah owed allegiance by covenant (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.13-18">13-18</a>). Judah’s unfaithfulness thus extended to all of its relationships: religious, cultural, and political. After the exile, God promised, he would restore his people to their land under a Messiah, “a tender shoot” (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.22">22</a>). The messianic rule is signified by the young twig, which when planted in the land will become a magnificent cedar, giving shade and protection to the birds. Chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.1-24">17</a> is an inspiring affirmation of the sovereignty of God in human affairs (“All the trees will know that it is I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who cuts down the tall tree and helps the short tree to grow tall. It is I who makes the green tree wither and gives new life to the dead tree”—<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.24">17:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.1-22.31">18–22</a> contain Ezekiel’s oracles to Judah, its leaders, and the exiles. First, he enunciates God’s standard of righteousness: “The person who sins will be the one who dies” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.18.4">18:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The people are charging God with injustice, for they believe themselves to be under God’s judgment for the sins of their ancestors (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.25-29">25-29</a>). Although the Ten Commandments do say that God may punish “the sins of their parents to the third and the fourth generations” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.5">Ex 20:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), the prophet vindicates God’s justice, telling the people that they are not being punished merely for their ancestors’ sin. Each person must be directly accountable to God; the sinner will die in wickedness, and the righteous will live by righteousness. A life of faithfulness to God’s moral and civil law will be rewarded (<a href="?bref=Ezek.18.5-9">Ez 18:5-9</a>). Even if one’s father was a sinner, the father’s sin is not transferable (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.14-18">14-18</a>). God is ready to forgive any sinner who repents (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.27">27</a>). The prophet’s vindication of God’s justice becomes a call to repentance. The sinners in Judah and in exile were thus warned of the consequences of their evil, and were exhorted to return to their God and his standard of right and wrong (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.31-32">31-32</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.1-14">19</a> contains two parables in the form of a lamentation. The first portrays a lioness and her two cubs. The lioness is Hamutal, the wife of King Josiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.31">2 Kgs 23:31</a>), who bore two sons: Jehoahaz and Zedekiah. Jehoahaz is referred to in <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.3-4">Ezekiel 19:3-4</a> as a cub who grew up and was taken to Egypt (by Pharaoh Neco in 608 <span class="era">BC</span>; see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.31-34">2 Kgs 23:31-34</a>). Zedekiah succeeded to the throne ten years later. In the lamentation the prophet imaginatively represents Zedekiah as a young cub who is ultimately taken to Babylon as a rebellious ruler (<a href="?bref=Ezek.19.7-9">Ez 19:7-9</a>). The second parable changes the imagery to a vine, representing Israel (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.10">10</a>). In its early days God blessed Israel with strong rulers, but now the vine was wilting as Zedekiah irresponsibly led Judah to its last days. Ezekiel’s lamentation stresses the lack of a good candidate for the throne and the lack of life in the vine (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.19.13-14">13-14</a>).</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.1-49">20</a> the prophet concludes God’s argument against his people. He reviews the history of Israel’s past, starting with God’s self-revelation in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Ezek.20.5-6">20:5-6</a>). He took to himself a stubborn nation, tied to idolatry (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.8">8</a>) and prone to apostasy (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.13,21">13, 21</a>). Israel wanted to be one of the great nations (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.32">32</a>) instead of a sanctified people (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.12">12</a>). As a result of its spiritual hardness, Israel is dispersed to live among the nations (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.35">35</a>). Yet God had a solemn covenant with Israel, made by oath to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. On the basis of that covenant, God will reach out with compassion to those who repent of their sinful ways (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.37-44">37-44</a>). In Israel’s judgment and restoration the nations will see the holiness of God, which does not tolerate unfaithfulness in Israel (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.41">41</a>).</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s prophecies alternate between God’s judgment on Israel’s sin and his restoration of Israel, spanning the bridge between Israel’s past and future. In view of the people’s doubts of the coming judgment on Jerusalem, he stresses the necessity of judgment and the need for repentance. Still, the future restoration of a remnant is touched upon here and there as the counterpart of his message of judgment. After announcing the fall of Jerusalem, the prophet shifts from a message of judgment to one of hope.</p>
<p>The prophet returns to the proclamation of judgment in four oracles (<a href="?bref=Ezek.20.45-21.32">20:45–21:32</a>). He speaks against the Negev Desert area (<a href="?bref=Ezek.20.45-49">20:45-49</a>), Jerusalem and the land of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.21.2-17,20-27">21:2-17, 20-27</a>), and against the Ammonites (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.21.28-32">28-32</a>). God permitted the sword of Nebuchadnezzar to be his instrument of judgment upon the Judeans (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.21.19">19</a>). He would see to the judgment on the Ammonites. The Judeans would recover their previous glory, but the memory of the Ammonites would perish (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.21.27,32">27, 32</a>). The oracle against the Ammonites anticipates a larger treatise on Israel’s other neighbors: Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyre, Sidon, and Egypt (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.1-29.21">25–29</a>).</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.1-24.27">22–24</a> contain a renewed series of indictments against Jerusalem. Jerusalem’s religious and civil leadership (the prophets, priests, and princes) are corrupt, and the people have followed their example (<a href="?bref=Ezek.22.25-30">22:25-30</a>). The parable of the two sisters, Oholah and Oholibah, is a variation of the parable of adulterous Jerusalem (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.1-49">23</a>; cf. ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">16</a>). It differs in that the comparison drawn between Jerusalem, soon to be exiled, and Samaria, already in exile, is more explicit in the parable of Oholah and Oholibah. In chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">16</a> Jerusalem was charged with greater sins than Sodom and Samaria, but was promised restoration. Only the adulterous nature of the two sisters and God’s judgment on them is emphasized in chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.1-49">23</a>, with no word of restoration. This parable is a fitting introduction to that of the boiling pot (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.24.1-27">24</a>), in which Jerusalem is compared to a rusty pot boiling with water. The Jerusalemites, likened to pieces of meat in the boiling pot, will die in the city. The parable was pronounced on the starting day of Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem. Thus, the exiles were divinely forewarned of God’s intent to destroy the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.21">24:21</a>) and were prepared for messengers bringing the bad news of Jerusalem’s fall.</p>
<p>Those oracles and parables conclude the first division of the book. Ezekiel has stated God’s case against the rebellious house of Judah in many ways. His metaphors have likened Judah to a burnt piece of wood, to an uprooted vine, to a baby who grew up to be an adulteress, and to Oholibah, the adulterous woman. He has countered arguments against the fulfillment of God’s word and against the justice of God. He has reassured the exiles that God will not leave the righteous and that the future of Israel begins with a righteous remnant. The pendulum of Ezekiel’s writing has swung from judgment to restoration, while the clock was bringing Judah closer to the hour of its fall.</p>
<p class="h3">Oracles against the Nations (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.1-32.32">25:1–32:32</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ammon, Moab, and Edom were Israel’s neighbors to the east. Because they were ethnically related to Israel, they were not attacked by the Israelites on their march to the Promised Land. Ammon and Moab were descendants of Lot, Abraham’s nephew, and the Edomites descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob. Although God forbade war with them, relations between Israel and its eastern neighbors were always tense. Israel had been overrun by the Ammonites for a time, and Israel was never successful in controlling the Edomites’ competitive trade relations. Those neighboring nations joined the Babylonian attack against Jerusalem and rejoiced when Jerusalem fell and the temple was devastated (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.3-12">Ez 25:3-12</a>). They were ready to take over and loot Judah’s cities, and to instigate trouble in a time when Jerusalem was distressed. Therefore, says Ezekiel, God’s judgment will also extend to Ammon, Moab, and Edom (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.4-14">4-14</a>).</p>
<p>The Philistines had been Israel’s enemy to the southwest. During the period of the judges and the united monarchy, the Philistines had controlled much of Israel’s territory. King David successfully limited the Philistine threat by confining them to their own territory. But in Ezekiel’s day they were still considered Israel’s “everlasting” enemy (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.15">25:15</a>), possibly intensified by Philistine support of the Babylonian invasion of Judah.</p>
<p>The city of Tyre had received reports of the overthrow of Jerusalem and was ready to exploit the opportunity for its own advantage (<a href="?bref=Ezek.26.2">26:2</a>). Tyre’s trade position was unrivaled; its ships crossed the seas to exchange goods with many distant lands (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.1-36">Ez 27</a>). But Tyre would soon be broken by the Babylonians, its wealth dried up with the destruction of the fleet and the murder of its sailors (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.26">27:26</a>).</p>
<p>The prince of Tyre is singled out in chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.1-26">28</a>, but verse <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.12">12</a> refers to the “king” of Tyre. Interpreters disagree whether they are one person or two. Those who distinguish between the two understand the prince of Tyre to be the ruler of that city, but they consider the “king” of Tyre to represent Satan (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.13-15">28:13-15</a>). The Garden of Eden with all its splendor is an appropriate setting for the original glory of an angelic Satan before his fall. But there is no reason within the context to distinguish between the prince and the king of Tyre. Each is said to have exalted himself, and both took authority over men as if they were gods and enjoyed all the splendor and royalty that belong to God. And both prince and king fall from their high position. The passage is a magnificent example of Ezekiel’s literary ability. He draws a glorious picture of the Garden of Eden, reworking the same theme as he depicts the glory and fall of the king of Tyre. Ezekiel presents him as a cherub, in accordance with the local belief that the king was divine. He wore the finest clothing, with nine kinds of precious stones (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.13">13</a>). Though God had elevated him to the royal throne (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.13-14">13-14</a>), the king’s heart turned to materialism and to religious and judicial corruption (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.16-18">16-18</a>). In a sense the king (prince) represents the people of Tyre. They were all guilty of corruption, injustice, and violence. If God judged his covenant people for their perversion of justice and for their sins, his judgment would surely come also on the city of Tyre (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.18-19">18-19</a>). When the Babylonians marched on Tyre, they laboriously built a jetty from the mainland to the city. At the same time Tyrian ships loaded with goods and treasures sailed out across the Mediterranean, so that when Nebuchadnezzar’s troops finally breached the walls, little loot could be taken (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.18">29:18</a>).</p>
<p>The city of Sidon also cheered Jerusalem’s destruction. Sidon was a port city in Phoenicia, to the north of Tyre. By pestilence and war, the inhabitants of Sidon would learn the justice of Israel’s God.</p>
<p>Six nations (Ammon, Moab, Edom, Philistia, Tyre, and Sidon) scorned Israel at the fall of Jerusalem. Because God had invested his holiness in the temple of Jerusalem and in his people, the temple’s destruction and the people’s exile signified to the nations that Israel’s God was impotent. They did not realize that the reason for Israel’s fate was God’s intolerance of his people’s sin. God’s holiness required the punishment of sin, and it also required vindication for his name (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.22-23">28:22-23</a>). God was still concerned for his people, that Israel might know he had removed the scorn of their neighbors (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.24">24</a>). In the restoration of Israel the Lord would further manifest his holiness before the nations. Israel would receive back the land, vineyards, and houses, and would enjoy the bounty of the Lord in peace (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.28.25-26">25-26</a>).</p>
<p>Egypt had convinced the people of Israel and Judah that with its help the Assyrians and the Babylonians could not stand their ground in Palestine. In 722 <span class="era">BC</span> the Assyrian troops took the northern capital of Samaria, and in 586 the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem, while Egypt remained passive. The Egyptians had desired control over Palestine for economic reasons, but not at the expense of their own welfare. Egypt, too, would lose its leadership under God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Ezek.29.9-16">29:9-16</a>). Reduced to dependence on foreign powers, Egypt would no longer be a stumbling block for Israel. First, Babylonia was permitted to break Egypt’s power (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.1-32.21">23:1–32:21</a>); later, the Persians, Greeks, and Romans would incorporate Egypt as a province. The fall of Egypt coincided with the fall of several great and small kingdoms: Assyria (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.22-23">32:22-23</a>), Elam (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.24-25">24-25</a>), Meshech and Tubal (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.26-28">26-28</a>), Edom (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.29">29</a>), and Sidon (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.30">30</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Proclamation of Hope (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-48.35">33:1–48:35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After the visions of God’s judgment on the surrounding nations, Ezekiel returns to the future hope of Israel. In the first major section of his book he dealt with the reasons for Judah’s exile and the destruction of the temple, alluding often to the future of Israel. But the prophet’s organization of his material included, between prophecies of Israel’s judgment and restoration, the oracles of God’s judgment on Israel’s neighbors who had encouraged and rejoiced in its fall. Throughout its history Israel had allowed foreign nations to influence its religion, culture, and form of government. The reduction of their powers meant Israel, restored to the Promised Land, would be more free for faithfulness to God. Before taking up the theme of the restoration, Ezekiel reviews the emphases of chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-24.27">1–24</a>: (1) He was called to be a watchman over Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.1-9">33:1-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-3.21">1:1–3:21</a>). (2) Israel had sinned against the Lord and had to receive a righteous judgment (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.10">33:10</a>). (3) Jerusalem was to be taken by the Babylonians (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.21">21</a>). (4) Israel’s repentance is necessary for restoration (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.11-16">11-16</a>).</p>
<p>Thus far, his ministry had not met with success. The exiles who had heard his messages were full of appreciation for Ezekiel’s rhetorical and literary abilities (<a href="?bref=Ezek.33.32">33:32</a>). They readily accepted Ezekiel as a watchman who warned the people of the impending catastrophe at Jerusalem, and they may have admitted that their sin was the reason for God’s judgment on Israel and Jerusalem. But they were slow in applying the prophetic word to their own lives. God was ready to forgive their sins if they repented, acknowledged him, and demonstrated their renewed spirit by practicing the law of God (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.32">32</a>). Now that the news of Jerusalem had been reported to the exiles (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.21">21</a>), the necessity for the people to act responsibly was even more urgent. The Lord had demonstrated that Ezekiel was a true prophet (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.33">33</a>).</p>
<p>The success of Ezekiel’s ministry was not measured in numbers. He faithfully declared the word of God in word, sign, and parable. The exiles had followed the false hopes proclaimed by false “shepherds” who had fattened themselves at the expense of the flock (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.2-3">34:2-3</a>). They did not take care of those in need (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.4">4</a>), and they allowed the flock to be scattered (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.5-6">5-6</a>). God promised his people that he would be the faithful shepherd, bring the sheep together, feed them, and care for them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.11-15">34:11-15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1-6">Ps 23</a>). God would also distinguish between the sheep and the goats, to find out whose hearts were right with him, so that the true sheep could be restored to God’s flock (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.20-22">Ez 34:20-22</a>). God’s promise included the restoration of the land and the restoration of the divinely appointed Davidic dynasty (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.24">24</a>). The renewed fellowship between the Lord and Israel under the messianic ruler would be sealed with a new covenant, the “covenant of peace.” That covenant assured the people of God’s blessing on their labor, bringing them abundant harvests (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.26-27">26-27</a>). The people would not be forced to fight against nature in their pursuits (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.25-28">25-28</a>). They would not have to struggle against other peoples who might try to share in their blessings by force (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.27-29">27-29</a>). The prophetic vision telescoped the events of the restoration of Israel after the exile, the coming of Jesus the Messiah (cf. <a href="?bref=John.10.1-42">Jn 10</a>), and the full restoration of the sin-cursed world.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.1-31">34</a> is the key to the messages of restoration. The emphases include the outworking of the frequently repeated verse “They will truly be my people, and I will be their God” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.20">11:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.30">34:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.28">36:28</a>). The most significant aspects of the restoration theme include: (1) God’s gracious restoration of his people to covenant blessing (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.20-36">36:20-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.23-26">37:23-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.25">39:25</a>); (2) God’s restoration of the nation of Israel to the land (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.1-15,24">36:1-15, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.14-23">37:14-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.27">39:27</a>); (3) God’s new covenant, giving his Spirit to his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25-27">36:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.14">37:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.29">39:29</a>), and his blessing on his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.8-12,29-38">36:8-12, 29-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.9-10,26">39:9-10, 26</a>), assuring them of victory over their enemies (<a href="?bref=Ezek.35.1-15">35:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.36">36:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.28">37:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.1-39.24">38:1–39:24</a>); (4) God’s appointment of a Davidic king, the Messiah, over his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.24-25">37:24-25</a>); and (5) God’s temple restored among his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.26-27">37:26-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The People of God</p>
<p class="fl">The rejection of the exiles did not last forever. Based on the Abrahamic covenant, the Lord promised to bless the faithful remnant and to make of them a new people. The imagery of a valley of dry bones is particularly fitting. The dry bones represent God’s people without hope (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.11">37:11</a>). Ezekiel proclaims to them the good news that God will renew and restore them (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.12">12</a>). The Lord’s purpose for his people is that all the nations may honor his holy name through his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.39.7,25-27">39:7, 25-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Land</p>
<p class="fl">The promise also extends to the land, originally given to Abraham and his descendants. The Abrahamic covenant included a messianic element, for through the family of Abraham living in the Promised Land all nations would receive God’s blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gn 12:3</a>). In a vision Ezekiel saw the boundaries and described the division of the land (<a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1-48.35">Ez 47–48</a>). The royal city of Jerusalem is the central symbol of God’s presence among his people; its name will be “The Lord is there” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.48.8-35">48:8-35</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The New Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">The Abrahamic covenant is renewed, a gracious covenant that expresses the restored relationship. “Covenant of peace” fittingly describes its nature and benefits. The restless people of God are promised rest from their searching, their enemies, and their toil. The change in relationship is further emphasized by God’s sending of his Spirit, who will add a new dimension to the lifestyle of his people. Obedience to God will no longer be constrained, for God’s Spirit helps his people to do his will. A new heart, controlled by the Spirit of God, is given to the Lord’s people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.26-27">36:26-27</a>). The presence of the Spirit also signifies a new life for the people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.14">37:14</a>; see <a href="?bref=John.3.8,16">Jn 3:8, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.2-4,15">Rom 8:2-4, 15</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Messiah</p>
<p class="fl">The OT hope of a messianic king is crystallized in Ezekiel’s message. His rule will be everlasting (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.25">Ez 37:25</a>), over all God’s people who have new hearts (vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.15-25">15-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Temple</p>
<p class="fl">As a priest, Ezekiel remained keenly interested in the temple, priesthood, sacrificial regulations, and festivals. A large section of the prophecy’s last division describes the temple’s revived worship (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-46.24">40:1–46:24</a>). His vision of the glory of God, so important in the messages of God’s judgment on Jerusalem (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1-28">1</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-11.25">10–11</a>), now assures the remnant that God did not forsake his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.2-5">43:2-5</a>). He will dwell among them, for the temple is a symbol of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.27">37:27</a>). Some interpreters believe that the temple, with its ritual as described in <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-46.24">Ezekiel 40–46</a>, will be restored in the messianic era before the last judgment. Others believe the promises about the temple provide a positive symbolic answer to Ezekiel’s greatest concern: whether God will return to be with his people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.48.35">48:35</a>; see <a href="?bref=John.2.21">Jn 2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.22">Rv 21:22</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="EzekielSTemple"/>
<p>There are various interpretations of chapters <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.1-48.35">34–48</a>. As a watchman to Israel, Ezekiel had a message for the exiled Jewish community. Thus the prophecy’s fulfillment must have begun with the decree of Cyrus I (538 <span class="era">BC</span>) permitting the Jews to return to their land (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-3">Ezr 1:1-3</a>). Two rival schools of interpretation exist on how the prophecy is fulfilled beyond Israel’s restoration to the land. Those who interpret Israel as simply the nation view the modern return of Jewish people to the land of Israel as a continuation of God’s prophetic promise. They believe that God’s plan for Israel is being fulfilled along with, and in addition to, his plan for the Christian church. The fulfillment of those prophecies will be inaugurated by the coming of the messianic king, who will give earthly peace to the Jewish people. The temple worship (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ez 40–48</a>) will be restored in some way during the period of the messianic kingdom. The church will enjoy a small share in all the events centered on the Jews. The promises of Ezekiel’s vision are thus limited to the nation of Israel and must be fulfilled before the coming of a new heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Other interpreters believe that Ezekiel wrote for the benefit of spiritual descendants of Abraham who believe, as Abraham did, in God’s promises (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gn 15:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.4.11-13">Rom 4:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-9,29">Gal 3:6-9, 29</a>). All who have faith like Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, are regarded as Abraham’s offspring (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.28-29">Gal 3:28-29</a>). Ezekiel’s message thus would include all of God’s gracious work among Christian Gentiles, who have become the recipients of God’s promises and benefits. It is possible, on the basis of <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.10-11">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>, to interpret Ezekiel’s language as a prophetic expression of how God’s grace would come to all those who become reconciled to God through faith in the gospel.</p>

<p class="fl">Important port near some significant ruins at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba. Ezion-geber was one of the stations where the Israelites encamped while on their way to the plains of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.33.35-36">Nm 33:35-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.8">Dt 2:8</a>). The city is not mentioned again until Solomon’s time. From this port Solomon and Hiram, king of Tyre, carried on a profitable commercial venture. Solomon’s products included copper (mined in the Arabah at Timna, 15 miles, or 24.1 kilometers, north of Ezion-geber), olive oil, and possibly products bought from Egypt, such as linen, and chariots (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.28-29">1 Kgs 10:28-29</a>). The “ships of Tarshish,” with the ships of Hiram, made a round trip of three years from Ezion-geber to many ports along the coasts of Africa and Arabia and possibly even as far as India (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.22">1 Kgs 10:22</a>). In exchange the fleet brought back gold from Ophir, along with precious stones, almug wood (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.11-12">11-12</a>), silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.22">22</a>). Solomon’s alliance with the Phoenicians of Tyre gave him a port on the Mediterranean (which he himself did not have). The alliance also gave Hiram and the Phoenicians an outlet at Ezion-geber for trading in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>With the division of the kingdom after Solomon, the port was under Judah’s control. It was burned and destroyed by Shishak of Egypt in his invasion of Judah in Rehoboam’s fifth year (925 <span class="era">BC</span>). A second city was built on the ruins, but there is no mention of a navy. Jehoshaphat was able to restore the fleet to sail once again, but some storm or other disaster wrecked the ships (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48">1 Kgs 22:48</a>). In subsequent Judean history, Judah was able to use the port when it was strong, but in its times of weakness, other nations did (e.g., Edom, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">2 Kgs 8:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.6">16:6</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Exodusthe_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Exodus, The</a>; <a href="?item=WildernessWanderings_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Wilderness Wanderings</a>.</p>

<p class="list">1. Religious reformer following Israel’s return from exile. Ezra’s genealogy (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-5">Ezr 7:1-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3-15">1 Chr 6:3-15</a>) places him in the high priestly Aaron-Zadok family line, which accounts for the importance of his scribal and priestly activities. He is called “priest” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.10,16">Ezr 10:10, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.8.2">Neh 8:2</a>), “scribe” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.6">Ezr 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.36">Neh 12:36</a>), and “priest and scribe” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.11-12">Ezr 7:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.8.9">Neh 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.26">12:26</a>).

In the commission of the Persian king Artaxerxes to Ezra, the king described him as “priest” and “scribe” (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.6-11">Ezr 7:6-11</a>). It was Ezra who began the traditional view of the scribe as a religious leader, a “bookman”; the view lasted until 200 <span class="era">BC</span>. Scribes were qualified to teach and preach the Scriptures as well as interpret them, but by the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, the scribe’s function was more specialized.</p>

<p class="list-text">As “Secretary of State for Jewish Affairs” in the Persian Empire, Ezra visited Jerusalem about 458 <span class="era">BC</span>, and on his return reported his findings. Little was done, however, until Nehemiah went to Jerusalem in 445. Once the city walls had been rebuilt, Ezra instituted a religious reformation in which the ancient Torah (the Law) was made the norm for Jewish life. He also demanded that Jews who had married foreigners must divorce them to maintain the Jewish purity the Torah required. Ezra set an example of piety and dedication through prayer and fasting, and this placed his reforming zeal in proper spiritual perspective. He set the pattern for life in the postexilic Jewish commonwealth, making God’s Word and worship central features. The date and place of his death are unknown.</p>

<p class="fl">In the Talmud tractate <span class="ital">Baba Bathra</span> 15a, the rabbis and scribes regarded Ezra and Nehemiah as one book. Josephus (<span class="ital">Apion</span> 1.8) also considered the two books to be one when the number of OT books was given as 22. Some church fathers, such as Melito of Sardis and Jerome, thought of them as one book. The Septuagint (Greek translation of the OT) also grouped the two books as one, referring to them as 2 Ezra to distinguish them from an apocryphal book known as 1 Ezra. The Latin Vulgate, however, called Ezra “1 Ezra” and Nehemiah “2 Ezra.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The Jewish people came under the rule of the Persian Empire when Cyrus conquered Babylon in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>. From then until Ezra’s time, the Persian kings were Cyrus (539–530 <span class="era">BC</span>), who allowed the Jewish people and other captives to return to their homeland (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">Ezr 1</a>); Cambyses (529–522 <span class="era">BC</span>); Gaumata, a usurper of the throne (522 <span class="era">BC</span>); Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.6">Ezr 5:6</a>); Xerxes I (OT Ahasuerus, 486–465 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.6">Ezr 4:6</a>); and Artaxerxes I (465–424 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7-23">Ezr 4:7-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-10.44">7:1–10:44</a>). Both Ezra’s and Nehemiah’s work fall within the period between Cyrus and Artaxerxes I. Some scholars, however, place Ezra during the reign of Artaxerxes II (404–359 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Sources">Sources</p>
<p class="fl">By tradition, the Jewish leader Ezra researched and put together the material that forms his book. Chapters <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-10.44">7–10</a> are written in the first person singular, and Ezra may have used the autobiographical passages as the core of this book, adding information from other sources. That the book contains portions written in Aramaic has been used as justification for assigning a date later than Ezra’s time. But the Aramaic of Ezra bears a remarkable similarity to fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> Aramaic papyri from the Jewish community at Elephantine in Egypt.</p>
<p>The book is largely a compilation, using autobiography, official documents, edicts, and other material. The present book of Ezra contains four identifiable strata of source material.</p>
<p class="h3">Memoirs of Ezra</p>
<p class="fl">Certain sections appear in the first person singular (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.27-9.15">7:27–9:15</a>), located between third-person narratives (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-26">7:1-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.1-44">10</a>). The memoirs were probably part of Ezra’s own official reports.</p>
<p class="h3">Aramaic Documents</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic was the diplomatic language of the Persian Empire, and a number of documents appear in the book of Ezra. A letter of complaint was written to Artaxerxes I about the rebuilding of the city walls, for example, and Ezra also included the official reply (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.8-23">Ezr 4:8-23</a>). There is also a letter of Darius I and the king’s reply (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-6.18">5:1–6:18</a>). An official authorization by the Persian court of Artaxerxes permitted Ezra to return, and this included a description of material entrusted into his keeping (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.12-26">7:12-26</a>). Since all of those sections were official correspondence, the record naturally is written in Aramaic.</p>
<p class="h3">Hebrew Lists</p>
<p class="fl">Ezra included Hebrew documents listing people’s names for a number of purposes. One such document indicated the Persian government’s permission for Jewish immigrants to return to the land of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezr 1:2-4</a>). It was a Jewish version of Cyrus’s general edict expressing concern for all his subjects. The edict in Aramaic is repeated by Ezra in <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.3-5">6:3-5</a>, and that version is probably taken from an original memorandum of a royal decision. Ezra included lists of the immigrants who returned to begin the second commonwealth of Israel (ch <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.1-70">2</a>, repeated in <a href="?bref=Neh.7.1-73">Neh 7</a>). The book also contains a list of immigrants who returned with Ezra by permission of Artaxerxes I (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.1-14">Ezr 8:1-14</a>). Lists of those who had married pagan wives are provided as well (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.18-43">10:18-43</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Narrative</p>
<p class="fl">The rest of the book comprises narrative by Ezra himself. For the period of the first return prior to his own time, he probably drew upon existing sources, either oral or documentary. Material in the book that was contemporary with the scribe would be his personal account about his own work.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Traditionally, the Artaxerxes in <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1">Ezra 7:1</a> has been identified with Artaxerxes I Longimanus. Ezra’s arrival in Jerusalem would thus have been in 458 <span class="era">BC</span> (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg for <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.8">7:8</a>). Therefore, Ezra’s work at Jerusalem started before that of Nehemiah, who came in 445 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>But the traditional dates are questioned from a number of sources. One alternative is to place Nehemiah during the reign of Artaxerxes I (464–424 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Ezra at a later date, in the reign of Artaxerxes II Mnemon (404–359 <span class="era">BC</span>). Such a suggestion creates a difficulty with <a href="?bref=Neh.8.2">Nehemiah 8:2</a>, because there Ezra is named as Nehemiah’s contemporary and coworker.</p>
<p>In addition, the Elephantine papyri (407–400 <span class="era">BC</span>) mention the high priest Johanan in Jerusalem, and Sanballat as governor of Samaria. Johanan is considered a grandson of Eliashib, but Nehemiah was a contemporary of Eliashib (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.1,20">Neh 3:1, 20</a>). The biblical material that speaks of Nehemiah going to Jerusalem in the 20th year of Artaxerxes (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">Neh 2:1</a>, 445 <span class="era">BC</span>) and again during the 32nd year (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.6">Neh 13:6</a>, 433 <span class="era">BC</span>) refers to Eliashib’s contemporary high priesthood with Ezra. The traditional position thus furnishes a reasonable date for the book of Ezra. If the scribe were placed during the reign of Artaxerxes II (c. 397 <span class="era">BC</span>), his ministry would be too late for the high priesthood of Johanan.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LanguagesTextsandVersions">Languages, Texts, and Versions</p>
<p class="fl">The primary language of the book of Ezra is Hebrew; the exceptions are <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.7">4:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.18">6:18</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.12-26">7:12-26</a>, which are written in Aramaic. The Hebrew portion appears to resemble the language of Daniel, Haggai, and 2 Chronicles much more than later Hebrew, such as that of Ecclesiasticus. As indicated, the Aramaic portions resemble the Elephantine papyri, dated about 407–400 <span class="era">BC</span>. In addition, Persian personal and family names and Persian words and expressions occur in the book, such as Bigvai, Mithredath, and Elam. All of these evidences serve to place the book in about the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The Hebrew Masoretic Text of Ezra seems well preserved. The Septuagint version is a bit shorter than the Masoretic Text. Only parts of <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-24">Ezra 4</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-17">5</a> have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandContent">Purpose and Content</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Ezra is a straightforward account of one of the most important events in Jewish history. From a priestly point of view, it is an account of the restoration of Jewish people to their homeland following the Babylonian dispersion. The record tells of two distinct returns, one under the leadership of Zerubbabel (chs <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-6.22">1–6</a>; 538 <span class="era">BC</span>), and 80 years later, the second return led by Ezra (chs <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-10.44">7–10</a>; 458 <span class="era">BC</span>). The book emphasizes Ezra’s leadership and the reestablishment of the people on their land, both of which were to have important future consequences.</p>
<p>Little is known about the political activity of Ezra in the Persian court. He appears to have been a man of considerable influence, however, and could well be described as an official who held a position corresponding to that of “Secretary of State for Jewish Affairs.” To what extent that function applied to the Persian Empire as a whole is uncertain, since Ezra’s recorded activities took place only in the area known to the Persians as the province “Beyond the River,” that is, the territory lying to the west of the Euphrates. The importance of Ezra’s position in the Persian Empire is indicated by the fact that King Artaxerxes gave him full authority to do whatever he thought necessary for the welfare of his people and the empire (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.21-26">7:21-26</a>). Ezra’s genealogy is given in <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1-5">7:1-5</a>, and he is consistently spoken of as a scribe learned in the Mosaic law. As a descendant of Zadok the priest, he would have the authority to instruct others in the Torah.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-24">4</a> speaks of the opposition to rebuilding the temple and the walls. We should recognize that Ezra’s approach in this chapter is topical rather than chronological where, in the middle of describing the earlier opposition to building the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-5">5:1-5</a>), he complained that the same kind of opposition was being repeated in his day concerning the attempt to rebuild the city walls and repair the fortifications of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.7-23">5:7-23</a>). Internal evidence suggests that a long historical interval ensued during the reign of Ahasuerus, or Xerxes, and the early part of Artaxerxes’ regime. During this period, complaints were made to the Persian authorities that the returned Judeans were rebuilding the city wall of Jerusalem, and as a result the work was halted for some time. It readily can be seen that Ezra was dealing with the evil intentions of Judah’s enemies and that the opposition of Rehum and Shimshai did not appear in the 520s (when the temple was being built) because they lived in the 460s, early in the reign of Artaxerxes I.</p>
<p>But the initial passage is actually a history of opposition to rebuilding the ruined temple. It narrates the frustrations experienced by the Judean community from the time of return to their homeland during Cyrus’s rule (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-5">4:1-5</a>) up to the time of King Darius (v <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.24">24</a>). The prophet Haggai (520 <span class="era">BC</span>) aroused the people with his message and persuaded them to lay the foundations of the new temple.</p>
<p>Ezra resumes the theme of the book in chapter <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-17">5</a>. He points out the problems, frustrations, and hindrances the Jewish people had with the construction of the temple. It was not until a diligent search had been made in the archives by the Persian authorities that the original edict granting permission to build the temple was found (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.7-6.5">5:7–6:5</a>).</p>
