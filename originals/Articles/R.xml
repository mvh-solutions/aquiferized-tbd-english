  <title>Rabbah of the Ammonites</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">RABBAH OF THE AMMONITES</p>
<p class="fl">Capital of the ancient Ammonite kingdom. Located near the sources of the Jabbok River, it stood about 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) east of the Jordan and lay astride the main caravan route leading from Damascus south along the length of the Transjordanian plateau. This road was also known as the King’s Highway (<a href="?bref=Num.20.17">Nm 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.21.22">21:22</a>). Modern Amman, the capital of Jordan, covers the ancient city. During the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt rebuilt the city and renamed it Philadelphia. After the Romans took Palestine in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, the city became part of the Decapolis, and after <span class="era">AD</span> 106 was part of the Roman province of Arabia.</p>
<p>Rabbah first appears in Scripture as the place where the great iron bedstead of Og, king of Bashan, was kept (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">Dt 3:11</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Rabbath of the children of Ammon”). When Transjordan was divided among the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, the territory of Gad extended to the vicinity of Rabbah but did not include it (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.25">Jos 13:25</a>).</p>
<p>Rabbah figured most significantly in Scripture during David’s reign. At that time Joab laid siege to the city, and during the battle, Uriah the Hittite lost his life by the specific command of the king (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1">2 Sm 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.26-29">12:26-29</a>). The city was built in two parts—the upper city and the lower city, called the “city of waters” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.27">12:27</a>). Joab took the lower city and perhaps gained control of the water supply, and then waited for David to come and complete the conquest (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.27-28">27-28</a>). After a thorough sack of Rabbah, David did not station troops in the city but left it under the control of the Ammonites, who became vassals of Israel.</p>
<p>About 250 years later, Amos pronounced judgment on the then-prosperous city (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.13-14">Am 1:13-14</a>). When Nebuchadnezzar stopped at Rabbah during his invasion of Transjordan, it was a significant place (<a href="?bref=Ezek.21.20">Ez 21:20</a>). It was at Rabbah that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, later plotted the attack that resulted in the death of Gedaliah (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.14-16">Jer 40:14ff</a>.), the Babylonian governor of Judea, and the exile of Jeremiah into Egypt. Jeremiah’s prophecy against Rabbah is recorded in <a href="?bref=Jer.49.2-3">Jeremiah 49:2-3</a>.</p>
<p>Since modern Amman covers ancient Rabbah, no excavation of the ancient city is possible. The Roman theater stands in the center of the city, with seating for 6,000 people. Dilapidated remains of an odeum, or music hall, and a fountain, also of the Roman period, stand nearby. Everything visible on the ancient citadel is Roman, Byzantine, or Arab, except at the northeast corner, where part of the Iron Age town wall is still exposed. The Roman temple at the southwest corner of the citadel was dedicated to Hercules.</p>

<p class="h1">RABBI</p>
<p class="fl">Title of respect, meaning “my great one” or “my superior one,” used in Jesus’ day for Jewish religious teachers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Matt.23.7">Matthew 23:7</a>, “rabbi” was evidently used as a common title of address for the Jewish scribes and Pharisees. However, in the NT it is most commonly used as a title of respectful address when others were speaking to Jesus. It was used by Nathanael (<a href="?bref=John.1.49">Jn 1:49</a>), by Peter and Andrew (v <a href="?bref=John.1.38">38</a>), by Nicodemus (<a href="?bref=John.3.2">3:2</a>), by the disciples as a group (<a href="?bref=John.9.2">9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.8">11:8</a>), and by a crowd generally (<a href="?bref=John.6.25">6:25</a>). Mary Magdalene (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.51">Mk 10:51</a>) and blind Bartimaeus (<a href="?bref=John.20.16">Jn 20:16</a>) both use the longer form, “rabboni,” to address Jesus directly, thus indicating even more profound respect than the use of the shorter title “rabbi.” By the time of the writing of John’s Gospel, the title “rabbi” meant “teacher”; John explicitly states this in <a href="?bref=John.1.38">1:38</a> and implicitly says this in <a href="?bref=John.3.2">3:2</a>.</p>
<p>Jesus condemns the scribes and the Pharisees for their evident pride displayed in their love of being greeted in the marketplaces and their insistence on having people call them “rabbi” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.7-8">Mt 23:7-8</a>). Jesus prohibited the use of the title for his own disciples, saying, “You are not to be called rabbi.” However, Jesus’ prohibition was more against seeking to be called this and insisting on it than the legitimate possession of the title itself. In fact, when people did use the title of Jesus in a reverent way, they were not in any way rebuked.</p>

<p class="h1">RACA*</p>
<p class="fl">Derogatory expression used by Jews of the first century <span class="era">AD</span> to show open contempt for another. <span class="ital">Raca</span> is derived from an Aramaic and Hebrew term meaning “empty” or “worthless.” Literally meaning “empty-headed,” <span class="ital">raca</span> probably insinuates an intellectual stupidity or inferiority rather than a moral deficiency. In the OT it is comparable to the worthless lot that Abimelech hired to follow him (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.4">Jgs 9:4</a>), the idle men who gathered around Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.3">11:3</a>), and the scoundrels who joined up with Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.7">2 Chr 13:7</a>). Michal accused David of acting like one of the vulgar fellows [<span class="ital">raca</span>] who shamelessly uncovered himself (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.20">2 Sm 6:20</a>).

According to Jesus, the perpetrator of the insult was to be judged by the highest court of the land and punished by its severest penalty. The commandment against murder (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.13">Ex 20:13</a>) not only prohibited the deed itself but also the thoughts of unrighteous anger and expressions of unwarranted contempt.</p>

<p class="h1">RACHEL</p>
<p class="fl">Beautiful younger daughter of Laban; she was the favorite wife of Jacob. He first met her as he arrived at Haran in Paddan-aram. There he assisted her by attending to the needs of Rachel’s father’s sheep, removing a stone from the mouth of a well in order to water them (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.10">Gn 29:10</a>). Jacob loved Rachel exceedingly and agreed to work seven years for Laban in return for her hand in marriage. His seven years’ service seemed like only a few days because of his great love for her. Laban deceptively reneged on his bargain and required Jacob to marry Leah, his older, less attractive daughter, before finally giving him Rachel for his wife. Unlike Leah, Rachel was barren in the early years of her marriage to Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.1">30:1</a>). Consequently, she gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob in order to have children. Thus, through this commonly accepted ancient custom, Dan and Naphtali were born. In time, Rachel herself conceived and bore Joseph (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.30.22-25">22-25</a>). After this, Jacob took his wives, children, and possessions away from Haran.</p>
<p>Somewhere between Bethel and Bethlehem, Rachel died while giving birth to Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.16,19">Gn 35:16, 19</a>). Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb there, a landmark known even in the days of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.2">1 Sm 10:2</a>). Rachel and Leah are highly regarded as those who built up the house of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.11">Ru 4:11</a>). In <a href="?bref=Jer.31.15">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, Rachel is pictured as crying for her children being carried off into captivity. Later, Matthew recalls Jeremiah’s words in Herod’s slaughter of the male infants (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.18">Mt 2:18</a>).</p>

Two persisting traditions make its original location still questionable.

This option has won the impressive historical support of Josephus, Eusebius, Jerome, Origen, and the Talmudists. A second site is Ephrath (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.19">Gn 35:19</a>), which was on the northern border of Benjamin, 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) north of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.2">1 Sm 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.15">Jer 31:15</a>), near ancient Bethel.</p>

<p class="fl">Heroine of the battle of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.1-6.27">Jos 2–6</a>). Soon after Moses’ death, God told Joshua that he and the people were to cross the Jordan and occupy the land of promise. Before the crossing, however, Joshua sent two spies into the land to reconnoiter the opposition, in particular the fortified city of Jericho. Upon entering the city, the spies found their way quickly to Rahab’s house, which was perhaps an inn and/or a brothel. She apparently was a prostitute.</p>
<p>News of the arrival of spies was not long in reaching the king of Jericho, who quite naturally demanded that Rahab divulge their whereabouts. She cleverly admitted seeing them but insisted that they had left the city at nightfall. Actually, the spies were hiding under the stalks of flax on the roof of her house. When the king’s search party left Jericho to hunt the spies, Rahab confessed to the spies the reason for her complicity with the Israelites’ cause. She feared the God of the Jews, believing that he would surely give them victory (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.11">Jos 2:11</a>).</p>
<p>For her help, the spies agreed to save Rahab and her family. The sign was to be a cord of scarlet thread hanging from her window, the same avenue the spies used to escape the city. Rahab and her family were indeed the only survivors of the subsequent battle. They were led to safety, on Joshua’s command, by the very men Rahab had saved.</p>
<p>Rahab became the wife of Salmon and mother of Boaz, and thus an ancestor of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Mt 1:5</a>). Rahab is listed, along with Moses, David, Samson, and Samuel, as an example of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.31">Heb 11:31</a>).

Ramah, positioned near Bethel, was the place where Deborah judged Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.5">Jgs 4:5</a>). This city was a temporary resting place for a Levite and his concubine traveling north from Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.13">19:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">During the period of the divided kingdom (930– 722 <span class="era">BC</span>), King Baasha of Israel (908–886 <span class="era">BC</span>) fortified Ramah. From Ramah, Baasha was able to prevent an invasion of King Asa’s (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>) Judean army. Baasha later abandoned the city and hurried his army north to repulse a Syrian offensive led by King Ben-hadad I (c. 885 <span class="era">BC</span>). Asa dismantled Ramah’s military fortifications, using the material to build the towns of Geba and Mizpah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.17-22">1 Kgs 15:17-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.1-6">2 Chr 16:1-6</a>).</p>

Later King Nebuchadnezzar used Ramah as a place of detainment for the Jews being deported to Babylon.

<p class="fl">Place (also called Ra’amses or Ramses) mentioned with Pithom in <a href="?bref=Exod.1.11">Exodus 1:11</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Raamses”) as one of the locations where the Hebrews were engaged in a building program for the pharaoh. Here they were afflicted with heavy burdens by the pharaoh’s officers. In due course they escaped their oppression and set out for the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.37">Ex 12:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.3">Nm 33:3</a>). The identification of this place and the period is important for establishing the date of the exodus from Egypt.</p>
<p>The great Ramses II (c. 1290–1224 <span class="era">BC</span>) built extensively in the east Delta region. The ambitious pharaoh determined to add a center of his creation, using as a nucleus the old family seat of Avaris, where his father had built a summer palace. On the north side of Avaris, he built a majestic palace that he named Pirameses. The location of its site is much debated, having been variously located at Pelusim (on the Mediterranean Sea) and at Tanis (or Zoan). This latter suggestion is now rejected since the stonework was reused material taken from elsewhere and not original. However, 19 miles (30.6 kilometers) south of Tanis, near the town of Qantir, considerable remains of a palace commenced by Seti I, with an adjacent glazing factory, dwellings of princes and high officials, and traces of a temple and public audience halls, are now recognized as the site of Ra’amses (Pirameses). The old Hyksos center was destroyed when these foreigners were expelled early in the 18th dynasty (c. 1552–1306 <span class="era">BC</span>). The place was then abandoned but later rebuilt under the 19th dynasty. Ramses II lavishly adorned his father’s palace and established nearby a marshaling place for his chariots, a mustering place for his infantry, and a mooring place for his ships.</p>

<p class="h1">RAMOTH-GILEAD</p>
<p class="fl">City lying in the Transjordan area of Gilead and probably identifiable with Tell Ramith, although the site of Tell el-Husn has also been suggested. Initially, biblical references pertain to Ramoth in Gilead (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.43">Dt 4:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.20.8">Jos 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.38">21:38</a>), while later it is called Ramoth-gilead. Combined names were used to avoid confusion with cities of the same name in other locations.</p>
<p>Ramoth-gilead, a possession of the tribe of Gad, first appears in the biblical narrative as one of three Transjordan cities of refuge (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.43">Dt 4:43</a>) later included in the six cities of refuge for all Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.8">Jos 20:8</a>). It was allotted to the Merarites as one of 48 Levitical cities (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.38">21:38</a>) and was most likely located along the King’s Highway, which transversed that area.</p>
<p>During the time of Solomon, Ramoth-gilead enjoyed a place of prominence as the central city in his sixth administrative district and the residence of Ben-geber, chief officer of that district (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">1 Kgs 4:13</a>). After the division of the kingdom, this border town was taken by the Arameans and became a site of contention between Israel and Aram. King Ahab’s final battle began with his desire to retake Ramoth-gilead. In seeking to convince his ally Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, to support him in this maneuver, he produced many prophets who spoke favorable and victorious words to the king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-53">1 Kgs 22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-34">2 Chr 18</a>). Unconvinced, Jehoshaphat inquired of the word of the Lord through Micaiah, a prophet of the Lord, who warned of impending disaster. The message was ignored and Ahab was killed at Ramoth-gilead. Ahab’s son Joram also fought with Aram here and was wounded in battle (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.29">2 Kgs 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.22.6">2 Chr 22:6</a>; also called Ramah). Shortly thereafter, Elisha sent one of the sons of the prophets to Ramoth-gilead, where he anointed Jehu to be king over Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-14">2 Kgs 9:1-14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">RAMSES* (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Name of 11 kings of the 19th and 20th Egyptian dynasties (also spelled Rameses). Ramses II reigned for some 67 years (c. 1290–1224 <span class="era">BC</span>). He was known as Ramses the Great, mostly because of his extensive building activities, such as his mortuary temple at Thebes (the Ramasseum), the rock-cut temple of Abu Simbel in Nubia, and his additions to the temples of Karnak and Luxor. Pictured on his temple walls as a great military leader, he fought with the Hittites at Kadesh on the Orontes, where, because of a serious tactical blunder on his part, he nearly lost his life. The battle was at best a draw, but he depicted it as an Egyptian victory in the Ramasseum and Abu Simbel. His treaty with the Hittites is the earliest known international nonaggression pact. He has often been suggested as the pharaoh of the oppression (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.8-11">Ex 1:8-11</a>), but this is improbable.</p>
<p>Ramses III (c. 1195–1124 <span class="era">BC</span>), of the 20th dynasty, saved Egypt from an invasion by the Sea Peoples in a land and sea battle in the Nile Delta. He built a large mortuary temple complex and royal residence in the Theban area, at Medinet Habu. On the northern exterior wall of the temple area are the first known representations of a naval battle. Among the captives are the Peleset, who are believed to be Philistines. The exterior walls also bear excellent reliefs of lion and wild-bull hunts. From late in the reign of Ramses III comes the famous Harris Papyrus, which lists the benefactions of the king to Amon. Because of withheld wages in kind, workers in the royal necropolis went on strike. Similar strikes occurred in the times of Ramses IX and X. From the end of the reign of Ramses III come records of the court trial of a harem conspiracy in which Ramses III apparently was killed.</p>
<p>The other Ramessides were minor rulers who played no great part in history. The instability of the country is further illustrated by widespread looting of the royal tombs. A complicated and dubious investigation of these robberies was conducted in the reign of Ramses IX.</p>

<p class="h1">RANSOM</p>
<p class="fl">Price for redeeming or liberating slaves, captives, property, or life. Jesus described his entire ministry as one of service in giving his life as a ransom for many (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>). Hence, “ransom” is closely linked to such terms as “redemption” and “salvation,” to the satisfaction Christ made in atonement for sin.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="ToWhomWasTheRansomPaid"/>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT God provided various regulations for his covenant people whereby life and property could be “redeemed,” “bought back,” or “set free” by payment of ransom (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-27.34">Lv 25–27</a>). Ransom involved a price paid as a substitute for that which was redeemed or set free.</p>
<p>The OT uses three different Hebrew words for ransom or redemption. Only when there is a clear indication of the payment of a price are these terms translated by “ransom.” But even when another term, such as “redemption,” is used in English translation, a ransom price is usually implied.</p>
<p>One of the Hebrew terms (<span class="hebrew">kopher</span>) means a “cover” or a “covering.” It was a replacement payment made in exchange for punishment. A ransom could be paid to redeem the life of the owner of an ox that had gored a person to death (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.30">Ex 21:30</a>). A half-shekel ransom price was required by God for each Israelite at census taking to prevent a plague (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.12">30:12</a>), and this “atonement money” was an offering to the Lord for use in the tabernacle service. A murderer could not be ransomed, and anyone who found safety in a city of refuge could not be taken back by ransom (<a href="?bref=Num.35.31-32">Nm 35:31-32</a>). It was impossible to avoid death by paying a ransom (<a href="?bref=Ps.49.7-9">Ps 49:7-9</a>). But in a few instances the term takes on the meaning of a “bribe” or “hush money” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.12.3">1 Sm 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.35">Prv 6:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.12">Am 5:12</a>).</p>
<p>A second Hebrew word-family for “ransom” and “redemption” is related to <span class="hebrew">go’el</span><span class="ital">.</span> <span class="hebrew">Go’el</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning a “reclaimant” or “redeemer,” derives from the root meaning of the Hebrew term “to restore, repair, deliver, rescue.” The term refers to God’s family-law regulations that place various obligations on a relative or kinsman (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.25-55">Lv 25:25-55</a>). The kinsman had the right and duty of redeeming by ransom any family property that a person was compelled to sell (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.25-34">Lv 25:25-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.4-6">Ru 4:4-6</a>); of ransoming a relative who was compelled by poverty to sell himself as a slave to a stranger or sojourner (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-55">Lv 25:47-55</a>); and of acting as avenger of the blood of a dead relative, thus enforcing the claim for satisfaction for shedding his blood (<a href="?bref=Num.35.19-27">Nm 35:19-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.20.3-5">Jos 20:3-5</a>). The kinsman was also obligated to marry the wife of a dead brother who had died without leaving children so that the kinsman might raise up seed and the brother’s name not be forgotten in Israel (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.9-13">Ru 3:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.1-12">4:1-12</a>). In a general sense the <span class="hebrew">go’el</span> was a “vindicator” or “redeemer”; a familiar example is Job’s cry for God to vindicate him (<a href="?bref=Job.19.25">Jb 19:25</a>). In the highest sense, God is the kinsman and <span class="hebrew">go’el</span> of Israel, redeeming them from the bondage of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.5-7">Ex 6:5-7</a>), from captivity in Babylon, and from distress in general (<span class="hebrew">go’el</span> occurs 13 times in <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-46.13">Is 40–46</a>). Thus Israel is called “the ransomed of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.10">Is 35:10</a>), having been “redeemed without money” (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.3">52:3</a>). In such contexts, however, the cost is indicated in terms of God’s might and power.</p>
<p>The OT uses a third Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">pidyon</span>) from the area of commercial law for ransom or payment. Since God spared the firstborn in Israel at the time of Passover, the first offspring of every womb belonged to God, and the oldest male was redeemed by ransom (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.12-15">Ex 13:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.20">34:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.27.27">Lv 27:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.18.15-17">Nm 18:15-17</a>). Later the entire tribe of Levi was set aside as priestly substitutes for the firstborn. Since there were 273 more firstborn than Levites, a payment of five shekels was paid in ransom for each (<a href="?bref=Num.3.40-46">Nm 3:40-46</a>). This term was also used for the price paid to ransom a slave from slavery (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.15">Dt 15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.18">24:18</a>); a slave concubine could also be ransomed (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.8-11">Ex 21:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.20">Lv 19:20</a>). God motivates these provisions by his own ransoming of Israel as slaves in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.15">Dt 15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.18">24:18</a>). This Hebrew term is also applied to God’s deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.8">Dt 7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.9.26">9:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.5">13:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.23">2 Sm 7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.17.21">1 Chr 17:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.42">Ps 78:42</a>) and from Babylonian captivity (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.10">Is 35:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.11">51:11</a>). Sometimes God ransoms without reference to a specific occasion (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.13">Hos 7:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.21.8">Dt 21:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.1.10">Neh 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.27">Is 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.11">Jer 31:11</a>). God also ransoms from the grave (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">Hos 13:14</a>), from iniquities (<a href="?bref=Ps.130.8">Ps 130:8</a>), and from troubles (<a href="?bref=Ps.25.22">25:22</a>). This deliverance always implies some sort of payment or cost, such as “the mighty power” or “strong hand” of God needed for the redemption.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT there is just one family of words used for ransom. The term basically means “to loose” or “to set free.” It denotes releasing, redeeming, or liberating on payment of the ransom price. The translation “ransom” is restricted to approximately eight instances where there is a clear reference to the payment of some sort of price. The translators of the Septuagint restricted their use of this Greek word to those instances where the three Hebrew terms clearly meant ransom payment.</p>
<p>The most important occurrence in the NT is Jesus’ description of his death “as a ransom for many” (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>). Three features stand out in Jesus’ words: his service is one of ransom; his self-sacrifice is the ransom price; and his ransom is substitutionary in character. “He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.6">1 Tm 2:6</a>). Jesus Christ “gave his life to free us from every kind of sin” (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.14">Ti 2:14</a>). The ransom price was “the precious blood of Christ,” who was an unblemished lamb (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-19">1 Pt 1:18-19</a>), thus linking Christ’s self-sacrifice to the sacrifices of the OT that pointed to him. The blood of goats and calves was not able to save, but an eternal redemption was obtained by Christ’s blood (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.12">Heb 9:12</a>). In heaven the redeemed sing the new song to the Lamb whose blood ransomed them (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.9">Rv 5:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.14.3-4">14:3-4</a>).</p>

  <title>Raphael</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">RAPHAEL</p>
<p class="fl">Major character in the deuterocanonical book of Tobit. When God heard the prayers of Tobit and Sarah, the angel Raphael was sent to their aid (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.3.17">Tb 3:17</a>). This angel, posing as a dependable relative named Azarias (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “Azariah”), accompanied Tobit’s son Tobias on his journey to retrieve a sum of money from Gabael (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.5.1-22">5:1ff</a>.). Traveling with Tobias’s dog, Toby, the two made camp by a river (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.6.1-18">6:1ff</a>.). A fish leapt from the water and tried to swallow Tobias’s foot. At the suggestion of Raphael, Tobias eviscerated the fish and set aside its gall, heart, and liver for future use as remedies. When queried by Tobias, the angel revealed that “the gall is for anointing a person’s eyes when white patches have spread over them” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.6.8">8</a>). This happened to be the very malady that was plaguing Tobias’s father, Tobit (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.2.9-10">2:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>The journey continued, and Raphael became matchmaker to Tobias and Sarah (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.6.9-18">6:9ff</a>.). At Sarah’s home the two were married. In the bride’s chamber, the fish’s heart and liver came in handy for exorcising the demon that had prevented the success of Sarah’s previous seven marriages (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.8.2">8:2</a>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Raphael continued on the errand to recover Tobit’s money from Gabael (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.9.1-6">9:1ff</a>.). He succeeded at this task. Finally, Tobias and his new wife, Sarah, accompanied by the angel Raphael, with the dog Toby faithfully following at their heels, returned at long last to the home of Tobit (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.11.1-18">11:1ff</a>.). There Tobias applied the angel’s fish-gall remedy to his father’s eyes. Tobit’s eyesight was immediately restored. At the urging of Tobit, Tobias offered to reward the disguised Raphael half of the money retrieved from Gabael. At this point the angel made his true identity known to them saying, “I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand in attendance on the Lord,” and adding, “Take note that I ate no food; what you saw was an apparition” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.12.15,19">12:15, 19</a>). Raphael then ascended out of sight.</p>

<p class="fl">Daughter of Bethuel and the wife of the patriarch Isaac. Her name, which means “well fed” or “choice,” appears 31 times in Genesis (primarily in chs <a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-27.46">24–27</a>) and once in <a href="?bref=Rom.9.10">Romans 9:10</a>.</p>
<p>Rebekah’s father was Bethuel, who in turn was the son of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham’s brother (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.20-23">Gn 22:20-23</a>). Abraham was her great-uncle and eventually, of course, her father-in-law. Laban, the father of Leah and Rachel, was her brother. Thus her son Jacob married his two cousins, who were sisters.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-67">Genesis 24</a> is the account of the successful search by Abraham’s servant for a wife for Isaac. He went to Aram-naharaim (northwest Mesopotamia) in obedience to Abraham, who did not want his son to marry a local Canaanite. In answer to the servant’s prayer, Rebekah not only gave a drink to the man but also watered his camels. After a certain amount of hospitality was extended and payment was made, Rebekah willingly went to meet her new husband.</p>
<p>Rebekah bore twins, Esau and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.20-27">25:20-27</a>). She preferred Jacob, the younger, over Esau and was a party to the deception of her husband in securing the right of the firstborn for Jacob. Disguising Jacob to feel, look, and smell like Esau the outdoorsman was her idea. She also prepared Isaac’s favorite dish in order to facilitate the event (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.5-17">27:5-17</a>).</p>
<p>Scripture records little more of her life but does report that she was buried next to her husband in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.31">49:31</a>).</p>

  <title>Reconciliation</title>

<p class="h1">RECONCILIATION</p>
<p class="fl">Restoration of friendly relationships and of peace where there had previously been hostility and alienation. Ordinarily, it also includes the removal of the offense that caused the disruption of peace and harmony. This was especially so in the relation of God with humanity, when Christ removed the enmity existing between God and mankind by his vicarious sacrifice. The Scripture speaks first of Christ’s substitutionary death in effecting reconciliation of God with sinners; of sinners appropriating this free gift by faith; the promised forgiveness and salvation that become the sinners’ possession by grace; and finally reconciliation with God (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.10">Rom 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.16">Eph 2:16</a>).</p>
<p>The term <span class="greek">katalassein</span> (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.10">Rom 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>) signifies first of all the reconciliation of God with the world, expressing God’s initial change of heart toward sinners. The problem is not rightly addressed by questioning whether the unchanging God ever changes his mind; the situation rather is one where an altered relationship now exists between God and sinners by Christ’s interposing sacrifice on behalf of fallen humanity. The point of the reconciliation is that God, for Christ’s sake, now feels toward sinners as though they had never offended him. The reconciliation is complete and perfect, covering mankind both extensively and intensively—that is, all sinners and all sin. The cause of rupture between God and sinners has now been healed, a truth wholly independent of humanity’s mood or attitude. While sinners were still the objects of God’s just wrath, Christ, in full harmony with the gracious will of his heavenly Father, interposed himself for their sakes, for the restoration of harmony.</p>
<p>So basic is this truth that without objective reconciliation there is no thought of salvation, of regeneration, of faith, of Christian life. The initiative in reconciliation, moreover, is all on God’s side; through his Word, the gospel, God reveals to sinners that he is fully reconciled with them because of Christ.</p>
<p>The vicarious atonement or redemption of Christ underlies God’s reconciling activity. Reconciliation took place not by God’s exercise of divine fiat or decree of power but through Christ interposing himself as the people’s substitute for the law’s condemnation. Thus the vicarious atonement is the key to understanding reconciliation as scripturally conceived and taught. Christ “became sin for us”; he assumed the full obligations of the law, perfectly fulfilling it and fully bearing the guilt and punishment. Sins and guilt were laid on him; his righteousness attained under the law was imputed to mankind.</p>
<p>The human predicament, simply and precisely, was the human inability to change or rectify in any way the broken, hostile relationship existing between humanity and God. Christ was the bridge. To carry out his substitutionary mission was the purpose of his incarnation. His sacrificial suffering and death, sealed by his triumphant resurrection, achieved mankind’s redemption (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>). Christ suffered death not as the common lot of all people but as the wages of sin.</p>
<p>His vicarious satisfaction for all sins is the central teaching of the Scripture. Everything literally depends upon the fact that the turning point for humanity came from God, who was working out reconciliation with the world through Christ. This is not simply an imagined or piously conceived idea, something presented as true by deeply concerned and thoughtful people, but a reality that happened (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.6">Is 53:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.12-14">Heb 9:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.19">1 Pt 1:19</a>). It was God’s solution for the grievous, hostile state that existed between a righteous, angry God and sinful, offending people.</p>
<p>The Scripture never loses sight of the sweeping extent of Christ’s work, the atonement for the sins of all people (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>). Christ is the sinners’ shield from and before the just wrath of God. Nor was it merely by God’s accepting it as sufficient that Christ’s atonement availed; it was in fact and in truth the adequate and full payment (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.26-28">Heb 7:26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.6">1 Tm 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>).</p>
<p>The gospel, therefore, is the message that informs the sinner of God’s reconciliation with sinners through Christ and powerfully persuades the sinner to accept this truth in faith, or as the apostle Paul puts it: “For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people’s sins against them. This is the wonderful message he has given us to tell others. We are Christ’s ambassadors, and God is using us to speak to you. We urge you, as though Christ himself were here pleading with you, ‘Be reconciled to God!’ ” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19-20">2 Cor 5:19-20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

The recorder spoke for Hezekiah in his dealings with Rabshekah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.18">2 Kgs 18:18</a>), and during Josiah’s reign, supervised temple repairs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.8">2 Chr 34:8</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">REDEEMER, REDEMPTION</p>
<p class="fl">English words derived from a Latin root meaning “to buy back,” thus meaning the liberation of any possession, object, or person, usually by payment of a ransom. In Greek the root word means “to loose” and so to free. The term is used of freeing from chains, slavery, or prison.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentandNewTestamentWords">Old Testament and New Testament Words</p>
<p class="fl">For a full understanding of the concept of redemption, it is necessary to look at the OT. There are three different words used in Hebrew, depending on the particular situation, that convey the idea of redemption. The meaning of these redemptive terms rests on legal, social, and religious customs that are foreign to modern culture. An understanding of the culture is needed for an understanding of the terminology and its use.</p>
<p>The first term used for redemption has a legal context. The verb <span class="hebrew">padah</span> is used when an animal substitutes for (or redeems) a person or another animal. The noun derived from the root means the ransom or the the price paid. When a living being, person or animal, requires redemption, the substitution must be made, or price paid; otherwise, the creature involved is killed (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.13">Ex 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.20">34:20</a>). However, there is evidence that this rule was not always strictly followed (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.8">Ex 21:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.6.23">Jb 6:23</a>).</p>
<p>The concept of redemption had special significance for the firstborn. The firstborn male, both man and beast, belonged to God. In theory the firstborn was sacrificed to him. This was done in the case of many animals, but the human firstborn and some animals were redeemed (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.13">Ex 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.20">34:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.18.15-16">Nm 18:15-16</a>). In the redemption of the firstborn son, an animal was substituted, although later a sum of money was paid (<a href="?bref=Num.18.16">Nm 18:16</a>).</p>
<p>The second term involved is the Hebrew root <span class="hebrew">ga’al</span><span class="ital">,</span> which is used primarily in relation to family rules and obligations, the laws governing family property rights and duties. For example, should a piece of property be lost by a family member, the next of kin had both the right and the obligation to redeem this property. This right of redemption protected the family inheritance. The noun derived from this root is equivalent to the English root “redemption,” and the person who buys back the property is the <span class="hebrew">go’el</span> or redeemer.</p>
<p>An Israelite who was forced to sell himself into slavery to pay his debts could be redeemed by a near relative or even by himself (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-49">Lv 25:47-49</a>). Land might also be redeemed in the same fashion (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.25-28">25:25-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-9">Jer 32:6-9</a>).</p>
<p>The right of redemption extended also to persons in special circumstances. The obligation of a man to marry his brother’s widow is well known. In the book of Ruth, the right of redemption is extended to a distant relative. In this story, Boaz redeemed not only the property but Ruth as well, and she became his wife (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.13">Ru 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.1-6">4:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>The third term used in Hebrew is the root verb <span class="hebrew">kaphar</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to cover.” From this root come the terms meaning to cover sin, atone, or expiate. The noun derived, <span class="hebrew">kopher</span><span class="ital">,</span> means the price paid to cover sin, when the term is used in the religious sense.</p>
<p>The term is used to mean the payment made for any life that should be forfeited. A good illustration is the price paid by the owner of an ox that had gored a person to death. Under the law, the owner’s life was forfeited, but he could redeem himself by paying the required ransom (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.28-32">Ex 21:28-32</a>).</p>
<p>All three terms are translated by the same Greek verb, <span class="greek">luo</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “to loose.” The noun <span class="greek">lutron</span> (ransom), is used for all three terms on occasion. This indicates that while the Hebrew used different words for different situations, the same essential meaning of redemption was involved in all situations. The concept of redeeming or freeing was of primary concern.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GodasRedeemer">God as Redeemer</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT the object of God’s redemption is generally the people as a whole, or the nation, rather than individuals. The beginning of this concept of national redemption is seen in God’s freeing the people from slavery in Egypt. Though they were in bondage, their God ransomed them (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6">Ex 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.15">Dt 15:15</a>).</p>
<p>As indicated by the terms used for redeeming or ransoming, the payment of a set price or the substitution of another life was involved. When the redemptive concept is applied to God as the subject, he delivers—without the payment of a price—by his might or power: “I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and I will free you from your slavery in Egypt. I will redeem you with mighty power and great acts of judgment” (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6">Ex 6:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.15.15">Dt 15:15</a>). The same thought is carried forward in other times of need and deliverance, such as the time of exile. God is the national deliverer (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.29.22">Is 29:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.10">35:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.1">43:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.22">44:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.31.11">Jer 31:11</a>).</p>
<p>Again there is no suggestion that God paid a price to free his people. God redeems by his own power. “For this is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> says: ‘When I sold you into exile, I received no payment. Now I can redeem you without paying for you’ ” (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.3">Is 52:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). When Cyrus let the people free, it was again without payment of a price (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.13">45:13</a>).</p>
<p>In the Christian community, especially in the early centuries of the church, there arose the idea that a ransom price was needed to pay for sins. In fact, it was often taught that the sinner was, in effect, held captive by Satan. Christ’s death was the ransom price paid by God to Satan to free sinful people. This teaching is not supported by Scripture. The death of Christ is an atonement or expiation made for sin, but this does not mean that his death was a price paid to Satan. God is not pictured anywhere in Scripture as getting into such a commercial transaction with Satan. The redeeming work of the cross must always lie within the realm of divine mystery.</p>

<p class="h2" id="RedemptionandtheMessiah">Redemption and the Messiah</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT redemption is closely linked with the messianic hope. From the time of the exodus on, God is revealed as deliverer. The hope of redemption is very strong during the Captivity. The prophets constantly speak of God as redeemer or deliverer. This hope was to be fulfilled ultimately through God’s anointed one, or Messiah, who would be of the line of David (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-6">Is 9:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-9">11:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>The messianic hope grew stronger during the periods of exile and persecution. In fact, during the long centuries of persecution, this hope of a messianic deliverer was stronger than ever. This period, generally called the intertestamental period, lasted about four centuries and extended from the last of the prophets until the time of John the Baptist and Jesus.</p>
<p>Christians believe that in Jesus the Christ (or Jesus the Messiah) we see the fulfillment of the OT redemptive concept. The redemptive image is very evident in the Gospels. John the Baptist depicted Jesus of Nazareth as the fulfillment of God’s redemptive kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.12">Mt 3:12</a>) and hence, the Messiah of Israel. Jesus, the Son of Man, came to give himself as a ransom for many (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>). The work of the Messiah was vicarious and substitutionary.</p>
<p>The same thought occurs especially in the writings of Paul. Christ is the sin offering to the Father (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>). Redemption is by the giving of his life (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</a>) for a purchased people (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.22-24">1 Cor 7:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14-17">2 Cor 5:14-17</a>). These are all words or expressions used to present the central idea of redemption or atonement. Jesus Christ is the one who in himself fulfilled the redemption concept of Scripture and by his sacrifice provided for the redemption of sinners.</p>
<p>The concept of redemption has deep meaning for God’s people. In the OT it illustrates the truth that God is the Savior of his covenant people. Although Israel fell into sin by denying God’s law, God did not destroy them but restored them to favor upon repentance.</p>
<p>In the prophets, especially, God’s redemptive work was to be completed through the Messiah and his redemptive sacrifice. The followers of Jesus believed that he was the Messiah who would provide redemption for the whole world. Coupled with the idea of redemption is the motivating force of divine love as the basis for restoration (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>). The one who believes will be freed from the bondage of sin and find favor again with his redeeming God.</p>

  <title>Red Sea</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">RED SEA</p>
<p class="fl">Arm of the Indian Ocean, extending to the northwest and lying between the continents of Africa and Asia. It is a long, narrow body of water, some 1,350 miles (2,172.2 kilometers) long and averaging 180 miles (289.6 kilometers) in width. It is flanked on the east by the Arabian Peninsula, while its African shore includes Egypt, the Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. At the northwest, the peninsula of Sinai juts into the sea, with the Gulf of Suez on the west and the Gulf of Aqaba on the east. At the northwestern end of the Gulf of Suez is the city of Suez and the water connection with the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal. At the tip of the Gulf of Aqaba is the Israeli port of Eilat and the sole Jordanian port, Aqaba. The waters of this sea are extremely rich in aquatic life; the fish and other animal life from the Red Sea could provide much of the food needs for this part of the world. There are few cities, few good roads, and little arable land adjoining the Red Sea.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew OT the Red Sea is called the “Sea of Reeds” or “Sea of Rushes,” but English translations ordinarily give “Red Sea,” following the Septuagint. This body of water could be different from what is known today as the Red Sea. In the NT the only references to the Red Sea by that name are in the defense of Stephen before the council (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.36">Acts 7:36</a>) and in the “heroes of faith” chapter (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.29">Heb 11:29</a>).</p>
<p>The crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites at the time of the exodus is one of the most celebrated events of Hebrew history and has been memorialized by the Jewish people to the present time. The place of this crossing is much debated, but wherever it occurred, it is evident that the water was too deep to wade across and the distance too far to swim. And it was deep enough to cover all the Egyptian army and wide enough to drown all of their number. Confronted by the sea and closely pursued by the crack troops and skilled chariotry of the best army in the world at that time, the Israelites were delivered by the direct intervention of the Lord, who used an east wind to make a channel for their passage upon the bed of the sea (see <a href="?bref=Exod.14.10-31">Ex 14:10-31</a>).</p>
<p>When the Lord overwhelmed the Egyptian forces in the sea, the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptian threat was complete. This victory was celebrated by songs (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-21">Ex 15:1-21</a>) and was often recalled in accounts of the Lord’s works in behalf of Israel (see <a href="?bref=Josh.4.23">Jos 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.6-7">24:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.7-9">Pss 106:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.13-15">136:13-15</a>). Even the people of Jericho heard what God did at the Red Sea and fear fell upon them (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.9-10">Jos 2:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>The route taken by Israel paralleled the eastern shore of the Gulf of Suez for some distance. After they left Elim, they camped beside the sea (<a href="?bref=Num.33.9-11">Nm 33:9-11</a>). Then they turned inland to head for Mt Sinai.</p>
<p>From Sinai they headed northeast, paralleling the Gulf of Aqaba as closely as possible and certainly touching the Red Sea at Ezion-geber (<a href="?bref=Num.33.35">Nm 33:35</a>). Following their failure to enter Canaan from Kadesh-barnea and their defeat at Hormah, they turned south to the point at which Mt Seir approaches the Gulf of Aqaba (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.2.8">Dt 2:8</a>).</p>
<p>The southernmost border of the Promised Land is indicated as the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.31">Ex 23:31</a>). Solomon’s kingdom extended to the Gulf of Aqaba, for at Ezion-geber near Eloth he built a fleet of ships that went to Ophir, from which gold and other precious and exotic commodities were brought (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">1 Kgs 9:26-28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.17-18">2 Chr 8:17-18</a>). Later, Jehoshaphat attempted to do the same, but his ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48">1 Kgs 22:48</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.36-37">2 Chr 20:36-37</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">REGENERATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Spiritual rebirth producing a new beginning. It describes the new life of the believer in Christ (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.5">Ti 3:5</a>) and the new order that will begin at Christ’s return (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.28">Mt 19:28</a>). It occurs in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> of the Bible in only these two places. This does not mean, however, that the concept is unimportant. A variety of other words and figures are used frequently by the biblical writers to describe the same inner renewal of the heart.</p>
<p>Secular writers also speak of regeneration. For the Stoic philosophers, it meant a return to a former state of existence. They referred to the yearly cycle of the seasons as a regeneration. For the biblical writers, however, regeneration means a renewal on a higher level. It is a radically new beginning rather than a mere restoration of previous conditions. This renewal involves a mighty change in the person. It is a work of the Holy Spirit, breaking the dominion of sin and implanting proper attitudes and desires. The regenerated person freely and joyously does the will of God. The ultimate goal of regeneration is the creation of a new heaven and earth that will be totally righteous and without sin (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>). The present working of the Holy Spirit in the believer is a foretaste of this future cosmic regeneration (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.13-14">Eph 1:13-14</a>). The new heavens and earth are still future. But God’s renewal of his people, foreseen by the OT prophets, is already a reality (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">Is 65:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.22">66:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rv 21:1</a>).</p>
<p>The believer now possesses a new life from God through the process of spiritual birth. Christians are born of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.12-13">Jn 1:12-13</a>). And it is only through this spiritual birth that one may participate in the kingdom of God and receive his Spirit. Those born into God’s family reflect his righteous character (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.29">1 Jn 2:29</a>). They are freed from habitual sin (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.9">3:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.18">5:18</a>). In <a href="?bref=Jas.1.18">James 1:18</a> this process of birth is attributed to the power of the Word of God.</p>
<p>Extending this metaphor for regeneration, Jesus taught Nicodemus about the absolute necessity of being born again, or born from above, as a prerequisite to entering the kingdom of God. Those who are thus reborn possess a living hope (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1 Pt 1:3</a>). Again, this new birth is brought about through the power of the Word of God (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.23">23</a>).</p>
<p>The initial experience of regeneration is followed by a continuing renewal in the life of the Christian. The newborn are to desire the pure milk of the Word of God in order to grow (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.2">1 Pt 2:2</a>). Paul commands an ongoing transformation by the renewing of the mind (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.23">Eph 4:23</a>). The new person remains in a process of constant renewal (<a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>), and the inner self is renewed daily (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16">2 Cor 4:16</a>).</p>
<p>The present result of the new birth is a new person or new creation for whom old things are replaced by new (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>). It is this new creation, rather than superficial participation in religious practices, that is the goal of the Christian life (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.15">Gal 6:15</a>). It involves laying aside the old nature (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.22">Eph 4:22</a>) and putting on the new nature (v <a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">24</a>). In the final analysis, however, this is never the result of human effort alone. We are God’s workmanship (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.10">2:10</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">When Solomon died (930 <span class="era">BC</span>), his son Rehoboam ascended to the throne. Perhaps as a concession to the Ephraimites, who often seemed to have been piqued at their inferior status, Rehoboam agreed to hold his coronation in their town of Shechem instead of in Jerusalem, a traditional place of meeting on which “all Israel” could agree (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1">1 Kgs 12:1</a>).</p>
<p>At the conclave, leaders of the northern tribes, accompanied by Jeroboam, approached the new king for concessions. Jeroboam—an official under Solomon’s administration who had fled to Egypt when Solomon suspected him of treason—had returned to Israel to assume a position of leadership. Jeroboam was destined to be the ruler of Israel because of Solomon’s apostasy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-43">1 Kgs 11</a>). Solomon’s numerous building projects and his ostentation seem to have bankrupted the kingdom, resulting in an intolerable tax burden. Especially objectionable was forced labor on various projects (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.4">1 Kgs 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.10.4">2 Chr 10:4</a>). The populace sought relief from high taxes.</p>
<p>The new king asked for a three-day grace period in which to study the request. Advisers from Solomon’s administration counseled concessions; the younger men urged no moderation but an even greater tax burden. Following the advice of his peers, Rehoboam arrogantly threatened even higher taxes. The restless northern tribes broke away to establish a separate kingdom under the leadership of Jeroboam. Judah and Benjamin were the only tribes loyal to Rehoboam.</p>
<p>The separate existence of the northern kingdom was not a new development. After Saul’s death, the north had gone its own way while David ruled in Hebron. Some 30 years later, it had briefly supported Sheba in a revolt against David. Now under the leadership of Jeroboam, the rupture was to become permanent.</p>
<p>Not accepting the apparent success of the secession, Rehoboam sent his tribute master or treasurer, Adoram (Adoniram), to try to heal the division. North Israelite partisans stoned him to death, and Rehoboam and his party fled to Jerusalem. Rehoboam immediately tried to subjugate the rebellious tribes. Raising a force of 180,000 men from Judah and Benjamin, he prepared to march north, but the prophet Shemaiah brought word from God to abandon the project since the breakup of the kingdom was part of the judgment of God on Israel for the sinfulness of the nation during Solomon’s reign. Rehoboam promptly abandoned his military efforts, but intermittent military skirmishes plagued the relations of Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their reigns.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ReignofRehoboam">Reign of Rehoboam</p>
<p class="fl">In the face of constant threat of attack, Rehoboam set about to fortify his kingdom. He built extensive fortifications with adequate supplies of weapons and food at Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Maresha, Ziph, Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron.</p>
<p>Military preparedness was supplemented by spiritual underpinning. As a result of the establishment of a new apostate religion in the northern kingdom, priests and Levites streamed to the south, where they greatly strengthened the spiritual fiber of the realm. Apparently, they helped to maintain the stability of Judah for three years.</p>
<p>However, the people built high places and pagan sanctuaries throughout the land. They began to engage in the corrupt religious practices of the heathen nations around them, including homosexuality (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.22-24">1 Kgs 14:22-24</a>).</p>
<p>Soon Rehoboam forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel followed him (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.1">2 Chr 12:1</a>). Rehoboam was the son of Solomon, a preoccupied father who himself grew increasingly lax about spiritual things. Rehoboam’s mother was Naamah, a pagan Ammonite princess who presumably lacked any spiritual perception (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.21">1 Kgs 14:21</a>). His father’s example of keeping a harem and having numerous children likewise had an impact on him. Rehoboam had 18 wives, 60 concubines, 28 sons, and 60 daughters. He spent a considerable amount of time providing living arrangements for them in the fortified cities of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.21-23">2 Chr 11:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>At length, the apostasy of Judah became so great that God brought judgment on the nation in the form of a foreign invasion. In the fifth year of Rehoboam (c. 926 <span class="era">BC</span>), Shishak I (Sheshonk I) of Egypt invaded Palestine with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 men (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">1 Kgs 14:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.2-3">2 Chr 12:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>After Shishak’s initial successes, the prophet Shemaiah made it clear to the king and the nobility that the invasion was direct punishment for their sinful ways. When they repented of their waywardness, God promised to moderate their punishment. They were subjected to either heavy tribute or a plundering of their cities. The national treasury and the temple treasury were emptied to satisfy the demands of the Egyptians.</p>
<p>Shishak’s invasion continued into the northern kingdom, for his inscription in the temple of Karnak at Luxor tells of his conquest of 156 towns in the two kingdoms. Only a fraction of the names listed can be identified.</p>
<p>Rehoboam’s repentance was only temporary. Scripture indicates that his latter years were characterized by evil (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.14">2 Chr 12:14</a>), and that his son and successor, Abijam, “walked in all the sins which his father did before him” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3">1 Kgs 15:3</a>). Probably the sins of his father would not have been condemned if Rehoboam’s last 12 years had been a good example to his maturing son.</p>
<p>Rehoboam was 41 when he ascended the throne, and he reigned for 17 years.</p>

  <title>Remission of Sins*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">REMISSION OF SINS*</p>
<p class="fl">KJV phrase synonymous with “forgiveness of sins.” The NT uses a variety of terms to describe a single truth. With the concept of forgiveness of sins, there are a number of expressions employed (“passing over,” <a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>; “covered,” <a href="?bref=Rom.4.7">Rom 4:7</a>; “not imputed,” <a href="?bref=Rom.4.8">Rom 4:8</a>; “remembered no more,” <a href="?bref=Heb.10.17">Heb 10:17</a>). One of the most significant is the word rendered “remission” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.4">Mk 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.77">Lk 1:77</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.3">3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.47">24:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.43">10:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.22">Heb 9:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.18">10:18</a>).</p>
<p>The word has an interesting tradition in the Greek language. In the legal sense, it was used to denote dismissal from office, release from obligation, remittance of debt or punishment. In time it also referred to amnesty or exemption from taxation. In NT usage the verb means “to let go,” “to leave behind,” or “to send away.” Hence, the noun can be (and frequently is) translated “forgiveness” as well as “remission” (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.31">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.38">13:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.18">26:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.14">Col 1:14</a>). While forgiveness can be exercised at both the human and divine levels, the forgiveness indicated by the word “remission” is almost always that of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.43">Acts 10:43</a>).</p>

  <title>Remnant</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">REMNANT</p>
<p class="fl">Group of people who survive a catastrophe brought about by God, ordinarily in judgment for sin. This group becomes the nucleus for the continuation of mankind or the people of God; the future existence of the larger group depends on this purified, holy remnant that has undergone and survived the judgment of God. The remnant concept is found in all periods of redemptive history where catastrophe—be it natural disaster, disease, warfare, or other instruments—threatens the continuity of God’s purposes. From the Creation account to the end of the OT, the concept is progressively sharpened.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheProblem">The Problem</p>
<p class="fl">The theological problem that the remnant concept addresses is the tension between the grace and promises of God over against his holiness and just judgment of sin. This tension between God’s grace and his judgment presents a distinction between the true and false people of God and between the present and future people of God. The holy, pure, and true people of God will survive his judgment on sin as a faithful remnant and will become the nucleus of a renewed, chosen people. The purposes of God are not frustrated but are effected among that true and renewed people.</p>
<p>The concept is one that cuts in two directions. On the one hand, depending on the imminent expectation of the biblical author, it may emphasize judgment, that God is on the verge of destroying his people because of their sin; the remnant itself may even be threatened because the contemplated judgment is so severe. On the other hand, the fact that a remnant survives emphasizes both the grace of God (his favor shown to those he has kept safe) and the dawning of a new age and a new community, which inherits the promises of God as it springs from that remnant.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="h3">Prior to the Patriarchal Period</p>
<p class="fl">The first passage exhibiting the remnant concept is the account of the fall of man. Though there is no immediate loss of life or numerical reduction, the judgment of God threatens the continued existence of mankind (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15-19">Gn 3:15-19</a>). Judgment is averted by God’s grace, and Adam and Eve become the nucleus of humanity; the hopes of the future are focused in their offspring (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.16,20">3:16, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.4.1">4:1</a>). God’s purposes for mankind will be realized through the seed of the woman.</p>
<p>The Flood narrative is more specific. Because of the wickedness of mankind, God determined to blot out all life. However, a righteous man who was blameless before God, together with his family, received God’s favor (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.8-9">Gn 6:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">Heb 11:7</a>). Only Noah and those with him in the ark survived the judgment of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.23">Gn 7:23</a>). The continued existence of mankind focuses in the fruitfulness and increase of his sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.1">9:1</a>), introducing a new age and a new covenant (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.9.8-17">8-17</a>). God’s purposes for mankind will be realized in the seed of Noah.</p>
<p class="h3">From the Patriarchal Period to the Monarchy</p>
<p class="fl">Not all passages contributing to the development of the remnant motif involve the threat of universal judgment. The sins of the twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were so grievous that God determined to destroy them. For the sake of his servant Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.16-19">Gn 18:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.19.29">19:29</a>) and because of Lot’s righteousness (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.8">2 Pt 2:8</a>), God spared Lot and his two daughters. Abraham’s negotiations with God to spare the entire city if 50, and finally even 10, righteous persons could be found there (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.22-33">Gn 18:22-33</a>) emphasize again that the righteous escape judgment. God will not sweep away the righteous with the wicked; even when they hesitated, he was merciful and led them out of the city (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.16,29">19:16, 29</a>).</p>
<p>The story of Joseph is the literary bridge from the children of Jacob, a family in Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.26-27">Gn 46:26-27</a>), to the thousands of children of Israel at the time of the exodus. The dominant theological motif in the story is the preservation of the patriarch’s family in the face of mortal threat from famine. God sent Joseph into Egypt to save lives and to preserve for his family a remnant (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.6-7">45:6-7</a>). Joseph’s brothers intended harm, but God turned it to good—to the saving of many lives (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.19-20">50:19-20</a>). Once again the purposes of God are not thwarted but will be realized in these survivors from the threat of extinction.</p>
<p>Obedience to the commands of God and trust in his promises are at issue when the spies return from reconnoitering Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.1-14.45">Nm 13–14</a>). Representatives from all the tribes had explored the land. In spite of their agreement about its excellence, all but two of the spies reported that the land could not be taken. Because of their grumbling, God announced his intention to destroy them all and to recreate a greater nation from his faithful servant Moses. After Moses interceded on behalf of the people, the Lord relented. Instead of destruction for all, only Joshua and Caleb would enter the promised inheritance because of their faithful report. The people would remain in the wilderness 40 years until all died except these two. The transgressors would die, but the faithful remnant would receive the promise.</p>
<p>The law, too, stipulates that faithfulness is required to retain possession of the land. Disobedience would bring disease, defeat in war, drought, crop failure, attack by wild animals, death by sword and famine, cannibalism, destruction of cities, and exile into enemy lands (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-39">Lv 26:1-39</a>). But for those who were left, those who confessed their sins and repented—the remnant—God would keep his covenant with them, restore them to their land, and realize his purpose through them.</p>
<p class="h3">From the Monarchy to the Exile</p>
<p class="fl">Even in the apostate northern kingdom the Lord kept his faithful remnant. At the end of a three-year drought in punishment for sins in the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kgs 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1">18:1</a>) and after the victory over the priests of Baal at Mt Carmel, Elijah went to Mt Sinai, fleeing for his life from Jezebel (ch <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-21">19</a>). There he lamented that Israel had given itself totally to false worship and that he alone was left of the faithful. God replied by instructing him to anoint Jehu as king and Elisha as his prophetic successor. Jehu and Elisha would destroy the apostate, while God preserved for himself the 7,000 who had not bowed the knee to Baal. The faithful remnant would be spared destruction.</p>
<p>The preexilic prophets emphasized the smallness of the remnant that would survive the destruction under Assyria and Babylon. Amos warned of great judgment that would threaten even the remnant itself. God would destroy the sinful kingdom, though not totally. Isaiah, too, speaks of the smallness of the remnant. Israel is left like a shelter in a vineyard, a hut in a melon field only narrowly avoiding the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.8-9">Is 1:8-9</a>). It is left like a pole on a hilltop (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.17">30:17</a>), like the stump of a felled tree (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.13">6:13</a>). When the reaper gathers his harvest, Israel is the gleanings that are left, the few olives that remain in the top of the tree (<a href="?bref=Isa.17.4-6">17:4-6</a>). But from the stump of that felled tree will spring new life (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.11-13">6:11-13</a>). Those who survive in Jerusalem will be holy, and the Lord will bring a new shoot from the stump of Jesse, a righteous servant (the Branch) who will bring the remnant of the people of God from many nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.2-3">4:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-16">11:1-16</a>). After God has purged away the iniquity of the people, Jerusalem would be known as the city of righteousness (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.21-26">1:21-26</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">During the Exile</p>
<p class="fl">From his vantage point among the exiles by the Kebar River (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.1">Ez 1:1</a>), Ezekiel was concerned about the future remnant and the promises of restoration. In a vision (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.9.1-11">9</a>), he saw a scribe pass through the city of Jerusalem placing a mark on the foreheads of all who grieved for the sins committed in the city. Behind the scribe came a group of warriors slaying all who did not have the mark on their foreheads. Fearing the destruction of all the people, Ezekiel called out, “O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, will you destroy the entire remnant of Israel?” Immediately thereafter, he saw the glory cloud—the visible presence of God in the midst of his people—rise and depart from the temple (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">10</a>). Ezekiel prophesied judgment on the leaders of Israel, and Pelatiah (whose name means “escape”) died, prompting Ezekiel to ask again, “O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, will you destroy the entire remnant of Israel?” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.13">11:13</a>). The Lord will gather his people and restore them to their land as a pure people free of idolatry. Though their sins were great, there would yet be mercy and restoration for a purified nation. The glory cloud that Ezekiel saw departing from the temple will return to a new temple (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-27">43</a>). The people will no longer stray from God (<a href="?bref=Ezek.14.11">14:11</a>) but will enjoy a new and everlasting covenant (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.60-62">16:60-62</a>). Ezekiel recalled the remnant motif as it applied to the wilderness community after the exodus: many will leave the land of bondage, and the rebellious will die along the way, not entering Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.20.35-38">20:35-38</a>). God will gather his flock, and they will have “one shepherd, my servant David” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.20-24">34:20-24</a>). God will remove their hearts of stone, give them hearts of flesh, and put his Spirit in them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.24-27">36:24-27</a>). Though Israel appears dead and incapable of living again, yet God will speak to these dry bones and bring them to life (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-14">37:1-14</a>).</p>

  <title>Repentance</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">REPENTANCE</p>
<p class="fl">Literally a change of mind, not about individual plans, intentions, or beliefs, but rather a change in one’s attitude about God. Such repentance accompanies saving faith in Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.21">Acts 20:21</a>). It is inconsistent and unintelligible to suppose that anyone could believe in Christ yet not repent. Repentance is such an important aspect of conversion that it is often stressed rather than saving faith, as when Christ said that there is joy in heaven among the angels over one sinner who repents (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.7">Lk 15:7</a>). The apostles described the conversion of the Gentiles to Christ as God granting them “repentance unto life” (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.18">Acts 11:18</a>). Evangelical repentance and faith in Christ are in fact inseparable, though a convert may be aware of one aspect more than another.</p>
<p>Such penitence is not an isolated act but a disposition of the mind, providing a spur for behavior that accords with God’s declared will. Recognition of daily sins and shortcomings provides the occasion for renewed acts of penitence and for fresh exercises of faith in Christ. One of the deepest and most noteworthy expressions of such penitence is David’s account of his adultery with Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Ps 51</a>). Whole churches are, on occasion, called to repent (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.5">Rv 2:5</a>). <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.1-16">Second Corinthians 7</a> contains an interesting and full description of such corporate repentance involving the elements of sorrow for sin and a determined resolve to forsake old sinful ways and to behave properly. While repentance is often accompanied by deep feelings, it is not equivalent to such feelings but is rooted in convictions about the sinner’s own need before a holy God.</p>
<p>Both John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.4">Mk 1:4</a>) and Christ (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>) were preachers of repentance, calling not the righteous but sinners to repent. And in accordance with the Great Commission (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.44-49">Lk 24:44-49</a>), the apostles continued the same kind of preaching—beginning with Peter’s preaching on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>), with noteworthy results. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Confession_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Confession</a>; <a href="?item=Conversion_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Conversion</a>; <a href="?item=Forgiveness_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Forgiveness</a>; <a href="?item=Regeneration_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Regeneration</a>; <a href="?item=Salvation_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Salvation</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Camping place of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, following their exodus from Egypt. <a href="?bref=Exod.17.1">Exodus 17:1</a> lists Rephidim as Israel’s stopping place after the wilderness of Sin. <a href="?bref=Num.33.12-15">Numbers 33:12-15</a>, however, specifies that after the wilderness of Sin, they camped at Dophkah and Alush, then Rephidim, before they journeyed on to the Sinai wilderness.</p>
<p>Several incidents occurred at Rephidim during the wilderness travels of Israel. Upon arriving at Rephidim, the Israelites learned that there was no water to drink. The thirsty, disgruntled people complained to Moses. In reply, Moses struck a rock in Horeb with his staff (according to the Lord’s instruction) and water flowed out to satisfy the nation. Moses, however, named Rephidim Massah (meaning testing) and Meribah (meaning quarreling) because of Israel’s doubt of the Lord’s presence and provision (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1-7">Ex 17:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>Rephidim was the site near which the Israelites, led by Joshua, engaged the Amalekites in battle. The Lord promised to grant Israel victory as long as Moses kept his hands in the air. With the assistance of Hur and Aaron, Moses held up his hands for the duration of the day, and the Israelites prevailed over the Amalekites.</p>

  <title>Rest</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">REST</p>
<p class="fl">Freedom from work or activity. The source of the Christian doctrine of rest is the rest of God himself, who, after completing the work of Creation in six days, “rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.2">Gn 2:2</a>). This provides the basis for the Hebrew Sabbath as the weekly seventh day of rest (<span class="hebrew">sabbath</span> is the Hebrew term for rest), which is presented as an ordinance of Creation. The fourth commandment demands the consecration of the Sabbath day to God and the limitation of labor to six days precisely because God made all things in six days and rested the seventh day (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>).</p>
<p>The biblical concept of rest, however, is not just past (Creation) and present (weekly) but also future. This future aspect received symbolic expression in the Israelites’ pilgrimage under the leadership of Moses through the wilderness from the bondage of Egypt to the “rest” of the Promised Land. That rest was attained under Joshua, who led them into the land and settled them there (see <a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-24.33">Jos 23–24</a>).</p>
<p>The 40 years of restless wandering in the wilderness meant that the whole adult generation that set out with Moses perished without entering the Promised Land. This was a judgment they brought upon themselves by their ingratitude and rebelliousness (<a href="?bref=Num.14.26-35">Nm 14:26-35</a>). Centuries later God warned their descendants against the danger of following this example of hard-heartedness and reaping a similar consequence of not entering his rest: “Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts” (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.7-11">Ps 95:7-11</a>). The author of Hebrews cites this passage (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-8">Heb 3:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.7">4:7</a>) as evidence that God’s rest is not a matter of past history but that “the promise of entering his rest remains.” The word “today” indicates that the day of grace is not closed: “For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later of another day. So then, there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.8-9">4:8-9</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>It is <span class="ital">God’s</span> rest into which all persons are encouraged to enter. The weekly day of rest is a reminder and a reflection of that rest. The rest of the Israelites in the Promised Land after their wilderness wanderings is a symbol of God’s eternal rest that his people will share. The rest that Christ gives to those who come to him (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.28">Mt 11:28</a>) is a foretaste and a guarantee of the divine rest that awaits them. The rest after death of believers who have fallen asleep in Christ is a blissful intensification of the reality of this experience: “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. . . . They may rest from their labors” (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.13">Rv 14:13</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). But the completion of this rest in its inexpressible fullness will take place at the return of Christ, when at last all who are his will be fully conformed to his likeness (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.2">1 Jn 3:2</a>). Salvation will be consummated as they are clothed with imperishable, glorified bodies (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-21">2 Cor 5</a>), and the renewed order of creation in which righteousness dwells will be established (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>).</p>
<p>This will be the climactic point of all history and the moment of the entry of God’s people into the full and unending enjoyment of his rest. The completion of the redemption purchased by Christ at the cross will mean rest and freedom from all sin, and this in turn will mean rest and freedom from all sorrow, pain, suffering, persecution, frustration, injustice, and death (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.9-17">Rv 7:9-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-7">21:1-7</a>). The rest of mankind, moreover, will involve the rest of God’s whole creation as it is brought to the perfection of that glorious destiny for which it was intended from the very beginning (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-25">Rom 8:19-25</a>).</p>
<p>Rest is not synonymous with inactivity. What God rested from was the work of Creation. He continues constantly to be active, however, in providentially sustaining all that he has created and in the work both of righteous judgment and gracious salvation. Jesus Christ, indeed, in his incarnation, life, death, rising, and glorification, is precisely God in action (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>). Hence the assertion of Jesus: “My Father is working still, and I am working” (<a href="?bref=John.5.17">Jn 5:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). What the Christian will rest from is the struggle against the forces of evil and the afflictions by which this present life is marred. The rest into which the Christian will enter will not be a state of uneventful boredom. God himself is dynamic, not static, and so also is his rest.</p>
<p>Consequently, all that a Christian rests from simply sets him free to be active ceaselessly and joyfully in the service of God, the Creator and Redeemer. In perfect harmony with all God’s works, and in complete fulfillment, Christians exultantly praise and serve the triune God. Joy will be full, without possibility of improvement or deficiency (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.4.8-11">Rv 4:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.8-14">5:8-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.9-12">7:9-12</a>). Such will be the rest without end of that eternal Sabbath that has a morning but no evening: “Let us therefore strive to enter that rest” (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.11">Heb 4:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p class="fl">Act of being raised from the dead, used in the Bible in three different contexts: (1) It refers to miraculous raising of the dead back to earthly life, such as when Elijah raised a boy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.8-24">1 Kgs 17:8-24</a>), Elisha raised the Shunammite’s son (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.18-37">2 Kgs 4:18-37</a>), Jesus raised both Jairus’s daughter (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.35-43">Mk 5:35-43</a>) and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=John.11.17-44">Jn 11:17-44</a>), Peter raised Dorcas (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.36-42">Acts 9:36-42</a>), and Paul raised Eutychus (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.9-12">20:9-12</a>). There is no hint that these resuscitations would prevent future death. (2) It refers most frequently to the resurrection of Jesus Christ. (3) It also refers to the eschatological resurrection of mankind at the end of time for punishment or reward (<a href="?bref=John.5.29">Jn 5:29</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.20.5-6">Rv 20:5-6</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="ResurrectionintheOldTestamentandJudaism">Resurrection in the Old Testament and Judaism</p>
<p class="fl">The concept of resurrection to eternal life developed slowly in Israel. Life and death were limited to physical existence in this world. Death meant leaving this world and entering a shadowy existence known as Sheol, the place of the <span class="hebrew">rephaim</span><span class="ital">,</span> or shades (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.9">Is 14:9</a>), a place of hopelessness (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.23">2 Sm 12:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.7.9-10">Jb 7:9-10</a>). The tragedy of Sheol was that a person was cut off from fellowship with God. At that stage of Israel’s thought, there seemed little hope for resurrection (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.4-5">Pss 6:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.88.10-12">88:10-12</a>).</p>
<p>But in the midst of hopelessness concerning a personal future, Israel developed a sense of faithfulness to God. In spite of the fact that the future was not clear, Job cried helplessly, “If a man dies, will he live again?” (<a href="?bref=Job.14.14">Jb 14:14</a>). As Job sought for the seemingly impossible, the difficult passage in <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-26">Job 19:25-26</a> suggests the reality of resurrection by a living redeemer (<span class="hebrew">go’el</span>).</p>
<p>While some would argue that <a href="?bref=Hos.6.1-3">Hosea 6:1-3</a> suggests a resurrection, it is more likely that Israel considered it to be a promise of God’s continuing care, even when it experienced defeat at the hands of its enemies. Whether Paul saw in the third-day statement of Hosea a reference to Jesus is difficult to assess. This passage, along with texts like the dry bones of Ezekiel (ch <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">37</a>), focus primarily on giving Israel hope in spite of defeat. But they may have become part of a developing sense in Israel that after death there should be something more.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Daniel 12:2</a>, however, there is a sure reference to the resurrection of the dead. Indeed, the text announced a twofold resurrection of Jews: some to eternal life and some to eternal contempt. But there was no general resurrection of all people suggested by this text.</p>
<p>In the intertestamental period, views began to solidify. The theologically conservative Sadducees would have nothing to do with the new ideas of resurrection and the afterlife. They continued to argue that there was no mention of resurrection in the writings of Moses, that life pertained to this earthly realm, and that the future hope was experienced through one’s children (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.46.12">Ecclus 46:12</a>). Sheol, the place of the dead, was devoid of relationship with God and was a place of hapless existence. The Sadducean opinion of the resurrection is generally well known to Christians because of the encounter between Jesus and the Sadducees when they sought to ensnare him concerning the wife of seven brothers. Jesus rejected their views of the resurrection, of God, and of the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.18-27">Mk 12:18-27</a>).</p>
<p>The Pharisees, along with the Essenes and those at Qumran, believed in resurrection. A twofold pattern of resurrection was suggested by the famous eschatological passages of 2 Esdras 7 and the Apocalypse of Baruch 50–51. Both texts may be as late as the first century <span class="era">AD</span>. In the Similitudes of 1 Enoch, the righteous Jews could generally expect resurrection, but not the wicked (1 Enoch 1:46, 51, 62). But elsewhere in Enoch there is a hint that some wicked may be raised for judgment (vv 22, 67, 90). The resurrection of the righteous in these texts would generally be linked to a spiritual type of body, yet in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.7.14-42">2 Maccabees 7:14ff</a>., the view seems less developed and more physical. The ascetics at Qumran expected a resurrection in the great Day of the Lord.</p>
<p>While in Judaism there was a growing sense of an eschatological day of resurrection and reckoning, there was no hint anywhere of a resurrection of the Messiah. Such an idea had to await the historical reality of Jesus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheResurrectionofJesusChrist">The Resurrection of Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="fl">The resurrection of Christ is the central point of Christianity. So important was the resurrection for Paul that he hinged both preaching and faith upon its validity. He considered that a Christianity without the resurrection would be empty and meaningless (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-19">1 Cor 15:12-19</a>). Indeed, the resurrection for him was the unveiling of God’s power in Jesus (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>).</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ is the presupposition behind other texts of the NT as well. Rebirth to a living hope is based upon the resurrection (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1 Pt 1:3</a>). It is the foundation for witness and fellowship with God, because the living Lord has been seen and touched (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1-4">1 Jn 1:1-4</a>). It is the bedrock thesis for ministry and apostleship (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.21-25">Acts 1:21-25</a>). The Gospels likewise would hardly have been good news if they did not conclude with Christ’s resurrection. Christ’s resurrection is the prototype for all the believers, who will experience resurrection when Christ returns.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheResurrectionAccounts">The Resurrection Accounts</p>
<p class="fl">While the resurrection of Jesus Christ is the very essence of Christianity, it has been the subject of considerable debate. Scholars have frequently noted the variations that are present in the accounts. How many and who were the women at the tomb? Was there one (Mt; Mk) or were there two (Lk; Jn) angels at the tomb? Did the women come to anoint the body (Mk; Lk) or to see the tomb (Mt)? Did the women say nothing to anyone because of fear (Mk), or did they report to the disciples (Mt)? What was the order of the appearances, and did they take place in Jerusalem (Lk; <a href="?bref=John.20.1-31">Jn 20</a>) or in Galilee (Mt; <a href="?bref=John.21.1-25">Jn 21</a>) or in both places? Can the appearances be harmonized? What kind of body did Jesus possess? These and many other questions have been the watershed for a great deal of contemporary scholarly debate.</p>
<p>Many of these questions were not first discovered by recent scholars. Tatian in the second century sought to remove the questions by composing his <span class="ital">Diatessaron</span> (harmony) in hopes that Christians would accept his work as a variant-free substitute for the Gospels. Although Christians liked the harmony, they continued to faithfully transmit the Gospels, because they believed that in them, by divine inspiration, God had provided a powerful witness concerning his Son. Many today still try the way of harmonization in an effort to deal with the minutia of historical questions, but they usually miss the uniqueness of each testimony. Others emphasize the differences and speculate on the Gospel constructs, but the fact of the resurrection usually becomes lost in the details of these human constructs. Both are attempts at protecting the essence of faith and reason in different ways.</p>
<p class="h3">The Empty Tomb</p>
<p class="fl">Many explanations have been given concerning the empty tomb. Some said the body was stolen by the disciples (already suggested by <a href="?bref=Matt.28.13">Mt 28:13</a>), but then one needs to explain the church on the basis of fraud. Others have said that the Jews could have stolen the body, or the disciples could have mistaken the tomb, but then the body would soon have been produced by the enemies. Others have said that Jesus could have lapsed into a swoon, reviving later in the cold tomb, but then the result would hardly have inspired the power of the Christian church. These explanations are all rationalistic attempts based upon a preconception that an actual resurrection of Jesus could not have happened.</p>
<p>In spite of the material differences, and while the Gospel writers have used a great deal of common material in their tomb stories, they themselves refrain from employing the tomb as a basis for resurrection faith. With the exception of <a href="?bref=John.20.8">John 20:8</a>, the empty tomb engendered surprise and fear. Indeed, it seemed to be an idle tale (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.11">Lk 24:11</a>). It is not the tomb stories but the appearances of Jesus after his resurrection that gave rise to faith.</p>
<p class="h3">The Appearances</p>
<p class="fl">Unlike the tomb stories, there is little commonality of material in the appearances. Yet the appearances are the basis for faith that the unbelievable happened. An enemy like Paul was converted into a zealous apostle (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-22">Acts 9:1-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8">1 Cor 15:8</a>). A fearful fisherman like Peter abandoned his nets (<a href="?bref=John.21.1-25">Jn 21</a>). A doubter like Thomas uttered early Christianity’s greatest confession, calling Jesus “my Lord and my God” (<a href="?bref=John.20.24-28">20:24-28</a>). And two weary travelers to Emmaus found new zeal to return quickly to Jerusalem and share the news about their encounter with the risen Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.13-35">Lk 24:13-35</a>).</p>
<p>Scholars have debated the nature of these appearances. Starting from Paul’s list of appearances (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.5-8">1 Cor 15:5-8</a>), some have argued that all appearances are of the same nature, and since the Damascus-road appearance to Paul recorded in Acts seems to have been of a spiritual nature (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-9">Acts 9:1-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-11">22:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.12-19">26:12-19</a>), then all the appearances must have been similar. Statements that the risen Jesus was touchable (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.41-43">Lk 24:41-43</a>) are rejected as later accretions to an earlier vision-type tradition. This type of argument is based on presuppositions of the impossibility of a bodily resurrection.</p>
<p>Another theory was based on the division between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith. According to this view, the resurrection was not to be regarded as a fact of history but as an experience of the faith of the disciples. The issue, however, is that the eyewitnesses of Jesus’ resurrection proclaimed the event as a historical, palpable reality.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSignificanceofChristsResurrection">The Significance of Christ’s Resurrection</p>
<p class="fl">Several people were raised from the dead, as recorded in the Bible. A widow’s son was raised by Elijah, another widow’s son was raised by Jesus, and Lazarus was raised by Jesus. However, their revitalization (or resuscitation) is not the same as Christ’s resurrection. They arose only to die again; he arose to live forevermore. They arose still doomed by corruptibility; he arose incorruptible. They arose with no change to their constitution; he arose in a significantly different form.</p>
<p>When the Lord arose, three significant things happened to him. He was glorified, he was transfigured, and he became spirit. All three happened simultaneously. When he was resurrected, he was glorified (see <a href="?bref=Luke.24.26">Lk 24:26</a>). At the same time, his body was transfigured into a glorious one (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Phil 3:21</a>). Equally so—and quite mysteriously—he became life-giving spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Cor 15:45</a>).</p>
<p>Prior to the Lord’s crucifixion and resurrection, he declared, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I say unto you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth many grains” (<a href="?bref=John.12.23-24">Jn 12:23-24</a>; literal). This declaration provides the best picture of resurrection. Paul also used this illustration. He likened the resurrection glory to a grain being sown in death and then coming forth in life. Actually, Paul used this illustration when answering two questions the Corinthians posed about resurrection: (1) How are the dead raised? and (2) With what sort of body do they come? (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35">1 Cor 15:35</a>).</p>
<p>To the first question Paul responded, “Foolish man, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.36">1 Cor 15:36</a>). This follows perfectly the Lord’s saying in <a href="?bref=John.12.24">John 12:24</a>, and the two explain each other. The grain must die before it can be quickened. Paul devotes more explanation to the second question; and the Spirit inspired his sublime utterance to unfold this mystery. Using the same natural example of the grain of wheat, Paul revealed that the body that comes forth in resurrection is altogether different in form from that which had been sown. Through an organic process, the single bare grain is transformed into a stalk of wheat. In essence, the grain and the stalk are one and the same—the latter simply being the living growth and expressed expansion of the former. In short, the stalk is the glory of the grain, or the glorified grain. This illustration shows that Jesus’ resurrected body was altogether different from the one that was buried. In death, he had been sown in corruption, dishonor, and weakness; in resurrection, he came forth in incorruption, glory, and power. The natural body that Jesus possessed as a man became a spiritual body, and at the same time Christ became “life-giving spirit.”</p>
<p>With this new spiritual existence, Christ, as spirit and through the Holy Spirit, could indwell millions of believers simultaneously. Before the resurrection, Jesus was limited by his mortal body; after his resurrection, Jesus could be experienced illimitably by all his believers. Before his resurrection, Christ could dwell only among his believers; after his resurrection, he could dwell in his believers. Because Christ became spirit through resurrection, he can be experienced by those he indwells. The Spirit of Christ now makes Christ very real and experiential to us.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus entered into a new kind of existence when he was raised from the dead because he was glorified and simultaneously became spirit—or, to coin a term, he was “pneumafied” (from the Greek word for “spirit,” <span class="greek">pneuma</span>). It appears that when he arose the indwelling Spirit penetrated and saturated his body so as to constitute his entire being with spirit. Recent studies in the area of pneumatology (the study of the Spirit) point out that the risen Christ and the Spirit were united via Christ’s resurrection.</p>
<p>William Milligan, the author of the best English classic on the subject of the resurrection, said that the risen Christ is spirit. In that classic, called <span class="ital">The Resurrection of Our Lord</span>, he wrote the following:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">The condition of our Lord after His Resurrection was viewed by the sacred writers as essentially a state of <span class="greek">pneuma</span> (spirit). Not indeed that our Lord had then no body, for it is the constant lesson of Scripture that a body was possessed by him; but that the deepest, the fundamental characteristic of His state, interpenetrating even the body, and moulding it into a complete adaptation to and harmony with His spirit, was <span class="greek">pneuma</span><span class="ital">.</span> In other words, it is proposed to inquire whether the word <span class="greek">pneuma</span> in the New Testament is not used as a short description of what our Lord was after His Resurrection, in contrast with what He was during the days of His humiliation upon earth.</p>
<p class="sp">Milligan went on from there to show that several Scriptures affirm that the resurrected Christ is spirit. He cited <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.17">1 Corinthians 6:17</a> to show that the believer who is joined with the risen Lord must be joined to him as spirit, because he who is joined to the Lord is said to be “one spirit” with him. He used <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17-18">2 Corinthians 3:17-18</a> to demonstrate that the Lord who is the Spirit is none other than the risen Christ. He also employed <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.1.3-4">Romans 1:3-4</a>, and <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14">Hebrews 9:14</a> to prove that the risen Lord is spirit.</p>
<p>When we read the last chapters of the Gospels, we realize that a great change had transpired in our Lord after the resurrection. By entering into glory, he had entered into a new sphere of existence. At one moment he was visible; in another he became invisible (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.31">Lk 24:31</a>). He was defying the limitations of space and perhaps even time. In the early morning of the day of resurrection, he appeared to Mary Magdalene in the garden (<a href="?bref=John.20.11-17">Jn 20:11-17</a>), then to some of the other women (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.9">Mt 28:9</a>). After this, he ascended to his Father (<a href="?bref=John.20.17">Jn 20:17</a>). Then he returned to appear to Peter, who had gone home (<a href="?bref=John.20.10">Jn 20:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.34">Lk 24:34</a>). On the same day, in the late afternoon, he took a seven-mile (11.3-kilometer) walk with two disciples on their way to Emmaus (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.13-33">Lk 24:13-33</a>), following which he appeared to the disciples as they were assembled in a closed room somewhere in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.33-48">Lk 24:33-48</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.19-23">Jn 20:19-23</a>). It is nearly impossible to follow a sequential, chronological order of all these happenings. What Jesus did was humanly impossible. How could he make all of these appearances on the same day? All we can say is that resurrection greatly changed his sphere of existence. As spirit, and yet with a body—a glorified one—he was no longer limited by time and space.</p>
<p> Through resurrection, Jesus had acquired a different form (see <a href="?bref=Mark.16.12">Mk 16:12</a>). As to his person, he was still the same; the Jesus who walked in Galilee and was crucified at Calvary is the same Jesus who arose. His person had not changed, nor will it ever; it is immutable. But his form did change; he is now life-giving spirit. As such, Christ is able to indwell all of his believers.</p>
<p>Resurrection and regeneration are closely linked in the Scriptures—in the same way that crucifixion and redemption form an inseparable unity. As redemption was not possible without Christ’s crucifixion, so regeneration is not possible without Christ’s resurrection. The Scripture plainly says that we have been born again through the resurrection of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.23">1 Pt 1:23</a>).</p>
<p>After Christ was raised from the dead, he called the disciples his brothers (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.10">Mt 28:10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.19">Jn 20:19</a>), and he declared that his God was now their God, and his Father their Father. Through resurrection, the disciples had become the brothers of Jesus, possessing the same divine life and the same Father. As the firstborn from among the dead (<a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.18">Rv 1:18</a>), Jesus Christ became the firstborn among many brothers (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ResurrectioninGeneral">Resurrection in General</p>
<p class="fl">Paul looked for the Day of the Lord when the dead in Christ would be raised and those who were still alive would join the dead in final victory (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.15-18">1 Thes 4:15-18</a>). There was no doubt in his mind that this resurrection was a glorious expectation, that it involved some type of a personalized body, and that this body would not be physical but spiritual (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-44">1 Cor 15:35-44</a>). Paul did not speak of two resurrections, as do the Johannine texts (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.5.29">Jn 5:29</a>), but merely of the resurrection to life. Perhaps the Revelation of John provides the best clue in understanding NT thought on this issue because it refers to the blessing of being part of the first resurrection (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.5-6">Rv 20:5-6</a>). Although in Revelation the term “resurrection” is not used in connection with judgment, the appearance at the judgment seat and the verdict of the second death in the lake of fire indicate that a resurrection to judgment will hardly be of the same essence as resurrection to life.</p>

<p class="h2" id="ResurrectionandGnosticism">Resurrection and Gnosticism</p>
<p class="fl">Gnostic eschatology is indebted to the Greek view of immortality and involves the shedding of the bodily husk in the spiritual ascent of the devotee to the Pleroma, or Gnostic heaven. Because of the way Gnostics used words, the Gospel of Philip is a helpful window for understanding the Gnostic twisting of ideas. There it is argued that “those who say that the Lord died first and [then] arose are in error; because he first arose and [then] died. If anyone does not attain the resurrection first, will he not die?” (Philip 56:15-19). The concept of resurrection is de-eschatologized and defined not in terms of a truly future expectation of resurrection but in terms of a realized spiritual awakening in this world. The Gospel of Philip is also useful in perceiving why in <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.17-19">2 Timothy 2:17-19</a> the criticism was so severe against Hymenaeus and Philetus for holding that the resurrection was past. Clearly, realized eschatology was rejected in the Pauline community and by the church when it appeared in Gnosticism. And it should continue to be rejected by the church in the present day.</p>

The area was bordered on the south by the Arnon River, on the north and east by the wadi of Heshbon and the Ammonite kingdom, and on the west by the Jordan and Dead Sea.

<p class="h1">REUBEN, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Tribe descended from Reuben, the eldest of Jacob’s sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.32">Gn 29:32</a>). The tribe of Reuben usually receives the place of honor in lists of the tribes, being named first (<a href="?bref=Num.13.4">Nm 13:4</a>). Similarly, in lists of the two and a half tribes residing east of the Jordan, Reuben is always mentioned first (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.12">Jos 1:12</a>), though Gad seems to have held a larger portion.</p>
<p>Because of Reuben’s sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.22">Gn 35:22</a>), his father prophesied that his preeminence among his brothers would disappear (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.4">49:4</a>). In spite of the prayer of <a href="?bref=Deut.33.6">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>, this disaster did overtake the tribe in later years. In desert days, Reuben’s tribal chief appears with all the others (<a href="?bref=Num.1.5">Nm 1:5</a>), and a spy goes forth from Reuben as with the other tribes (<a href="?bref=Num.13.4">13:4</a>). Reuben has his special place in camping and marching (<a href="?bref=Num.2.10">2:10</a>). Only the spies of Ephraim (Joshua) and Judah (Caleb) are faithful (<a href="?bref=Num.14.6">14:6</a>), but Reuben appears no worse than his brother tribes: all were equal in unbelief.</p>
<p>The revolt of Dathan and Abiram, men of Reuben, against the authority of Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.16.1">Nm 16:1</a>) and possibly against the special position of Levi may be significant. Reuben may be claiming his old primacy, forfeited by sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.3-4">Gn 49:3-4</a>). The attempt failed, and God’s judgment was a signal lesson (<a href="?bref=Num.16.33">Nm 16:33</a>).</p>
<p>Reuben was rich in herds of cattle (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1">Nm 32:1</a>) and presumably a powerful tribe. Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh asked to remain in the richly timbered and well-watered lands to the east of Jordan, recently conquered from Sihon, the Amorite king, and Og, the ruler of Bashan. This selfish request (for it would involve no sharing in the hard fighting across the Jordan) was rightly denounced by Moses. However, on the promise of the two and a half tribes to bear the brunt of the fighting for their brothers in the west, their request was granted (vv <a href="?bref=Num.32.20-22">20-22</a>). They were evidently good soldiers, and Joshua sent them home at the end of the campaign (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.1-6">Jos 22:1-6</a>). Although living east of the Jordan, and separated from their brothers by what was sometimes an insuperable natural obstacle, they had no desire to form an independent state. They showed this by building a great memorial altar at the spot where they crossed the Jordan on their way home (v <a href="?bref=Josh.22.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>Reuben does not appear again until the time of Deborah the prophetess. When the clans of Israel rallied to God’s call under Barak to fight Sisera the Canaanite, Reuben did not respond. The wording suggests that Reuben once again was influenced by material possessions, as the tribe had been in the days of the Conquest, when, because of their cattle, they chose the lush lands of Transjordan rather than the rugged hills of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.32.5">Nm 32:5</a>). The easy shepherd’s life appealed more to them than warfare on the slopes of Mt Tabor (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.16">Jgs 5:16</a>). Also the wording suggests long inconclusive discussions—or even, perhaps, great protestations of bravery and fidelity to God’s cause—that finally led to nothing (v <a href="?bref=Judg.5.15">15</a>). Reuben has not changed; the tribe, like its ancestor, was still “unstable as water” (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.4">Gn 49:4</a>).</p>
<p>Reuben’s tribal lands, to the southeast of Gad, were probably overrun and occupied by the Moabites at a later date. Certainly the whole area to the east of the Jordan was an area of contention between Israel and Aram later (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.3">1 Kgs 22:3</a>). Finally, Transjordan, with the north of Israel, was one of the first areas overrun and devastated by the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>). Although Ezekiel, in his vision, speaks of a strip of territory north of Judah for Reuben (<a href="?bref=Ezek.48.6">Ez 48:6</a>), it could only have been a small remnant, if any, that returned from the exile of the northern kingdom. Indeed, although Reuben finds his place in the list of the redeemed in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.5">Rv 7:5</a>), no man of Reuben plays a part in the NT.</p>

<p class="h1">REVELATION</p>
<p class="fl">Term from the Latin <span class="ital">revelatio,</span> referring to either (1) the act of revealing for the purpose of making something known or (2) the thing that is revealed. In theology it designates God’s own self-disclosure or manifesting of himself, or things concerning himself and the world; it may also mean the word itself, oral or written, that conveys such revelation. The equivalent NT terms are <span class="greek">apokalupsis</span> (apocalypse), which means unveiling, uncovering, or making someone or something known. The Greek word <span class="greek">phanerosis</span> is virtually synonymous, though usually with the nuance of clear, readily discernible presentation.</p>
<p>Rationalistic philosophy (as promoted by René Descartes, Immanuel Kant, J. G. Fichte, F. W. J. von Schelling, G. W. F. Hegel) finds in human reason the sole source for whatever shape revelation takes or is, acknowledging only natural religion and denying the reality of all supernatural divine revelation. Rationalists may at times admit the possibility of supernatural religion, but they cannot conceive of divine intervention.</p>
<p>Christian theology, on the other hand, is committed to the idea that the principle of knowledge is the Word of God, specifically the Scripture, despite the severe critique of higher criticism against any claim that the Scripture affords a secure, reliable, and independent base for theological truth. Modern critical theology has declared its support for what it calls “scientific theology,” for the “sure” judgments of natural science and the supposed improbability of all supernatural happenings. This has forced the Scripture, as the inspired Word of God, out of its authoritative, normative position. What the Scripture contains is not the account of what actually happened, or what God actually said or did, but merely the early church’s confession of faith as to what first-century followers of Christ supposed or contrived to have happened. The Bible, therefore, is not unique in its divine origin; it is only the unique product of early religious searchings and strivings.</p>
<p>Christian theology, on the other hand, asserts (on the basis of the scriptural text and the confirming mighty acts of God) that divine revelation is the first, last, and only source for theology. People have knowledge of God because of God’s initiative and activity. God is always the initiator and author of revelation; people are the recipients. God discloses what otherwise would be unknown; he uncovers what otherwise would be hidden (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.29">Dt 29:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.12">Gal 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.3">Eph 3:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="GeneralRevelation">General Revelation</p>
<p class="fl">God draws back the veil in a twofold manner. There is first of all what has come to be called “general revelation.” God reveals himself in nature, in history, and in all people as made in his image. The association of God’s revelation with nature, by which people have an intuitive knowledge of God’s existence, is of long standing and is a truth supported throughout Scripture—both in the OT (<a href="?bref=Ps.10.11">Pss 10:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.14.1,19">14:1, 19:1</a>) and in the NT (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.17">Acts 14:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.22-29">17:22-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.19-21">Rom 1:19-21</a>). That there is a God, that God is the Creator with almighty power, that God deals justly as the supreme Judge, or rules as the “wholly other” over his creatures—these things are known and recognized by many people. Thus, the fact that God <span class="ital">is,</span> is undeniable. So, when people deny God’s existence, as do atheists, it is a forced effort against an inner conviction worked by nature itself. Paul could expect concurrence from the Athenians when he asserted that it is in God, the one and only true God, that all people live and move and have their being (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">Acts 17:28</a>). Knowing God through nature, however, is not the end of revelation. Full and complete revelation comes when people encounter the personhood of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SpecialRevelation">Special Revelation</p>
<p class="fl">To know God from his revelation in nature still leaves him and his gracious purposes completely unknown. The gracious, loving heart of God intends the salvation of all people. By special revelation God purposes to share this with mankind in various ways. Mankind would know nothing at all of God’s messianic purposes in Christ, if God had not revealed his heart and purposes throughout Scripture. By inner, immediate illumination of their hearts and minds by God, the prophets and apostles spoke his Word as he gave them utterance (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.4-19">Jer 1:4-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.13">1 Cor 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.13">1 Thes 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-21">2 Pt 1:16-21</a>). The zenith of God’s revelation was the coming in flesh of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=John.1.14-18">Jn 1:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.4-5">Gal 4:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-2">Heb 1:1-2</a>). Jesus’ revelation of the Father and the Father’s gracious will toward all people was direct, accurate, and preeminent (<a href="?bref=John.14.1-31">Jn 14</a>).</p>
<p>God did not merely illuminate the hearts and minds of his prophets and apostles to speak his Word, but in specific instances also inspired them to record in writing the thoughts, words, and promises that he wanted revealed and retained for all time. The sacred collection of writings forms a remarkably harmonious and unified whole by which God reveals his thoughts and purposes toward humanity. For this writing, the prophets and apostles were prompted to recount not only certain historical events and happenings but also what God revealed for special communication. The ultimate purpose of Scripture is to reveal Christ. To him all Scripture gives witness (<a href="?bref=John.5.39">Jn 5:39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.35">10:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.43">Acts 10:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.28">18:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The earliest witnesses ascribe the authorship of Revelation to John the apostle, the son of Zebedee. Dionysius, the distinguished bishop of Alexandria and student of Origen (early third century), was the first within the church to question its apostolic authorship because it seemed to him that the writing style differed greatly from that found in the fourth Gospel, attributed to John. From the time of Dionysius, the apostolic origin of the book was disputed in the East until Athanasius of Alexandria (c. 350) turned the tide toward its acceptance. In the West, the book was widely accepted and was included in all the principal lists of canonical books from at least the middle of the second century on.</p>
<p>From the internal evidence, the following things can be said about the author with some confidence. He calls himself John (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.4,9">Rv 1:4, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.8">22:8</a>). This is most likely not a pseudonym but rather the name of a person well known among the Asian churches. This John identifies himself as a prophet (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.3">1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.6-10,18-19">22:6-10, 18-19</a>) who was in exile because of his prophetic witness (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">1:9</a>). As such, he speaks to the churches with great authority. His use of the OT and Targums makes it virtually certain that he was a Palestinian Jew, steeped in the ritual of the temple and synagogue. John the apostle fits this profile. The difference between the style of the fourth Gospel and that of Revelation can be explained by the radically different genres of the two books. The Gospel is a composed historical narrative, whereas the book of Revelation is a record of visionary experiences and direct divine revelation. The writer of the Gospel could take his time in crafting a narrative word by word and sentence by sentence. The writer of Revelation was compelled by God to write down immediately whatever he was told or was shown. Thus, the apostle John could easily have been the writer of both. In any event, no convincing argument has been advanced against his authorship.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginDestination">Date, Origin, Destination</p>
<p class="fl">Only two dates for Revelation have received serious support. An early date, shortly after the reign of Nero (<span class="era">AD</span> 54–68), is allegedly supported by references in the book to the persecution of Christians, to the <span class="ital">Nero redivivus</span> myth (a revived Nero would be the reincarnation of the evil genius of the whole Roman Empire), to the imperial cult (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13</a>), and to the temple (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.11.1-19">11</a>), which was destroyed in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. The alternate date rests primarily on the early witness of Irenaeus, who stated that the apostle John “saw the revelation . . . at the close of Domitian’s reign” (<span class="era">AD</span> 81–96).</p>
<p>The origin of the book is clearly identified with Patmos, one of the Sporades Islands, located about 37 miles (59.5 kilometers) southwest of Miletus, in the Icarian Sea (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">1:9</a>). John was apparently exiled on the island due to religious and/or government persecutions arising from his witness to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">1:9</a>).</p>
<p>Likewise, the recipients are clearly the seven historic churches in the Roman province of Asia (modern western Turkey): Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.4,11">1:4, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1,8,12,18">2:1, 8, 12, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.1,7,14">3:1, 7, 14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Revelation differs from the other NT writings, not in doctrine but in literary genre and subject matter. It is a book of prophecy (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.3">1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.7,18-19">22:7, 18-19</a>) that contains both warning and consolation—announcements of future judgment and blessing— communicated by means of symbols and visions.</p>
<p>The language and imagery were not as strange to first-century readers as they are today. Therefore, familiarity with the prophetic books of the OT, especially Daniel and Ezekiel, will help the reader grasp the message of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>While the symbolic and visionary mode of presentation creates ambiguity and frustration for many, it actually lends to the description of unseen realities a poignancy and clarity unattainable by any other method. Such language can trigger a variety of ideas, associations, existential involvement, and mystical responses that the straight prose found in most of the NT cannot achieve.</p>
<p>The letters to the churches indicate that five of the seven were in serious trouble. The major problem seemed to be disloyalty to Christ; this may indicate that the major thrust of Revelation is not sociopolitical but theological. John was more concerned with countering the heresy that was creeping into the churches toward the close of the first century than with addressing the political situation. This heresy seems to have been a type of Gnostic teaching.</p>
<p>Revelation is also commonly viewed as belonging to the group of writings known as apocalyptic literature. The name for this type of literature is derived from the Greek word for “revelation”: <span class="greek">apokalupsis</span><span class="ital">.</span> The extrabiblical apocalyptic books were written in the period from 200 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 200. Although numerous similarities exist, there are also some clear differences.</p>
<p>Much more important than the Jewish apocalyptic sources is the debt John owes to the eschatological teaching of Jesus, such as the Olivet discourse (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">Mt 24–25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.1-38">Lk 21</a>). Revelation is unique in its use of the OT. Of the 404 verses of the Apocalypse, 278 contain references to the Jewish Scriptures. John refers frequently to Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, and also repeatedly to Exodus, Deuteronomy, and the Psalms. However, he rarely quotes the OT directly.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MethodsofInterpretingRevelation">Methods of Interpreting Revelation</p>
<p class="fl">Four traditional ways of understanding <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-22.21">Revelation 4–22</a> have emerged in the history of the church:</p>
<p class="h3">Futurist</p>
<p class="fl">This view holds that, with the exception of chapters <a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-3.22">1–3</a>, all the visions in Revelation relate to a period immediately preceding and following the second advent of Christ at the end of the age. The beasts (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.17.1-18">17</a>) are identified with the future Antichrist, who will appear at the last moment in world history and will be defeated by Christ in his second coming to judge the world and to establish his earthly millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>Variations of this view were held by the earliest expositors, such as Justin Martyr (d. 164), Irenaeus (d. c. 195), Hippolytus (d. 236), and Victorinus (d. c. 303). This futurist approach has enjoyed a revival since the 19th century and is widely held among evangelicals today.</p>
<p class="h3">Historicist</p>
<p class="fl">As the word implies, this view sees in Revelation a prophetic survey of history. It originated with Joachim of Floris (d. 1202), a monastic who claimed to have received a special vision that revealed to him God’s plan for the ages. He assigned a day-year value to the 1,260 days of Revelation. In his scheme, the book is a prophecy of the events of Western history from the time of the apostles until Joachim’s own time. In the various schemes that developed as this method was applied to history, one element became common: the Antichrist and Babylon were connected with Rome and the papacy. Later, Luther, Calvin, and other Reformers came to adopt this view.</p>
<p class="h3">Preterist</p>
<p class="fl">According to this view, Revelation deals with the time of its author; the main contents of chapters are thus viewed as describing events wholly limited to John’s own day. The beasts (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13</a>) are identified as imperial Rome and the imperial priesthood. This is the view held by many contemporary scholars.</p>
<p class="h3">Idealist</p>
<p class="fl">This method of interpreting Revelation sees it as being basically poetic, symbolic, and spiritual in nature. Thus Revelation does not predict any specific historical events at all; on the contrary, it sets forth timeless truths concerning the battle between good and evil that continues throughout the church age. As a system of interpretation, it is more recent than the other three schools.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTeaching">Purpose and Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">NT scholar H. B. Swete wrote of Revelation: “In form it is an epistle, containing an apocalyptic prophecy; in spirit and inner purpose, it is a pastoral.” As a prophet, John was called to separate true from false belief—to expose the failures of the congregations in Asia. He desired to encourage authentic Christian discipleship by explaining Christian suffering and martyrdom in light of the victory over evil won by Jesus’ death and resurrection. John was concerned to show that the martyrs (e.g., Antipas, <a href="?bref=Rev.2.13">2:13</a>) will be vindicated. He disclosed the end both of evil and of those who follow the Beast (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.20-21">19:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10,15">20:10, 15</a>), and he described the ultimate victory of the Lamb and of those who follow him.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientGreekManuscriptOfRevelation"/>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The main contents of Revelation are arranged in series of seven items, some explicit, some implied: seven churches (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">2–3</a>), seven seals (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-7.17">6–7</a>), seven trumpets (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.8.1-11.19">8–11</a>), seven bowls (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.16.1-18.24">16–18</a>), seven last things (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-22.21">19–22</a>). It is also possible to divide the contents around four key visions: (1) the vision of the Son of Man among the seven churches (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-3.22">1–3</a>); (2) the vision of the seven-sealed scroll, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-19.10">4:1–19:10</a>); (3) the vision of the return of Christ and the consummation of this age (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-20.15">19:11–20:15</a>); and (4) the vision of the new heaven and new earth (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">21–22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">John’s Introduction (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-8">1:1-8</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first three chapters of Revelation form a unit and are comparatively easy to understand. They are the most familiar and contain an introduction to the whole book (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-8">1:1-8</a>); the first vision, of the Son of Man among the seven lampstands (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9-20">1:9-20</a>); and the letters or messages to the seven churches in Asia (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">2:1–3:22</a>).</p>
<p>The first eight verses introduce the whole book. They are freighted with theological content and detail. After a brief preface (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-3">1:1-3</a>), John addresses the book to the seven churches of Asia in an expanded ancient letter form (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.1.4-8">4-8</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Son of Man among the Lampstands (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9-20">1:9-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After a brief indication of the historical situation that occasioned it (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9-11">1:9-11</a>), John describes his vision of “someone, like a son of man,” walking among seven golden lampstands (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.1.12-16">12-16</a>). The person identifies himself as the exalted Lord, Jesus Christ (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.1.17-18">17-18</a>), and then explains the meaning of the symbolic vision (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.1.19-20">19-20</a>). Finally, the Lord addresses a rather detailed and specific message to each of the seven churches in Asia (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">2:1–3:22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Letters to the Seven Churches (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">2:1–3:22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">These seven churches contained typical or representative qualities of both obedience and disobedience that are a constant reminder to all churches throughout every age (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.2.7,11,17,29">2:7, 11, 17, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.6,13,22">3:6, 13, 22</a>; esp. <a href="?bref=Rev.2.23">2:23</a>). Their order (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.11">1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">2:1–3:22</a>) reflects the natural ancient travel circuit beginning at Ephesus and arriving finally at Laodicea.</p>
<p>Each message generally follows a common literary plan consisting of seven parts:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The addressee is given first, following a common pattern in all seven letters: “To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write. . . .”</p>
<p class="list">2. Then the speaker is mentioned. In each case, some part of the great vision of Christ and of his self-identification (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.12-20">1:12-20</a>) is repeated as the speaker identifies himself; for example, “This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lampstands” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.1">2:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.1.13,16">1:13, 16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Next, the knowledge of the speaker is given. He intimately knows the works of the churches and the reality of their loyalty to him, despite outward appearances. In two cases (Sardis and Laodicea) the assessment proves totally negative. The enemy of Christ’s churches is the deceiver, Satan, who seeks to undermine the churches’ loyalty to Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.10,24">2:10, 24</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Following his assessment of the churches’ accomplishments, the speaker pronounces his verdict on their condition in such words as “You do not love me as you did at first” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.4">2:4</a>) or “You are dead” (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.1">3:1</a>). Two letters contain no unfavorable verdict (Smyrna, Philadelphia) and two no word of commendation (Sardis, Laodicea). In the letters, all derelictions are viewed as forms of inner betrayals of a prior relation to Christ.</p>
<p class="list">5. To correct or alert each congregation, Jesus issues a penetrating command. These commands further expose the exact nature of the self-deception involved.</p>
<p class="list">6. Each letter contains the general exhortation: “Anyone who is willing to hear should listen to the Spirit and understand what the Spirit is saying to the churches.” The words of the Spirit are the words of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.19.10">19:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">7. Finally, each letter contains a promise of reward to the victor. Each is eschatological and correlates with the last two chapters of the book. Furthermore, the promises are echoes of <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-3.24">Genesis 2–3</a>: what was lost by Adam in Eden is more than regained by Christ. We are probably to understand the seven promises as different facets that combine to make up one great promise to believers: wherever Christ is, there the “overcomers” will be.</p>
<p class="h3">The Seven-Sealed Scroll (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-8.1">4:1–8:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In view of the elaborate use of imagery and visions from <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1">4:1</a> through the end of Revelation, and in view of the question of how this material relates to chapters <a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-3.24">1–3</a>, it is not surprising that commentators differ widely in their treatment of these chapters.</p>
<p class="h4">The Throne, the Scroll, and the Lamb (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-5.14">4:1–5:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Chapters <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-5.32">4–5</a> form one vision consisting of two parts: the throne (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">4</a>) and the Lamb and the scroll (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.5.1-14">5</a>). Actually, the throne vision (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-5.32">4–5</a>) and the breaking of all seven seals (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-8.22">6–8</a>) form a single, continuous vision and should not be separated; indeed, the throne vision should be viewed as dominating the entire vision of the seven-sealed scroll, and, for that matter, the rest of the book (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.22.3">22:3</a>).</p>
<p>A new view of God’s majesty and power is disclosed to John so that he can understand the events on earth that relate to the seven-sealed vision (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">4:1-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19">1 Kgs 22:19</a>). For the first time in Revelation, the reader is introduced to the frequent interchange between heaven and earth found in the remainder of the book. What happens on earth has its inseparable heavenly counterpart.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.5.1-14">5</a> is part of the vision that begins with chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">4</a> and continues through the opening of the seven seals (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-8.1">Rv 6:1–8:1</a>; cf. introduction to ch <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">4</a>). The movement of the whole scene focuses on the slain Lamb as he takes the scroll from the hand of the one on the throne. The culminating emphasis is on the worthiness of the Lamb to receive worship because of his death.</p>
<p class="h4">Opening of the First Six Seals (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-17">6:1-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The opening of the seals continues the vision begun in chapters <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">4</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.5.1-14">5</a>. Now the scene shifts to events on earth. The scroll itself involves the rest of Revelation and has to do with the consummation of the mystery of all things, the goal or end of history for both the overcomers and the worshipers of the beast. The writer tentatively suggests that the seals represent events preparatory to the final consummation. Whether these events come immediately before the end or whether they represent general conditions that will prevail throughout the period preceding the end is a more difficult question.</p>
<p>The seals closely parallel the signs of the approaching end times spoken of by Jesus in his Olivet discourse (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-35">Mt 24:1-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13:1-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.5-33">Lk 21:5-33</a>). This parallel to major parts of Revelation is too striking to be ignored. Thus the seals would correspond to the “beginning of birth pains” in the Olivet discourse. The events are similar to those occurring under the trumpets (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.2-11.19">Rv 8:2–11:19</a>) and bowls (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.1-16.21">15:1–16:21</a>) but should not be confused with those late and more severe judgments.</p>
<p class="h4">First Interlude: The 144,000 Israelites and the White-Robed Multitude (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-17">7:1-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The change in tone from the subject matter in the sixth seal, as well as the delay until <a href="?bref=Rev.8.1">8:1</a> in opening the seventh seal, indicate that chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-17">7</a> is a true interlude. John first sees the angels, who will unleash destruction on the earth, restrained until the 144,000 servants of God from every tribe of Israel are sealed (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-8">1-8</a>). Then he sees an innumerable multitude clothed in white standing before the throne of God; these are identified as those who have come out of the great tribulation (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.7.9-17">9-17</a>).</p>
<p>Some scholars separate the two groups into Jews and Gentiles at large, while others see the two groups as one group viewed from different perspectives.</p>
<p class="h4">The Opening of the Seventh Seal (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.1">8:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After the interlude (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-17">7</a>), the final seal is opened and silence for half an hour occurs in heaven to prepare for judgment on earth or to hear the cries of the martyrs on earth (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.6.10">6:10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The First Six Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.2-11.14">8:2–11:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">After a preparatory scene in heaven (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.2-5">8:2-5</a>), the six trumpets are blown in succession (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.6-9.19">8:6–9:19</a>), followed again by an interlude (<a href="?bref=Rev.10.1-11.14">10:1–11:14</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The First Six Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.6-9.21">8:6–9:21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Opinion differs, but it may be best to see the first five seals as preceding the events of the trumpets and bowls. But the sixth seal enters into the period of the outpouring of God’s wrath that is enacted in the trumpet and bowl judgments (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.12-17">6:12-17</a>). The trumpet judgments thus occur during the seventh seal, and the bowl judgments (<a href="?bref=Rev.16.1-21">16:1-21</a>), during the seventh trumpet’s sounding. Therefore, there is some overlapping, but also sequence and advancement, between the seals, trumpets, and bowls.</p>
<p>As in the seals, there is a discernible literary pattern in the unfolding of the trumpets. The first four trumpets are separated from the last three, which are called “woes” (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.13">8:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.12">9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.14">11:14</a>) and are generally reminiscent of the plagues in the book of Exodus.</p>
<p>The last three trumpets are emphasized and are also called “woes” (<a href="?bref=Rev.8.13">8:13</a>) because they are so severe. The first of these involves an unusual plague of locusts (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1-11">9:1-11</a>) and the second a plague of scorpionlike creatures (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.9.13-19">13-19</a>). Both of these plagues can best be seen as demonic hordes (cf. vv <a href="?bref=Rev.9.1,11">1, 11</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Second Interlude: The Little Book and the Two Witnesses (<a href="?bref=Rev.10.1-11.14">10:1–11:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The major point of chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.10.1-11">10</a> seems to be a confirmation of John’s prophetic call, as verse <a href="?bref=Rev.10.11">11</a> indicates: “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). More specifically, the contents of the little scroll (book) may include chapters <a href="?bref=Rev.11.1-19">11</a>, <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-18">12</a>, and <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13</a>.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.11.1-19">11</a> is notoriously difficult. It includes a reference to measuring the temple, the altar, and the worshipers, and to the trampling down of the Holy City for 42 months (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.1-2">11:1-2</a>), as well as the description of the two prophet-witnesses who are killed and raised to life (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.11.3-13">3-13</a>). Opinions vary considerably here; some see this vision as depicting the restored Jewish nation, with the actual prophets Moses and Elijah being revived. Others see the temple as the true church being protected by God during the tribulation and the two witnesses representing the whole faithful church under persecution.</p>
<p class="h3">The Seventh Trumpet (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.15-14.20">11:15–14:20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The seventh trumpet sounds, and in heaven loud voices proclaim the final triumph of God and Christ over the world. The theme is the kingdom of God and Christ—a dual kingdom, eternal in its duration. The image suggests the transference of the world empire once dominated by a usurping power, now taken by the hand of its true Owner and King. The announcement of the reign of the King is made here, but the final breaking of the enemies’ hold over the world does not occur until the return of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-21">19:11-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Woman and the Dragon (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-17">12:1-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this chapter there are three main figures: the woman, the child, and the dragon. There are also three scenes: the birth of the child (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-6">1-6</a>), the expulsion of the dragon (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.12.7-12">7-12</a>), and the dragon’s attack on the woman and her children (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.12.13-17">13-17</a>).</p>
<p>Since the context indicates that the woman under attack represents a continuous entity from the birth of Christ until at least John’s day or later, her identity in the author’s mind must be the Christian community.</p>
<p>The woman is in the throes of childbirth (v <a href="?bref=Rev.12.2">2</a>). The emphasis is on her pain and suffering, both physical and spiritual. The meaning of her anguish is that the faithful Christian community has been suffering as a prelude to the coming of the Messiah himself and of the new age (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.17">Is 26:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.7-8">66:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.10">Mi 4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.3">5:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Two Beasts (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13:1-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Turning from the inner dynamics of the struggle (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-18">12</a>), chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">13</a> shifts to the actual earthly instruments of this assault against God’s people—namely, the two dragon-energized beasts. The activities of the two beasts constitute the way the dragon carries out his final attempts to wage war on the offspring of the woman (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.17">12:17</a>).</p>
<p>The dragon and the first beast enter into a conspiracy to seduce the whole world into worshiping the beast. The conspirators summon a third figure to their aid—the beast from the earth, who must be sufficiently similar to the Lamb to entice even the followers of Jesus. As the battle progresses, the dragon’s deception becomes more and more subtle. Thus, the readers are called on to discern the criteria that will enable them to separate the lamblike beast from the Lamb himself (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.13.11">13:11</a> with <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1">14:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Harvest of the Earth (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.1-20">14:1-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The two previous chapters have prepared Christians for the reality that, as the end draws near, they will be harassed and sacrificed like sheep. This section shows that their sacrifice is not meaningless. In chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-17">7</a> the 144,000 were merely sealed; here, however, they are seen as already delivered. When the floods have passed, Mt Zion appears high above the waters; the Lamb is on the throne of glory, surrounded by the triumphant songs of his own; the gracious presence of God fills the universe.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1-20">14</a> briefly answers two pressing questions: What becomes of those who refuse to receive the mark of the beast and are killed (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1-5">1-5</a>)? What happens to the beast and his servants (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.14.6-20">6-20</a>)?</p>
<p class="h3">The Seven Bowls (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.1-19.10">15:1–19:10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The series of bowl judgments constitutes the “third woe,” announced in <a href="?bref=Rev.11.14">11:14</a> as “coming soon” (see comments on <a href="?bref=Rev.11.14">11:14</a>). These last plagues take place “immediately after the distress of those days” referred to by Jesus in the Olivet discourse and may well be the fulfillment of his apocalyptic words: “The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken” (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.29">Mt 24:29</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p class="h4">Preparation: The Seven Angels with the Seven Last plagues (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.1-8">15:1-8</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.15.1-8">15</a> is related to the OT account of the exodus and is strongly suggestive of the liturgical tradition of the ancient synagogue. The chapter has two main visions: the first portrays the victors who have emerged triumphant from the great ordeal (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.15.2-4">2-4</a>); the second relates the emergence from the heavenly temple of the seven angels clothed in white and gold who hold the seven bowls of the last plagues (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.15.5-8">5-8</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Pouring Out of the Bowl Judgments (<a href="?bref=Rev.16.1-21">16:1-21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">These occur in rapid succession with only a brief pause for a dialogue between the third angel and the altar, accentuating the justice of God’s punishments (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.16.5-7">5-7</a>). This rapid succession is probably due to John’s desire to give a telescopic view of the first six bowls and to hasten then on to the seventh, where the far more interesting judgment on Babylon occurs, concerning which the author will give a detailed account. The final three plagues are social and spiritual in their effect and shift from nature to humanity.</p>
<p class="h4">The Prostitute and the Beast (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.1-18">17:1-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">To a majority of modern interpreters, Babylon represents the city of Rome. The beast stands for the Roman Empire as a whole, including its provinces and peoples. However, it is not sufficient simply to identify Babylon with Rome. For that matter, Babylon cannot be confined to any one historical manifestation, past or future; it has multiple equivalents (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.11.8">11:8</a>). Babylon is found wherever there is satanic deception. Babylon is better understood here as the archetypal head of all entrenched worldly resistance to God. Babylon is a transhistorical reality that includes idolatrous kingdoms as diverse as Sodom, Egypt, Babylon, Tyre, Nineveh, and Rome. Babylon is an eschatological symbol of satanic deception and power; it is a divine mystery that can never be wholly reducible to empirical earthly institutions. Babylon represents the total culture of the world apart from God, while the divine system is depicted by the New Jerusalem. Rome is simply one manifestation of the total system.</p>
<p class="h4">The Fall of Babylon the Great (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.1-24">18:1-24</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.18.1-24">18</a> contains the description of the previously announced judgment on the prostitute (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.1">17:1</a>). Under the imagery of the destruction of a great commercial city, John describes the final overthrow of the great prostitute, Babylon.</p>
<p class="h4">Thanksgiving for the Destruction of Babylon (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-5">19:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In stark contrast to the laments of Babylon’s consorts, the heavenly choirs burst forth in a great liturgy of celebration to God.</p>
<p class="h4">The Marriage of the Lamb (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.6-10">19:6-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Finally, the cycle of praise is completed with the reverberating sounds of another great multitude (v <a href="?bref=Rev.19.6">6</a>): the redeemed throng (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.7.9">7:9</a>). They utter the final Hallel in words reminiscent of the great royal psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.93.1">Pss 93:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.1">97:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1">99:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Vision of the Return of Christ and the Consummation of the Age (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-20.15">19:11–20:15</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">The First and Second Last Things: The Rider on the White Horse and the Destruction of the Beast (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-21">19:11-21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This vision, which depicts the return of Christ and the final overthrow of the beast, may be viewed as the climax of the previous section (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-10">1-10</a>) or as the first of a final series of seven last things—namely, the return of Christ; the defeat of the beast; the binding of Satan; the Millennium; the release and final end of Satan; the last judgment; and the new heaven, the new earth, and the new Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Although Satan has been dealt a death blow at the cross (cf. <a href="?bref=John.12.31">Jn 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.11">16:11</a>), he nevertheless continues to promulgate evil and deception during this present age (cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.2.2">Eph 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.5">1 Thes 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.8-9">1 Pt 5:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">Rv 2:10</a>). Yet he is a deposed ruler who is now under the sovereign authority of Christ. Satan is allowed to continue his evil for a short time until God’s purposes are finished. In this scene of the overthrow of the beast, his kings, and their armies, John shows us the ultimate and swift destruction of these evil powers by the King of kings and Lord of lords. They have met their Master in this final and utterly real confrontation (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.17-21">Rv 19:17-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Third and Fourth Last Things: The Binding of Satan and the Millennium (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-6">20:1-6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Millennium has been called one of the most controversial and intriguing questions of eschatology. The main problem is whether the reference to a Millennium (thousand years) indicates an earthly historical reign of peace that will manifest itself at the close of this present age, or whether the whole passage is symbolic of some present experience of Christians or some future nonhistorical reality. The former view is called premillennial (i.e., Christ’s second coming precedes the Millennium), the latter is amillennial (i.e., there is no literal Millenium).</p>
<p>The binding of Satan removes his deceptive activities from the earth (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-3">1-3</a>) during the time the martyred saints are resurrected and rule with Christ (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.20.4-6">4-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Fifth Last Thing: The Release and Final End of Satan (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-10">20:7-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.1-39.29">Ezekiel 38–39</a>, “Gog” refers to the prince of a host of pagan invaders from the North, especially the Scythian hordes from the distant land of Magog. In Revelation, however, the names are symbolic of the final enemies of Christ duped by Satan into attacking the community of the saints.</p>
<p class="h4">The Sixth Last Thing: The Great White Throne Judgment (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.11-15">20:11-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The language of poetic imagery captures the fading character of everything that is of the world (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.15-17">1 Jn 2:15-17</a>). Now the only reality is God seated on the throne of judgment, before whom all must appear (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.27">Heb 9:27</a>). His verdict is holy and righteous (expressed symbolically by the white throne). This vision declares that even though it may have seemed that the course of earth’s history ran contrary to his holy will, no single day or hour in the world’s drama has ever detracted from the absolute sovereignty of God.</p>
<p class="h4">The Seventh Last Thing: The New Heaven and the New Earth and the New Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.5">21:1–22:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">John here discloses a theology in stone, gold as pure as glass, and color. Archetypal images abound. The church is called the bride (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">21:2</a>). God gives the thirsty “the springs of the water of life without charge!” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.21.6">6</a>). Completeness is implied in the number 12 and its multiples (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.21.12-14,16-17,21">12-14, 16-17, 21</a>), and fullness in the cubical shape of the city (v <a href="?bref=Rev.21.16">16</a>). Colorful jewels abound, as do references to light and the glory of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.11,18-21,23-25">21:11, 18-21, 23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.5">22:5</a>). There is the “river of the water of life” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.1">22:1</a>) and the “tree of life” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.22.2">2</a>). The “sea” is gone (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">21:1</a>).</p>
<p>Allusions to the OT abound. Most of John’s imagery in this chapter reflects <a href="?bref=Isa.60.1-22">Isaiah 60</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.65.1-25">65</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ezekiel 40–48</a>. John weaves Isaiah’s vision of the new Jerusalem together with Ezekiel’s vision of the new temple. The multiple OT promises converging in John’s mind seem to indicate that he viewed the new Jerusalem as the fulfillment of all these strands of prophecy. There are also allusions to <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-3.24">Genesis 1–3</a>: the absence of death and suffering, the dwelling of God with his people as in Eden, the tree of life, the removal of the curse. Creation is restored to its pristine character.</p>
<p>The connection of this vision with the promises to the overcomers in the letters to the seven churches (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-3.22">Rv 2–3</a>) is significant. For example, to the overcomers at Ephesus was granted the right to the tree of life (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.7">2:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.22.2">22:2</a>); at Thyatira, the right to rule the nations (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.26">2:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.22.5">22:5</a>); at Philadelphia, the name of the city of God, the new Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">3:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2,9-27">21:2, 9-27</a>). In a sense, a strand from every major section of the Apocalypse appears in chapters <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">21–22</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">John’s Conclusion (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.6-21">22:6-21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">With consummate artistry, the words of the introduction (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-8">1:1-8</a>) are sounded again in the conclusion: the book ends with the voices of the angel, Jesus, the Spirit, the bride, and finally John: “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.20">22:20</a>).</p>

  <title>Reward</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">REWARD</p>
<p class="fl">Recompense for good or evil; most often it suggests a benefit for favorable compensation. Both good and evil are rewarded or punished, and man’s responsibility and accountability are involved in an ethical sense. Related terms such as “wages,” “hire,” “recompense,” or “requital” are a part of the broader concept. In this fullest sense, the operation of reward ranges from the consequences resulting from dealings between people to God’s compensation for obedience or disobedience, from the consequences of actions felt in this life to divine recompense in the life to come.</p>
<p>To Greek and Hebrew minds, the concept of reward suggested the ideal of the wholeness of an action, the completion of a deed. Just as work was completed for a man in the payment of wages, so it was assumed that an action naturally carried certain results, either reward or punishment. The overtones of commercial transactions were not absent, as when the reward is referred to as “wages.” Thus Paul says, “The wages of sin is death” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.23">Rom 6:23</a>). The idea involves an equal return commensurate with the action performed.</p>
<p>The biblical conception of reward was both ethical and religious. The covenant of God made with Israel was evidence of God’s loving favor; it promised good things to Israel on the condition of their obedience to God’s commands. Disobedience was a violation of the covenant and would bring disaster and death. <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">Deuteronomy 28</a> spells out the blessings that obedience would bring and also the national disasters that would come upon Israel if they did not observe what was right and good in the sight of the Lord (see also <a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">Lv 26</a>). In the period of the wilderness wanderings, failure to obey on the part of the people and their leaders brought suffering and death. The history of the judges and the kings was written in terms of reward for faithfulness and punishment for sin and idolatry. Earthly victory and the national welfare depended on obedience and faithfulness to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.7-9">Jos 1:7-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-23">Jgs 2</a>).</p>
<p>The pattern of reward and punishment was not always carried out. The Jews believed that God would be a merciful, forgiving God. Forgiveness involved the removal of the punishment for sin. “He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor requite us according to our iniquities” (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.10">Ps 103:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The writer of Ecclesiastes found that life did not work out so neatly and that the doctrine of retribution did not always apply in the span of an individual life. There is a somewhat cynical note when the righteous suffer and the wicked prosper. Job’s friends take the position that his sickness is the result of some hidden sin. Job maintains his integrity, and for him the answer lies outside the pattern of strict reward for righteousness and punishment for evil. In the outcome Job is rewarded for his good life.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ day Judaism had changed significantly. The legal system of the judges had been replaced with Roman law. But Judaism had no hesitation about recognizing the merit of good works and exhorting people to accumulate a store of merit on a basis of which God would bless them (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.4.7-10">Tb 4:7-10</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.51.30">Ecclus 51:30</a>). The Pharisees believed that accurate and conscientious observance of the law would oblige God to recompense them for their performances. The individual who did much was to expect reward from God, while every transgression entailed its corresponding recompense for evil. What was not repaid in this life would be a part of a future reward.</p>
<p>Reward was a significant part of Jesus’ teaching, especially in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">Mt 5–7</a>). The Beatitudes proclaimed that the blessing of God would come upon all people who exhibited certain moral characteristics (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-12">Mt 5:1-12</a>). The individual who acts to receive the praise of others shall receive that and nothing more, but the one whose motives call him to please God shall be rewarded by God (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.1,4,6,18">6:1, 4, 6, 18</a>). However, Jesus sharply curbed this idea when he taught the parable of the laborers (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.1-16">20:1-16</a>). Here each was paid the same amount no matter how long he had worked. Jesus calls us to work for motives higher than reward. In the discourse on the good shepherd, the hireling who only works for wages is contrasted with the shepherd who is willing to lay down his life for the sheep (<a href="?bref=John.10.11-14">Jn 10:11-14</a>). The servant who had only done his duty deserves no reward (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.9-10">Lk 17:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>Beginning with Paul, the idea of reward, especially as it relates to salvation, is seen in a drastically different light. No longer is salvation considered to be the result of an individual having done more good than evil in life. Salvation is an act of divine favor that no one can earn (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.4-5">Rom 4:4-5</a>). Salvation is not earned but given by a loving, beneficent God. The idea of reward does not disappear. Reward results from good done after salvation is attained. <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.8-14">First Corinthians 3:8-14</a> teaches that the quality of a person’s works will be examined and rewarded but that salvation does not hinge upon good works. However, works do have an important place in one’s eternal destiny (<a href="?bref=Col.3.24">Col 3:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.13">Rv 14:13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">REZEPH</p>
<p class="fl">City destroyed by the Assyrians. It was mentioned in a derisive letter sent from Sennacherib, king of Assyria, to Hezekiah of Judah. Rezeph was listed along with the conquered cities of Gozan and Haran and the sons of Eden in Telassar. The Assyrian king was reminding Hezekiah that just as the local deities of these cities were not able to protect them from Assyrian conquest, so neither could Hezekiah’s God preserve Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.12">2 Kgs 19:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.12">Is 37:12</a>). Rezeph was a notable Assyrian city, known for its commerce and governing seat. It was brought into the Assyrian Empire well over a century before Hezekiah’s confrontation with Sennacherib. It is perhaps identifiable with the modern Syrian city of Resafa.</p>

  <title>Rezin</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">REZIN</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Syrian monarch who ruled in Damascus during the earlier part of Isaiah’s prophetic ministry and during the last years that the northern 10 tribes existed as a nation. Rezin was used by God to humble both Israel and Judah because they had forsaken him and rejected his covenant (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.5-6">2 Chr 28:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Rezin was born in the town of Bit-hadara near Damascus in the land of Syria (also called Aram). Upon his accession to the throne, the Syrian people (also called Arameans) reasserted their independence from Israel’s domination. During this period, Assyria was strengthening itself and expanding its empire throughout the Near East. Along with King Menahem of Israel, Rezin was forced to pay tribute to the Assyrian monarch Tiglath-pileser III in 738 <span class="era">BC</span>. The heavy burden of vassalage to the Assyrians generated anti-Assyrian sentiment among the Syrian and neighboring people. During this time, Rezin seems to have helped Pekah in his successful coup to seize the throne of Israel. Immediately upon his accession to the throne, Pekah formed an anti-Assyrian coalition with Rezin. They soon realized that successful resistance against Assyria required a larger alliance. They invited King Ahaz of Judah to join their coalition, but Ahaz adamantly refused. With the intention of placing an Aramean of Davidic lineage upon the throne of Judah in order to effect a broader Syrian-Israelite alliance, Rezin and Pekah joined in an attack on Judah. In spite of winning most battles, Rezin and Pekah were unsuccessful in their attempt to take Jerusalem and replace Ahaz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.5-15">2 Chr 28:5-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-9">Is 7:1-9</a>). During these dark days for Judah, Isaiah brought an encouraging word to the people. He prophesied the imminent destruction of Israel (Ephraim) and Damascus by Assyria (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-9">Is 7:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.1-8">8:1-8</a>). So certain was the destruction of these kingdoms that he referred to their two kings as “stubs of smoldering firebrands” about to be extinguished (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.4">7:4</a>). Disregarding Isaiah’s prophecy, Ahaz sent a large sum of money to Tiglath-pileser III, hoping to induce him to come to Judah’s aid.</p>
<p class="list-text">Rezin and Pekah moved their forces to the north to prepare for the impending Assyrian invasion. Tiglath-pileser attacked in 733 <span class="era">BC</span> and captured much of the area of Galilee. He then turned his attention to Damascus, to which Rezin had fled. Assyrian records refer to Rezin as a “caged bird” in besieged Damascus. When Damascus fell in 732 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rezin was executed and many citizens of Damascus were exiled. Samaria, the capital city of Israel, fell to the Assyrians in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. Damascus and the nation of Syria became an Assyrian province. Rezin thus was the last Syrian king to reign in Damascus.</p>

Then, in the absence of a south wind, they may have tacked into the Strait of Messina, finding good harbor at Rhegium. Another south wind carried them from Rhegium to Puteoli in the Bay of Naples—the ship’s destination, since Puteoli was southern Italy’s chief port, receiving the great Alexandrian grain vessels.</p>
<p>The Strait of Messina was well known to every Roman navigator. Passage here was necessary in order to gain access to Italy’s west coast, but its obstacles were numerous. Obstructions, shallows, and the narrow width forced ships to stay at Rhegium until an adequate south wind arose.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="Rhegium"/>
<p>The name Rhegium (modern Reggio or Reggio di Calabria) may have come from a Greek verb meaning “to tear” or “rend.” Sicily, it seemed, had been “torn from the mainland” and Rhegium was the nearest Italian port.</p>

<p class="fl">Port of call on Paul’s return trip to Jerusalem from his third missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.1">Acts 21:1</a>). The mention of Rhodes in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.4">Genesis 10:4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.15">Ezekiel 27:15</a>, and <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.7">1 Chronicles 1:7</a> is not based on the Hebrew text of the OT but on its Greek translation. The island of Rhodes, an area of more than 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers), is situated near the southeast coast of modern Turkey.</p>
<p>In Paul’s time the island had long been an important establishment of Dorian Greek culture, with several cities. Rhodes, the capital, lay on the busiest ancient sea route between the ports of Italy and the province of Asia to the west, and those of Syria and Egypt to the east. It was distinguished for its natural harbor and public works. Rhodes was a prominent center for business and supplied most of the precedents for Roman law of the sea. The second century <span class="era">BC</span> marked the height of its political power, which included control of most of Caria and Lycia on the mainland of Asia Minor. Roman power first deprived Rhodes of its commercial domination, and during the Roman civil wars of the first century <span class="era">BC</span>, it was reduced politically to little more than a provincial town in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>To celebrate a military victory in 280 <span class="era">BC</span>, the city of Rhodes erected an immense bronze statue of the Greek sun god, 121 feet (36.9 meters) tall—about the height of the Statue of Liberty. It was 12 years in the making, and soon after its completion, an earthquake broke it off at the knees (224 <span class="era">BC</span>). But the fragmented ruins remained as a curiosity until Arab occupation of the island in the seventh century. This Colossus of Rhodes was included in some ancient lists of wonders of the world.</p>

<p class="list">1. Town along the Orontes River located some 35 miles (56.3 kilometers) northeast of Baalbek, identifiable with modern Ribleh in Syria. Riblah was well situated topographically for military operations, especially when the great powers of Egypt and Mesopotamia were crossing the northern part of the Fertile Crescent. The Egyptians are mentioned in Scripture as the first people that troubled this town. After the death of King Josiah in his battle with the Egyptian pharaoh Neco, Jehoahaz was made king. Neco did not approve of the election. So the pharaoh imprisoned Jehoahaz at Riblah and made Eliakim (Jehoiakim), Jehoahaz’s brother, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.33">2 Kgs 23:33</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After the defeat of Neco at Carchemish in 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took control of the area, making Riblah his headquarters for his South-Syria and Palestine dominions.

  <title>Riches</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">RICHES</p>
<p class="fl">Wealth measured by money or the amount of property owned, whether land and buildings (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.8-10">Is 5:8-10</a>), livestock (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.2-3">1 Sm 25:2-3</a>), or slaves (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.11-18">8:11-18</a>). Great riches brought great influence and power, as the Hebrew word for wealth implies.</p>
<p>The Bible seems to speak with two voices on the subject of riches, sometimes describing material wealth as a sign of God’s blessing and approval (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.24.35">Gn 24:35</a>), at other times virtually identifying the rich with the wicked (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.37.7,16">Ps 37:7, 16</a>).</p>
<p>God made all things for people to enjoy (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.17">1 Tm 6:17</a>). That is why being rich is a matter for thanksgiving, not embarrassment. Every possession that a person can possibly own comes from the Creator (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.1">Ps 24:1</a>), so all wealth can rightly be counted as a blessing from God. It was in this spirit that David could pray to God, “Riches and honour come of thee” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.12">1 Chr 29:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Even when wealth is earned by hard work, the Bible reminds its readers that both their talents and their resources are God-given. Jesus illustrates this important lesson in the parables of the 10 talents (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.14-30">Mt 25:14-30</a>) and the 10 minas (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.11-26">Lk 19:11-26</a>).</p>
<p>Nowhere, then, does the Bible say that having possessions and becoming wealthy are wrong in themselves. There would be no point in the Ten Commandments’ ban on stealing and envy if it was wrong for God’s people to own anything at all. Jesus himself never taught that it was sinful to be rich.</p>
<p>However, Jesus warned that riches could keep a person out of the kingdom: “How hard it is for rich people to get into the Kingdom of God!” (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.23">Mk 10:23</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Affluence, he taught, can destroy peace (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.24-34">Mt 6:24-34</a>), blind people to the needs of others (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>), stand between individuals and the gateway to eternal life (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.17-27">Mk 10:17-27</a>), and even bring God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.16-21">Lk 12:16-21</a>). He told his disciples not to accumulate personal wealth (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.19">Mt 6:19</a>), and he praised those who gave up their possessions (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.29">19:29</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus’ warnings against wealth are not, in fact, directed against riches in themselves. What he condemns is the wrong attitudes many people have toward acquiring wealth, and the wrong ways in which they use it. Longing for riches, not having them, chokes the spiritual life like weeds in a field of grain (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.22">Mt 13:22</a>). The greedy desire to have more wealth doomed the unforgiving servant (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">18:23-35</a>). And the rich man’s selfishness, not his wealth, sealed his fate (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-26">Lk 16:19-26</a>). Paul captured the main theme in these parables when he said, “The <span class="ital">love</span> of money is at the root of all kinds of evil” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.10">1 Tm 6:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>, emphasis added).</p>
<p>The greatest danger of all arises when riches gain the mastery in a person’s life. The whole Bible warns against this idolatrous attitude to material things (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.8.17-18">Dt 8:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.15-24">Lk 14:15-24</a>). Satan tempted Jesus to put material wealth and power in God’s place (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.8-9">Mt 4:8-9</a>), and Jesus delivers the clearest warning against making money one’s master (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.24">6:24</a>). In this light Jesus instructs the rich young ruler to sell everything (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.17-22">Mk 10:17-22</a>). Here was a wealthy man who had allowed his possessions to possess him. Jesus’ aim was to make him recognize his bondage so he could escape from his self-made prison. The fact that he turned away from Jesus demonstrates the powerful pull of riches.</p>
<p>These blunt warnings are the most striking aspect of Jesus’ teaching on wealth. But alongside his exposure of wrong attitudes he was careful to sketch in the outline of right attitudes. Those who recognize that they are God’s trustees (not owners) of their possessions, he taught, will find many valuable outlets for their riches in the Lord’s service (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.42-44">Lk 12:42-44</a>). Instead of making them tight-fisted, their riches should allow them to express love in many practical ways (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.2">2 Cor 8:2</a>). And instead of having their inward peace ruined by anxious greed, they would find the secret of serenity in an increasing sense of dependence on their heavenly Giver (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.29-31">Lk 12:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.17">1 Tm 6:17</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, then, the morality of riches depends entirely on personal attitudes. And nowhere does this come out more than in the frequent comparisons Scripture draws between material and spiritual wealth. Those who make material riches their goal in life have wrong values. However wealthy they may appear, they are poverty-stricken in God’s sight (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.26">Mt 16:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.17">Rv 3:17</a>). In his view, the truly rich are those whose main aim in life is to serve him as King (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.44-46">Mt 13:44-46</a>). Their wealth lies in the currency of faith and good works (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.18">1 Tm 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">Jas 2:5</a>)—a heavenly bank balance that no one can steal and nothing can erode: “Wherever your treasure is, there your heart and thoughts will also be” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.21">Mt 6:21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">RIDDLE</p>
<p class="fl">Word puzzle widely used and esteemed in the ancient world, both as an everyday amusement and as a test of wisdom at a more serious level. The point of a riddle was the discovery of a concealed meaning. Riddles, therefore, may be broadly distinguished from fables, which, like Jotham’s celebrated plant fable (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.7-15">Jgs 9:7-15</a>), contained an easily discerned significance. Obviously, there is an intermediate area where there is no sharp differentiation. For instance, Ezekiel’s riddle (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.1-24">Ez 17</a>) has sometimes been classified as a plant fable.</p>
<p>Samson’s riddle at his wedding feast is the best-known biblical riddle (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.1-20">Jgs 14</a>). Probably it was a form of diversion used on such occasions (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.14.12-13">12-13</a>). The riddle took the form of a couplet: “From the one who eats came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet” (v <a href="?bref=Judg.14.14">14</a>). Samson’s 30 young men threatened his betrothed, who wheedled the secret from him: “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” (v <a href="?bref=Judg.14.18">18</a>).</p>
<p>Solomon’s wisdom was demonstrated in his ability to answer the “hard questions” (lit., “riddles”) of the queen of Sheba (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-4">1 Kgs 10:1-4</a>). His reputation for this kind of wisdom is further demonstrated by Ben Sirach: “Your soul covered the earth, and you filled it with parables and riddles” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.47.15">Ecclus 47:15</a>).</p>
<p>Josephus notes a contest of wits between Solomon and Hiram, with riddles being exchanged. Solomon won the earlier exchanges, but Hiram finally outwitted him by enlisting outside help (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 8.5.5). Such wisdom to solve riddles was, understandably, claimed by Israel’s wise men (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.49.4">Ps 49:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.1.6">Prv 1:6</a>). In <a href="?bref=Dan.8.23-24">Daniel 8:23-24</a> there is the apocalyptic vision of “a master of intrigue [who] will rise to power” (lit. “one who understands riddles”). Daniel himself possessed the same ability to “interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems” (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.12">Dn 5:12</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT riddles figure infrequently. The various “hard sayings” of Jesus (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.6.60">Jn 6:60</a>) are difficult to accept and are equally as hard to understand. Possibly the only true riddle is the number of the beast, 666 (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.18">Rv 13:18</a>). Various attempts have been made to identify a person, after the pattern of numerical references in contemporary literature. Of these, the emperor Nero is the most plausible candidate.</p>

  <title>Righteousness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">RIGHTEOUSNESS</p>
<p class="fl">The establishment of a right relationship—primarily between God and people, secondarily between people themselves. Righteousness is the fulfillment of just expectations in any relationship, whether with God or other people. It is applicable at all levels of society and is relevant in every area of life. Therefore, righteousness denotes the fulfilled expectations in relationships between man and wife, parents and children, fellow citizens, employer and employee, merchant and customers, ruler and citizens, and God and people. Depending on the fulfillment of one’s expectations, an individual could be called righteous and his or her acts and speech could be designated as righteous. The opposite of righteous is “evil,” “wicked,” or “wrong” (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.1.6">Ps 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.5">Zep 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>In Israel the concept of righteousness transformed all of life, both religious and secular. Israel had been called into existence as a separate nation through which Yahweh was to witness to the nations concerning his universal rule, his nature, and his expectations of life on earth. This meant that Israel required a revelation from God so that they might learn his will and be instructed in maintaining a relationship with him. The quality of a person’s relationship with God is directly linked to his relationship with his fellow human.</p>
<p>God is righteous (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.6">2 Chr 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.7.9">Pss 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.17">103:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.5">Zep 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.8">Zec 8:8</a>). His righteousness is dynamic, since it describes his acts on behalf of his people and also the nature of his relationship with them. All of God’s acts are righteous (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.32.4">Dt 32:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.11">Jgs 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.6">Ps 103:6</a>), and God’s people rejoiced in the righteous acts of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.16">Ps 89:16</a>). Because God is righteous, he expects righteousness of others, who are to reflect the nature of their Creator. The expected response to God’s rule is in the form of righteousness, that is, conformity to his rule and will. In this basic sense, Noah is called “righteous” because he walked with God and showed integrity in comparison to his contemporaries (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.9">Gn 6:9</a>). After humanity’s fall and acts of rebellion, culminating in the Flood and the dispersion at Babel, God renewed his relationship with humanity in Abraham and his descendants. Abraham was righteous because he ordered his life by the revealed will of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">15:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.19">18:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.5">26:5</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord revealed to Israel even more clearly how they were to relate to him and to each other. The law in Israel was for the purpose of helping the people of God to live in conformity to the will of God and thereby be righteous. The person who was devoted to the service of God in worship and life was called righteous (cf. <a href="?bref=Mal.3.18">Mal 3:18</a>). Thus, righteousness is a state of integrity in relation to God and one’s neighbor, expressing itself in one’s acts and speech.</p>
<p>The hope for an era characterized by righteousness was rooted in the prophetic revelation of the messianic rule and the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-9">Is 11:1-9</a>), whose rule will extend to the nations (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.11.10-16">10-16</a>) and last forever (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">9:7</a>). Isaiah developed the revelation of the glorious, victorious entrance of the kingdom of God in a most exquisite way, when his enemies will be subdued and his people will be gathered together and will live in a state of peace in his presence. The acts of restoration, extending from Israel’s return from exile until the final coming of the external kingdom are, in his prophetic purview, the demonstration of God’s righteous acts. He forgives, restores, remains faithful, loves, elects, and sends his Spirit to renew his people and to bestow on them all the benefits of the renewed covenant relationship. Both Jews and Gentiles will be the recipients of his righteous acts (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.8,23">Is 45:8, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.13,48">46:13, 48:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.5,8,16">51:5, 8, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.56.1">56:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.17">59:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.17">60:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.10-11">61:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>Out of concern for the salvation of his people and the establishment of his everlasting kingdom, God revealed his righteousness in the sending of his beloved Son. The coming of Christ marks an era of renewal of his relationship with people, the renewal of the covenant and renewal of his kingdom on earth. The older covenant was mediated by Moses; the covenant was renewed by the Son of God, who came “to fulfill all righteousness” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.15">Mt 3:15</a>). The message of Jesus is consistent with the OT in the close identification of God’s kingdom with his righteousness (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">6:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.13.43">13:43</a>). Jesus also taught that God expects all people to live in harmony with his will (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.21">7:21</a>). Jesus is God’s final revelation of what God requires of individuals so as to enter the kingdom and to live righteously.</p>
<p> But individuals cannot attain this righteousness by their own merits; it is a gift from God (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-5.21">Rom 3:21–5:21</a>). There is no righteousness apart from Jesus Christ. In the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus we discover that “it is through faith that a righteous person has life” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Hb 2:4</a>). Therefore, the Father requires acceptance of his Son as his appointed means of justification (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25-26">Rom 3:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.9">5:9</a>). God declares people to be righteous when they put their trust in his Son (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.33-34">Rom 8:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.15">11:15</a>). God pardons sins, is reconciled with sinners, and grants his peace to them (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1,9-11">Rom 5:1, 9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-17">Eph 2:14-17</a>). Those who have been declared righteous enjoy a new relationship. They are “sons of God” by adoption. The Father relates to his children righteously and expects them to relate righteously to him.</p>
<p>The fullness of righteousness will be manifest at the coming of the Lord Jesus, when all those who have been justified will also be glorified (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.30">Rom 8:30</a>). The goal of salvation history moves toward the final glorious manifestation of God’s kingdom, when all creation will be renewed in “righteousness”—that is, all creation will be right with God (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">RIGHT HAND</p>
<p class="fl">The word “right” in the Bible is often used in the sense of “being straight”; it is used to describe that which is just or righteous (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.18.25">Gn 18:25</a>). Figuratively speaking, God’s right hand is the means whereby victories are obtained for the people of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.17.7,98">Pss 17:7, 98:1</a>); it is also an instrument of punishment for the ungodly (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.16">Hb 2:16</a>). While the right hand of man is impotent to save (<a href="?bref=Job.40.14">Jb 40:14</a>), God’s right hand sustains his children in the hour of need (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.10">Ps 139:10</a>). Furthermore, God promises to strengthen the right hand of the person he purposes to help (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.13">Is 41:13</a>).</p>
<p>To be at the right hand of God is to occupy a place of the choicest blessings (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.11">Ps 16:11</a>); it is the place where the Lord Jesus Christ now reigns in glory and intercedes for those he has redeemed (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.34">Rom 8:34</a>).</p>
<p>To offer the right hand of fellowship is to extend the warmest and most accepting type of camaraderie (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>). Giving the right hand as the sign of a pledge also has a biblical antecedent (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.15">2 Kgs 10:15</a>).</p>
<p>Although the left hand is often linked to blessings (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.16">Prv 3:16</a>), it may also be associated with treachery or other undesirable activity (<a href="?bref=Eccl.10.2">Eccl 10:2</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Written in the first person (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.5,10">Rom 1:5, 10</a>, etc.), this epistle was authored by the apostle Paul. (The first words of the first verse are “Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, called an apostle.”) The actual transcription of the letter, however, was done by Tertius (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.22">16:22</a>), who acted as Paul’s amanuensis (secretary). The letter’s authenticity has never been disputed by reputable scholarship, liberal or conservative, and Romans stands at the head of virtually every ancient list or collection of Pauline letters.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">The destination of the letter is stated to be Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.7">1:7</a>). That Paul was in Corinth at the time of the writing seems clear from his reference to Erastus in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">16:23</a> as the treasurer of the city. An inscription in the stone pavement beside the large theater in Corinth states that it was laid by Erastus, the city treasurer, in appreciation for his election. This could hardly be coincidental. Erastus evidently remained in Corinth, because it is mentioned as his home (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.20">2 Tm 4:20</a>). Furthermore, Paul refers to Gaius as his host at the time he wrote Romans (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">Rom 16:23</a>), probably the same Gaius who lived in Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.14">1 Cor 1:14</a>). Finally, Phoebe, likely the carrier of this epistle, was a deaconess of the church at Cenchrea, the eastern port of Corinth (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.1">Rom 16:1</a>).</p>
<p>From the epistle itself we can determine when Paul wrote it. <a href="?bref=Rom.15.23-28">Romans 15:23-28</a> indicates that Paul was just about ready to make his visit to Jerusalem with a contribution for its Christian poor from the churches of Macedonia and Achaia, after which his purpose was to visit Rome on his way to Spain (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.23-28">15:23-28</a>). He carried this contribution with him from Corinth, at the close of his third visit to that city, which lasted three months (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.2,23">Acts 20:2, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.17">24:17</a>). On this occasion certain persons accompanied him from Corinth, whose names are given by the historian of Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">20:4</a>), and four of these are expressly mentioned in this epistle as being with the apostle when he wrote it—Timothy, Sosipater, Gaius, and Erastus (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.21,23">Rom 16:21, 23</a>). Paul’s visit to Jerusalem is usually dated around <span class="era">AD</span> 57–58. As such, the Epistle to the Romans was written around the same time.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">In a previous visit to Corinth, during his second missionary journey, Paul established the church there and remained in the city for 18 months (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.1,11">Acts 18:1, 11</a>). His arrival coincided with the arrival of Priscilla and Aquila, who had recently come from Rome. At the end of his 18-month stay, Paul was brought before the newly appointed proconsul, Gallio (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12">Acts 18:12</a>), whose arrival can be dated from the Gallio inscription found at Delphi to the spring of <span class="era">AD</span> 51. Thus, Paul arrived in Corinth in the winter of <span class="era">AD</span> 49.</p>
<p>Leaving the city, he returned to Antioch, gave a report on his work, and set out on his last journey to collect the contribution for Jerusalem from the Gentile churches (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.25-29">Rom 15:25-29</a>), for which he had previously prepared (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1">1 Cor 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.5">2 Cor 9:5</a>). Continued problems in Corinth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.11">1 Cor 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1">7:1</a>) necessitated his return to the city (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.3">Acts 20:3</a>), at which time he wrote Romans. It is clear from the last two chapters of the letter that he planned to take the contribution to Jerusalem almost immediately and from there go on to Rome (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.23-24">Rom 15:23-24</a>). The occasion for the letter, therefore, is to alert the Romans to his coming so that they can assist him in his journey to Spain (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.24,28">15:24, 28</a>). Rome was the only church, other than Colosse, which Paul did not establish. His letter, consequently, does not reflect awareness of specific problems in the membership there.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Audience">Audience</p>
<p class="fl">The Roman church at this time was composed of both Jewish and Gentile believers. The church was probably started by Jewish believers who were at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>) and were among the 3,000 converts. Evidently, some of these took the gospel back with them to Rome. Probably some of the believers addressed in the salutations of the epistle were Christians already of long standing, if not among the earliest converts to the Christian faith. Thus, it is not improbable that up to the time of the apostle’s arrival, the Christian community at Rome had been dependent upon its own members for the increase of its numbers, aided perhaps by occasional visits from preachers.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientGreekManuscriptOfRomans"/>
<p>Evidently, the gospel had gone out to Gentiles, because there were Gentiles in the church, as is evidenced by Paul’s remarks throughout the letter. In fact, it is clear that the apostle wrote to them expressly as to a Gentile church (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.13,15">Rom 1:13, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.15-16">15:15-16</a>). Perhaps the major constituency of the Gentiles were “God-fearers” (see <a href="?bref=Acts.10.2">Acts 10:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Of all the epistles of Paul, this is the most elaborate and, at the same time, the most glowing. It has just as much in common with a theological treatise as with a personal, heartfelt epistle. The major theme running throughout the book is that both Jew and Gentile have fallen short of God’s glory and stand in need of salvation (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-31">Rom 3:21-31</a>). God’s righteousness has not been revealed only to the Jew—because God is not God only to the Jews but to the Gentiles as well, since there is only one God (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.29">3:29</a>). He will justify the Jews on the basis of the saving work of Christ at Calvary, and the Gentiles on the basis of that same act of faithfulness to Abraham’s promise (v <a href="?bref=Rom.3.30">30</a>). Their common faith gives them access to this grace (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.2">5:2</a>). The gospel is thus to the Jew first and also to the Greek (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">1:16</a>).</p>
<p>Once a person believes, that person is justified before God (chs <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-3.31">1–3</a>). This new relationship with God provides the believer with a new life in Christ and makes him or her a part of God’s people (chs <a href="?bref=Rom.4.1-8.39">4–8</a>). This is the deepest and most difficult part of the whole epistle; it carries us directly to the eternal springs of grace, sovereign love, and the inscrutable purposes of God. After this, we are told about the calling of the Gentiles, the preservation of a faithful Jewish remnant amidst the general unbelief and the fall of the nation, and the ultimate recovery of all Israel to constitute, with the Gentiles in the latter day, one universal church of God upon earth (chs <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">9–11</a>). The remainder of the epistle is devoted to the practical application (in church life) of the truths previously revealed (chs <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-15.33">12–15</a>). And then the epistle concludes with Paul’s heartfelt salutations to several different believers in Rome (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Overview</p>
<p class="fl">The thematic statement of the first eight chapters of the letter is set forth in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">1:17</a>: “It is through faith that a righteous person has life” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This quotation from <a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Habakkuk 2:4</a> sets Paul’s teaching on faith over against that of the OT on works. Thus, he affirms the fact that his teaching on faith is not new but is squarely rooted in the OT prophets. What was new was that the Gentiles would be fellow citizens with the Jews on the basis of faith in Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.5-6">Eph 3:5-6</a>). They would not have to become proselytes to Judaism in order to be acceptable to God, as some Jewish Christians demanded (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1">Acts 15:1</a>). This was the mystery of which Paul spoke in Ephesians (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.6">Eph 3:6</a>).</p>
<p>The first part of the epistle dwells on the theme that righteousness is attained by faith. The first three chapters demonstrate that Jew and Gentile are under sin and that the redemption of Christ is applicable to both (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-22">Rom 3:21-22</a>). The fourth chapter demonstrates that Abraham is the father of Gentiles as well as Jews, because he is the spiritual father of believing Israel just as he is of believing Gentiles. Then, in chapters <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-8.39">5–8</a>, Paul deals with the latter part of the theme of how a justifed person <span class="ital">lives</span> by faith. Whether Jew or Gentile, the person who accepts the righteous acts of God on Calvary through Christ will live free from the wrath of God (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-21">5</a>), the power of sin (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">6</a>), the enslaving power of the law (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.7.1-25">7</a>), and the power of death (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-39">8</a>).</p>
<p>In chapters <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">9–11</a>, Paul discusses the nation of Israel “according to the flesh” (physical Jews) in relation to the future purpose of God, concluding that God has not cast off his people who were Israelites descended from Abraham (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.1-2">11:1-2</a>). He can regraft them back into the tree from which they have been cut off, if they will accept Jesus as their Messiah (v <a href="?bref=Rom.11.23">23</a>).</p>
<p>Then in his closing section, he discusses the implications of the first 11 chapters for everyday Christian living (chs <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-16.27">12–16</a>), closing the book with a reminder of the importance of the “offering of the Gentiles” through his own ministry (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.15.1-33">15</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In Detail</p>
<p class="fl">In the first chapter Paul argues that the pagan Gentile world was in a state of rebellion against God, and the wrath of God had been revealed against their ungodliness (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.18">1:18</a>). Even though God had given sufficient revelation of his existence to them in the world of nature, they had nevertheless become polytheistic and idolatrous, with all the accompanying moral degradations (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.1.20-23">20-23</a>). Thus, three times Paul emphasizes that God gave them up to their lusts (v <a href="?bref=Rom.1.24">24</a>), to dishonorable passions (v <a href="?bref=Rom.1.26">26</a>), and to a base mind and improper conduct (v <a href="?bref=Rom.1.28">28</a>). The meaning is that he passed over their sins (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">3:25</a>), overlooked their spiritual ignorance of his true existence (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.30">Acts 17:30</a>), and did not put a stop to such idolatry (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.42">7:42</a>).</p>
<p>The Jews fared little better because, even though they had received the law of Moses containing a revelation of the will of God for their nation, they had not kept the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.17-29">2:17-29</a>). Even the Gentiles had those among them who did by nature the things contained in the law and were acceptable because their consciences were pure (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.2.14-15">14-15</a>). For a Jew, keeping the law was insufficient unless he did so as a spiritual conviction, not as a mere legal requirement (v <a href="?bref=Rom.2.29">29</a>). God-fearing Gentiles who kept the essence of the law were a model for condemning the Jews who did not (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.2.14,27">14, 27</a>). However, the faithlessness of the chosen nation did not nullify the faithfulness of God to the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.3">3:3</a>). Although the Jew had every advantage over the Gentile, he was no better off because both had given themselves over to the power of sin (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.3.1, 9">1, 9</a>). The situation now was that “all have sinned [both Jew and Gentile] and fall short of the glory of God” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>God had therefore made Christ the Redeemer for the sins of the world (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-31">3:21-31</a>). The righteousness of God had been manifested apart from the law, through the “faith of Christ” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.3.22">22</a>; i.e., the faithfulness of Christ to the promise) and was available to the Gentile as well as Jew on the basis of personal faith. If this righteousness were available only through keeping the commandments of the law, as good and holy as it was (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.12">7:12</a>), then God was a God of Jews only and not of Gentiles, because the law was given to the Jews (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.29">3:29</a>). But God is also the God of the Gentiles and justifies the Jew on the basis of Christ’s faithfulness, and the Gentile on the basis of that same faithful act. Christ died for all who believe in him (v <a href="?bref=Rom.3.22">22</a>). Thus God’s righteousness was manifested through Christ’s faithfulness (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.3.3,22">3, 22</a>) and provides the basis of salvation for everyone who believes (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.9">5:9</a>).</p>
<p>Several times in the fourth chapter Paul insists that Abraham was the father of the Jews and of the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.4.11-12">11-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.4.16-18">16-18</a>). Christ’s faithfulness to the promise to Abraham that all nations (Gentiles) would be blessed through his seed (the descendants of Isaac) enabled Abraham to become the father of all nations, that is, of all who believe (v <a href="?bref=Rom.4.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>Having laid this broad theological base, Paul then argues that the impact of this justification or righteousness is that all believers experience salvation from the wrath of God and thereby experience peace (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1,9">5:1, 9</a>). Sin entered the world through the first transgression and passed to all people (v <a href="?bref=Rom.5.12">12</a>). Justification, however, was brought by the second Adam, Christ, who gives salvation to those who believe and receive the abundance of his grace (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.5.16-18">16-18</a>).</p>
<p>The function of the law was not to save the Jew. It was added because of transgressions (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.19">Gal 3:19</a>); it served to intensify the awareness of sin, present in all people, to the point of transgression of the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.20">Rom 5:20</a>). Sin used the law to deceive and destroy those who tried to keep it (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.11">7:11</a>). Paul had known what it was to covet before he knew the law, but when he became subject to the dictates and penalties of the law at age 12 or 13, the commandment against covetousness became even more demanding and destroyed him (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.11">7:11</a>). After the law was known, the penalty for its disobedience was fully applicable. Sin had been intensified because it became a transgression of the law. This very fact caused the need for greater grace, because where sin abounded, grace abounded all the more (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.20">5:20</a>). But it would be a gross perversion of what it means to live free from wrath, law, sin, and death to argue that one should therefore continue in sin that grace may abound (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.1">6:1</a>). Paul argues that those who have been justified and saved by Christ have died to the power of sin, which no longer has enslaving power (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.6.2,6">2, 6</a>). The key thought here is that sin (i.e., Satan—sin personified) cannot exercise dominion over the believer (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.6.9, 14">9, 14</a>); it cannot reign over him (v <a href="?bref=Rom.6.12">12</a>) and make him its slave (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.6.17, 20">17, 20</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to being liberated from God’s anger, the law, and sin, those who have been justified by faith have been freed from death, and God will give life to their mortal bodies through his Spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2,11">8:2, 11</a>). If they live according to the flesh, they will die; but if they live by the Spirit, they will enjoy a liberating life (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.8.6-13">6-13</a>). Not even death will be able to separate them from the love of Christ (v <a href="?bref=Rom.8.38">38</a>). The Spirit leads them and helps in their human infirmity, praying and interceding for them just as Christ does (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.8.14,26,34">14, 26, 34</a>).</p>
<p>Paul does not discuss the pragmatic application of these theological principles until chapter <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-21">12</a>. In between, he deals with the issue of how and why the Jews could have rejected the Messiah. How is it that they, of all people on earth, with the history of God’s personal involvement with them, could have rejected the Promised One? Chapters <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">9–11</a> focus on this important question.</p>
<p>Paul’s answer is fourfold. First, it was God’s purpose by election. He chose Israel, knowing what would happen in the future. These were physical Jews, Israelites, who enjoyed all the special relationships to God that an elect people could experience: sonship, glory, covenants, the law, worship, the promises, the patriarchs, and Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-5">9:1-5</a>). God had elected them just as he had chosen Jacob over Esau before either was born, just as he had hardened the heart of Pharaoh, just as the potter molds the clay into the vessel he desires (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.6-26">9:6-26</a>). It had nothing to do with their character or inherent worth; it was strictly a matter of God’s purpose for them. There is no injustice on God’s part in making this choice, because it was necessary in order for God to show his power through them so that his name might be proclaimed in all the earth. He had chosen Israel to serve his purposes just as he had chosen Pharaoh and Jacob and Moses; their salvation was a matter of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.1-40">Heb 11</a>). After all, only a remnant of Israel ever really believed (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.27-29">Rom 9:27-29</a>).</p>
<p>Second, Paul argues that Israel, in rejecting the Messiah and his gospel, is following a precedent that appears repeatedly throughout history (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.30-10.21">9:30–10:21</a>). The Jews did not seek righteousness by faith, and thus never found it. They based their righteousness on the law and thus stumbled over their own Messiah (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.30-33">9:30-33</a>).</p>
<p>Third, he argues that since a “remnant” of Israel has already believed the gospel, it is a clear indication that Israel as a whole will yet do so (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.1-16,26">11:1-16, 26</a>). So, even though he says that God has rejected Israel, he argues that God has not rejected them finally and irrevocably. He has broken them off the cultivated branch of the Abrahamic promise, but he has not rejected his people. The elect (remnant) obtained what it sought, but the rest were hardened for a period of time until they could be provoked to jealousy by the Gentiles’ inclusion into the kingdom. So Israel’s alienation is not necessarily final.</p>
<p>Fourth, Paul argues that since Israel’s rejection has been such a blessing for the inclusion of the Gentiles, the scenario of their conversion in large numbers would be like a resurrection from the dead. This argument runs throughout the rest of the chapter (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.17-36">11:17-36</a>). The Gentiles should not be haughty, because Israel stumbled so as to make their inclusion possible (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.11.17-19">17-19</a>). Israel did not stumble just so they could fall (v <a href="?bref=Rom.11.11">11</a>); their fall was a blessing to Gentiles and was a part of the purpose of God. And God, who broke them off for their unbelief, will be able to regraft them back into the tree from which they were cut off, if they do not persist in their unbelief.</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-16.27">12–16</a> deal with the pragmatic implications of Paul’s impressive arguments. Thus the chapter begins with “I appeal to you therefore . . .” (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.1">12:1</a>). What follows is a lengthy list of Christian virtues and responsibilities. Paul frequently includes advice in his letters so as to assist the young converts in their transition from paganism into the Judeo-Christian ethical and moral value system. He often even modifies some behavior patterns among Jewish converts. Chapter <a href="?bref=Rom.13.1-14">13</a> discusses the important relationship that should exist between Christians in the capital city of the Roman Empire and their government officials. They should recognize that civil government is, as such, ordained by God and has a right to exist even if those who hold the offices are corrupt. They are God’s servants to execute judgment on the disobedient (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.4">13:4</a>). Chapter <a href="?bref=Rom.14.1-23">14</a> encourages Christians enjoying freedom in Christ to live without influencing others to violate their own consciences in various matters, such as eating meat. Nor should those with weaker consciences try to restrict others who have found this precious freedom. Mutual love and respect is the mark of a true disciple of Christ. Chapter <a href="?bref=Rom.15.1-33">15</a> contains Paul’s travel plans and his understanding of his role as a priestly minister to Gentiles, offering their conversion to God symbolically on the altar at Jerusalem in the form of a large collection of money taken up among the Gentile churches. Chapter <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">16</a> closes typically with greetings and commendations from various individuals. Twenty-seven people are greeted by name.</p>

<p class="h1">ROME, City of</p>
<p class="fl">City in Italy founded, according to tradition, in 753 <span class="era">BC</span> on seven hills about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) from the mouth of the Tiber River. It was of no biblical interest until NT times. There are nine explicit references to the city in the NT (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.21">19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.11">23:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.14,16">28:14, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.7,15">Rom 1:7, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.17">2 Tm 1:17</a>), but Paul’s sojourn there and his letter to the Roman Christians, written probably from Corinth around <span class="era">AD</span> 57 and 58, make the imperial city of considerable interest to Bible readers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">In the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, Indo-European migrants moved into Europe and settled in the Italian peninsula. One group settled around the mouth of the Tiber River. A vigorous and more cultured group, the Etruscans from Asia Minor, occupied central Italy. At the time of Rome’s emergence in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the population of the Italian peninsula was mixed. The Latin-speaking enclave, which settled toward the mouth of the Tiber, were agriculturalists. The scattered groups formed leagues and communities to defend themselves against raiders. They built stockades on the hills to protect families and flocks while fighting off the raiders. From such beginnings Rome emerged as a dominant center with its focal point in the area of the seven hills (the Palatine, the Capitoline, the Aventine, the Caelian, the Esquiline, the Viminal, and the Quirinal). Traditionally these hills were considered to be seven in number; in fact, there are more than seven, although some are simply flat-topped spurs. The Tiber River winds in a large S-curve between the hills. At one point it divided to form an island where it was shallow enough to ford. The town that grew up there was linked by roads, north to the Etruscans, south to the Greek trading cities, west to the coast, and inland to the tribal areas on the highlands. Knowledge of early Rome is based largely on archaeological evidence from the remains of the simple forts and numerous burial sites in the area.</p>
<p>Rome developed politically in a remarkable fashion over the next 1,000 years. The loose association of the original chieftains, who comprised the earliest “senate,” gave place to domination by Etruscan kings who seem to have trained the people in discipline and obedience. They constructed numerous works, draining the forum area and making it a social, commercial, industrial, and political center. They built a temple for Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva on the Capitoline Hill as a common shrine for all the people. When the kings became autocratic, the Latin population rebelled and expelled the kings.</p>
<p>The republic was established in 510 <span class="era">BC</span>. This establishment marked the beginning of Rome’s remarkable expansion to the dimensions of a world empire. The population, which was now spread out over the hills and valleys, despite their tribal differences, united and solved political problems without bloodshed. Strictly speaking, the term “republican” should not be understood in any modern sense as indicating a kind of democracy. Rather, the ancient families (patricians) dominated the senate and constituted an oligarchy. This arrangement was useful for Rome at that time. The small city-state soon broke out of its confined area, overcame the Etruscans, and dominated the Greek cities to the south. The Romans then looked farther afield. In 273 <span class="era">BC</span> they made a treaty with the Ptolemies of Egypt. Before long, they expanded into North Africa, overcame the Carthaginians, pressed on into Spain, and developed ambitions to occupy the Middle East as well. Rome’s many conquests brought enormous wealth.</p>
<p>With geographical expansion came social changes in Italy. During the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, rich landowners bought out the small independent farmers, who subsequently drifted into Rome, landless and unemployed. Huge, overcrowded tenement houses appeared, which constituted creeping slums. Alongside this squalor there was evidence of vast wealth from Rome’s conquests in distant lands. In the capital, many fine buildings appeared. Pompey, who subdued and organized the East, did much to adorn the great capital.</p>
<p>The next stage in Rome’s political development came when the senate, the governing body of the republic, proved unable to control its more radical and violent members. As their political ambitions increased, aspiring leaders sought to gain popular support by granting privileges to the people without the concurrence of the senate. Civil strife broke out and plagued the last century of the republic. Military victories beyond Rome gave power to the generals. In the civil wars that followed, constitutional questions were decided by the power of the sword. Marius, Sulla, Pompey, Crassus, Julius Caesar, Antony, and Octavian were the real political forces in the land.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheRomanColosseum"/>
<p>By 27 <span class="era">BC</span>, Octavian emerged supreme and was given the title Augustus. Theoretically, a dual government existed between the senate and Augustus (the emperor), but a weak senate allowed the emperor to become the virtual ruler. As a result, Roman peace (<span class="ital">pax Romana</span>) reigned at home and abroad until well into the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. The emperors of the first century <span class="era">AD</span> cover the period of the life of Jesus and of the emerging church, and several are mentioned in the NT: Augustus (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1">Lk 2:1</a>), Tiberius (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>), Claudius (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">Acts 11:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">18:2</a>), and Nero, who is referred to without being explicitly named (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.10-12">Acts 25:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.27.24">27:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.16-17">2 Tm 4:16-17</a>).</p>
<p>The city of Rome was the capital of the empire and the home of the emperor, senators, administrators, military personnel, and priests. Augustus, the first of the emperors whose leadership and diplomatic endeavors gave peace to Rome after two civil wars and a century of strife, gave attention to the restoration and adornment of the city. He boasted that he found Rome built of brick and left it built of marble. His efforts at restoring Rome’s ancient religions led to the building of many temples. On the Palatine hill, Augustus united several houses already there into a palace for his own residence. A new and sumptuous temple of Apollo, surrounded by colonnades in which the emperor housed a large library, was erected near the palace. The palace itself overlooked an imposing group of new marble buildings in the valley below: a basilica business hall, a senate house, a temple of “the divine Julius,” a marble speaker’s platform, two impressive new forums, the forum of Caesar, and the forum of Augustus. Later emperors added to this splendor. Beyond the central forum area, the palaces of Tiberius and Caligula, various baths, arches, and theaters, the Circus Maximus, and the Circus Nero were built. The whole was enclosed by a wall built outside the old rampart of Servius. Several aqueducts brought water into the city, and significant roads from north, south, east, and west converged on the central city area.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RomesMilitaryPresenceinPalestine">Rome’s Military Presence in Palestine</p>
<p class="fl">With the military intervention of Pompey in the internal affairs of Judea in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome established its presence in Palestine. The census ordered by Augustus Caesar, affecting the eastern provinces as well as the rest of the Roman world (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-2">Lk 2:1-2</a>), was a vivid reminder. Roman military presence is amply reflected on the pages of the Gospels and Acts (e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.15.16">Mk 15:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.14">Lk 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.1-8">7:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.37">Acts 5:37</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT period, service in the legions was open to all Roman citizens. A professional volunteer army had replaced a conscripted militia. The permanent standing army was made up of legions recruited from the ranks of citizens. The legions were commanded by experienced officers of the rank of consul. Auxiliary forces were raised outside Italy, the inducement for enlistment being Roman citizenship for a soldier and his descendants after 25 years of service.</p>
<p>In the provinces supreme military command lay with the provincial governor or prefect. In Judea at the time of Jesus’ public ministry, Pontius Pilate was designated “prefect of Judea” in a Latin inscription found in Caesarea in 1961. At the official center for administration of Judea, Caesarea Maritima, one or more legions at the disposal of the governor would be garrisoned. On special occasions, particularly at the great Jewish festivals, when riots and disorders could be anticipated, the provincial governor would take up residence in Jerusalem some 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) to the south, accompanied by a substantial contingent of troops (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.13.1">Lk 13:1</a>).</p>
<p>Augustus established a standing army large enough to defend and pacify the empire. In 15 <span class="era">BC</span> there were 28 legions, each composed of some 5,000 foot soldiers plus a mounted bodyguard of 128 men. After three legions were destroyed in uprisings by fierce Germanic tribes in <span class="era">AD</span> 9, the number remained at 25 for some time. That suggests a standing army of about 125,000 legionaries in the first century.</p>
<p>Augustus was also responsible for establishing a permanent auxiliary army, almost the same size as the legionary army. The auxiliary forces, recruited from provincials who had not yet received Roman citizenship, included both cavalry and infantry. The cavalry was organized in squadrons, the infantry in cohorts of 1,000 under command of a military tribune (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.31-33">Acts 21:31-33</a>). When the apostle Paul was in Jerusalem, the tribune was Claudius Lysias, a man of Greek birth whose purchased Roman citizenship made possible his elevation to commander of an auxiliary cohort (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.28">22:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.26">23:26</a>). To send Paul from Jerusalem to Caesarea, Claudius could delegate a military escort of 200 soldiers commanded by two centurions, plus 70 mounted guards (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.23">23:23</a>), without dangerously weakening the strength of the fortress garrison.</p>
<p>A cohort was made up of either ten or five “centuries,” units consisting of 100 men under the command of a centurion whose duties resembled those of a modern army captain. Cornelius (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1">Acts 10:1</a>) was a Roman centurion assigned to one of the auxiliary cohorts in Judea. There is inscriptional evidence for the presence of his unit, “the Second Italian Cohort of Roman Citizens,” in Syria about <span class="era">AD</span> 69. Paul was sent to Rome in the custody of another centurion, Julius, who belonged to the Augustan or imperial cohort (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1">27:1</a>). The term Augustan was a title of honor sometimes bestowed on auxiliary troops. Julius was evidently a legionary centurion assigned to the corps of officer-couriers who maintained a communication service between the emperor and his provincial armies. He had a detachment of soldiers under his command on the voyage to Rome (v <a href="?bref=Acts.27.3">3</a>) and on arrival handed his prisoners over to the commander of the courier corps (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.16">28:16</a>). Probably all of the Roman centurions mentioned in the Gospels or Acts (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.5">Mt 8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">Mk 15:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.2">Lk 7:2</a>) were officers assigned to an auxiliary cohort.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChristiansinRome">Christians in Rome</p>
<p class="fl">It was to this magnificent city that Paul came under escort in March <span class="era">AD</span> 59. He found that the Christian church had already been established there. Indeed, he had already communicated with the Christians in his letter to the Romans early in 57. There was a considerable Jewish colony in Rome in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, descended from the large number of Jewish slaves brought to the city by Pompey after the capture of Jerusalem in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>. The emperor Claudius expelled Jews from Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 49, possibly when Jesus was proclaimed as Messiah in the synagogue. Who the preachers were is not known, but they were probably Christian travelers and traders. Paul’s Letter to the Romans was his exposition to the Gentile churches that had come into existence independently of him. His first known contact with the people of Rome was when he met Aquila and Priscilla at Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). This couple was expelled from Rome in the time of Claudius. Later, Paul hoped to visit Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.21">Acts 19:21</a>) on his way to Spain (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.24">Rom 15:24</a>). In his salutation he mentioned a considerable circle of Christians in Rome (ch <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">16</a>). The references to households in several places (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.16.5,10,11,14,15">5, 10, 11, 14, 15</a>) suggest that these were house churches of the Roman Christian church. During his captivity, Paul was a prisoner of Roman authorities, but he was able to meet the local leaders of the Jews, explain his experiences to them, and expound the gospel to them in person (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.16-31">Acts 28:16-31</a>).</p>
<p>In the book of Revelation, Rome is given a sinister significance. By the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, Rome had already drunk the “blood of the martyrs of Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.6">Rv 17:6</a>), a reference to early martyrs.</p>

<p class="h1">ROSETTA STONE*</p>
<p class="fl">The fame of this stone rests upon the part it played in providing the clue for deciphering ancient Egyptian inscriptions. Rosetta is the European name for the town Rashid in the vicinity of which the stone was discovered. It is a place near the mouth of the arm of the Nile flowing through the western delta toward the sea. A slab of black basalt—measuring about three feet, nine inches (1.1 meters) in length; two feet, four and a half inches (.7 meter) in width; and eleven inches (27.9 centimeters) thick—makes up the famous stone. Unfortunately, when discovered, it was in a damaged state, with the two top corners missing. It has been computed that the original stone size was at least 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) longer than it is now.</p>
<p>The discovery of the stone goes back to Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1799. There are two versions of the legend: according to one account it was found lying on the ground; according to the other, it was part of a wall that was ordered to be demolished for material to construct a fortification, later known as Fort Julian. The French officer, an engineer named Bouchard, who found the stone, recognized that the writing on it in three different scripts might be of great archaeological value. The bottom of the stone was in Greek lettering. Bouchard and his colleagues therefore assumed it to be the translation of the mysterious script at the top. The stone was later shown to Napoleon, who ordered copies to be sent to Europe for scholarly investigation. Two Frenchmen, Jean-Joseph Marcel and Remi Raige, soon recognized that the middle script, wedged between the hieroglyphic and Greek texts, was a cursive form of Egyptian writing. Scholars call it demotic writing, i.e., a popular, conventional form allowing for abbreviation, as distinct from the elaborate hieratic, i.e., priestly, writing. The stone in its present mutilated state consists of 14 lines of hieroglyphic text; 32 lines of demotic text; and 54 lines in Greek, of which the last 26 lines are marred at the ends. Fortunately, scholars were able to supplement a large portion of the missing hieroglyphic lines from inscriptions of two related texts. The Rev. Stephen Weston was the first to translate the Greek text into English. The French translation was accomplished by a man called “citizen Du Theil.” The demotic script was studied by Sylvester de Sacy and a Swedish diplomat by the name of Akerblad. It was the latter who first identified the demotic of all the proper names as they occur in the Greek text, plus the words “temples,” “Greeks,” and the third person of the masculine pronoun. An important clue to the puzzle was the discovery by Thomas Young, otherwise known for his theory of light, that ancient Egyptian writing was made up of phonetic signs. The first clue appeared with the identification of the name Cleopatra rendered in hieroglyphics. This gradually led to the identification of the name Ptolemy, except for the last few signs in the cartouche. It was assumed that the royal titles in the Greek text corresponded to these last hieroglyphs. By a combination of letters, scholars were able to translate the title “ever-living, beloved of Ptah.” Thomas Young’s discovery of the phonetical structure of the hieroglyphic script, together with the work of Jean-François Champollion, laid the foundations for unravelling the mystery of the ancient Egyptian inscriptions. By 1822 Thomas Young produced a list of hieroglyphic characters that were expanded and corrected by Champollion. The latter even worked out the grammar upon which the language was based. They thus laid the foundation for the work of later Egyptologists.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="RosettaStone"/>
<p>We now know that the stone has engraved upon it a decree passed by the priests of Egypt assembled at Memphis, in celebration of the coronation anniversary of Ptolemy V, Epiphanes, king of all Egypt. The date is probably spring, 196 <span class="era">BC</span>. Scholars think the original text was in Greek; the demotic and the hieroglyphic were renderings from this text. The opening lines were adulatory, listing the king’s titles and praising his piety and love of his people and country. This is followed by a list of benefactions conferred by the king for the good of the temples, the priesthood, and the general public, specifying amnesties to criminals, reduction of taxes, etc. In gratitude for the king’s bounty, the priestly council decided to “increase the ceremonial observances of honor which are paid to Ptolemy, the ever-living, in the temples.” To this end it was decided: (1) to make statues of Ptolemy, as savior of Egypt; (2) to place figures of Ptolemy in shrines next to the gods; (3) to place 10 double crowns of gold on his shrine; (4) to make the king’s birthday and coronation day public holidays; (5) to make the first five days of the month Thoth festive days when all people wore garlands; (6) to add to the priests the title “Priests of the beneficent god Ptolemy Epiphanus, who appears on earth”; (7) that citizens be allowed to borrow temple figures of Ptolemy for their house and for processions; and (8) that copies of the decree be cut upon slabs of basalt to be set up in temples “side by side with the statue of Ptolemy, the ever-living god.” The stone was brought to England as a result of the Capitulation Treaty of 1801 and is on view in the British Museum, London.</p>

<p class="h1">RULER</p>
<p class="fl">The term represents a number of different functions and translates 13 Hebrew and 3 Greek words. In a political sense, a ruler was one who exercised political control over a state (<a href="?bref=2Chr.7.18">2 Chr 7:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.20">Ps 105:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.1">Prv 23:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.28.15">28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.10.4">Eccl 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.5">Is 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.1">16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.7">49:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.26">Jer 33:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.46">51:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Mi 5:2</a>), or a state that exercised control over a subject people (<a href="?bref=Judg.15.11">Jgs 15:11</a>). The usual term for ruler was “king,” but because of its unsavory associations, many in Israel preferred the Hebrew term translated “leader,” meaning “one placed in front.” For example, Samuel rejected the former term but used the latter (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.16">1 Sm 9:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.14">13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.30">25:30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.2">2 Sm 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.21">6:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.8">7:8</a>). Other Hebrew words are translated “ruler” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. However, most modern translations prefer alternatives to this more generic term.</p>
<p>In the NT the Greek word regularly translated “ruler” refers to administrative or religious leaders (in various modern versions, see <a href="?bref=Matt.9.18,23">Mt 9:18, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.41">Lk 8:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.18">18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.35">23:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.20">24:20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.1">Jn 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.26,48">7:26, 48</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.31">12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.17">Acts 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.5,26">4:5, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.27,35">7:27, 35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.27">13:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.5">14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.19">16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.5">23:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.3">Rom 13:3</a>). <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Ephesians 6:12</a> mentions the rulers of the darkness of this world.</p>

<p class="h1">RULER OF THE SYNAGOGUE*</p>
<p class="fl">Senior official in a synagogue of NT times. It is generally understood that there was only one such official in any one synagogue.</p>
<p>His functions were to take care of the physical arrangements for the services of worship, to manage the maintenance of the building, and to determine who would be called to read from the Law and the Prophets or to conduct the prayers. The office was sometimes held for a specified period, sometimes for life.</p>
<p>The NT refers to this official on four different occasions. Jairus apparently was the ruler of a synagogue at Capernaum. When his daughter was ill, he went to Jesus for help, and Jesus raised her from the dead (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.18-26">Mt 9:18-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.21-43">Mk 5:21-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.41-56">Lk 8:41-56</a>). <a href="?bref=Luke.13.14">Luke 13:14</a> records the hostility of another ruler of a synagogue who objected to Jesus’ healing on the Sabbath after teaching in that synagogue.</p>
<p>On his missionary journeys Paul generally began his ministry in each place he visited by going to the synagogue. At Pisidian Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.15">Acts 13:15</a>), the rulers of the synagogue welcomed and encouraged him to preach the gospel and to return again the following week. Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue at Corinth, was converted (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.8">18:8</a>), and later Sosthenes (Crispus’s successor) was beaten by the mob after the Jews had made a charge against Paul before Gallio, the governor of Achaia.</p>

<p class="h2" id="AuthorandDate">Author and Date</p>
<p class="fl">The author of the book is unknown. The question of authorship has particular connection with the date of writing, and a few clues provide at least an educated guess. The book must have been written sometime after the beginning of David’s reign. The information in <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ruth 4:18-22</a>, which pertains to the historical significance of Ruth as David’s great-grandmother, bears this out. Since foreign marriages were not approved in the book of Ruth, it scarcely could have been written during the period in which Solomon began his policy of foreign marriages. Also, David’s close friendship with Moab might have prompted someone in his kingdom to write the book, thus presenting objective rationale for David’s actions (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.3-5">1 Sm 22:3-5</a>). Consequently, the author may have been someone close to David, possibly Samuel, Nathan, or Abiathar.</p>
<p>The time of the narrative is indicated by the opening statement: “In the days when the judges ruled. . . .” The dates of the judges probably comprise a period of about 300 years, beginning with the judgeship of Othniel and concluding with that of Samson, though Samuel also served as a judge. If the genealogical information is complete in <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ruth 4:18-22</a>, the events took place during the life of David’s great-grandfather and mark the birth of his grandfather. Allowing a 35-year generation span, the events would have taken place somewhere about the turn of the 11th century <span class="era">BC</span>, or about 100 years before David’s birth.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The book’s purpose is closely related to its date of composition. Assuming an early date, that is, one close to David’s lifetime, its principal thrust must be the authentication of the Davidic line. The book may be considered as a justification for including the godly Moabitess in the nation of Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Introduction (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.1-5">1:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Driven by famine, Elimelech, with his wife, Naomi, and his two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, cross the Jordan to stay for a period of time in Moab, where there is sufficient provision. The two sons, after marrying Moabite women, die, and their father dies as well. Naomi is left a widow, with two foreign daughters-in-law.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheStoryofRuth"/>
<p class="h3">Return to Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.6-22">1:6-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Hearing reports from Bethlehem that the famine has ended, Naomi makes preparations to return. Both of her daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth, accompany her for at least a portion of the journey. Probably thinking of the problems they might encounter as foreigners in Judah, Naomi strongly urges the girls to stay in their own land. Both of the young widows refuse, but Naomi presents the facts. First, she is not pregnant, so the chance of a younger brother fulfilling the levirate responsibility is not imminent. Second, she has no prospects of remarriage and consequently no prospect of further children. Then she also notes that even if the first two conditions were met immediately, the possibility of their waiting was impossible. Orpah is persuaded and kisses her mother-in-law good-bye.</p>
<p>But Ruth “clung to her” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.18">1:18</a>). The verb, having the connotation of being glued to something, is the same verb used of marriage (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>). Ruth demonstrated her serious intentions by making five commitments (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.16-17">Ru 1:16-17</a>). In essence, Ruth renounced her former life in order to gain a life that she considered of greater value. She decided to follow the God of Israel and his laws. Ruth’s appeal to the God of Israel was more than equal to Naomi’s pleas, and the two of them returned together.</p>
<p>Their arrival in Bethlehem was traumatic for Naomi. Having left Bethlehem with a husband and two sons, she returned empty. She told her friends to call her “Mara” (bitter). But she had returned at a propitious time, the beginning of the harvest season.</p>
<p class="h3">Reaping in the Fields of Boaz (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.1-23">2:1-23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first verse of the chapter provides the setting for the narrative that follows by introducing Boaz, a wealthy relative of Elimelech.</p>
<p>In the second verse, Ruth volunteered to glean the fields by following the reapers and picking up the small amounts left behind. Gleaners were also permitted to harvest the grain in the corners of the fields—a provision for the poor contained in the law (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-10">Lv 19:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>Ruth happened to come to the field of Boaz. When he visited this field, he noticed Ruth, inquired about her, and learned her identity. His overseer reported that she had industriously worked the fields from early morning until that time. Boaz, attracted to her because of her loyalty and concern for Naomi, graciously made additional provisions for her. She was given a favored position in reaping, directly behind the main body of reapers. Further, she was to receive water that had been drawn for her by the young men—an unorthodox arrangement.</p>
<p>Ruth, falling before Boaz in a gesture of great humility and respect, asked why she—as a foreigner—should receive such favor. Boaz gave two reasons: her kindness to her mother-in-law, and her spiritual insight, which led her to seek after Israel’s God, “under whose wings you have come to take refuge” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.12">Ru 2:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>She was also given a place at the reapers’ table and, upon Boaz’s orders, returned to the fields, this time to reap from the unharvested grain. At the end of the day she returned home to Naomi and told her of the day’s events. Naomi informed Ruth that Boaz had the right of redemption (see discussion below). Ruth returned to his fields until the end of the harvest season.</p>
<p class="h3">Relying upon the Kinsman (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.1-18">3:1-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Naomi advised Ruth to approach Boaz as a <span class="hebrew">go’el</span><span class="ital">,</span> or kinsman-redeemer. The plan suggested by Naomi seems peculiar, yet some thoughts may give a certain coloring to it. (1) Naomi seems to have believed that Boaz was the nearest kinsman, being ignorant of the yet nearer one (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.12">3:12</a>). Consequently, according to Israelite law (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5-19">Dt 25:5ff</a>.), it would be the duty of Boaz to marry Ruth to produce offspring, since her husband died. (2) The general presentation of Naomi’s character in this book is that of a God-fearing woman. It is certain that, however curious in its external form, there can be nothing counseled here that is repugnant to God’s law or shocking to a virtuous man such as Boaz. Otherwise, Naomi would have been frustrating her own purpose.</p>
<p>Boaz’s response to Ruth’s actions demonstrated his gentlemanly concerns for her. He explained to her that he was not the nearest kinsman but promised that he would take care of the necessary procedures the next day. Protecting her reputation, Boaz sent her home before daylight. Naomi predicted that Boaz would settle the matter that very day.</p>
<p class="h3">Redeeming the Inheritance (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.1-22">4:1-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Boaz went to the place of business, the city gate. The city gate area comprised the forum where the public affairs of the city were discussed. Boaz indicated that he wished to discuss a matter of business with the nearer kinsman. Ten of the city elders acted as witnesses. The first matter at hand was to deal with the issue of property. Boaz asked this nearer kinsman if he was willing to acquire property for Naomi. This is stated in the traditional stipulation: “Your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.5">4:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The nearer kinsman was unwilling to marry Ruth because this would inevitably cost him some financial loss, since he would have to divide his own property with any son of his born to Ruth. Thus he relinquished his rights by the custom of taking off his shoe. (The shoe was symbolic of the land rights that belonged to the inheritance.) So Boaz took the part of being the kinsman-redeemer. The marriage of Boaz and Ruth produced a son who, under Israel’s laws, was reckoned as Naomi’s child and heir.</p>

<p class="fl">First, the book of Ruth traces the lineage of Ruth to David. The completion of that line is in <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-25">Matthew 1</a> and finds its fulfillment in Jesus.</p>
<p>A second teaching is the beauty of God’s grace. A foreigner, even a Moabitess, can be linked with Israel’s blessing.</p>
<p>Theologically, the concept of kinsman-redeemer as a type of Messiah is clearly evident. He must be a blood relative, have the ability to purchase, be willing to buy the inheritance, and be willing to marry the widow of the deceased kinsman.</p>
<p>And finally, the love that Ruth showed to Naomi provides a pattern of devotion. The women of Bethlehem told Naomi, “Your daughter-in-law . . . loves you so much and [is] better to you than seven sons!” (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.15">4:15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
