<p class="h1">TAANACH</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Canaanite fortress cities bordering the plain of Esdraelon and the valley of Jezreel, including Jokneam, Megiddo, Ibleam, and Beth-shan. The modern site, about five miles (8 kilometers) southeast of Megiddo, retains the ancient name, Tell Taanak. Excavations reveal a 14th-century <span class="era">BC</span> wall made of huge, irregularly shaped rocks, with smaller stones set in the chinks, along with ruins of a local king’s palace. Some 40 cuneiform tablets of the 15th and 14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span> were unearthed, and from a later period, brick houses possibly of Israelite construction. A terra-cotta incense altar was found in a house of Israelite date.</p>
<p>Taanach is first mentioned in the Bible in a list of kings conquered by the Israelites on the west side of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.21">Jos 12:21</a>). In the tribal division of Palestine, Manasseh received Taanach (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.25">21:25</a>), which was also named as a Levitical city. Manasseh, however, was not able to capture Taanach or any of the other strong cities in its inheritance (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>).</p>
<p>After the defeat of Sisera, Deborah and Barak sang a song in which it was said that the fighting took place at Taanach near the waters of Megiddo (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.19">Jgs 5:19</a>). In the time of Solomon, Taanach was one of the towns mentioned in the enumeration of the administrative districts responsible for supplying monthly provisions for the king’s household (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). The last mention of Taanach in the Bible is in a genealogical list (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.29">1 Chr 7:29</a>), where the city is said to have belonged to Ephraim, along the borders of the Manassites.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Introduction">Introduction</p>
<p class="fl">The tabernacle was the precursor of the temple during most of the period between the formation of Israel at Sinai and its final establishment in the Promised Land in the early period of the monarchy. A portable sanctuary in keeping with the demand for easy mobility, it was the symbol of God’s presence with his people and, therefore, of his availability, as well as a place where his will was communicated. At an early period it was anticipated that, when peace and security had been secured, a permanent national shrine would be established (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.10-11">Dt 12:10-11</a>). This was not realized until the time of Solomon, when the temple was erected (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.10-13">2 Sm 7:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-5">1 Kgs 5:1-5</a>). Historical events, as well as the similarities in construction and underlying theology, illustrate the close connection between the tabernacle and temple.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheTabernacle"/>
<p class="h2" id="NamesfortheTabernacle">Names for the Tabernacle</p>
<p class="fl">Several words and descriptive phrases are used:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. “Sacred residence,” “sanctuary,“ or “holy place” (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.8">Ex 25:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.10.17-18">Lv 10:17-18</a>) derive from the verb “to be holy.”</p>
<p class="list">2. “The tent” occurs 19 times and is also found in expressions such as “the tent of the testimony” (<a href="?bref=Num.9.15">Nm 9:15</a>), “the tent of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.28-30">1 Kgs 2:28-30</a>), “the house of the tent” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.23">1 Chr 9:23</a>), and “the tent of meeting” (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.33.7">Ex 33:7</a>). The last name appears approximately 130 times. The word involves the concept of meeting by appointment and designates the tabernacle as the place where God met with Moses and his people to make known his will.</p>
<p class="list">3. “Dwelling place” is the literal meaning of “tabernacle.” In <a href="?bref=Exod.25.9">Exodus 25:9</a> the word indicates the whole tabernacle (including the outer court), but in <a href="?bref=Exod.26.1">Exodus 26:1</a> it refers to the tabernacle proper (that included the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies). A variant of this is “the tabernacle of the testimony” (<a href="?bref=Exod.38.21">Ex 38:21</a>; <span class="sc">nlt</span> “Tabernacle of the Covenant”), which, with other expressions like “the tent of the testimony,” stresses the presence of the two tablets of the law.</p>
<p class="list">4. “The house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.19">Ex 23:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The three-part construction of the tabernacle, composed of a general area and two restricted areas, was not unique. In other developed religions that included an organized priesthood there were three main levels of approach: one for all members of the community; one for the priests generally; and one for the chief religious leaders, which was an inner sanctuary, conceived as the dwelling place of the deity. Excavations of heathen sanctuaries in Palestine and Syria in the pre-Israelite period have revealed this type of divided sanctuary.</p>
<p>There is also widespread evidence of the use of portable, often complex, prefabricated structures during the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, usually as either staterooms for kings and other high dignitaries, or as sanctuaries. Rulers of settled communities used these structures when traveling to other areas within their kingdoms (e.g., Egypt and, to a lesser extent, Canaan). Also, nomadic or seminomadic peoples, such as the Midianites, used portable sanctuaries. In pre-Mosaic Egypt, craftsmen used techniques similar to those used in the construction of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTabernacleandItsFurniture">The Tabernacle and Its Furniture</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.1-40.38">Ex 25–40</a>) describes the tabernacle and its furnishings in detail. The materials used included items ranging from precious to common materials. Three metals are mentioned in descending order of importance: gold, copper, and silver. Gold alone was employed in the principal sanctuary furnishings. The total amount of metals used was approximately one ton (.9 metric ton) of gold, three of copper, and four of silver (<a href="?bref=Exod.38.24-31">38:24-31</a>). The relatively large amount of silver came from an offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.11-16">30:11-16</a>), which augmented the silver and gold already given by the Egyptians (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.35">12:35</a>). </p>
<p>Significantly, in God’s building specifications, the starting point was the furniture of the inner sanctuary (the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies). In the actual construction, this furniture was made after the tabernacle itself, presumably so that it could be immediately and adequately housed (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.9-27.19">Ex 25:9–27:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.36.8-37.28">36:8–37:28</a>).</p>
<p>The first item listed was the ark, the only furniture in the Holy of Holies. It was a wooden box sheathed in gold, approximately three and three-quarters feet (1.1 meters) long, with a width and height of two and a quarter feet (.7 meter). The supreme symbol of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, it was often called “the ark of the covenant of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.8">Dt 10:8</a>). Unlike contemporary arks in some neighboring countries, it contained no representation of the deity, only the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.16">Ex 25:16</a>), a jar of manna (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.33">16:33</a>), and Aaron’s rod (<a href="?bref=Num.17.10">Nm 17:10</a>)—all symbolic of various aspects of God’s provision (see <a href="?bref=Heb.9.4">Heb 9:4</a>).</p>
<p>The ark was transported by two poles that passed through rings attached to each lower corner (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.13-15">Ex 25:13-15</a>). These poles, left in place, projected underneath the veil into the Holy Place, serving as a reminder of the presence of the unseen ark.</p>
<p>Resting upon the ark was the mercy seat (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “atonement cover”), a rectangular slab of solid gold, to which were attached two cherubim. The inward-looking cherubim and the mercy seat formed a throne for the invisible God (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.22">Ex 25:22</a>), who is frequently described as enthroned above or upon the cherubim (<a href="?bref=Ps.80.1">Pss 80:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1">99:1</a>). The noun “mercy seat” comes from a verb meaning “to make atonement.” The mercy seat was sprinkled with blood at the climax of the annual Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.14">Lv 16:14</a>). The fact that the ark was placed <span class="ital">under</span> the mercy seat (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.21">Ex 25:21</a>) signifies that the law was under God’s protection and explains the references to the ark as his footstool (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.132.7">Ps 132:7</a>). Like the cherubim in the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.24">Gn 3:24</a>), those in the Holy of Holies probably had a similar protective function. In the ancient world, symbolic winged creatures like the cherubim were frequently placed as guardians of thrones and important buildings.</p>
<p>Like the ark, the portable table of the bread of the Presence (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.30">Ex 25:30</a>) was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. It was marginally smaller, with a length of three feet (.9 meter), a width of one and a half feet (.5 meter) and a height of two and a quarter feet (.7 meter). The various auxiliary vessels and implements are detailed (v <a href="?bref=Exod.25.29">29</a>); presumably the dishes would be used for carrying the bread. On each Sabbath day, 12 loaves, symbolizing God’s provision for the 12 tribes of Israel, were placed in two rows on the table (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.5-9">Lv 24:5-9</a>). The table was located in the Holy Place, on the north side.</p>
<p>On the south side was the seven-branched golden lampstand (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.31-39">Ex 25:31-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.17-24">37:17-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.40.24">40:24</a>). It was the most impressive item of furniture in the Holy Place; like the cherubim and the mercy seat, it was made of pure gold. Six golden branches, three on either side, extended from a central shaft, and the whole lampstand was ornamented with almond flowers. From the biblical evidence, it is not clear whether the lampstand gave continuous illumination (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.20">Ex 27:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.24.2">Lv 24:2</a>) or night light only (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.3">1 Sm 3:3</a> in most versions). <a href="?bref=Lev.24.4">Leviticus 24:4</a> strongly supports the former, and the reference in 1 Samuel probably reflects the laxity that had crept in during the period of the judges. In Scripture, the golden lampstand symbolizes the continuing witness of the covenant community (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.1-7">Zec 4:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1">Rv 2:1</a>). The precise attention to the smallest detail is well illustrated in the listing of the supplementary items, all made of pure gold, required for the servicing of the lamps. Without this precise attention, the light would soon grow dim, and the sanctuary itself be defiled by carbon deposits (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.38">Ex 25:38</a>). Moreover, only the best-quality olive oil was used, thus ensuring the brightest possible light (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.20">27:20</a>).</p>
<p>The altar of incense (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.1-10">Ex 30:1-10</a>) may have been deliberately played down to give greater prominence to the sacrificial altar in the outer court, which is frequently referred to as <span class="ital">“the</span> altar.” In order to distinguish the altar of incense from the bronze altar of sacrifice, the former was called “the golden altar” (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.5">40:5</a>). The altar of incense was located in the Holy Place, immediately opposite the ark in the Holy of Holies but just outside the veil, between the table of the bread of the Presence and the lampstand. Made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, it was 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) square and 3 feet (.9 meter) high, with horns and a golden molding around the four sides. Like the ark, it was made readily portable by the provision of rings and carrying poles. The altar was used for the offering of incense every morning and evening and for anointing the horns for the yearly atonement (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.7-10">30:7-10</a>). The incense from a special recipe was forbidden for secular use. Originally, incense indicated something that ascended from a sacrifice, a pleasing aroma to God. Incense acknowledged God in worship (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.11">Mal 1:11</a>) and at an early date signified the prayers of the godly (<a href="?bref=Ps.141.2">Ps 141:2</a>). It also concealed God from human eyes (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.13">Lv 16:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTabernacleProper">The Tabernacle Proper</p>
<p class="fl">The tabernacle was fundamentally a tent structure supported on a rigid framework. As with most of the other items, a triplication of detail underlines the importance of the tabernacle proper. The specifications are given in <a href="?bref=Exod.26.1-37">Exodus 26</a>, the construction in <a href="?bref=Exod.36.8-38">Exodus 36:8-38</a>, and the final erection in <a href="?bref=Exod.40.16-19">Exodus 40:16-19</a>. The overall dimensions were approximately 45 feet (13.7 meters) long, 15 feet (4.6 meters) wide, and 15 feet high.</p>
<p>The basic framework was a series of upright supports, each 15 feet (4.6 meters) high and 2½ feet (.7 meters) wide, and each standing on two silver bases (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.15-25">Ex 26:15-25</a>). Scholars used to think these supports or frames were solid planks of acacia wood, but most modern scholars accept that each comprised two upright sides connected by horizontal pieces like a ladder. Such sections would be considerably stronger, would keep their shape better, and would allow a view of the beautiful inner layer of curtains from within the sanctuary. On the south and north sides were 20 such frames, with 6 more at the western end. In addition, on the western side were two corner pieces to which all the walls were attached by clasps (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.26.23-25">23-25</a>). A series of bars, which passed through gold rings attached to each upright frame, provided further security and alignment (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.26.26-29">26-29</a>). There were five such bars on each of the three sides. The central one on both the south and the north sides extended the entire length; the other four probably extended halfway, so that each frame was effectively secured by three bars. All the wooden sections were sheathed in gold.</p>
<p>Over this framework several layers of coverings formed the top, sides, and back of the tabernacle. The first layer of ten linen curtains was dyed blue, purple, and scarlet, and embroidered with cherubim (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.1-6">Ex 26:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.36.8-13">36:8-13</a>). Each measured 42 feet by 6 feet (12.8 meters by 1.8 meters). Pairs joined along their length formed five sets of curtains. The two large curtains were themselves attached with 50 golden clasps that passed through a similar number of loops in each. Probably the curtains were stretched over the structure like a tablecloth.</p>
<p>Eleven curtains or tarpaulins of goat hair, each 45 feet by 6 feet (13.7 meters by 1.8 meters), formed the next layer. These were divided into two sets by joining together five and six curtains respectively, and were linked using a similar method as the under curtain, except that bronze clasps instead of gold were used. The extra length of the goat-hair tarpaulins provided an overlap to protect the under curtain, and the larger tarpaulin overlapped at both the front and the rear of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.7-9,12-13">Ex 26:7-9, 12-13</a>). Two further layers ensured complete weatherproofing, one of ram’s skins dyed red and one of goatskins.</p>
<p>A veil made of the same material as the under curtaining divided the sanctuary and hung under the golden clasps that joined the two curtains, supported by four pillars of acacia wood plated with gold and resting in silver bases. The cherubim on both the veil and the curtains were symbolic guardians of the sanctuary. The positioning of the veil made the Holy of Holies a perfect cube of 15 feet (4.6 meters). The layers of overlapping material and the attention given to the joints emphasizes the darkness of the innermost shrine. God was surrounded by darkness, carefully isolated from any unauthorized sight (<a href="?bref=Ps.97.2">Ps 97:2</a>). The Holy Place occupied an area 30 feet by 15 feet (9.1 meters by 4.6 meters), exactly twice the area of the Holy of Holies. A screen made from the same fabric as the main curtain stood between the Holy Place and the outer court and hung from golden hooks on five posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and resting on bronze sockets. There is no mention of embroidered seraphim on this section, which formed the tabernacle’s eastern wall.</p>
<p>The tabernacle, while probably having a somewhat squat appearance suggestive of strength, could be easily dismantled, transported, and reassembled. By the standards of that age, it was a fit dwelling place for God, constructed by the best human skills and the highest quality materials.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheOuterCourtandItsFurnishings">The Outer Court and Its Furnishings</p>
<p class="fl">The court of the tabernacle was a rectangle 150 feet (45.7 meters) long on the north and south sides and 75 feet (22.9 meters) wide on the east and west (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.9-18">Ex 27:9-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.9-19">38:9-19</a>). The tabernacle itself was at the western end. Curtains of fine-twined linen 7½ feet (2.3 meters) high screened the entire tabernacle area. In the eastern section, there was a central entrance, 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide. An embroidered curtain of the same height screened this doorway, which was probably recessed to facilitate entrance on either side. Silver rods supported all the curtains. These rods passed through silver hooks attached to the silver-plated posts that rested on bronze bases (<a href="?bref=Exod.38.17">38:17</a>).</p>
<p>The altar of burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.1-8">Ex 27:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.1-7">38:1-7</a>), at the eastern end of the court adjacent to the entrance (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.29">40:29</a>), was a reminder that there could be no approach to God except by the place of sacrifice. Seven feet (2.1 meters) square and four and a half feet (1.4 meters) high, it was small in comparison to the gigantic altar in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.1">2 Chr 4:1</a>). Basically, it was a hollow wooden framework overlaid with bronze, light enough to be carried on bronze-plated poles that passed through bronze rings at each corner. The grating (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.4-5">Ex 27:4-5</a>) was probably inside the altar at the middle, although some scholars believe that it extended around the lower, outer sides of the altar, to provide draft and to allow the sacrificial blood to flow to the base of the altar. The horns, possibly symbolizing the sacrificial victims, could be used to tether the animals about to be sacrificed. In Israel, a person could claim sanctuary by clinging to the horns of the altar (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.50">1 Kgs 1:50</a>), with the possible symbolism that he was offering himself as a sacrifice to God and so claiming his protection. The lower part of the altar may have been partly filled with earth to absorb the blood (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.24">Ex 20:24</a>). All the accessories were bronze: ash buckets, shovels for removing the ashes and filling the base with earth, basins for the blood, carcass hooks, and fire pans (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.3">27:3</a>).</p>
<p>No specifications concerning the size of the laver (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “washbasin”) have survived (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.17-20">Ex 30:17-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.38.8">38:8</a>). It was made from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the court. The laver stood between the altar of sacrifice and the tabernacle. Failure to wash at the laver prior to ministering was punishable by death—a solemn reminder of the need for cleanliness and obedience before undertaking any task for God. The bronze pedestal may have been merely a support for the laver, but possibly it incorporated a lower basin in which the priests could wash their feet.</p>

<p class="fl">The God-given specifications required skills beyond the capabilities of Moses and Aaron. Prominent in the construction were Bezalel and Oholiab (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.1-11">Ex 30:1-11</a>), with a large supporting group of experts, who must have learned their craftsmanship in Egypt. In a remarkable community effort, the Israelites gave so generously that the flow of gifts had to be stopped (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.20-24">35:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.36.4-7">36:4-7</a>). In addition, many gave of their special skills (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.25-29">35:25-29</a>).</p>
<p>When all the items had been completed and placed in position (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.1-33">Ex 40:1-33</a>), every piece except the mercy seat and the cherubim was anointed with special oil (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.22-33">30:22-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.40.9-11">40:9-11</a>) and symbolically consecrated for its particular function. The climax came when the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34">40:34</a>). He came to be present among his people, and thereafter the cloud by day and fire by night provided reassurance concerning his presence and guidance. Yet there could be no laxity in approaching him, and even Moses was excluded from the Holy of Holies. The tabernacle was erected exactly one year after the deliverance from Egypt and a mere nine months after the Sinai revelation.</p>
<p>Thereafter, when Israel camped, the Levites surrounded the tabernacle on three sides (<a href="?bref=Num.1.53">Nm 1:53</a>), with the families of Moses and Aaron occupying the remaining eastern side (<a href="?bref=Num.3.14-38">Nm 3:14-38</a>). This prevented any unauthorized intrusion into the sacred area. When the tabernacle was moved, the dismantlement was carefully regulated (<a href="?bref=Num.4.5-15">4:5-15</a>). The Kohathites were responsible for transporting the more sacred items, using the carrying poles; the Gershonites dealt with all the soft furnishings, the altar of sacrifice, and its accessories; and the Merarites carried the hard furnishings, such as the frames, bars, and bases. Even on the march, the tabernacle remained central, with six tribes preceding and the remaining six following (<a href="?bref=Num.2.1-34">Nm 2</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TABOR, Mount</p>
<p class="fl">Important hill in lower Galilee located in the northeast area of the Jezreel Valley. About six miles (9.7 kilometers) east of Nazareth, Tabor rises abruptly from the valley floor. Appearing more prominent than its height would indicate (1,929 feet, or 587.9 meters), it became an important geographical reference point in antiquity. It defined the western boundary of Issachar’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.22">Jos 19:22</a>) and was a useful navigation tool on the international coastal highway (the Via Maris) that passed through Megiddo in Galilee en route to Hazor. Its prominence invited comparison with Mt Hermon far to the north (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.12">Ps 89:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.46.18">Jer 46:18</a>).</p>
<p>In the OT, Mt Tabor is mentioned in the book of Judges when Deborah and Barak fight Sisera, the commander of a Canaanite army from Hazor (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-24">Jgs 4:1-24</a>). Barak’s troops from the nearby tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun met on Mt Tabor and at Deborah’s command launched a successful campaign against Sisera. Later in the same book, Mt Tabor was named as the place where Gideon finally confronted the Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, who had killed his brothers (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.18">8:18</a>).</p>
<p>Strategically located, Tabor’s moderately sized top, less than a half mile square (1.3 square kilometers), was easily fortified. During the OT kingdom period, shrines may been located there (see <a href="?bref=Hos.5.1">Hos 5:1</a>), but by the Hellenistic era, fortifications were built. The Ptolemies strengthened it, and by the time of Antiochus III (218 <span class="era">BC</span>), Tabor may have become the administrative center of the Jezreel Valley. The Roman era witnessed various conflicts on Mt Tabor. In the major Jewish war of <span class="era">AD</span> 66, Josephus fortified the hill with a large wall, which is still visible. Since the fourth century, Mt Tabor has been identified as the site of Jesus’ transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.2-13">Mk 9:2-13</a>). This is uncertain, however, since the NT fails to mention Mt Tabor by name. Helena, the mother of Constantine, was convinced that the Transfiguration did take place there, and in <span class="era">AD</span> 326 she built a church on the site. Other shrines, monasteries, and churches graced the hill until the 12th century, when everything was destroyed by the Arab conqueror Saladin. Today a Greek Orthodox monastery and a Latin basilica dating from the 19th century can be seen on the mountain.</p>

<p class="fl">Roman historian (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 55–120).</p>
<p>Little is known of Tacitus personally, but his writings present an invaluable picture of Roman life during the first century <span class="era">AD</span>. These works are <span class="ital">Dialogus de Oratoribus</span> (c. 77); <span class="ital">The Life of Agricola</span>, his father-in-law (c. 98); <span class="ital">Germania</span> (c. 98); <span class="ital">Histories</span> (c. 116); and <span class="ital">Annals</span> (c. 116). In this last-named work, Tacitus referred to the persecution of the Christians in Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 64, when the emperor Nero made them the scapegoats for the fire that he had ordered set. Though Tacitus believed the Christians to be innocent of the arson of which they were accused, he referred to their faith as “a detestable superstition,” named Christ as the founder of this sect, and stated that he was crucified “in the reign of Emperor Tiberius by the Procurator Pontius Pilate.” He further said that Nero accused the Roman Christians not only of arson but also of “hatred of the human race,” and that Nero had some of them thrown to dogs, others crucified, still others burned in the imperial garden. Thus Tacitus provides independent secular confirmation for some basic events recorded in the NT, including Jesus’ crucifixion.</p>

<p>Solomon built or rebuilt a number of cities, including store cities and cities for his horses and chariots.

<p>In Greek and Roman times, the city was known as Palmyra, whose ruins may be seen today.

<p class="h1">TALMUD*</p>
<p class="fl">Word meaning “to study,” “to learn.” It is a body of literature in Hebrew and Aramaic, covering interpretations of legal portions of the OT, as well as wise sayings from many rabbinical sources; it spans a time period from shortly after Ezra, about 400 <span class="era">BC</span>, until approximately the <span class="era">AD</span> 500s.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginandDevelopmentoftheOralLaw">Origin and Development of the Oral Law</p>
<p class="fl">Traditional Jews believe that a second law was given to Moses in addition to the first or written word; this second one was given orally, and handed down from generation to generation in oral form. The Talmud itself makes this claim for an early origin, and <span class="ital">Pirke Aboth</span> 1:1 states that it is attributed to Moses. Other scholars do not agree on this origin of the oral law and insist that it had its beginning and development after Ezra. For example, there is no mention by the preexilic prophets concerning a lapse from the oral law, but the messages of the prophets abound in warnings about abandoning the written revelation given to Moses, thereby indicating the absence of a body of oral tradition prior to the Babylonian exile.</p>
<p>In the period succeeding Ezra (“a scribe skilled in the law of Moses,” <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.6">Ezr 7:6</a>), teacher succeeded teacher in synagogues and schools, and their understanding of the OT was treasured and memorized. Across the centuries, many memorizing devices were employed to learn and remember the growing mass of opinions and interpretation. But eventually not even the best memory could retain all the available materials. It was finally necessary to compile a summary of all the essential teachings of preceding generations, and also to facilitate access for future generations to the immense treasure of thought, religious feeling, and wisdom for guidance and inspiration. The compilation is known as the Talmud, the basic repository of the oral law. Jewish people regard it as second to the Scriptures. A literature recognized as the genius of a national and religious creation, it has a profound influence upon the development of the Jewish world view.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RationaleforanOralLaw">Rationale for an Oral Law</p>
<p class="fl">With the cessation of the postexilic prophets, and with the continual development of the complexity of life in Israel and its relationships to the outer world, there arose a need for further elaboration of the laws of the Pentateuch. The oral law, at first, was intended to be helpful so that people could obey the written Word of God.</p>
<p>The oral law contained in the Talmud has a twofold function. First, it provided an interpretation of the written Law. According to the rabbis, this is necessary since the oral law makes it possible to observe the written Law. Without the former, it would be impossible to observe the latter. A good example is the concept of not working, as indicated by the biblical Sabbath law. Everyone knew that work was not done on the Sabbath. The rabbis contend, however, that it took the oral law to define what was meant by work.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the oral law is that it modifies and seeks to adapt the written Law to fit new conditions and circumstances. The oral law is supposed to make the written Law a viable document from generation to generation. Without this oral law, the written Law would become obsolete. Therefore, the oral law is necessary for observance of prohibitions as well as for stressing what is good Jewish devotion and loyalty.</p>
<p>It is true that every generation must face new social, political, and economic conditions, which make necessary a different application of the Word of God. But the Word of God cannot be changed in order to accommodate personal desires or interpret new problems in different ages. Something of this is apparent in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, when Jesus challenged the Jewish leaders for having preempted the Word of God by their oral traditions (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.9-13">Mk 7:9-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="BasicAntecedentstotheTalmud">Basic Antecedents to the Talmud</p>
<p class="fl">One of the earliest means for teaching oral law was a running commentary, or Midrash (“to expound”), of the biblical text. If the teaching handled the legal portions of the OT, then it was referred to as Midrash Halakah (the latter emphasized a way by which one walks or lives). When treating nonlegal, ethical, or devotional portions of the OT, then the opinions and understanding was called Midrash Haggadah (“narration”). Ezra and his trained associates were using the method of Midrash, upon the occasion of the completion of the Jerusalem wall in 444 <span class="era">BC</span>, when they “explained the law to the people while the people remained in their place. They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading” (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.7-8">Neh 8:7-8</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>). This kind of oral Midrash is the method followed by generations of teachers after Ezra, when the religious leaders were known as Soferim (“bookmen” or “scribes”), until about 200 <span class="era">BC</span>. Sometimes referred to as the “Great Synagogue,” these scholars provided teaching to “hedge” the revealed moral and ceremonial word so that Israel would never stray into idolatry or ignorance again. The Soferim were succeeded by the Hasidim (“pious ones”), who tried to maintain a high level of religious devotion. In turn, the Hasidim were succeeded by the Pharisees (“separated ones”) at about 128 <span class="era">BC</span>. Each of these groups contributed to the Midrash method. This material continued to increase and was transmitted orally. Succeeding generations learned these materials through continuous repetition. Therefore, the new method was called Mishnah (“repetition”), and the teachers of the Mishnah were known as Tannaim (“those who handed down orally”). Both Midrash and Mishnah existed side by side in ensuing generations. There came a time, however, when it was necessary to codify the oral law covered by Mishnah, since this became cumbersome to learn as a body of material. Eventually, this material was put into writing; it came to be known as Gemara (“completion”). The combination of Gemara and Mishnah constitute the Talmud.</p>

The son and consort of Ashtar (Inanna), Tammuz represented the annual vegetation cycle of death during the heat of summer and the rebirth of life with the coming of the fall and spring rains, as mythically recounted in the Akkadian poem “Inanna’s Descent into the Netherworld.” This rejuvenation of life and defeat of death was annually celebrated during the Babylonian New Year Festival. In the OT, the prophet Ezekiel sees in a vision women weeping for Tammuz at the north gate of the temple; this is a prophetic description of coming desecrations of the Lord’s house (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.14">Ez 8:14</a>).</p>
<p>In subsequent cultures following the Sumerian civilization (third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>), the Tammuz cult was carried on. It undoubtedly embodied the worship of Marduk of Babylon, Ashur of Assyria, Baal of Canaan, Attis of Phrygia, and Adonis of Syria (Aram) and Greece. Numerous liturgies and dirges have been found detailing Tammuz worship in ancient Mesopotamian culture. During the postexilic era, the fourth month of the Hebrew calendar was named Tammuz.</p>

<p class="h1">TARGUM*</p>
<p class="fl">An Aramaic translation of the OT. While technically this Hebrew word may be used to refer to any translation, <span class="hebrew">targum</span> commonly designates an Aramaic paraphrase or interpretive translation of a portion of the OT. Targums were of inestimable importance in the development of ancient Judaism. Jewish tradition holds that oral targums were extant in the time of Ezra; <a href="?bref=Neh.8.8">Nehemiah 8:8</a> is cited as supportive evidence.</p>
<p>At the time of the Babylonian exile (seven centuries before Christ), the language of the Jews was Hebrew. During the Captivity, Aramaic (the native tongue of the Babylonians) gradually replaced Hebrew as the language for the average Israelite. It thus became a practical necessity for Jewish scholars to translate the Scriptures into Aramaic. In the synagogue, a reading of an excerpt from the Law would be immediately followed by an oral translation of it. Eventually these translations or paraphrases were committed to writings, many of which still survive. The earliest known manuscript of a Targum is of the book of Job. Found in a cave of the Qumran community, it antedates the time of Christ by more than a century. The most important Targums are Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathon, in circulation by the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>. The former is a literal rendering of the Pentateuch; the latter is a freer interpretive version of the Prophets.</p>

<p>The Phoenicians, who were great sea voyagers, are often associated with Tarshish. Solomon used the sailors of Hiram, king of Tyre, for his fleet (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.21">2 Chr 9:21</a>).

<p class="fl">Birthplace and hometown of Saul (Paul) and the capital and chief city of the Roman province of Cilicia in Asia Minor. The city is mentioned only five times in the Bible, all in the book of Acts. After Saul’s conversion, the Lord directed Ananias to visit Saul; Ananias was told to ask for “a man of Tarsus named Saul” (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.11">Acts 9:11</a>). Then, when Saul returned to Jerusalem and a plot against his life was discovered, the Christians sent him to Tarsus (v <a href="?bref=Acts.9.30">30</a>). When Barnabas was serving in Syrian Antioch and needed help, he went to Tarsus to get Saul to work with him (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.25">11:25</a>). On the occasion of Paul’s rescue from the Jewish mob in the temple, the Roman tribune was concerned with Paul’s identity. Paul identified himself: “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia” (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.39">21:39</a>). In the defense he made before that angry multitude, speaking in Hebrew, he declared, “I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia” (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">22:3</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="PaulsReturntoTarsus"/>
<p>Tarsus was situated on the Cydnus River, 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) upstream from the Mediterranean Sea. The plain on which the city was built was very fertile, composed of alluvium carried down from the Taurus Mountains by the Cydnus and several other streams.</p>
<p>Although the river was navigable by small boats as far as Tarsus, the overland trade routes were the most important. Asia Minor was interlaced with roads long before the Romans came into the area. From the east there were two main routes, one of which began in northern Mesopotamia and went on to Carchemish or Aleppo, across the Amanus Pass. The other ran from Nineveh through Malatya and Antioch to the Syrian Gates. These two routes converged near Caesarea, 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) east of Tarsus. During the Roman Empire, “the Old Way to the East” ended at Babylon; coming westward it reached Aleppo, Syrian Antioch, Adana, Tarsus, the Cilician Gates, Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, Pisidian Antioch, Hierapolis, Colosse, Laodicea, Ephesus, Smyrna, and Troas, most of which are well known from the writings of Paul and from the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>Tarsus was an educational center; the university of Tarsus was famous for its scholarship, and Strabo indicated that Tarsus surpassed Athens, Alexandria, and other cities as a seat of learning. The university offered instruction in a wide range of studies; one of its specializations was the philosophy known as Stoicism, with which Paul was familiar. Although Paul does not say that he attended this institution, it has often been suggested that he studied there.</p>
<p>Tarsus was also a center for tent making, a vocation in which Paul had been trained (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.18.3">Acts 18:3</a>). The goats of the cold, snow-swept Taurus Mountains produced long hair that was made into a fabric particularly well suited for tents.</p>
<p>Tarsus has been described as “the heart of the Greco-Roman world” and “a meeting place of East and West.” From such an environment, a man like Saul of Tarsus, at home with Greek and Roman culture and educated at the feet of Gamaliel, was singularly well equipped to bring the gospel to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</p>

<p class="h1">TAX, TAXATION</p>
<p class="fl">Amount of money or goods that was extracted by the powerful nations from those whom they subjected. It commonly consisted of gold, silver, animals, produce, or forced labor. Taxes were also levied on the people both by their ruler and by the priesthood to pay for the maintenance of the temple. The term “tribute” is first used in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> in <a href="?bref=Gen.49.15">Genesis 49:15</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “forced labor”). In <a href="?bref=Num.31.28">Numbers 31:28</a> the spoils of battle were divided up to include a tribute or levy for the priesthood. For the Hebrews the temple tribute was originally a voluntary offering to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.10">Dt 16:10</a>) but later became a prescribed tax (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.24">Mt 17:24</a>).</p>
<p>Even in 2500 <span class="era">BC</span> in the city of Lagash, taxes were imposed on most facets of life, from the means of earning a livelihood, to marriage, divorce, and death. Like many ancient peoples, the Sumerians believed that the land belonged to the god and his representative the king, and that therefore a rent or levy was payable to the owner.</p>
<p>In Egypt, Joseph exacted a burdensome 20-percent tax in grain during the seven years of plenty, which alleviated the food shortages during the subsequent seven years of famine (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.25-42.5">Gn 41:25–42:5</a>). The tax on the crops was facilitated because in Egypt the ownership of the land was vested in the ruler.</p>
<p>Warrior kings, such as David, were able to maintain a healthy treasury without taxing their own people. The Canaanites and neighboring conquered peoples contributed great wealth to the treasury (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.6-14">2 Sm 8:6-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.25-31">1 Chr 27:25-31</a>), one list of which included silver, gold, bronze, 1,700 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. Forced labor was often required by David and his successors of aliens who remained within the boundaries of the Israelite kingdom (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.10">Jos 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.13">17:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.28">Jgs 1:28</a>).</p>
<p>Israel was probably first taxed during Solomon’s reign. In this more stable period, income came from tribute but not from booty. To maintain the grandeur of the court and the extensive building program, Solomon divided Israel into 12 areas, each under an officer, each of whom provided food and support for the king and his household for one month per year (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.7">1 Kgs 4:7</a>). Solomon also derived considerable income from levying custom duties on trading caravans that passed regularly through his kingdom. In addition to all of this, both foreigners and native Israelites were subject to forced labor for major building projects, especially for the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.13">1 Kgs 5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-21">9:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.7-8">2 Chr 8:7-8</a>). Handles from ten-gallon (37.9-liter) jars have been excavated, bearing a Hebrew stamp “to the king,” indicating that they formed part of a levy (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.10">2 Chr 2:10</a>).</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat was equally successful in taxing the people at home (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.5">2 Chr 17:5</a>) and maintaining the tribute from abroad, including silver and gold from the Philistines and 7,700 rams and 7,700 he-goats from the Arabs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.11-12">2 Chr 17:11-12</a>). As the power of the surrounding empires increased, Judah found itself forced to pay tribute. Sennacherib, king of Assyria, required 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold, which necessitated the removal of the gold from the temple doors (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.14-16">2 Kgs 18:14-16</a>). Approximately a century later, Pharaoh Neco required 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold from Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.33">23:33</a>), and shortly thereafter Nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasure from the temple and the royal palace, together with 10,000 captives, all the craftsmen, and 1,000 smiths, leaving few in Jerusalem except the poor (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.13-16">24:13-16</a>).</p>
<p>A definite, regular, organized tax system was instituted by the Persians, whose satraps, ruling each province, were required to make payment of fixed sums into the royal treasury (<a href="?bref=Esth.10.1">Est 10:1</a>). Tax exemption was introduced by Artaxerxes I, who stated that levies should not be collected from priests, Levites, or any others occupied in any way with the service of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.24">Ezr 7:24</a>). An additional tax was required for the maintenance of the governor’s household; it consisted of food, wine, and 40 shekels of silver (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.14-15">Neh 5:14-15</a>). As governor, Nehemiah did not claim this allowance of food because he considered the taxes already burdensome, causing the mortgaging of fields, vineyards, and houses “for the king’s tax.” Simultaneously, a levy was imposed upon the Jews for the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.6">4:6</a>). Darius was politically astute enough to encourage the rebuilding of the temple and to allow the Jews to use some of the royal tax money for this purpose (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.7-10">Ezr 6:7-10</a>).</p>
<p>Under the Seleucids, the Ptolemies, and subsequently the Romans, there was a change in the collection of taxes, whereby the office of tax collector was sold to the highest bidder, who in turn extracted the maximum payment from the people and built up his own wealth from the surplus generated. At times, the Jews were paying tithes for the maintenance of the temple, in addition to taxes of as much as one-third of the grain and half of the fruit grown. Excise, sales, and poll taxes were also collected.</p>
<p>After the extortionate level of tax imposed by Pompey, Julius Caesar reduced the amount paid by the Jews and exempted them from all payment in the sabbatical year. The provinces were considered booty by the Romans and were plundered physically by the army and financially by the tax collectors. In imperial times there was greater regulation of the tax system. An income tax was imposed on produce from the field and from artisans and tradesmen, as well as a poll tax, port duties, sales taxes, an auction tax, and an estate duty.</p>
<p>In addition to the taxes paid to foreign powers, all Jews worldwide who were 20 years of age and older (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.11-16">Ex 30:11-16</a>) were assessed a half-shekel per person annually as a tax to support the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.24">Mt 17:24</a>), a tax that continued to be levied even after the destruction of the temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. Jesus was questioned on the validity of this tax (v <a href="?bref=Matt.17.25">25</a>) as well as the lawfulness of payment of taxes to Rome (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.17">Mt 22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.14-15">Mk 12:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.22">Lk 20:22</a>). Despite Jesus’ famous reply—“render to Caesar that which is Caesar’s and to God that which is God’s” (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.21">Mt 22:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.17">Mk 12:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.25">Lk 20:25</a>)—he was still accused before Pilate of forbidding the Jews to give taxes to Caesar (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.2">Lk 23:2</a>). The early church also reinforced the legality of taxation as a legitimate responsibility required of all people (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.5-7">Rom 13:5-7</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TAX COLLECTOR</p>
<p class="fl">One who collected taxes for the government. In NT times the Romans collected a variety of taxes. Their own officers undertook some of this work but also delegated it to private individuals, Jews and others, who were required to return to the authorities an agreed-upon sum. Dishonest individuals collected far more than they were required to pay and became a hated group, especially the Jews who cheated fellow Jews. Zacchaeus, a Jew, was a “chief tax collector” who amassed considerable wealth in the Jericho area (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.2-10">Lk 19:2-10</a>). Such men were regarded as sinners and were often linked in the phrase “tax collectors and sinners” (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.10-11">Mt 9:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.19">11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.15-16">Mk 2:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.30">Lk 5:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.2-10">19:2-10</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TEACHER</p>
<p class="fl">Teachers conserved the values and academia of a nation and passed them on to each new generation. In OT times the first teachers were often parents (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.7,20-25">Dt 6:7, 20-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.19-21">11:19-21</a>). Leaders like Moses and Aaron were charged with teaching the people (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.11">Lv 10:11</a>), and later the priests and Levites had a teaching function (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.8">Dt 24:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.33.8-10">33:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.7-9">2 Chr 17:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.23">Ez 44:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.11">Mi 3:11</a>). God himself was thought of as a teacher (<a href="?bref=Ps.25.8,12">Pss 25:8, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.27.11">27:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.32.8">32:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.11">86:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.3">Is 2:3</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the Greek noun for “teacher” and the verb “to teach” are widely used. John the Baptist was called a teacher (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.12">Lk 3:12</a>). The term is used more than 30 times of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.2">5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.7.29">7:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.35">9:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.1">11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.21">Mk 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.13">2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.1-2">4:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.2,6,34">6:2, 6, 34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.15,31">Lk 4:15, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.3">5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.6">6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.59">Jn 6:59</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.14,28">7:14, 28</a>; etc.). People recognized his teaching as authoritative (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.29">Mt 7:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.22">Mk 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.32">Lk 4:32</a>). Even as a boy of 12 he conversed in a profound way with the teachers of the law in the temple (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.46">Lk 2:46</a>). These men were often associated with the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.17">5:17</a>). Gamaliel was a Pharisee and a teacher of the law (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.34">Acts 5:34</a>). The term “rabbi” was often used to denote teacher. The rabbi was held in great honor. In the early church the teacher was widely recognized (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.28-29">1 Cor 12:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.11">2 Tm 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.1">Jas 3:1</a>).</p>

  <title>Teacher of Righteousness*</title>

<p class="h1">TEACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS*</p>
<p class="fl">A designation of the founder of the Essene community at Qumran. The commentaries on biblical books found at Qumran provide us with some insight into the importance of the Teacher. He was a priest and as such was expected to officiate in the temple of Jerusalem. He separated himself with his followers from the established religion in Jerusalem when he began to teach an interpretation of the Law and the Prophets that differed from the established religious practices in Jerusalem. It is claimed that he received a special revelation from God: “to whom [the Teacher of Righteousness] God made known all the mysteries of the words of his servants the Prophets” (1QpHab 2:7-9). Based on the revelation he received, the Teacher taught another way of life and worship. Those who joined with him were discipled so that they might be saved from the day of judgment (1Qpap Micah 1:5).</p>
<p>The claims of the Teacher of Righteousness were exclusive. Only those who followed him by living in separation from corrupt Judaism in the desert were the elect. He felt himself called by God to establish a faithful remnant who would inherit the Abrahamic covenant. As the Teacher knew by revelation the mysteries of the future, he would assume that salvation was possible by faith in him: “This concerns all those who observe the Law in the House of Judah, whom he will deliver from the House of Judgment, because of their suffering and because of their faith in the Teacher of Righteousness” (1QpHab 8:1-3).</p>
<p>The priesthood of Jerusalem was upset with his teachings and exclusive claims. The Teacher was persecuted by one such person, known as the Wicked Priest. On the Day of Atonement, observed at Qumran according to a different calendar from that followed by the establishment, the Wicked Priest appeared at Qumran to force the devotees to defend themselves on their solemn day of rest (1QpHab 11:4-8). It is uncertain what happened to the Teacher of Righteousness. After his death, the Essene community continued to observe his teachings and to draw people dissatisfied with the established religion to its wilderness monastery at Qumran.</p>

<p class="fl">City about six miles (9.7 kilometers) southeast of Bethlehem on the edge of the Judean desert, and its residents. Tekoa may also be the name of a person, the son of Ashur of Judah’s tribe; “father” could mean founder or leader of Tekoa (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.24">1 Chr 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.5">4:5</a>). Tekoa does not appear on the list of cities given to Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.1-63">Jos 15</a>). In an oracle predicting the siege of Judah, Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.6.1">Jer 6:1</a>) makes a pun with the phrase “Sound the trumpet in Tekoa.” The Hebrew word for “sound” is spelled with the same consonants (but not vowels) as Tekoa.</p>
<p>Tekoa is located on the high ground between two watersheds, both of which flow eastward to the Dead Sea. The southern slopes climb off to the upper reaches of the Nahal Arugot, which eventually comes out at En-gedi. The northern slopes are drained by the Nahal Darga. The ridge between them is the Ascent (or Pass) of Ziz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.16">2 Chr 20:16</a>). Because Tekoa lies between the desert and the town on the marginal land just east of the main north-south watershed, the area around it came to be known as the desert of Tekoa (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.20">2 Chr 20:20</a>), a part of the larger desert of Judea. Tekoa marks the border where farming gives way to herding, explaining why Amos, a native of Tekoa, had two dimensions to his preprophetic career: a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore trees (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">Am 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.14">7:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TELL*</p>
<p class="fl">Arabic word (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">tel</span>) meaning an artificial mound composed of many layers of occupational debris, representing the ruins of successive cities, roughly like layers of a cake. The discerning of the strata, or building levels, is one of the biggest challenges of the field archaeologist. The levels are dated primarily by the pottery found in them.</p>
<p> Usually tells bear Arabic names, which sometimes have interesting or amusing meanings. Tell el Ful (Gibeah), the hometown of King Saul, means “the mound of the beans.” Tell Beit Mirsim translates into “the mound of the house of the fast camel driver.” Other modern names preserve the identity of ancient sites; for example, Tell Taanak is biblical Taanach; Tell Jezer is biblical Gezer.</p>
<p>There are numerous references to tells in the Bible, although in English tell may appear as “mound,” “heap,” or “heap of ruins.” The Lord commanded Israel that a city which practiced abominable idolatry should be burned and “be a heap forever” (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.16">Dt 13:16</a>). <a href="?bref=Josh.11.13">Joshua 11:13</a> states that Israel burned none of the cities that stood on mounds, except Hazor. Joshua burned Ai and made it “a heap of ruins for ever” (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.28">Jos 8:28</a>). In a prophecy against the Ammonites, Jeremiah said that Rabbah “shall become a desolate mound” (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.2">Jer 49:2</a>).</p>

The Jeremiah passage contains an obscure indication that the residents of Dedan, Tema, and Buz were among those who “cut the corners of their hair.” The practice of cutting the corners of the hair would distinguish them from the Jews, who left the corners of their hair uncut (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.27">Lv 19:27</a>). Like uncircumcision, the practice would identify the men of Tema as pagans.</p>

<p class="fl">David’s capture of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-9">2 Sm 5:6-9</a>) and his designation of it as the nation’s capital is one of the great masterstrokes of history. Occupied by the Jebusites, it was a pocket of neutral territory between the northern and southern sections of David’s united kingdom and was politically acceptable to both. Jerusalem was then established as the national religious center by the return of the ark, which had been largely neglected since its capture by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-17">2 Sm 6:1-17</a>). Henceforth, God’s choices of both David and Jerusalem (“Mount Zion”) were indissolubly linked (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.67-72">Ps 78:67-72</a>).</p>
<p>David’s great impulse was to build an adequate dwelling place for Israel’s God. The idea was initially approved by Nathan the prophet (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-3">2 Sm 7:1-3</a>), but God revealed otherwise to him, and he conveyed the divine purpose to David (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.4-17">4-17</a>). In a significant wordplay, David was informed that, while he was not to build a house (temple) for God, God would build a house (dynasty) for him. David was not the one to build a temple because of the numerous wars during his reign; the temple would instead be built by his son (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.3">1 Kgs 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.22.7-8">1 Chr 22:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.3">28:3</a>). Nevertheless, David enthusiastically amassed most of the necessary finances and materials and drew up the blueprints for the temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.22.3-5,14">1 Chr 22:3-5, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.2,11-19">28:2, 11-19</a>). He also purchased the temple site (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.25">21:25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="SolomonsTemple">Solomon’s Temple</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="SolomonSTemple"/>
<p class="h3">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Construction commenced in Solomon’s fourth year, about 966 <span class="era">BC</span>, and took seven years to complete (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1,38">1 Kgs 6:1, 38</a>). Everything necessary for the temple, including the workers, had been prepared by David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.21">1 Chr 28:21</a>). The temple evidently had first priority among Solomon’s building schemes, as he built his own palace later (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.1">1 Kgs 7:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Superintendents and Workforce</p>
<p class="fl">The principal architect for the bronze furnishings was Huram (Hebrew “Hiram”), whose father was a metal craftsman from Tyre and whose mother was an Israelite (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.13-14">1 Kgs 7:13-14</a>). Cedar for the temple came from Lebanon and was felled and transported by the skilled woodsmen of another Hiram—the king of Tyre, Solomon’s ally (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.5-9">5:5-9</a>). Thirty thousand Israelites, divided into three groups, were drafted to assist at Lebanon. Each group was on duty for one month in three. For the stonework, Solomon conscripted 153,600 foreigners resident in Israel to provide a self-contained group of carriers, stone cutters, and supervisors (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.15-17">15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.17-18">2 Chr 2:17-18</a>). Possibly the “men of Gebal,” with their specialized skills, formed yet another group (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.18">1 Kgs 5:18</a>). Building the temple was obviously a national project of immense size and effort. In order to preserve the sanctity of the site and to eliminate noise, the masonry and carpentry were not done at the temple site (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.7">6:7</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Description</p>
<p class="fl">The details given in the Bible are sufficiently clear for us to make a reasonably accurate description of the temple. The accounts in Kings and Chronicles are supplemented by Ezekiel’s depiction of the temple (see below), which was broadly based on his knowledge of the Jerusalem temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ez 40–48</a>).</p>
<p>The side rooms probably rested on a foundation or platform that was separate from the temple itself (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.5,10">1 Kgs 6:5, 10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.41.8-9">Ez 41:8-9</a>) and were arranged in three stories, each seven and a half feet (2.3 meters) high, extending around the whole building except for the porch side. Each successive story was one and a half feet (.5 meter) wider than the one below, these dimensions coinciding with the thickness of the side wall of the Holy Place. The ground floor rooms were seven and a half feet (2.3 meters) wide; the first story was nine feet (2.7 meters), and the second was ten and a half feet (3.2 meters). Access to the upper stories was possibly by winding staircases (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.8">1 Kgs 6:8</a>). There is some uncertainty concerning the location of the entrances; there may have been one on either side, but only one is mentioned (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.8">8</a>). As in Ezekiel’s temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.17,28">Ez 40:17, 28</a>), there were two adjacent courts, an inner and an outer (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.36">1 Kgs 6:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.12">7:12</a>), but no dimensions are given for these. The inner court, or “court of the priests,” being next to the temple itself, was also called “the upper court” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.9">2 Chr 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.36.10">Jer 36:10</a>). The wall of the inner court was made of three layers of hewn stone held together by a layer of cedar beams (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.36">1 Kgs 6:36</a>), and the doors of both courts were sheathed in bronze (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.9">2 Chr 4:9</a>). The palace buildings were within the outer court area, probably with a private passageway between the palace and the temple that was later closed during the reign of Ahaz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.9,12">2 Chr 4:9, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.18">2 Kgs 16:18</a>).</p>
<p>The temple itself was 90 feet (27.4 meters) long, 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide, and 45 feet (13.7 meters) high (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.2">1 Kgs 6:2</a>), with a porch or vestibule 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep stretching across the width. Probably the vestibule was on the east end of the temple, thus corresponding with the orientation of Ezekiel’s temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1">Ez 43:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.1">44:1</a>). The larger part of the main sanctuary, next to the porch, formed the Holy Place, which was 60 feet (18.3 meters) long (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.17">1 Kgs 6:17</a>). Beyond this was the innermost sanctuary, the Holy of Holies (or the “Most Holy Place“), which was a perfect cube of 30 feet (9.1 meters). All the interior walls were paneled with cedar decorated with flower patterns, cherubim, and palm trees, so that no masonry was visible. The walls of both inner and outer sanctuaries were “overlaid” (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.22">22</a>) with pure gold. Actually the gold decoration may have been inlaid, on the basis that a solid sheath of gold would spoil the natural beauty of the wood carving. The floor was made of cypress planks (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.15">15</a>). Narrow windows set high in the walls above the level of the three-storied outer chambers provided light in the Holy Place (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.4">4</a>). The ceiling was paneled with beams and planks of cedar. No detail is given about the exterior roofing, but probably the contemporary technique was employed, using a wooden, latticelike framework into which a waterproof, limestone plaster was packed and rolled.</p>
<p>The outer porch was apparently an open space, since no doors are mentioned. Access into the Holy Place was by double doors, both hinged to fold back on themselves, made of cypress and decorated in exactly the same way as the interior walls (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.34-35">34-35</a>). The doorposts were made of olive wood. Within the Holy Place was the altar of incense made of cedar overlaid with gold; it was placed centrally before the Holy of Holies. Also in the Holy Place were a table for the bread of the Presence of God, ten lampstands arranged in two groups of five on either side, and various utensils required for maintaining the priestly duties (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.48-50">1 Kgs 7:48-50</a>). All these were made or overlaid with gold. The ten tables, arranged five on each side, were presumably for the utensils and accessories (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.8">2 Chr 4:8</a>).</p>
<p>Between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies was a double door made of olive wood, carved with cherubim, palm trees, and flower patterns and overlaid with gold. Inside these doors, veiling still further the Holy of Holies, was a blue, purple, and crimson curtain, made of the finest fabrics and ornamented with cherubim (<a href="?bref=2Chr.3.14">2 Chr 3:14</a>).</p>
<p>In the Holy of Holies were two cherubim, each 15 feet (4.6 meters) high and made of olive wood covered with gold (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.23-28">1 Kgs 6:23-28</a>). Each wing measured seven and a half feet (2.3 meters). A wing of each touched the side walls; the other wings met at the center of the room. The divine throne had been considerably less impressive in the tabernacle, where a wing of each cherubim fused into the mercy seat above the ark (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.17-22">Ex 25:17-22</a>). In Solomon’s temple, the ark of the covenant was placed below the forward-facing cherubim, the symbolic protectors. The ark, the only major item surviving from the Mosaic tabernacle, still contained the tablets of the law, but the pot of manna and Aaron’s rod were missing (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.9">1 Kgs 8:9</a>).</p>
<p>Immediately outside the temple and on either side of the vestibule were two hollow bronze pillars (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.15-20">1 Kgs 7:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.15-17">2 Chr 3:15-17</a>). According to the book of Kings, these pillars were 27 feet (8.2 meters) high, with a circumference of 18 feet (5.5 meters). The metal itself was about four inches (10.2 centimeters) thick. The pillars were surmounted by bronze, lily-shaped capitals seven and a half feet (2.3 meters) high and six feet (1.8 meters) wide, intricately adorned with a chain latticework that supported two rows of pomegranates. The total weight must have been enormous, and their size is attested to by Jeremiah, who notes that the Babylonians had to break them in pieces before transporting them to Babylon (<a href="?bref=Jer.52.17,21-23">Jer 52:17, 21-23</a>).</p>
<p>The bronze altar of sacrifice in front of the vestibule is not listed in the specifications of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.1-51">1 Kings 7</a>. However, it is mentioned in the temple dedication and subsequently (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.22,54,64">1 Kgs 8:22, 54, 64</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.25">9:25</a>) and clearly stood in the inner court. Its dimensions were 30 feet (9.1 meters) square and 15 feet (4.6 meters) high (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.1">2 Chr 4:1</a>). In view of its weight, it was probably cast in sections at Solomon’s foundry in the Jordan Rift valley (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.17-18">17-18</a>) and then transported to the temple site for assembly.</p>
<p>Probably the most striking article in the inner court was the “molten (bronze) sea,” a huge, round tank made of bronze 3 inches (8 centimeters) thick, 7½ feet (2.3 meters) high, and 15 feet (4.6 meters) in diameter (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.23-26">1 Kgs 7:23-26</a>). Its rim flared out like a lily (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.2-5">2 Chr 4:2-5</a>). The tank was supported on 12 bronze oxen, four on each side, and had two rows of decoration, possibly gourds or pomegranates, under the brim. Its capacity was between 10,000 and 12,000 gallons (37,850–45,420 liters). The bronze sea was used for priestly ablutions (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.6">6</a>). Presumably this involved a platform of sorts, for the brim of this vast basin would have been about 15 feet (4.6 meters) above ground level.</p>
<p>Hiram also constructed ten large lavers, mounted on moveable stands and placed in two groups of five, on the north and south sides of the inner court (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.27-39">1 Kgs 7:27-39</a>). Basically the stands were bronze boxes, six feet (1.8 meters) square and four and a half feet (1.4 meters) high with a nine-inch (22.9-centimeter) rim around the top edge. Each corner was attached to braced posts to which the axles were fixed. The four-spoked wheels were 27 inches (68.6 centimeters) high. Into each stand there fitted a laver containing approximately 220 gallons (832.7 liters) of water, used for washing sacrificial animals (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.6">2 Chr 4:6</a>). Probably each was adjacent to one of the ten tables that would be used to flay and otherwise prepare the sacrifices (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.8">8</a>). Supplementary items, such as pots, shovels, and basins, all made of bronze, were also manufactured (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.40,45">1 Kgs 7:40, 45</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Dedication</p>
<p class="fl">Eleven months elapsed between the completion of the temple and its dedication (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.38">1 Kgs 6:38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.2">8:2</a>), during which time the major items of furniture were set in place. The dedication itself took place in the seventh month, presumably in connection with the Feast of Tabernacles and the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.23-36">Lv 23:23-36</a>). The ark of the covenant was brought into its final resting place (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.3-4">1 Kgs 8:3-4</a>), but the inner court proved inadequate for the vast numbers of beasts sacrificed (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.62-64">1 Kgs 8:62-64</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.7">2 Chr 7:7</a>).</p>
<p>The temple employed the most sophisticated building techniques of the age, and no expense had been spared in construction, ornamentation, or equipment. Yet Solomon readily confessed its utter inadequacy to house the eternal God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>). His prayer also underlined Israel’s propensity to forsake the Lord, contrasting the nation with God, who, though a just judge, was also merciful and faithful. The climax of the proceedings came when fire from heaven consumed the sacrifices and the shekinah glory filled the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.7.1-3">2 Chr 7:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Later History</p>
<p class="fl">Like most ancient shrines, the temple became a treasury for national wealth and as such was often the target for attack. Shishak of Egypt plundered it within five years of Solomon’s death (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-38">1 Kgs 14:25-38</a>). Shortly afterward, King Asa (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>) depleted its gold and silver treasures to buy Syrian help against his oppressor, Baasha (908–886 <span class="era">BC</span>), king of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.16-19">15:16-19</a>). Joash, the king of Judah (835–796 <span class="era">BC</span>) who was concealed in the temple from the vicious Athaliah during his youth (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1-21">2 Kgs 11</a>), made provision for its repair after protesting the priests’ embezzlement of gifts (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.4-16">12:4-16</a>). But after the death of Jehoiada, the high priest, Joash himself was adversely influenced by his nobles (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.15-19">2 Chr 24:15-19</a>). As punishment for his apostasy, the Lord allowed the Syrians to attack, and Joash used the temple treasures to buy them off (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.17-18">2 Kgs 12:17-18</a>). Hardly had provision for replacements been made, when Jehoash of Israel (798–782 <span class="era">BC</span>), having shattered the arrogant pride of Amaziah of Judah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>), again stripped the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.8-14">14:8-14</a>). Later, King Ahaz (735-715 <span class="era">BC</span>) used the remaining resources of the temple to enlist support from the Assyrians (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7-9">16:7-9</a>), though he eventually became completely subservient to them.</p>
<p> Then Hezekiah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>), one of the great reforming kings, thoroughly renovated the temple and restored worship after it had fallen into disuse during theclosing years of Ahaz (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1-19">2 Chr 29:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.31.9-21">31:9-21</a>). Manasseh (696–642 <span class="era">BC</span>), however, completely reversed his father’s policy, bringing the practices of Canaanite and Mesopotamian worship into the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.3-7">2 Kgs 21:3-7</a>). His conversion experience, which probably occurred late in his reign and resulted in certain reform measures in the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.12-19">2 Chr 33:12-19</a>), was not far-reaching enough to escape the final judgment that his reign was the dark spot of Judah’s history (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.10-16">2 Kgs 21:10-16</a>).</p>
<p>Manasseh’s grandson Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>), was the second great reforming king. He organized the repair of the temple in 622 <span class="era">BC</span>, during which the lost Book of the Law (almost certainly the book of Deuteronomy) was discovered (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.3-13">2 Kgs 22:3-13</a>). As a result, Josiah’s reformation gained a new dimension and sense of urgency (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.14-23.3">22:14–23:3</a>). The reformation included a thorough purge of all idolatrous elements from the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.4-12">23:4-12</a>) and the restoration of the traditional festivals. Sadly, however, Josiah’s reformation died with him, and Judah’s downward slide continued under the apostate Jehoiakim (609–598 <span class="era">BC</span>). It was probably during this time that Jeremiah preached his famous temple sermon foretelling its destruction (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.1-8.3">Jer 7:1–8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.26.1-19">26:1-19</a>), which alienated him from the religious leaders. In Nebuchadnezzar’s reprisal raid following Jehoiakim’s rebellion in 601 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-4">2 Kgs 24:1-4</a>), Jerusalem was captured (596 <span class="era">BC</span>) and many of the temple treasures were transported to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.7">2 Chr 36:7</a>). The temple itself appears to have escaped damage, but when Judah again rebelled under Zedekiah (597–586 <span class="era">BC</span>), the temple was demolished (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.8-10">2 Kgs 25:8-10</a>). The remaining temple treasures were taken away.</p>

<p class="h3">Construction</p>
<p class="fl">Although the temple was devastated, the site still remained as a place of pilgrimage during the exile (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.4-5">Jer 41:4-5</a>). In 538 <span class="era">BC</span> the Persian king, Cyrus, in pursuance of a liberal policy diametrically opposed to that of the earlier empires, permitted the Jews to return from exile. And he authorized the rebuilding of the temple, financing it from the Persian treasury.</p>
<p>In the book of Ezra, the decree of authorization has been preserved in two forms: the general proclamation (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezr 1:2-4</a>) and a more prosaic memorandum in the national archives indicating the main temple specifications and the amount of promised Persian help (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.1-5">6:1-5</a>). Probably only a minority of the Jews opted to leave the relative comforts of Mesopotamia for the dangers of a long journey to their desolated homeland. According to the book of Ezra, 42,360 dedicated individuals and their servants (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.64-65">2:64-65</a>) responded under the leadership of Sheshbazzar (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.8-11">1:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.14-16">5:14-16</a>) and Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2,8">3:2, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.2">4:2</a>). With great enthusiasm, the altar was rebuilt on the temple site and the traditional pattern of worship reestablished (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.1-6">3:1-6</a>). Utilizing the grant from Persia as well as their own freewill gifts (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.68-69">2:68-69</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.7">3:7</a>), the Jews began to plan the second temple and lay its foundations (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.7-13">3:7-13</a>). The initial impetus quickly died as a result of local opposition (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-4,24">4:1-4, 24</a>), selfish preoccupation, and crop failures (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.2-11">Hg 1:2-11</a>). In 520 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.24">Ezr 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">Zec 1:1</a>), inspired by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the Jews under Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest commenced rebuilding. Work continued in spite of official suspicion, if not direct opposition, and the temple was completed and dedicated in 515 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1-6.22">Ezr 5:1–6:22</a>).</p>
<p>Little is known of the physical features of Zerubbabel’s temple. The inference that it was vastly inferior to Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.3">Hg 2:3</a>) probably relates to an early stage in the building operation. In fact, the second temple stood for over 500 years. The dimensions noted in <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.3">Ezra 6:3</a> are incomplete; the new temple was no doubt about the same size as its predecessor and was probably built on the same foundation. The construction technique appears to have followed the method of the original, with layers of timber providing a framework for sections of masonry (v <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.4">4</a>). Clearly, there was auxiliary accommodation, probably like the side rooms of Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.8.29">Ezr 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.44">Neh 12:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.4-5">13:4-5</a>). If Persian aid was forthcoming as promised (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.8-12">Ezr 6:8-12</a>), the second temple was a more splendid, substantial structure than is generally supposed.</p>
<p class="h3">Later History</p>
<p class="fl">Several references in the Apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, rabbinic writings, and the historian Josephus help to illumine the history of the temple and give more detail on its structure and furnishings. Josephus, quoting from Hecateus of Abdera (fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>), states that the temple was a large building in an enclosure about 500 feet by 150 feet (152.4 meters by 45.7 meters), surrounded by a stone wall, with an altar of unhewn stones the same size as Solomon’s bronze altar (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.1">2 Chr 4:1</a>). Within the sanctuary was a golden altar of incense and a lampstand, the flame of which burned continually. Josephus also notes that Antiochus III (223–187 <span class="era">BC</span>) financially supported the temple when the Seleucids displaced the Ptolemies as masters of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Ben Sirach, early in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, commended Simon, the son of Onias the high priest, for his work in fortifying and repairing the temple area. First Maccabees provides valuable evidence of the fate of the temple during the oppression under Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 <span class="era">BC</span>). The books of the Maccabees recount the defilement of the altar of burnt offering (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.54">1 Macc 1:54</a>) and the plundering of the golden lampstand, altar of incense, table of offering, veil, and other treasures (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.15-16">2 Macc 5:15-16</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.2-4">6:2-4</a>). When the temple was recaptured and restored, the victorious Maccabees replaced the items taken by the Seleucids, except for the altar of sacrifice, which was considered so polluted that it was dismantled and replaced by a new one constructed of unhewn stone (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.36-61">1 Macc 4:36-61</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.1-9">2 Macc 10:1-9</a>). Clearly the temple area was used as a fortress, both in opposition to the Seleucid garrison that was maintained in Jerusalem in the Maccabean period and in the conflicts of the later Hasmonean period. When Pompey captured Jerusalem about 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, he entered the temple to assert his authority but took no plunder, thus showing respect for it.</p>
<p>The history of Zerubbabel’s temple closed when Herod, having carefully preserved it from any major damage when he gained control of Jerusalem with Roman aid in 37 <span class="era">BC</span>, began to dismantle it about 21 <span class="era">BC</span> in preparation for the construction of his own grand temple.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HerodsTemple">Herod’s Temple</p>
<p class="fl">Apart from over 100 references in the NT, our main sources of information about Herod’s temple come from the Jewish historian Josephus and from the Middoth (a section of the Jewish rabbinic writings). There are considerable differences in detail between the two, which rules out any dogmatic interpretation in attempted reconstructions. Since Josephus was contemporary with the temple (he was born about <span class="era">AD</span> 37 and died early in the second century), he is probably more reliable than the Middoth, which, dating from about <span class="era">AD</span> 150, appears to exaggerate occasionally. Archaeological research has been helpful in determining the positions of the outer walls and gates.</p>
<p>Herod’s motive in building his temple was political rather than religious. As an Idumean, he wished to placate his Jewish subjects by constructing a sanctuary as magnificent as Solomon’s. Possible fears that the site might be profaned, or that the existing temple might be demolished and never rebuilt, were allayed by the training of 1,000 priests as masons and the amassing of materials before the work commenced. Herod’s temple followed the tripartite plan of its predecessors, although its porch was much larger. It was built in the contemporary Greco-Roman architectural style and must therefore be regarded as distinct from Zerubbabel’s temple. Work began in 20 <span class="era">BC</span>, and while the main sanctuary was quickly erected (it was in full operation within ten years), the total project was not completed until <span class="era">AD</span> 64, only six years before it was destroyed by the Romans.</p>
<p>Herod first prepared the site by clearing and leveling an area approximately 500 yards (457.2 meters) from north to south and about 325 yards (297.2 meters) from east to west. This involved cutting away sections of rock in some areas and building up with rubble in others. Considerable sections of the enclosing wall, constructed on stone blocks averaging about 15 feet (4.6 meters) long by 4 feet (1.2 meters) high, still survive. Some of the stones in the corners of the south wall weigh up to 70 tons (63.5 metric tons).</p>
<p>The sanctuary itself seems to have been based on the same dimensions as Solomon’s temple. It was divided into the Holy Place, which was 60 feet (18.3 meters) long, 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide, and 60 feet high, and the Holy of Holies, which was 30 feet square. There was no furniture within the Holy of Holies, which was separated by a veil from the Holy Place. The Holy Place contained the seven-branch lampstand, the table for the bread of the Presence, and the incense altar. The main divergence from Solomon’s temple was the imposing porch, 150 feet (45.7 meters) in width and height. Outside was a doorway approximately 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide by 40 feet (12.2 meters) high, with an inner doorway about half that size leading into the sanctuary. By allowing empty rooms over the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place, there was a uniform roof height of 150 feet (45.7 meters). Golden spikes on the roof discouraged birds from alighting and defiling the structure. Like its predecessors, the temple was oriented toward the east and was surrounded on the other sides by three stories of rooms rising to a height of 60 feet (18.3 meters). The stone used was the local white stone, cut in huge blocks and highly polished.</p>
<p>Access to the porch was by a flight of 12 steps from the Court of the Priests. Centrally placed before the porch and 33 feet (10.1 meters) away was the altar of sacrifice. Made of unhewn stone, it was a multilevel construction 15 feet (4.6 meters) high and about 48 feet (14.6 meters) square at its base. Male Israelites were allowed into this area once a year, during the Feast of the Tabernacles, to walk around the altar of sacrifice. Otherwise, they were restricted to the Court of Israel. To the east of the Court of Israel, and separated from it by a flight of 15 steps and by the ornate Great Gate, made of Corinthian bronze, was the Court of the Women. Here the offertory chests for temple expenses were located (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.41-44">Mk 12:41-44</a>). The next court was the large, lower, outer Court of the Gentiles, which surrounded the inner courts and was separated from them by a balustrade and a series of warning notices. Two of these have been excavated, written in Latin and Greek and forbidding trespass by Gentiles into the inner areas, on pain of death. This outer court was widely used. Immediately inside its walls was a portico, supported by four rows of columns almost 40 feet (12.2 meters) high on the south side (the Royal Porch), and two rows on the other sides, the eastern portico known as “Solomon’s Porch” or “Solomon’s Colonnade.” Here is the area where the stalls of the money changers and merchants were set up, where the Sanhedrin met, and where Christ and the scribes taught and debated (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.27">Mk 11:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.46">Lk 2:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.47">19:47</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.23">Jn 10:23</a>). Here, too, the infant church met before it was rejected by a hostile Judaism (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.11">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.12">5:12</a>). Just to the northwest of the temple enclosure was the Fortress of Antonia, where the Roman governor resided while in Jerusalem, and where a Roman garrison was on hand to deal with disturbances (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.31-40">Acts 21:31-40</a>). Overlooking the temple area, it was separated from it by a wide moat. The high priest’s vestments were stored in the fortress as a symbol of Roman authority. Access to the Court of the Gentiles was by four gates in the west wall; two in the south wall, where the ground fell away steeply into the valley, a site often identified as the pinnacle of the temple (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.5">Mt 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.9">Lk 4:9</a>); and one gate in each of the east and north walls.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SignificanceoftheTempleintheOldTestament">Significance of the Temple in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The temple in Jerusalem functioned as the focal point of the tribal confederation. In spite of the attempt of Jeroboam I, the first king of the northern kingdom, to divert attention from Jerusalem by establishing shrines at Bethel and Dan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.26-30">1 Kgs 12:26-30</a>), Jerusalem never lost its preeminence. Naturally, both Hezekiah and Josiah sought to extend their reformation into the area of the northern tribes (<a href="?bref=2Chr.30.1-12">2 Chr 30:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.6-7">34:6-7</a>), and Jerusalem was a pilgrimage center for those areas even after its destruction (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.5">Jer 41:5</a>). The prophets foretold its destiny as the focal point of universal worship (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.1-4">Is 2:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>The temple was God’s dwelling place among his people. God’s presence, symbolized in the shekinah glory and the pillar of cloud, was associated with the tent of meeting (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.9-11">Ex 33:9-11</a>), with the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">40:34-38</a>), and finally with the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>). The paradox is that while God is completely unrestricted, the temple was considered a place for God to live forever (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.13,27">13, 27</a>). God had chosen Zion, as he had chosen David (<a href="?bref=Ps.68.15-18">Pss 68:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">76:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.67-72">78:67-72</a>), so the temple was regarded as God’s house (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.4">27:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.42.4">42:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-4">84:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Ezekiel’s Temple</p>
<p class="fl">Ezekiel’s detailed description of the ideal temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ez 40–48</a>) was not used as the blueprint for Zerubbabel’s temple. In fact, since Ezekiel must have been familiar with Solomon’s temple before his deportation in 597 <span class="era">BC</span>, his description is of greater help in determining uncertain details of the first temple. Ezekiel’s concern was to show the nature of pure worship, safeguarded from all contamination. This worship would allow the glory of God, which had departed from corrupted Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.9.3">9:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.4,18-19">10:4, 18-19</a>: <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.22-23">11:22-23</a>), to return so that Jerusalem could again be named “the Lord is there” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.1-5">43:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.35">48:35</a>). This thought, linked with Ezekiel’s vital concept of God’s Spirit indwelling his faithful worshipers (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.24-28">36:24-28</a>), anticipated the NT teaching of the believers becoming God’s temple.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SignificanceoftheTempleintheNewTestament">Significance of the Temple in the New Testament</p>
<p class="h3">Christ and the Temple</p>
<p class="fl">Christ showed considerable respect for the temple. When he was 12 years old, he entered into the rabbinic discussions in its porticoes and described it as his Father’s house (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.41-50">Lk 2:41-50</a>). To him “the house of God” was indwelt by God (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.4">Mt 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.21">23:21</a>). Although he twice cleansed it in righteous anger (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12-13">Mt 21:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.13-16">Jn 2:13-16</a>), he wept over the impending destruction of the city and temple (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.41-44">Lk 19:41-44</a>). He often taught there, but he was “greater than the temple” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.6">Mt 12:6</a>). When his presentation to Jerusalem as the predicted Messiah was rejected, in spite of attendant miracles, he foretold its inevitable destruction (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.9-15">Mt 21:9-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-2">24:1-2</a>). For a brief period after Pentecost, the early church used the temple as its meeting place, until mounting opposition drove believers from Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.12,21,42">Acts 5:12, 21, 42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.1">8:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Church as the Temple</p>
<p class="fl">The NT writers used two different Greek words to describe the temple: <span class="greek">naos</span> and <span class="greek">hieron</span><span class="ital">.</span> <span class="greek">Naos</span> refers to the actual sanctuary of the temple, the place of God’s dwelling. <span class="greek">Hieron</span> refers to the temple precincts as well as to the sanctuary. Generally speaking, <span class="greek">naos</span> was used to designate the inner section of the temple known as the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, whereas <span class="greek">hieron</span> included the outer court and the temple proper.</p>
<p>In Paul’s epistles the word <span class="greek">naos</span> appears six times (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16">2 Cor 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.21">Eph 2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.4">2 Thes 2:4</a>) and <span class="greek">hieron</span> once (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.13">1 Cor 9:13</a>). In these verses Paul maintains the distinction of definition noted above. When speaking of the actual physical temple, he used the word <span class="greek">hieron</span> to indicate the place where the priests offered up animal sacrifices on the altar (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.13">1 Cor 9:13</a>), which was situated in the outer court (see <a href="?bref=Exod.27.1-29.46">Ex 27–29</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.40.1-38">40</a>). And when Paul referred to the abominable act of the lawless one in usurping God’s place in the temple, he used the word <span class="greek">naos</span>—the word that designates the place of deity’s presence (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.4">2 Thes 2:4</a>).</p>
<p>In all the other Pauline passages, <span class="greek">naos</span> is used metaphorically—to depict a human habitation for the divine Spirit. In one instance the sanctuary image is used to describe the individual believer’s body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">1 Cor 6:19</a>); in every other instance the sanctuary depicts Christ’s body, the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.16">2 Cor 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.21">Eph 2:21</a>). Mistakenly, many readers think <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a> speaks of the individual, but according to the Greek text, it is unquestionably clear that Paul was speaking about the collective church (specifically, the church in Corinth).</p>
<p>When Paul told the church in Corinth that it was God’s sanctuary, they would have understood the image from their knowledge of pagan temples. But Paul probably had in mind the one temple in Jerusalem. The Gentiles had many gods with many temples in one city; the Jews had one God with only one temple in all of Israel. This helped to preserve unity among the Israelites. The Corinthians needed spiritual unity; they were fragmented due to their individual preferences (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.10-13">1 Cor 1:10-13</a>).</p>
<p>In Ephesians, Paul’s masterpiece on the church, he speaks of the local churches as living, organic entities that are all (compositely speaking) growing into a holy sanctuary in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.21">Eph 2:21</a>). Paul pictured each local church as providing God with a spiritual habitation in that locality (v <a href="?bref=Eph.2.22">22</a>) and as growing together with all the other churches into one holy, universal sanctuary for the Lord’s indwelling.</p>
<p class="h3">The Temple in John’s Revelation</p>
<p class="fl">In John’s revelation there is no material temple, even though he continues to use the imagery of Jerusalem and Mt Zion (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">Rv 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1">14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2,10,22">21:2, 10, 22</a>). Three interrelated ideas dominate. First is the concept of the church made up of martyrs, whose faithful members are God’s temple (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1">14:1</a>). This temple grows gradually as the number of martyrs increases (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.11">6:11</a>). Another aspect is the temple as the place of judgment (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.19">11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.15">14:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.15.5-16.1">15:5–16:1</a>). Finally, any temple in the new age is unnecessary, “for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.22">21:22</a>). The ultimate state will be God’s dwelling with his people—the eternal, spritual temple.</p>

Though Abram is listed first among his sons, it is likely that Abram was not the oldest. After Terah lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.26">Gn 11:26</a>). Stephen reports in the NT, however, that Abram left Haran after the death of his father, at which time Abram was 75 years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.4">Gn 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.4">Acts 7:4</a>). Terah died at the age of 205 (v <a href="?bref=Gen.11.32">Gn 11:32</a>), which suggests that Terah was at least 130 when Abram was born. Terah initiated the trip to Canaan, though he failed to go beyond Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31-32">Gn 11:31-32</a>). Abram was commanded there to leave his family and proceed to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1">12:1</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TERAPHIM*</p>
<p class="fl">Idols associated with pagan magical rites. In the OT, the term is often translated “household gods,” indicative of talismans, which were kept in family shrines (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.19,34">Gn 31:19, 34</a>). These were the idols that Rachel stole from her father and that occasioned Laban’s angry pursuit. Many have postulated that Laban’s anger reflects a Nuzian tradition where ownership of the household gods conferred inheritance rights to the owner. It is more likely that Rachel stole the teraphim simply to ensure good luck and safety.</p>
<p>Teraphim are also mentioned in connection with Micah’s attempt to establish a private priesthood (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.5">Jgs 17:5</a>). When the Danites moved to Laish, they stole Micah’s teraphim and ephod for oracular use (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.14-20,31">18:14-20, 31</a>). Teraphim were typically small idols but on occasion could be life-size as well. David escaped from Saul when Michal placed a teraphim in his bed as a dummy (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.13-16">1 Sm 19:13-16</a>). During Israel’s kingdom period, teraphim continued to be used in heretical cultic practices. Josiah attempted to rid the country of teraphim, wizards, and mediums, but his reforms appear to have been temporary (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.24">2 Kgs 23:24</a>). The prophets regularly condemned the use of teraphim, identifying them with heathen abominations (<a href="?bref=Ezek.21.21">Ez 21:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.4">Hos 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.2">Zec 10:2</a>).</p>

<p>From the speed with which the Jews were able to bring him forward, he was probably a professional attorney who practiced law regularly in the Roman court. His speech (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.2-8">Acts 24:2-8</a>) begins with a word of flattery for Felix.

<p class="h1">TEST</p>
<p class="fl">The process of proving one’s worth. When ascribed to God in his dealings with people, it means that God tests his peoples’ faith and moral character. When the word is used in a negative way, it means “to tempt”—that is, to entice, solicit, or provoke to sin. Both senses of the word could be applied to Jesus’ forty days of trial in the wilderness. He was tested by God and found faithful, while he was tempted by Satan and found sinless. The Spirit of God led Jesus into the wilderness to have his faith tried; but the agent in this trial was the wicked one, whose whole object was to seduce Jesus from his allegiance to God. It was temptation in the bad sense of the term. Yet Jesus did not give in to temptation; he passed the test (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">Heb 7:26</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TESTAMENT*</p>
<p class="fl">English word translated from the Greek signifying the covenantal administrations of God. Prior to Christ, this covenant is known as the Old Testament; under Christ’s administration, it is called the New Testament.</p>
<p>The Greek word, generally meaning “last will and testament,” contains certain legal characteristics that have important theological implications. First, a testament was not an agreement between parties (especially equals) but rather was exercised solely by the testator. Second, the testament became effective upon the death of the testator. Third, the testament was irrevocable.</p>
<p>When the OT was translated into Greek, the translators had the option of two words to translate the Hebrew word for “covenant.” One term carries the idea of a mutual agreement, and this often between equals. Since this would blur the divine initiative in God’s covenantal dealings with the patriarchs and with Israel, the other word was used. It connoted the self-determined action of the sovereign in making the covenant. The NT writers saw additional significance in the word “testament.” As a testament only becomes valid at the death of the testator, so the benefits of the new covenant are given to believers as a consequence of Christ’s death (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.15-22">Heb 9:15-22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TETRAGRAMMATON*</p>
<p class="fl">Term referring to the four consonants of one of the primary Hebrew names, for God (from Greek <span class="greek">tetra</span><span class="ital">,</span> “four,” and <span class="greek">gramma</span><span class="ital">,</span> “a letter of the alphabet”). These letters are the Hebrew equivalents of English Y (or J), H, W, and H. The most widely accepted meaning of the name is “the one who is, that is, the absolute and unchangeable one.” This is the name the Lord revealed to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.15">Ex 3:15</a>; cf. vv <a href="?bref=Exod.3.13-14">13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.56-58">Jn 8:56-58</a>). According to the Ten Commandments, the Jews were not to take this name in vain (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2,7">Ex 20:2, 7</a>). The Jews, therefore, regarded the name as so holy that they would not pronounce it but said instead <span class="hebrew">Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> “Lord.” Originally the text was written only with consonants, but when the scholars called Masoretes added the vowel points, they inserted the vowels for Adonai as a reminder not to read the sacred name. Non-Hebraists combined the vowels of Adonai with the consonants of JHWH, producing a new form, “Jehovah,” which does not exist in the Hebrew language. The correct pronunciation of the name must have been Yahweh, but most translations render it <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, using capital letters to distinguish it from other uses of the English word “Lord.”</p>

<p class="h1">TETRARCH*</p>
<p class="fl">Title of a class of Roman provincial officials. Tetrarchs were tributary princes who were not deemed important enough to be designated kings. The title was used in the Roman provinces of Thessaly, Galatia, and Syria. The origin of the title appears to have come from governors who ruled over a fourth part of a region or country, as was the case in Syria after the death of Herod the Great. By NT times, the etymological significance had diminished, so that the title merely designated secondary princes. Three tetrarchs are mentioned in the Bible. Luke reports that Herod (Antipas) was the tetrarch of Galilee, Philip was the tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanius was the tetrarch of Abilene (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). Of these, only Herod is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.1">Mt 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.19">Lk 3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.7">9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">Acts 13:1</a>). Herod’s greater significance is indicated by the fact that he is also referred to as “king” by his Jewish subjects (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.9">Mt 14:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.14">Mk 6:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">THEATER*</p>
<p class="fl">A flat, semicircular orchestra surrounded by an open-air auditorium, a Greek creation in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>. A chorus and actors performed in the orchestra, and the audience sat on the raised hillside before them. The earliest drama was tragedy, which celebrated the deeds of the god Dionysus and began with a sacrifice on the altar in the orchestra. Later, comedy developed.</p>
<p>The Golden Age of Athens (c. 450 <span class="era">BC</span>) was also the golden age of Greek drama; Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus wrote their dramas then. At that time audiences sat on the ground or on the wooden seats of the Theater of Dionysus in Athens, located on the south slope of the Acropolis. During the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, theaters in Greece were equipped with stone seats arranged in concentric tiers against a concave hillside, and the orchestra was paved.</p>
<p>By the second and first centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, great stone theaters were being built all over the Hellenistic East, and by that time a raised stage was constructed against the straight side of the semicircle of the orchestra. Action was now transferred to the stage. The auditorium of the typical theater consisted of three great bands of seats, which were divided into great wedges by the stairways that gave access to the seating. The elaborate stage was built in stone and had dressing and storage rooms. The orchestra was always paved.</p>
<p>Although initially the theater was intended for dramatic events, it came to be used for a variety of public meetings because it was one of the largest structures. For example, the great theater in Ephesus held about 25,000; the theater of Dionysus in Athens, about 17,000; and the south theater in Jerash of the Decapolis, about 5,000.</p>
<p>The theater should be distinguished from the odeum, which was shaped like a theater but was roofed. The odeum held only 1,000 or 2,000 people and was used primarily for musical events. It should also be distinguished from the amphitheater, which was a freestanding structure in stone, like the Colosseum of Rome and the arena of Verona, with an oval arena surrounded by concentric tiers of seats and used for gladiatorial combats, wild-beast hunts, and other such events. Only occasionally, as at Salamis in Cyprus and Caesarea in Palestine, were theaters free-standing stone structures; almost always they were built into the side of a hill.</p>
<p>By NT times, theaters were built in Greco-Roman towns all over the Mediterranean world. They even made their appearance in Palestine, as a result of the Hellenizing activities of Herod the Great, who constructed Greek-style theaters in Samaria, Caesarea, and Jerusalem.</p>
<p> Only one theater, that of Ephesus, figures specifically in the NT (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.29-41">Acts 19:29-41</a>).</p>

<p>Thebes was the capital of Egypt during most of the empire period (c. 1570–1100 <span class="era">BC</span>), when the Hebrews were in bondage in the land and when the exodus took place. By that time, Amon had become the chief god, and the Pharaohs lavished their wealth on the great temples of Amon at Thebes, hoping for the god’s help in overcoming their enemies.</p>
<p>The city of ancient Thebes was located on both the east bank of the Nile (“the side of the rising sun”) and the west bank (“the side of the setting sun”). The city had an estimated population of nearly one million at its height.</p>

  <title>Theocracy*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">THEOCRACY*</p>
<p class="fl">Form of government that acknowledges God alone as the highest political authority, whether or not he is represented by a human ruler such as a king. Thus, <a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> argues that a human king rules only as one designated for kingship by the Lord.</p>
<p>In ancient Israel, the concept of theocratic government developed through several historical stages. A fundamental theological conception of the sons of Israel in Egypt involved the belief that Yahweh, their special God, cared enough about their plight to become personally involved in redeeming them from slavery and establishing them in freedom from all earthly rulers (specifically the pharaoh). They would then be able to serve him alone (see <a href="?bref=Exod.3.7-10">Ex 3:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.1">9:1</a>). It is necessary to remember that the conditions of oppression described in Exodus were everyday features in the lives of Egyptian peasants. Living under the rulership of the pharaoh as a peasant implied oppression, unreasonable work assignments, loss of freedom and self-respect, and many other things. By contrast, life under the rulership of Yahweh came to signify freedom, justice, and equality.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Canaan, the young tribes encountered a system of kingship widely different from the Egyptian model but equally opprobrious. Ancient Canaanite rulers normally owned the city-state they governed, and rented out at least some of the land to their subjects. But the Israelites who occupied Canaan under Joshua were meant to be free inhabitants of the territory allotted to them and subservient to God alone.</p>
<p>In the period of the judges, the idea of theocracy continued to be expressed consistently and explicitly. The various groups comprising the “sons of Israel” were not welded together into a unified body by any external political structure. Rather, acceptance of the rulership of Yahweh alone continued to function as the foundational unifying element. Thus Gideon, when asked by some to accept kingship, could say in words acceptable to virtually all Israelites, “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> shall rule over you” (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.23">Jgs 8:23</a>).</p>
<p>In this period, human leadership became necessary from time to time as threats arose to one or more of the tribes. These judges were regularly described as “raised up” for the specific task of averting immediate danger, but more specifically to lead the people back to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.16">Jgs 2:16</a>). But no judge was believed to have brought victory to Israel by means of his personal abilities. Yahweh alone was credited with having won the battle; hence, he deserved and received the loyalty of Israel.</p>
<p>Samuel bridges the time of the judges and a new era of monarchy in Israel. Philistine social and military pressure was confronting the Israelite theocratic government with a challenge of enormous proportions. For roughly 200 years preceding Samuel, the Israelites and the Philistines had coexisted, if not peaceably, at least short of open warfare. During the career of Samuel, however, the Philistines inaugurated a policy of open aggression toward Israel aimed at conquest and expansion. The tribal confederacy, which for years had successfully defended one or more tribal groups, now appeared incapable of resisting the Philistines. A new governmental structure had clearly become necessary. In the minds of many influential Israelites, only a kingdom headed by a king could enable Israel to survive (see <a href="?bref=1Sam.8.5,19-20">1 Sm 8:5, 19-20</a>).</p>
<p>At this point the concept of theocracy received a severe test. Politically and militarily, a king appeared to be a wise and necessary choice. But the tradition of theocratic rule was deeply ingrained. Samuel viewed the desire for a king as rejection of the rulership of Yahweh (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.10-18">1 Sm 8:10-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.19">10:19</a>). On the other hand, he also appears to have received a prophetic word concerning Saul and the willingness of God to have him anointed as king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.27-10.1">9:27–10:1</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to his prophetic anointing, Saul also received a designation from “the spirit of God” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.6">1 Sm 11:6</a>), which closely paralleled the experiences of earlier judges. A third ingredient to Saul’s claim to kingship was added when the people acclaimed him following a military victory over the Ammonites. Apart from the clarity of the biblical tradition that two opinions of kingship were represented among Israelites, clearly God chose the king and revealed his choice through his messenger-prophet.</p>
<p>One day God’s people would no longer need a human king to rule them. This is portrayed in the book of Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ez 40–48</a>), in which God would rule his people through the Zadokite priesthood. This began to be implemented through the work of Haggai and Zechariah in 520 <span class="era">BC</span>. This was a particularly important feature of postexilic life and imparted a distinctive character to the Judean community. The work of Ezra made the theocracy normative for Judaism, and thereafter the priesthood exercised an important role in national life. Although the people were subjected to human rule under the Seleucids, they looked for the true king, a descendant of David. This man, the Messiah, would be the peaceful prince who would redeem Israel and bring the ancient covenantal values of justice, righteousness, and equity to fruition.</p>

However, the use of such generic titles is contrary to ordinary NT practice. Furthermore, the adjective “most excellent” generally designates an individual, particularly one of high rank. Paul addressed Festus as “most excellent,” and Claudius Lysias and Tertullus addressed Felix in the same manner (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.26">Acts 23:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.24.2-3">24:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.25">26:25</a>).

<p class="h2" id="Authors">Author(s)</p>
<p class="fl">The names of Paul, Silas (Greek “Silvanus”), and Timothy stand at the head of this letter, and as with other letters of Paul, his coworkers may have had some share in the writing of the letter. Often the plural pronouns “we” and “us” are retained, but “I, Paul” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.18">1 Thes 2:18</a>) and the singular pronoun in other places (see <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.5">3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.27">5:27</a>) show that the letter was essentially Paul’s. From the 19th century, a few scholars have questioned the Pauline authorship of the epistle, but without convincing reasons. The issues dealt with in this letter are manifestly issues faced by a church in the earliest stages of its existence. In the light of differences of expression between this and other Pauline letters, some have suggested that Silvanus or Timothy may have had a significant part in writing it, but that is uncertain. The early church had no doubts about the authorship of the letter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">The letter is addressed specifically to “the church of the Thessalonians” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1:1</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Acts.17.1-9">Acts 17:1-9</a>, Paul, with Silas (Silvanus) and Timothy, in the course of their missionary work in the Roman province of Macedonia, came from Philippi to Thessalonica. He went first, as was his custom, to the synagogue, and for three Sabbaths explained and proved from the Scriptures that the Christ should suffer and rise from the dead, declaring that Jesus was the Christ. Some Jews believed in Jesus as their Messiah, as did many God-fearing Greeks and several prominent women. But then the Jews stirred up opposition, so that Paul and his coworkers had to leave Thessalonica.</p>
<p>The actual time spent in Thessalonica was probably more than three weeks. In this letter Paul speaks of working for his support so as not to burden the Thessalonians (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.9">1 Thes 2:9</a>). References concerning his actions and attitudes among them imply a longer time, and <a href="?bref=Phil.4.16">Philippians 4:16</a> speaks of the Philippian Christians twice sending help to Paul in Thessalonica.</p>
<p>With Silas, and presumably Timothy, Paul went on to Berea, and his coworkers stayed there when Paul proceeded to Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.10-15">Acts 17:10-15</a>). When Timothy joined Paul at Athens, Paul sent Timothy to the Thessalonian Christians because he was concerned about how they were faring against their opposition. Timothy returned from Thessalonica with good news. Subsequently, Paul wrote this letter.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Acts.18.5">Acts 18:5</a> speaks of Timothy and Silas coming back from Macedonia to the apostle in Corinth. It was probably from Corinth, in the early part of his 18-month stay, that Paul wrote this letter. Since his work in Corinth can be approximately dated, this epistle was probably written early in the year 50, in all likelihood about a year after the first preaching of the gospel in Thessalonica.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Timothy’s report of the situation in Thessalonica motivated Paul to write this letter. Possibly Timothy brought a letter from the Thessalonians. This is suggested by the way Paul introduced certain subjects (“concerning brotherly love,” <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.9">4:9</a>; “concerning those who are asleep,” <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13">4:13</a>; “as to the times and the seasons,” <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1">5:1</a>) and then said that he didn’t need to write to them about these things. There were several reasons why Paul wrote to the Thessalonians:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. He wanted to commend the Thessalonian Christians for their faith and devotion, which had become widely known as an example to others (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.7-10">1:7-10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. He realized that the persecution he had faced in Thessalonica had continued for those he left behind, and he wanted to encourage them to stand fast (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.13-16">2:13-16</a>). He had feared for them but was delighted by the news of their steadfastness (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.1-10">3:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. There were those who had been misrepresenting the apostle in Thessalonica, perhaps the Jews who had initiated opposition to him when he was there (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.5">Acts 17:5</a>). They probably said that he was only a religious charlatan who had turned them away from their religion to his new faith, and they would never see him again. So the apostle reminded them of his methods and attitudes among them (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.1-12">1 Thes 2:1-12</a>) and told of his desires and plans to see them again (vv <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.17-18">17-18</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. It was necessary also to urge the Thessalonian Christians to live true to Christian standards, especially in the matter of sexual morality (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.1-8">4:1-8</a>). Other matters concerning their way of life and their relationships within the Christian fellowship also needed attention (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.9-12">4:9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.12-22">5:12-22</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Another major concern was to deal with the misconceptions of the Thessalonian Christians regarding those who had died and the second coming of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-18">4:13-18</a>). In relation to the future hope, there was also the question of “the times and the seasons,” and Paul repeated the teaching he had given when among them (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-11">5:1-11</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. There may also have been a danger of disunity that led the apostle to emphasize the fellowship of all believers (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.27">5:27</a>), to urge them not to disparage any spiritual gifts (vv <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.19-21">19-21</a>), and not to fail in respecting their leaders (v <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.12">12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Thanksgiving for the Thessalonians’ Response to the Gospel (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.2-10">1:2-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul prayed with gratitude that in their lives the fruits of faith, love, and hope were evident. The gospel had come to them in the power of the Holy Spirit, backed by the lives of its messengers. Even though receiving the gospel had involved suffering, their faith was an example to the Christians of the Roman provinces of Macedonia and Achaia. The Thessalonians had turned to the living God from idols, indicating that most of the believers were Gentiles rather than Jews.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Defense of His Ministry in Thessalonica (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.1-12">2:1-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Because of false accusations made about him, Paul found it necessary to defend his ministry. He had come from an experience of persecution in Philippi and had to face “great opposition” in Thessalonica. There was no guile in his trying to persuade them of the gospel’s truth. That gospel was entrusted to him by God, and his one desire was to communicate it to them in all integrity.</p>
<p class="h3">Their Acceptance of the Gospel (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.13-16">2:13-16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Thessalonians had accepted the gospel as “the word of God” and had suffered at the hands of their own people. Such persecutors must face the righteous judgment of God.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Continuing Concern for Them (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.17-20">2:17-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">If Paul’s accusers were saying that the Thessalonians would never see him again, he could give the assurance that he had often wanted to return but had been prevented. In saying “Satan hindered us,” Paul may have been referring to the incident in which Jason was compelled to promise the authorities that Paul would leave the city and not return (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.9">Acts 17:9</a>). In any case, the Thessalonian Christians are his “glory and joy.” His delight will be for them to stand “before our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming.”</p>
<p class="h3">Timothy’s Mission (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.1-5">3:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Fearful for the Thessalonian Christians facing persecution, Paul was willing to be left alone in the work of the gospel in Athens (see <a href="?bref=Acts.17.16-34">Acts 17:16-34</a>) and sent Timothy to encourage and support them in all their “afflictions.” Paul reiterated that Christians must always be prepared to face suffering.</p>
<p class="h3">The Good News That Timothy Brought (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.6-10">3:6-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul himself had continued to have “distress and affliction” in the gospel’s cause, but the news of their faith and love had revived his spirit and given him great cause for thanksgiving to God. He was praying that he might see them again and strengthen them further in faith.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Prayer (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.11-13">3:11-13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul’s prayer was that God might return him to his friends in Thessalonica, and that they might overflow with love and be established in holiness of life, so as to appear “blameless, and holy when [they] stand before God our Father on that day when our Lord Jesus comes with all those who belong to him” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.13">3:13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Exhortation to Purity of Life (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.1-8">4:1-8</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Holiness, not immorality, and sanctification, not uncleanness, are the Christian’s calling. Paul stressed this by saying that living in a contrary way demonstrated disregard for the Holy Spirit. Christian standards must be utterly different from the prevailing standards among the heathen who don’t know God. For example, sexual relationships must not be determined by lust but expressed in holiness and honor within the bonds of marriage.</p>
<p class="h3">Practical Exhortation (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.9-12">4:9-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Christian duty of mutual love had been demonstrated in Thessalonica, but Paul asked that it be shown in increasing measure. He exhorted them to live quietly and work for their living, and to not be dependent on others for support.</p>
<p class="h3">What Happened to Those Who Had Died Since Becoming Believers (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13-18">4:13-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Thessalonians may have written Paul about this issue. Paul told them they didn’t need to grieve, as those without hope, for their loved ones who had died. Those who are alive and those who have died will share together in the joy and triumph of the Lord’s return. Those who have died “will rise first”; those who are alive on earth will be caught up to meet their Master; then together, living and departed, “shall always be with the Lord.” With that assurance they can “comfort one another.”</p>
<p class="h3">Living in Readiness for the Lord’s Coming (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.1-11">5:1-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Perhaps further questions had been asked about “the times and the seasons” in relation to the Second Coming. Neither they nor anyone else knows the time. The Lord will come unexpectedly like “a thief in the night.” What matters, therefore, is that Christians should never be complacent but ready at all times, living as “children of the day,” so that, waking or sleeping, “we might live with him.”</p>
<p class="h3">Other Christian Duties (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.12-22">5:12-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the last main section of the letter, Paul urged the Thessalonian Christians to respect their leaders and to acknowledge their oversight; to live at peace, in unity; to do and encourage all that is good. The will of God for the Christian life is constant joy, prayer, and praise. The Holy Spirit is not to be quenched, the gift of prophecy is not to be despised, but all things claiming to be of God must be tested, so that the good can be embraced and the evil rejected.</p>
<p class="h3">Conclusion (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23-28">5:23-28</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The final prayer of the letter is for their holiness of life, so that they may stand “blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” “Pray for us” is the apostle’s plea. Greetings are to be passed on and the letter read to all the believers.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Authors">Author(s)</p>
<p class="fl">This letter, like 1 Thessalonians, begins with the names of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, and like that letter often retains the plural pronouns “we” and “us” but also has the singular “I” (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.5">2 Thes 2:5</a>). The end of the letter reads: “Now here is my greeting, which I write with my own hand—<span class="sc">Paul</span>. I do this at the end of all my letters to prove that they really are from me” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.17">3:17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Some scholars have questioned Paul’s authorship, mostly because of the difference between the teaching about the future in this letter and that in 1 Thessalonians. In the light of the words of <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.17">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>, the first letter would have to be seen as a blatant forgery. And this is not the case. The early church did not question Paul’s authorship of both.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">In the first verse, exactly as in 1 Thessalonians, the letter is addressed “to the church of the Thessalonians.” Unlike 1 Thessalonians, this letter provides us with no other personal details of the movements of Paul and his coworkers. Thus, there is no direct evidence of the date and place of the letter.</p>
<p>Just as the difference between the teaching of this epistle from that of 1 Thessalonians has led some to question its Pauline authorship, so it has led others to a variety of explanations for its date and destination. These include:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. It was written much later than 1 Thessalonians. This is improbable because both Silas and Timothy were still with Paul.</p>
<p class="list">2. It was written earlier than 1 Thessalonians. In <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.15">2:15</a>, however, there is a reference to a letter written previously to Thessalonica, and the early church from the second century certainly called this 2 Thessalonians.</p>
<p class="list">3. It was written to Jewish Christians in Thessalonica, while 1 Thessalonians was written to gentile Christians. This, however, is most unlikely, as the apostle who had such concern for the unity of all Christians in one place (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-3.23">1 Cor 1–3</a>) and especially for the unity of Jewish and gentile Christians (see <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-22">Eph 2:11-22</a>) could hardly have done such a thing.</p>
<p class="list">4. It was written to Christians in a different place (Berea or Philippi), and then came to be in the hands of the Thessalonian Christians. There is no evidence to support the idea that the letter was sent anywhere but to Thessalonica.</p>
<p class="sp">When this epistle was written, Paul had the same coworkers with him as when he wrote 1 Thessalonians (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.1">2 Thes 1:1</a>). This indicates that probably a short time after writing 1 Thessalonians, Paul heard of further problems being faced by the Christians in Thessalonica, and in his concern for them, he wrote this second letter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">There were three main concerns in the mind of the apostle Paul as he wrote this letter.</p>
<p>As in all his letters, he wanted to encourage his readers to stand firm in their faith (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.15">2:15</a>). He could thank God for his work in their lives (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.3">1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13">2:13</a>), made evident by their faith, love, and steadfastness in the face of persecutions (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.4">1:4</a>). Paul assured them of the righting of wrongs in the ultimate judgment of God. Their task was to glorify the name of Jesus by their lives; then at his coming he would be glorified in his faithful people (vv <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.5-12">5-12</a>).</p>
<p>There was false teaching, even purportedly from Paul, that the Day of the Lord had already come (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.2">2:2</a>). The apostle rejected this teaching by saying that certain things must take place prior to the Second Coming. There must be a still greater manifestation of evil in the person of one called “the man of lawlessness” or “the son of perdition.” This one will reject all true worship, show signs and wonders, and proclaim himself to be God. At present there is a restraining influence. The time will come, however, when the lawless one will be revealed. Then the Lord himself will come and “the lawless one” will be conquered and destroyed. This teaching (vv <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-12">1-12</a>) is similar to that in the Gospels about the Antichrist or antichrists, claiming to be Christ, deceiving people by signs and wonders (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.5,23-26">Mt 24:5, 23-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.5-6,20-23">Mk 13:5-6, 20-23</a>). In 1 Thessalonians, Paul emphasized that the time of the Lord’s coming is unknown, and believers must be ready for him at any time. Here, in opposition to the idea that the Lord had already come, Paul spoke of those things that must take place before the Lord’s coming. Both of these aspects were also presented by Jesus when he taught about the future (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-51">Mt 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.1-38">Lk 21</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, the problem of laziness in the Christian community (referred to in <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.11">1 Thes 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.14">5:14</a>) remained, and probably had increased. Paul had to refer again to the example that he and his coworkers had given to them—they had worked with their own hands to earn a living instead of depending on those to whom they brought the gospel. Paul had a simple dictum that he applied: “If any one will not work, let him not eat” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.10">2 Thess 3:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Thanksgiving for Their Christian Lives (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.3-4">1:3-4</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul praised God for the Thessalonians’ growing faith, increasing love, and endurance of persecution.</p>
<p class="h3">A Reversal of Persecutors and Persecuted (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.5-10">1:5-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">At that time the Thessalonian Christians were having to suffer, but their persecutors would have to face the just judgment of God at the coming of the Lord Jesus “with his mighty angels.” Those who reject the knowledge of God and the salvation offered in the gospel must “suffer the punishment of eternal destruction.” His people will experience that glory of his coming and will realize that they have not believed or suffered in vain.</p>
<p class="h3">Prayer That the Lord Jesus Will Be Glorified (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.11-12">1:11-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This is Paul’s prayer for the Thessalonian Christians—a life worthy of their calling, the fulfilling of their resolves, and by the grace of God, that the name of Christ would be glorified in them.</p>
<p class="h3">Events That Must Precede Christ’s Second Coming (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-12">2:1-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this section, Paul deals with the false teaching that the Day of the Lord had already come. Before this event, there must be the revealing of “the man of lawlessness,” otherwise called the Antichrist (though it may be noted that the NT also speaks of “antichrists” and “the spirit of antichrist”—<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18">1 Jn 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">4:3</a>). Paul said, “That day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness is revealed” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3">2 Thes 2:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>At the present time, the mystery of lawlessness is restrained (vv <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.6-7">6-7</a>). But in the future—just prior to the Lord’s coming—the restraint will be taken away. In other words, all hell will break loose. Christians must be prepared for a supreme manifestation of evil “with pretended signs and wonders” (v <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.9">9</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) by which many will be deceived. The coming of Christ will mean the overthrow of evil and the judgment of those who oppose the truth and take pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="h3">Renewed Thanksgiving, Encouragement, and Prayer (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13-3.5">2:13–3:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Subsequent to the discussion of the power of evil in people’s lives, Paul gives thanks for the work of the Spirit of God in the lives of the Thessalonian Christians. He encourages them to continue in all that the apostle has taught them, when present with them or by letter. Paul’s prayer is that God, as the great Giver of comfort and hope, will establish them in every good work and word. He also expresses his need of their prayers, that God may continue to prosper the word he preaches and deliver him from evil men. His Christian readers, for their part, can be assured of God’s faithfulness. Paul’s prayer for them is that, as they continue in the things in which they have been taught, they will be directed to the love of God and the endurance that comes from Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">Warning against Disorderliness and Idleness (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.6-15">3:6-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Another of Paul’s special purposes in writing was to stress that there is no place for idleness in the lives of Christians. He had taught this and exemplified this in his own life. Christian people are “to do their work in quietness,” “earn their own living,” and “not be weary in well-doing” (vv <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.12-13">12-13</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). There should be no associating with those who reject this teaching, but they should be admonished as brothers, not treated as enemies.</p>
<p class="h3">Conclusion (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.16-18">3:16-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">With a prayer for grace and peace and with his own personal signature, Paul concludes the letter. When he speaks of writing with his own hand in verse <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.17">17</a>, it probably means that up to that point Paul had dictated his letter to someone else (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.21">1 Cor 16:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.18">Col 4:18</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">THESSALONICA</p>
<p class="fl">Chief city of Macedonia and the seat of Roman administration in the century before Christ. In addition to having a magnificent harbor, Thessalonica had the good fortune of being located on the overland route from Italy to the East. This famous highway, called the Egnatian Way, ran directly through the city. Two Roman arches, the Vardar Gate and the Arch of Galerius, marked the western and eastern boundaries.</p>
<p>According to Strabo, a famous Greek geographer, Thessalonica was founded in 315 <span class="era">BC</span> by the Macedonian general Cassander, who named it after his wife, the daughter of Philip and stepsister of Alexander the Great. It was settled by refugees from a large number of towns in the same region, which had been destroyed in war. When Macedonia was divided into four districts (167 <span class="era">BC</span>), Thessalonica was made the capital of the second division. Its influence continued to expand when the area became a Roman province. In the second civil war between Caesar and Pompey (42 <span class="era">BC</span>), Thessalonica remained loyal to Antony and Octavian and was rewarded by receiving the status of a free city. This gift of autonomy allowed the city to appoint its own magistrates, who were given the unusual title of politarchs. The historical accuracy of Luke is seen in the fact that while the term “politarch” does not appear in earlier Greek literature, it is used in <a href="?bref=Acts.17.6-8">Acts 17:6-8</a> and has been found on an inscription on the Vardar Gate and in other inscriptions from the area. At the beginning of the first century, Thessalonica had a council of five politarchs. Cicero, a Roman statesman who lived shortly before the time of Christ, spent seven months in exile at Thessalonica.</p>
<p>The church at Thessalonica was founded by Paul on his second missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.1-4">Acts 17:1-4</a>). At Troas the apostle had been directed in a vision to cross over the Aegean Sea to Macedonia. After ministering at Philippi, where he was beaten and jailed, Paul’s Roman citizenship secured his release and he traveled on to Thessalonica. On the Sabbath, Paul went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. Some were persuaded, along with a number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women (v <a href="?bref=Acts.17.4">4</a>).</p>
<p>Paul’s success stirred the jealousy of the Jews, who gathered some rabble from the marketplace and started a riot. They rushed the house of Jason, where Paul was staying, but when they were unable to find the apostle, they dragged his host and some other believers before the city officials. They claimed that Paul was guilty of defying Caesar’s decrees because he taught another king called Jesus. That very night Paul slipped out of town and made his way to Berea (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.5-10">Acts 17:5-10</a>). The hostility of the Thessalonian Jews toward Paul is seen in the fact that when they learned that he was preaching at Berea they followed him there and stirred up the crowds against him (v <a href="?bref=Acts.17.13">13</a>).</p>
<p>Our basic knowledge of the church at Thessalonica comes from two letters by Paul from Corinth at a slightly later date. These early letters of the apostle supply an important insight into the life of a first-century Macedonian congregation that was primarily Gentile. In the centuries that followed, the city remained as one of the major strongholds of Christianity.</p>

<p class="fl">Rebel referred to by Gamaliel in his speech before the Sanhedrin as an example of the fact that false messiahs would fall without anyone’s intervention (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.36">Acts 5:36</a>). Theudas evidently led an unsuccessful rebellion against Rome in which he and 400 others were killed. A chronological difficulty is created by the fact that Josephus reports a rebellion led by Theudas during the reign of Claudius as occurring around <span class="era">AD</span> 44, which is seven to ten years <span class="ital">after</span> Gamaliel’s speech. While critics have offered this apparent anachronism as evidence that Luke (or some later editor) was in error, several other solutions are possible. Possibly the error is in Josephus’s report rather than Luke’s, or two different individuals named Theudas are intended. During the final years of Herod the Great, several rebellions occurred, one of which may have been instigated by Theudas. It has been suggested (without any direct evidence) that Herod’s slave Simon may have adopted the name Theudas when he gained freedom and subsequently rebelled against Herod. While the identity of Theudas remains unknown, this fact does not necessarily discredit the historical accuracy of Luke’s narrative.</p>

  <title>Thomas, the Apostle</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">THOMAS, The Apostle</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 12 apostles whose name appears in all four Gospels. The name is a transliteration of an Aramaic word meaning “twin” and appears in the NT as Thomas. Among Greek Christians, there was a tendency to use his Hellenistic name, Didymus (<span class="greek">didumos</span><span class="ital">,</span> “twin”); this name appears three times in John (<a href="?bref=John.11.16">Jn 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.24">20:24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.2">21:2</a>). There is ample evidence from koine papyri that the name Didymus was well known in the NT era.</p>
<p>Thomas appears in each synoptic list of apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Mt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mk 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Lk 6:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>) but plays no further role. His celebrated appearance in the fourth Gospel is interesting. Here Thomas expresses the despair of the final approach to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=John.11.16">Jn 11:16</a>) and presses Jesus to explain his words of departure in the upper room (<a href="?bref=John.14.5">14:5</a>). In the Gospel’s closing scenes is the familiar episode in which Thomas doubts the Lord’s resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.20.24">20:24</a>) and then is given compelling proof (vv <a href="?bref=John.20.26-28">26-28</a>), after which Thomas called Jesus “my Lord and my God.” Thomas is also named in John’s epilogue (<a href="?bref=John.21.2">21:2</a>).</p>
<p>Two apocryphal, pseudepigraphical works bear Thomas’s name: the Gospel of Thomas (from Nag Hammadi), which records 114 “secret sayings which the living Jesus spoke” and which Thomas is said to have preserved; and the Acts of Thomas (extant in both Greek and Syriac), which says that Jesus and Thomas were twins (sharing similar appearances and destinies) and that the apostle obtained secret teachings. This apocryphal account even explains Thomas’s fate. Against his wishes, Thomas traveled to India under the command of the Lord. There he was martyred with spears by the hand of an Indian king. He was raised up and his empty tomb took on magical properties. Today in St. Thomas, India, Christians assert that they are the spiritual descendants of the apostle.</p>

  <title>Throne</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">THRONE</p>
<p class="fl">Elevated, ceremonial chair, symbolizing the importance and the authority of the person seated on it. With the widespread use of the word “throne,” the term came to symbolize kingship and became equivalent in meaning to the kingdom itself. When Pharaoh elevated Joseph to the status and office of viceroy, he emphasized “only as regards the throne will I be greater than you” (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.40">Gn 41:40</a>). The establishment of David as king of Israel was equivalent to the establishment of the throne of David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.10">2 Sm 3:10</a>). To occupy the throne indicated succession to the kingship (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.46">1 Kgs 1:46</a>).</p>
<p>Only one throne is described in detail in the OT, the throne of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.18-20">1 Kgs 10:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.17-19">2 Chr 9:17-19</a>). The description, combined with the representation of thrones on ancient monuments, gives an idea of the appearance of the throne of Israel. An elevated seat with six steps leading up to it, the throne was partly made of ivory and overlaid with gold. The throne had a backrest and arms; alongside it were statues of lions and six similar statues on either side of the steps. Although not mentioned in the OT’s description, a footstool was an indispensable part of the throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.1">Is 66:1</a>).</p>
<p>The Hebrew term <span class="hebrew">kisseh</span> is used of a seat of honor for any distinguished person; for example, a priest (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.13,18">1 Sm 4:13, 18</a>), a ruler (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.20">Ps 94:20</a>), a military officer (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.15">Jer 1:15</a>), and a favored guest (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.10">2 Kgs 4:10</a>), although it is principally used for a king’s chair from which he discharged his royal duties. The OT refers to thrones of foreign kings (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.5">Ex 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.43.10">Jer 43:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.6">Jon 3:6</a>), but particular emphasis is on the throne of Israel, especially on the throne of David.</p>
<p>The God of Israel is described metaphorically as sitting upon a throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.1">Is 66:1</a>). The vision of God seated on a throne as seen in prophetic visions is described by Micaiah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19">1 Kgs 22:19</a>), Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-3">6:1-3</a>), Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.4-28">1:4-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1">10:1</a>), and Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.9-10">7:9-10</a>). Later, Ezekiel’s vision of the throne of God was of major significance in Jewish “throne mysticism.” In <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">Revelation 4</a> the throne of God is flanked by the 24 thrones of the elders, surrounded by an emerald rainbow and seven torches, with a crystal sea in front, and four living creatures on each side.</p>
<p>Usually, God’s throne is spoken of as being in heaven (<a href="?bref=Ps.11.4">Ps 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.34">Mt 5:34</a>), but Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.17">Jer 3:17</a>), the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.6-7">Ez 43:6-7</a>), or the nation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.21">Jer 14:21</a>) may be called the throne of God. The concept of Christ’s throne is rare in the OT (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.7">Is 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.25">Jer 17:25</a>) but common in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32">Lk 1:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.30">Acts 2:30</a>). This throne symbolizes Christ’s kingship and authority.</p>

  <title>Thyatira</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">THYATIRA</p>
<p class="fl">Location of one of the seven local churches in the book of Revelation. The city was founded by the Lydian kingdom and later captured by Seleucus, Alexander’s general. It then served as a border settlement to preserve his kingdom from Lysimachus, his rival to the west.</p>
<p>After the kingdom of Pergamum was founded (282 <span class="era">BC</span>), Thyatira became the borderline between Pergamum and the Syrians. The city was without natural defenses. It was not built on a hill and therefore was subject to repeated invasions. The strength of the city lay largely in its strategic location and also upon the fertility of the area surrounding it. Its inhabitants were descendants of Macedonian solders and retained much of their ancestors’ militancy. They were formidable defenders of the city.</p>
<p>When Rome defeated Antiochus in 189 <span class="era">BC</span>, Thyatira was incorporated into the kingdom of Pergamum, Rome’s ally. Peace and prosperity followed. Under the Roman emperor Claudius (<span class="era">AD</span> 41–54), Thyatira rose to new prominence and was permitted to issue its own coins. The emperor Hadrian included this city in his Middle East itinerary (<span class="era">AD</span> 134), a hint of the importance of Thyatira in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>Prosperity attracted many Jews to this area. Among the commercial activities of the city were textiles and bronze armor. The armorers were in a guild, like the silversmiths in Ephesus. The first known Christian convert in Europe was a businesswoman from Thyatira named Lydia (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14-15,40">Acts 16:14-15, 40</a>). She specialized in the costly purple garments that were exported from Thyatira to Macedonia. Here the purple dye, from the madder root, offered a much cheaper cloth to compete with costlier garments dyed with the expensive murex dye from Phoenicia.</p>
<p>In the message to the church in Thyatira, the members are commended for their love, faith, service, and endurance (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.19">Rv 2:19</a>). But the influence of paganism is still reflected in the sharp rebuke of those who tolerate the heresy of which “Jezebel” was the leader. Their temptation was similar to that of the Corinthian believers who were uncertain about eating food that had been dedicated to idols (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">1 Cor 8:1-13</a>). The trade guilds held periodic festivals in which food offered to idols was consumed. This was sometimes accompanied by licentious rites in which religion and sex were mingled. This church was condemned for its accommodation to these pagan practices. Immorality was so rife among the pagans that the early church, with its uncompromising attitude toward unchastity, stood in constant tension with the mores of the community. Superstition and devil worship were apparently a great temptation as well. The “deep things of Satan” (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.24">Rv 2:24</a>) is probably an allusion to one of the Gnostic sects that stressed “depth” and carried on secret rites in which only initiates participated. So serious was the temptation that the best hope was for survival of the remnant—hence, the exhortation “hold fast what you have, until I come” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.2.25">25</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TIBERIAS</p>
<p class="fl">City midway along the western shores of Lake Galilee, built about <span class="era">AD</span> 20 by Herod Antipas, Herod the Great’s son and the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 39), who named the town in honor of the emperor Tiberius. The name is preserved in the modern town Tabariyeh. The site became his new capital after abandoning Sepphoris, which he built in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. The location of Tiberias had several advantages: it lay just below a rocky projection above the lake, a natural acropolis that offered good protection; it was a center where roads from north, south, and west met, allowing Herod to move readily to various parts of his domain; and a little to the south lay famous warm springs, which were known to the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, who spoke of their health-giving qualities. Herod built a lakeside palace, feeling secure in the knowledge that a naturally fortified acropolis lay behind him. From there he would have enjoyed a superb panorama, which took in the whole of Galilee at a glance.</p>
<p>During the building of the town, a necropolis was discovered, which led to the Jewish abandonment of the site. The town was subsequently settled by a heterogeneous company of Gentiles, some of whom were brought forcibly to the place by Herod. By offering good houses and land to all, Herod assembled a sizable population (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.2.3). According to the Gospels, Jesus never went there, probably in deference to Jewish scruples about the pollution caused by corpses. The town is mentioned only once in the NT (<a href="?bref=John.6.23">Jn 6:23</a>), where boats came from Tiberias following the episode of the feeding of the 5,000. The Sea of Tiberias, that is, Lake Galilee, is referred to in <a href="?bref=John.6.1">John 6:1</a> and <a href="?bref=John.21.1">21:1</a>.</p>

The name means “my trust is in the son of the temple Esharra,” and appears in various forms (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>; also called Tilgath-pilneser in <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.6">1 Chr 5:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.20">2 Chr 28:20</a>).</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser I (1115–1077 <span class="era">BC</span>) was the son of Ashur-resh-ishi. Having gained independence from Babylonian overlordship, Tiglath-pileser consolidated his hold over the territory newly acquired in his father’s reign, maintaining control and guarding against counterattacks from the former occupiers. Security brought increased trade and prosperity, and a large temple-building program was undertaken.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser II (c. 967–935 <span class="era">BC</span>) was a weak king who ruled Assyria during a period of decline. Although he was able to maintain some degree of internal control, he was powerless to prevent outside peoples from encroaching upon Assyrian territory. In particular, the Arameans took advantage of Assyrian weakness to occupy large areas of land, and an Aramean ruler named Kapara built a palace at Guzana (the Gozan of <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.6">2 Kgs 17:6</a>). Some of the Arameans who occupied the area have been identified from inscriptions found at the site. This period was of particular importance for the emergence of the Aramean Empire.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) ascended to the throne at a time when he could stem and reverse another decline in Assyrian fortunes. Although not directly in line for the throne, he was probably of royal descent. On occasion, he used the name Pul (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19">2 Kgs 15:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.26">1 Chr 5:26</a>), which may have been his real name as opposed to his throne name.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser III was a strong, able, resourceful king whose reign is remarkable for the rapid extension of Assyrian boundaries and for the peaceful administration of the newly acquired territories. He assisted Babylon by defeating the Arameans, and by his diplomacy retained Babylonian support while he concentrated his military efforts elsewhere. On the death of the vassal king Nabu-nasir of Babylon in 734 <span class="era">BC</span>, Tiglath-pileser gained the support of some of the tribes and finally forced the submission of Marduk-apla-iddina (the Merodach-baladan of <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1">Is 39:1</a>). According to the Babylonian Chronicle, he used the name Pul when acceding to the throne of Babylon himself in 729 <span class="era">BC</span>. He was the first Assyrian king on the throne of Babylon in 500 years.</p>
<p>His reign, which was marked by a vast increase in territory coupled with a firm and able administration, also had long-term effects far beyond Assyria’s immediate borders. The expansion into Syria and Palestine was bound to lead eventually to conflict with Egypt when that country wished once again to mount a more aggressive foreign policy. Tiglath-pileser was the father of Shalmaneser V (727–722 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

  <title>Tigris River</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TIGRIS RIVER</p>
<p class="fl">One of the two major rivers that drains the Mesopotamian plain. Unlike the Euphrates, it is seldom mentioned in the Bible. In the description of the Garden of Eden, it is listed as the third of the four rivers that flowed out of the river that watered the Garden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.14">Gn 2:14</a>). Unfortunately, this reference provides little help concerning the location of Eden. The river is not mentioned again until <a href="?bref=Dan.10.4">Daniel 10:4</a>, where Daniel referred to it as the “great river” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). Nahum was likely referring to the Tigris when he described the opening of the river gates of Nineveh during the Babylonian siege (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.6">Na 2:6</a>).</p>
<p>When its two principal tributaries are included, the length of the Tigris is 1,146 miles (1,843.9 kilometers). Its primary source, a mountain lake called Golenjik, is only two or three miles (3.2–4.8 kilometers) from the channel of the Euphrates. As is the case with most of the rivers of the region, the flow of the Tigris varies considerably during the year. Flood season begins in early March, with its peak in early- to mid-May. Though the river is generally navigable, historical records suggest that the river never had great commercial significance. However, it did gain political significance during the period of Assyrian dominance. Nineveh, Asshur, and Calah were all located on the banks of the Tigris. Unfortunately for the Assyrians, the Tigris never proved to be a formidable natural barrier and thus failed to protect the empire from its enemies.</p>

<p class="h1">TIMOTHY (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul’s convert and companion, whose name means “one who honors God.”</p>
<p>Timothy first appears in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-3">Acts 16:1-3</a> as Paul’s disciple whose mother “was a believer; but his father was a Greek” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.1">1</a>). He was a third-generation Christian after his mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.5">2 Tm 1:5</a>). The apostle Paul, undoubtedly Timothy’s spiritual father, refers to him as “my true child in the faith” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.2">1 Tm 1:2</a>); he perhaps converted Timothy on his first or second missionary journey. The son of a Greek (or Gentile) father, Timothy was yet uncircumcised; however, when Paul decided to take Timothy with him on the second journey, he had him circumcised so as not to hinder their missionary endeavors among the Jews.</p>
<p>Timothy, who was well spoken of by the believers at Lystra and Iconium (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.2">Acts 16:2</a>), became Paul’s companion and assistant on his second missionary journey at Lystra. He traveled with Paul into Europe following the Macedonian vision. When Paul decided to go to Athens, he left Silas and Timothy at Berea to establish the church there (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.14">17:14</a>). Timothy and Silas eventually joined Paul in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.5">18:5</a>). He next appears with Paul in Ephesus on his third journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.22">19:22</a>), from where Paul sends him into Macedonia ahead of himself. In the last mention of Timothy in <a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>, he was included in the list of goodwill ambassadors who were to accompany Paul to Jerusalem with the offering for the Christian Jews.</p>
<p>Timothy is often mentioned in the Pauline letters. His name is included in the introductory salutations of 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Timothy’s presence with Paul when he wrote these letters confirms the accuracy of the references to him in Acts. He was in Corinth on the second journey when Paul wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians, at Ephesus on the third journey when Paul wrote 2 Corinthians, and in Rome during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment, when he wrote Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. He is mentioned in the introductions of 1 and 2 Timothy as the recipient of those two letters.</p>
<p>In the closing salutations of <a href="?bref=Rom.16.21">Romans 16:21</a>, Timothy is listed along with others who send their good wishes to the believers in Rome. In <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.17">1 Corinthians 4:17</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.10">16:10</a>, Paul speaks words of praise for Timothy as he sends him with a message to Corinth (see also <a href="?bref=Phil.2.19-23">Phil 2:19-23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.3.2-6">1 Thes 3:2-6</a>). In <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.19">2 Corinthians 1:19</a> Timothy is named, along with Paul and Silas, as men who were proclaiming the good news about Jesus Christ. Paul put Timothy in charge of the church at Ephesus and wrote him two pastoral letters to help him perform that responsible task.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Heb.13.23">Hebrews 13:23</a> the author (probably not Paul) tells his readers that Timothy had been released from prison, and that he hoped to come with Timothy to visit the readers of that letter. By this note, we know that Timothy experienced imprisonment.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">In 1 Timothy, as in 2 Timothy and Titus, Paul is named as the author in the first verse. And Paul’s name is the only one assigned as author in the tradition of the early church since the time of Irenaeus (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 185). Throughout all three letters are many personal references to the life of Paul, which constitute strong evidence that he was truly the author.</p>
<p>However, some scholars object to Pauline authorship on the following grounds:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The Greek vocabulary contains a large number of words that are not found in the other Pauline letters.</p>
<p class="list-text">But the subject matter in these letters is also different. In the Pastoral Epistles the author is dealing with the more technical matters of church organization and discipline—a church leader writing to other leaders. Paul was a highly educated man, with a large vocabulary at his disposal. None of the words peculiar to the Pastoral Letters would have been beyond Paul’s own vocabulary. And if these weren’t his words, they may have come from the scribes that Paul regularly used to compose his epistles.</p>
<p class="list">2. There are notes about Paul’s journeys that do not fit into the journeys described in the book of Acts.</p>
<p class="list-text">To believe that Paul wrote the Pastorals and did the things described in them, he must have been released from Roman imprisonment and then traveled to Crete, Ephesus, and Macedonia. These later journeys may not have been mentioned in Acts because the writer of Acts concluded this book with Paul’s imprisonment in Rome. There is some legal evidence that Paul would automatically have been released after two years, if he had not been convicted by that time.</p>
<p class="list">3. The advanced development of the church described in the pastorals proves a date later than the life of Paul. Elders, bishops, and deacons are mentioned.</p>
<p class="list-text">However, elders existed in OT times and bishops, as officers within local churches, are almost certainly the same as elders. In addition, Paul refers to deacons elsewhere in his letters, such as <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Philippians 1:1</a>.</p>
<p>Most conservative scholars, and many others as well, believe very strongly that Paul did write all three of the Pastoral Letters.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Assuming that Paul wrote the Pastorals, 1 Timothy would have been written after his release from the first Roman imprisonment, about <span class="era">AD</span> 61 or 62, and before his second Roman imprisonment, somewhere between 64 and 67, the date of the death of Nero. As to the place, Paul left Timothy in Ephesus and then went on to Macedonia (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.3">1 Tm 1:3</a>), where he may have written 1 Timothy. The letter was, of course, written to Timothy at Ephesus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Paul left Timothy in charge of the church at Ephesus (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.2-3">1:2-3</a>). Paul wanted to go to the Roman province of Asia, of which Ephesus was the chief city, on his second missionary journey, but the Spirit did not allow him to do so. He went on to Macedonia and Greece (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a>). He briefly visited Ephesus as he was completing his second journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.19-20">18:19-20</a>). Then on his third journey he made Ephesus the center of his activity and spent three years there (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-20.1">19:1–20:1</a>). During his first Roman imprisonment, he wrote an encyclical letter to Ephesus and the nearby churches. Only a few years later, he wrote 1 Timothy to Timothy at Ephesus.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="ITimothy316InCodexSinaiticus"/>
<p class="h2" id="Theology">Theology</p>
<p class="fl">In general, the theology of 1 Timothy is consistent with that of the other Pauline letters and of the NT as a whole. The sovereignty and love of God are clearly presented time and again throughout the letter. Jesus is always presented as being truly God as well as man. Salvation is by faith in God through Christ. The law will not save a person, because all people have broken it. Yet the law is good and is God’s guide for the saved person in living a life pleasing to God.</p>
<p>The church occupies a large place in the letter. All Christians should be a part of the church. They gain much from the church for the development of Christian character, and they can serve God far more effectively in the church than apart from it. The church needs organization to do its work effectively. And the church must strive always to avoid heresy and to teach the truths of the gospel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Salutation (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The author names himself, Paul, and describes himself as an apostle, chosen by God and authorized by God the Father and his Son, Christ Jesus. Paul had the right to speak words of authority to the young pastor and to the church.</p>
<p>The letter is written to Timothy, Paul’s beloved spiritual child, to whom Paul gave his triple blessing—grace, mercy, and peace from God.</p>
<p class="h3">Dealing with Heresy (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.3-20">1:3-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of the reasons Paul left Timothy in Ephesus was that he wanted him to “stop those who are teaching wrong doctrine” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.3">1:3</a>). Paul believed that what a person believed was as important as what he did. The heresy here is described as an early form of the Gnostic heresy, a dangerous heresy plaguing the church for centuries.</p>
<p>These early Gnostics claimed to have a deeper insight into truth than the average Christian. They separated God as Spirit from man as matter. For Gnostics, the bridge between the two was made up of innumerable angels of various ranks, emanations, aeons, and such, rather than the one mediator, Jesus Christ. They argued about myths and fables. They sought salvation by finding favor with an endless chain of angels rather than by accepting God’s salvation by faith. But only the grace of God can save sinners, as Paul himself knew well.</p>
<p class="h3">Correct Worship in the Church (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.1-15">2:1-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">“I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.1">2:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Prayer is an exceedingly important part of the worship of the Christian church. Paul emphasized the importance of special prayer for persons in high places of authority in the state (even though the state was the Roman Empire with Nero as its emperor). Paul had taught this clearly in <a href="?bref=Rom.13.1-14">Romans 13</a>, and Jesus had told his disciples to give to Caesar the things that belonged to him (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.17">Mt 22:17</a>).</p>
<p>Christian men and women should pray to God, lifting up holy hands to him, hands free from sin and anger and resentment. Paul specifically urged the sisters as follows: “And I want women to be modest in their appearance. They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes. For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.9-10">1 Tm 2:9-10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Then Paul said, “I do not let women teach men or have authority over them” (v <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.12">12</a>). This did not mean, however, that they could not function orally in the church meetings. According to Acts and 1 Corinthians, it is quite clear that women prayed, prophesied, and testified in church meetings. But teaching was reserved for the men because it was the duty of the elders (who were male) to be the teachers. Thus, teaching and exercising authority went hand in hand.</p>
<p class="h3">Proper Organization in the Church (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.1-5.25">3:1–5:25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first issue to resolve about the organization of the early church had to do with who the bishops were. The first verse of this section reads, “If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.1">3:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In all the Pastoral Epistles, the bishop is clearly an officer within a local church rather than an official over a group of churches, such as the office of the episcopal bishop, which developed in the early second century. And in the light of <a href="?bref=Titus.1.4-6">Titus 1:4-6</a>, where Paul passed directly from elders to bishops, most scholars believe that Paul used the two terms interchangeably. Timothy himself would be the closest thing to a modern pastor in the church, and there were elders (bishops) and deacons assisting him in governing the church.</p>
<p>To be an elder in the church is a worthy aspiration. But a person must have high qualifications to be elected to such a responsible position. He should be respected by other members of the church and by those outside the church. Most of the qualifications are quite clear but several of them deserve some attention.</p>
<p>“Now a bishop must be above reproach, the husband of one wife” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.2">3:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Greek says literally, “a man of one woman.” That would clearly prohibit polygamy and eliminate a man who was unfaithful to his wife. It would probably eliminate neither a man who had been divorced and remarried nor a bachelor who had never had a wife. The church should insist that its official leaders conform to a high view of sexual morality.</p>
<p>The elder should be able to discipline his own family life if he is to exert discipline in the church. The man also should not be a drunkard. Paul did not demand total abstinence, but he clearly demanded that an elder not be a person under the domination of strong drink. And a person occupying the high office of elder should not be a new Christian (lit. a neophyte), lest this go to his head and keep him from being a good elder. All in all, only a person of excellent character should be elected to the high office of elder, or bishop, in the church.</p>
<p>Then Paul went on to speak about the office of the deacon: “In the same way, deacons must be people who are respected and have integrity” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.8">3:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The qualifications for the deacons are virtually the same as those for elders. Before being elected as deacons, they should have experience in church work. <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.11">First Timothy 3:11</a> applies the same qualifications to women aspiring to be deacons and/or to wives of deacons (<span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). Verse <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.12">12</a> continues with the qualifications of deacons in general.</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.1-16">4</a> Paul urges Timothy to exercise his leadership in the church, especially in his relation to the heretics. Some of the Gnostic heretics taught a false kind of asceticism, forbidding marriage and the eating of various foods. But God has given these things to be used and appreciated for God’s glory. Timothy’s pastoral duty was to teach his people God’s truths and not to allow himself to be caught up in arguing about the heretics’ godless and silly myths (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.7">4:7</a>). Paul urged Timothy to keep his spirit fit by constant spiritual exercise, which was even more important than exercise of the body.</p>
<p>Paul recognized that Timothy was a young man, and that some of the older Christians might be tempted to look down upon his youth. Timothy should strive even harder to deserve their admiration—“in speech and conduct, in love, in faith, in purity” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.12">4:12</a>). Because God had called Timothy and the church had ordained him by the laying on of hands, Timothy should strive to live up to these high responsibilities.</p>
<p>Paul gave Timothy practical advice as to how a young preacher should deal with the different age and sex groups in the church. He should treat the older men as his own father, the older women as his mother, the younger men as his brothers, and the younger women as his sisters—adding significantly, “in all purity” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.2">5:2</a>).</p>
<p>Paul also told Timothy how to deal with the problem of widows. At that time, when few women could work and before the days of insurance and Social Security, women who had lost their husbands were in a hopeless situation. The early church developed a roll for widows that would enable it to minister to their needs. Younger widows were to be encouraged to marry again and get new husbands to support them. Able families should recognize their responsibility to take care of their own needy ones. The church, then, would have the responsibility of taking care of the older widows who had no families to take care of them. The church, with its charitable obligations, must use its limited means responsibly, wisely, and fairly so that the greatest possible good can result.</p>
<p>Even in the early church, church leaders were paid for their work. Paul said that they should “be considered worthy of double honor” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.17">5:17</a>). Church leaders should not be chosen or ordained too quickly. Their sins should not be overlooked. Even Timothy himself was warned to keep himself free from sin. The section ends with another treatment of the sins of church leaders (vv <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.24-25">24-25</a>). When the sins are clear, the sinner must be disciplined by the church. At times, a person’s sins are not evident to other people, but God knows them and will deal with them. Conversely, the same is true about the many good deeds of the leaders.</p>
<p class="h3">Some Practical Teaching about the Christian Life (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.1-21">6:1-21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Slavery was a recognized institution in those days. Christian slaves should be good slaves, and Christian masters should be good masters. After many centuries, Christian principles would bring slavery to an end, but it would have been impossible for Paul or anyone else at that time to lead a crusade for the abolition of slavery.</p>
<p>Timothy was urged to avoid the teaching of the heretics but to be faithful in teaching the positive truths of the gospel.</p>
<p>Two sections (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.6-10,17-19">6:6-10, 17-19</a>) deal with the Christian’s attitude toward wealth. Here Paul closely followed the teachings of Jesus. Money can be made into a false god and bring all kinds of evil to the church member. But it can also be used in the service of God and be changed into treasure stored in heaven.</p>
<p>Finally, in two sections (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.11-16,20-21">6:11-16, 20-21</a>), Paul encouraged Timothy to strive to do his very best to be truly God’s man. He should fight a good fight as a soldier of God. This life will often be hard, but Timothy should keep his eyes fixed on the second coming of the glorious Christ.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Many of those who deny the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral Epistles recognize that 2 Timothy contains some true Pauline fragments in the numerous personal references in the letter. But the evidence in favor of the Pauline authorship is much stronger than the evidence against it. (See the discussion on authorship of the Pastoral Letters under “<a href="?item=TimothyFirstLetterto_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Timothy, First Letter to</a>.”)</p>
<p class="h2" id="PlaceandDateofWriting">Place and Date of Writing</p>
<p class="fl">Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter to Timothy; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.15-18">2 Timothy 1:15-18</a> tells specifically of his being in Rome and how Onesiphorus was faithful to him when others from the province of Asia had deserted him. <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.9">Second Timothy 2:9</a> again refers to his being in jail for preaching the gospel. Toward the end of the letter, starting at <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.6">4:6</a>, Paul relates his experience in prison—and that he has no hope for release. Second Timothy is a type of last will and testament of the apostle. Early, trustworthy tradition reports that Paul was martyred in Rome under Nero. Rome, then, was the place from which 2 Timothy was written.</p>
<p>The letter was written to Timothy in Ephesus, as is made plain throughout the letter.</p>
<p>As to the year in which it was written, two dates are possible. The year 64 <span class="era">AD</span> was the date of the great fire in Rome. Nero tried to shift responsibility for the fire to the Christians. Possibly Paul was martyred at that time. Nero himself died in <span class="era">AD</span> 67, so that would be the latest date that could be assigned. The letter was written between <span class="era">AD</span> 64 and 67, with some preference being given to the earlier date.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Since the time of the writing of 1 Timothy, Paul made further travels and then came to Rome for his second imprisonment. See this section under “<a href="?item=TimothyFirstLetterto_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Timothy, First Letter to</a>.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Salutation (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">As was customary in ancient letters, the writer puts his name first. Then he gives a fuller identification of himself as an apostle, one belonging to Jesus Christ, and one commissioned to tell the whole world about the eternal life that God has made available through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul hereby indicates his authority and also gives a brief summary of the essence of the true Christian faith.</p>
<p>The person to whom the letter is written is “Timothy, my beloved child.” Then follows a triple blessing, “Grace, mercy, and peace” from God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. As in all his letters, Paul changes the rather colorless Greek salutation, “greetings,” to one of the greatest theological concepts, “grace,” and adds the Greek translation of the regular Hebrew salutation, “peace.” Then he adds here the great word, “mercy,” as he did in 1 Timothy.</p>
<p class="h3">Exhortations to Timothy to Be a Good Minister (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.3-2.13">1:3–2:13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul begins this section by telling Timothy how often he offered prayers of thanksgiving to God on his behalf, to the God of his fathers, to the God whom it was his chief purpose in life to please. Paul greatly desired to see Timothy, especially as he remembered their tearful parting.</p>
<p>Paul reminded Timothy of his great trust in the Lord, a trust that was passed on to him by two godly women: his mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois. <a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-3">Acts 16:1-3</a> states that Timothy’s mother was a believing Jewess, and his father was a Greek, or Gentile. He had not allowed his son to be circumcised in infancy. But the believing mother had passed on her faith to her son. When Paul decided to take him along as an assistant on his second missionary journey, he had him circumcised so that he could work more effectively with the Jews. Thus, Timothy had a great heritage from Lois, Eunice, and Paul himself.</p>
<p>“Hence I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.1.6">2 Tm 1:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.14">First Timothy 4:14</a> adds this: “when the council of elders laid their hands upon you.” This seems very much like there had been a formal service of ordination, when Timothy was set apart as a minister of the gospel by the laying on of hands accompanied by prayer. Timothy should have never forgotten that solemn moment, and the memory should have kept his life filled with strength and boldness. He was truly a man of God, a man filled with the Spirit of God, and a man not afraid to do his Christian work. Timothy might suffer for his faith, but he could be encouraged as he remembered the sufferings and imprisonment of his spiritual father, Paul. God would give Timothy strength to endure suffering, as he had done for Paul.</p>
<p>Then Paul reminded Timothy of how God had saved him and Paul, and how he had chosen them from all eternity to tell others of God’s saving love through Jesus Christ, who came in time to work out that salvation, by breaking the power of death and showing the way to eternal life. Paul knew, of course, what he believed, but more importantly he knew whom he believed, or trusted—Jesus Christ. And in spite of the many uncertainties that must have been in Paul’s mind, he could be absolutely sure of Christ. Paul was also sure that Christ would be able to guard what had been entrusted to him—guard it until the day Paul and Jesus saw each other. Paul was confident of that, and he wanted Timothy to have a similar assurance.</p>
<p>So Paul urged Timothy to hold fast to the pattern of truth Paul had taught him—that body of Christian doctrine, especially as it pertained to Jesus Christ and the faith and love in Christ. He should guard this gift carefully, with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Paul then shared with Timothy his great sorrow that all the Christians of the Roman province of Asia, of which Ephesus was the chief city, had deserted him. Paul mentions two of the deserters by name, Phygelus and Hermogenes. Evidently Timothy knew who they were. In striking contrast, Paul mentioned the good man Onesiphorus (also at <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19">4:19</a>), who had been such a wonderful and faithful helper of Paul, both in Ephesus and in Rome.</p>
<p>Paul again urged Timothy to be strong in the strength that Christ has given him (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.1">2:1</a>). Timothy should pass on the Christian truths to others and train them to pass them on to still others. Paul was probably thinking especially of the elders and deacons (cf. 1 Timothy). Paul used three effective illustrations to encourage Timothy to give his best in his Christian service. He was to fight and suffer as a good soldier, play the game well as a good athlete, and work hard as a good farmer. The rewards will come to all three if they perform their tasks well. All three illustrations had been used by Jesus, and they were used by other NT writers.</p>
<p>In the midst of his exhortations, Paul provided a fine summary of true Christology in <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.8-10">2:8-10</a>. Jesus was truly man and truly God. It is heretical to deny either the full humanity or the full deity of Christ, even though no human mind can full understand the mystery of the Incarnation. And this divine-human being died and then rose again from the dead.</p>
<p class="h3">Warnings against Heresy (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.14-4.5">2:14–4:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section begins with the affirmation “Remind everyone of these things, and command them in God’s name to stop fighting over words. Such arguments are useless, and they can ruin those who hear them” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). There are heretical beliefs that should be definitely condemned, but Christians are warned against arguing among themselves about insignificant matters. Christians can become angry with other Christians and spend time fighting one another rather than fighting Satan.</p>
<p>Timothy was to strive to make himself a good servant, meriting the approval of his Master, knowing well the truths of his word. In that way, he could combat the false teachings of the heretics. Two of the heretics are mentioned by name, Hymenaeus and Philetus. Philetus is named only here in the NT. Hymenaeus, though, was mentioned also in <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.20">1 Timothy 1:20</a>, along with another heretic, Alexander; these two had been given over to Satan, or excommunicated, by Paul at that time. Their heresy was that they taught that the resurrection of believers had already happened (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.18">2 Tm 2:18</a>). This heresy undermines the Christian hope of the final resurrection, which brings all believers into eternity. The heretics were denying the reality of that and redefining it as something that had already happened.</p>
<p>In various ways Paul urged Timothy to prove himself a true servant of God, one who is known by God and one who lives by the truths of God’s word. He should avoid the evil thoughts that so often come to young men, and also the temptation to quarrel. Rather, he should be gentle, patient, and humble, seeking to help his people avoid the traps of Satan.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=2Tim.3.1-9">Second Timothy 3:1-9</a> gives Paul’s strongest condemnation of the heretics in the church. They attend church but they do not believe the Christian truths. They do not live Christian lives themselves, and they strive to get others to follow their beliefs and practices; Paul likened the heretics of his day to the Egyptian magicians in <a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-25">Exodus 7</a> (who were given the names Jannes and Jambres by Jewish tradition). The heretics in Timothy’s day would fail in their attacks against the truth, just as Jannes and Jambres had failed in their attacks against God and his spokesman Moses.</p>
<p>Paul contrasted his own life and beliefs with those of the heretics. He had been persecuted by heretics himself even on his first missionary journey, but he had continued to preach the truth and had brought many to accept Christ. Timothy should follow Paul’s example.</p>
<p>The supreme way to overcome heresy is the diligent study of the Word of God. “All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It straightens us out and teaches us to do what is right. It is God’s way of preparing us in every way, fully equipped for every good thing God wants us to do” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.16-17">3:16-17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Paul gave Timothy a solemn charge to preach that Word faithfully and diligently. Many would not be willing to listen to the truths of the Bible, but Timothy should try to correct and rebuke them, even though it may bring persecution upon himself.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Faith and Hope (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.6-18">4:6-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul had been writing these important injunctions to Timothy because he knew that he had very little time left here on earth: “As for me, my life has already been poured out as an offering to God. The time of my death is near” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.6">4:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). He can look back with satisfaction upon a life of true faith and service. So he can look forward in all confidence to his crown of victory in eternity. This kind of faith enabled Paul to face his death bravely, and it will do the same for all believing Christians for whom the Second Coming is a blessed hope.</p>
<p>Paul urged Timothy to come and be with him in Rome. Luke was the only one of his friends still with him. Paul told Timothy about other friends who had been with him but who had left. One, Demas, had proved to be a failure. Crescens, Titus, and Tychicus had left for other places. Paul asked Timothy to bring his coat, which he had left at Troas with Carpus, and also his books, especially those written on parchment (probably some copies of Scripture, both Old Testament and New). Paul warned Timothy against the evil man, Alexander the coppersmith (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.20">1 Tm 1:20</a>).</p>
<p>At Paul’s first trial, all of his friends had left him. But God had been with him and saved him. Paul had even had an opportunity of proclaiming the gospel for all the world to hear.</p>
<p class="h3">Concluding Greetings (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.19-22">4:19-22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul sent his greetings to a number of his friends in Ephesus. And he sent greetings to Timothy from some of the Roman Christians whom he evidently knew. He urged Timothy to try to come to him before winter, when traveling would be difficult or impossible. He then concluded with a short benediction: “The Lord be with your spirit.”</p>

The Hebrew form of Tishbe in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">1 Kings 17:1</a> prompted the KJV to translate the word as “of the inhabitants [of Gilead].” Most translations follow the Septuagint, however, in considering Tishbe a proper noun. This reading is also supported by the fact that Elijah is elsewhere called a Tishbite. If Tishbe is considered a proper name, it is likely identified with Thisbe, a town in Naphtali that is mentioned in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.1.2">Tobit 1:2</a>.</p>

  <title>Tithe, Tithing</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TITHE, TITHING</p>
<p class="fl">Words deriving from Old English for “tenth” and representing a charge upon produce or labor levied for the maintenance of religious activities. The custom is very ancient (Abraham paid a tithe of the spoils of war to Melchizedek; see <a href="?bref=Gen.14.20">Gn 14:20</a>) and widely practiced, being known in Athens, Arabia, Rome, Carthage, Egypt, Syria, Babylon, and China.</p>
<p>According to Deuteronomy (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.2-7,17-19">Dt 12:2-7, 17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.22-29">14:22-29</a>), the centralization of worship meant that the tithe was taken annually at the sanctuary and shared by priests and Levites. Corn, wine, oil, and flocks were tithed. Every third year, the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows were given the whole tithe in charity (<a href="?bref=Deut.26.12">Dt 26:12</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Num.18.21-32">Numbers 18:21-32</a>, every tithe in Israel was given to the Levites in return for their priestly service.</p>
<p> The prophet Malachi (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.8-10">Mal 3:8-10</a>), who scathingly declared the withholding of tithes to be “robbing God,” promised full barns and vats, opened windows of heaven, outpoured blessing and deliverance from locusts, in return for faithful tithing. In the early tithe feasts, thanksgiving for God’s gifts would seem appropriate (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.28.22">Gn 28:22</a>), though not emphasized. Maintenance of the service of God remained the chief purpose of tithing, along with a wide charity.</p>
<p>Apart from recalling Melchizedek’s tithe (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-28">Heb 7</a>), tithing is mentioned in the NT critically. According to <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">Matthew 23:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.11.42">Luke 11:42</a>, Jesus spoke of those who meticulously paid tithes on three small garden herbs while neglecting three “weightier matters of the law,” namely, justice, mercy, and faith. For him, this was an example of the lack of moral proportion, the lack of a right sense of priorities, that marked Pharisaism. The explicit rule, precisely observed, is so much easier and self-satisfying than the moral sensitivity that should govern all relations with others and with God. According to <a href="?bref=Luke.18.12">Luke 18:12</a>, the Pharisee, congratulating himself in prayer for his superior virtues, mentions his tithing of all income among his claims to divine favor. Christ sternly devalued the pride-filled performance, compared with that of the humble penitent.</p>

  <title>Titus (Person)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TITUS (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. One of Paul’s converts—“my true child in a common faith” (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.4">Ti 1:4</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>)—who became an intimate and trusted associate of the apostle in his mission of planting Christianity throughout the Mediterranean world (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.23">2 Cor 8:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Tm 4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.4-5">Ti 1:4-5</a>). Mentioned frequently in Paul’s letters (eight times in 2 Corinthians, twice in Galatians, once each in 2 Timothy and Titus), his name occurs nowhere in Acts. This is a puzzling silence that some scholars have sought to explain with the fascinating, but uncertain, suggestion that he was a brother of Luke, the author of Acts.</p>
<p class="list-text">Unlike Timothy, who was half Jewish, Titus was born of gentile parents. Nothing is recorded of the circumstances surrounding his conversion and initial encounter with Paul. He is first introduced as a companion of Paul and Barnabas on a visit to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.3">Gal 2:3</a>). The occasion appears to have been the Jerusalem Council, about <span class="era">AD</span> 50, which Paul and Barnabas attended as official delegates from the church at Antioch not long after the apostle’s first missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">With the hotly contested issue of compulsory circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity before the council, Paul decided to make a test case of Titus. The council decided in Paul’s favor against the Judaizing party, and Titus was accepted by the other apostles and leaders of the Jerusalem church without submitting to the rite of circumcision. Thus, Titus became a key figure in the liberation of the infant church from the Judaizing party.</p>
<p class="list-text">Titus probably accompanied Paul from that time on, but he does not appear again until Paul’s crisis with the church at Corinth during his third missionary journey. According to 2 Corinthians, while Paul was conducting an extended ministry in Ephesus, he received word that the Corinthian church had turned hostile toward him and renounced his apostolic authority. Other attempts at reconciliation having failed, he sent Titus to Corinth to try to repair the breach. When Titus rejoined Paul somewhere in Macedonia, where the apostle had traveled from Ephesus to meet him, Titus brought the good news that the attitude of the Corinthians had changed and their former love and friendship were now restored (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.6-7">2 Cor 7:6-7</a>). In view of this development Paul sent Titus back to Corinth, carrying 2 Corinthians, which included instructions to complete the collection of the relief offering for the Jewish Christians of Judea (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.6,16">8:6, 16</a>). In this venture also Titus was apparently successful (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.25-26">Rom 15:25-26</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="PaulSearchesforTitus"/>
<p class="list-text">Assuming that Paul was released after his first Roman imprisonment, it appears that Titus accompanied him on a mission to the island of Crete. On departing from Crete, Paul left Titus behind to consolidate the new Christian movement there (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>). The assignment was difficult, for the Cretans were unruly and the struggling church was already invaded by false teachers (vv <a href="?bref=Titus.1.10-16">10-16</a>). His handling of the Corinthian problem some years before, however, demonstrated that Titus possessed the spiritual earnestness, skillful diplomacy, and loving concern required to meet the present challenge, and Paul was confident that this new commission was therefore safe in his hands.</p>
<p class="list-text">Paul’s letter to Titus, one of his three Pastoral Letters, was written somewhat later to encourage Titus in his Cretan ministry. The letter closes with the apostle’s request that Titus join him at Nicopolis, a town on the west coast of Greece, where he planned to spend the winter (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">Ti 3:12</a>). Most likely it was from Nicopolis, or else later from Rome (where the apostle was imprisoned again and eventually martyred), that Paul sent Titus on the mission to Dalmatia, a Roman province in what is now Yugoslavia (see <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Tm 4:10</a>). If later tradition is correct, Titus returned to Crete, where he served as bishop until he was an old man.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Though this letter begins with the name and greeting of Paul (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.1-3">Ti 1:1-3</a>), Paul’s authorship has been questioned by modern scholars on the grounds of its language and style, the church situation it presents, and the way that it sets forth Christian teaching. But Pauline authorship has been stoutly defended by eminent scholars and careful students who have argued that there is no reason for supposing that this epistle was written by someone else using Paul’s name, after the apostle himself had died. The differences in this epistle and Paul’s other letters are explained previously in the section on “Author” in the article “Timothy, First Letter to.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Recipient">Recipient</p>
<p class="fl">Titus appears to have been one of Paul’s most trusted and valuable coworkers. Paul speaks of him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.23">2 Cor 8:23</a>) as “my partner and coworker.” According to <a href="?bref=Titus.1.4">Titus 1:4</a>, he owed his conversion to Paul. It is clear from <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-4">Galatians 2:1-4</a> that he was a Gentile, as his was a test case whether gentile Christians should be compelled to be circumcised. At that time Titus was with Paul and Barnabas in Jerusalem. Much later, at the time of Paul’s third missionary journey, he had two delicate missions to carry out for Paul in Corinth: the first pertained to the strained relationship between the apostle and the Corinthian Christians; the second related to the gentile collection for the Jerusalem church (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.12-13">2 Cor 2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.5-16">7:5-16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-24">8:1-24</a>). If <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.9-18">2 Timothy 4:9-18</a> was written at the end of Paul’s life, then Titus went to Dalmatia after the time of this letter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">To date this letter with precision is difficult. Titus was left by the apostle in Crete to continue his work (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>). Paul was in Crete briefly on his voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.7-13">Acts 27:7-13</a>), but that could not have been the occasion referred to. In <a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">3:12</a> Titus is called to come to Nicopolis (probably the Nicopolis in Epirus in Greece), as Paul had decided to winter there. Many have favored the view that after Paul’s first imprisonment in Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.16-31">Acts 28:16-31</a>) he was released, carried out further ministry in various places (including Spain, Crete, and Greece), and then was arrested, imprisoned a second time, and finally put to death. Those who do not accept Pauline authorship of Titus, date this letter, like 1 and 2 Timothy, in the generation that followed Paul’s death.</p>

<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTeaching">Purpose and Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Although this letter is addressed to an individual colleague of the apostle, it has a minimum of personal references and exhortations. The growing and developing churches in Crete were Paul’s main concern. They were being bothered by false teachings that appear to have had Jewish elements, ascetic emphases, and a great deal of speculative discussion (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.10,14-15">Ti 1:10, 14-15</a>: <a href="?bref=Titus.3.9">3:9</a>). In short, it seems that they were dealing with an early Jewish form of Gnosticism. Its advocates promoted this teaching “for base gain” (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.11">1:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Titus and those whom he would appoint as elders were called upon to refute the wrong teaching and to provide the believers with healthy teaching (v <a href="?bref=Titus.1.9">9</a>). Though this healthy teaching is not specified, it must have pertained to the saving grace of God in Christ, the renewing work of the Holy Spirit, and the future coming of the Lord Jesus (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.11-13">2:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.4-7">3:4-7</a>). In this letter there is constant emphasis on the lifestyle that bears out the truth of the gospel—with application to different groups in the Christian community: older men and women, young women, young men, and slaves.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Salutation (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.1-4">1:1-4</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Greetings come from Paul—whose apostleship is described as a stewardship of the gospel that promotes faith and strengthens the knowledge of the truth, hope of eternal life, and godliness of living—to Titus, spoken of as “my true son in our common faith.”</p>
<p class="h3">Titus’s Work in Crete (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5-9">1:5-9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Titus was left behind in Crete to continue Paul’s work and to appoint elders in every church (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">Acts 14:23</a>). These elders are also called bishops (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.20.17,28">20:17, 28</a>)—that is, those with oversight of the church. The necessary qualities of life for these positions are described (cf. <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.2-7">1 Tm 3:2-7</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Dealing with False Teachings (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.10-16">1:10-16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The closing words of the previous section speak about the responsibility of elders “to encourage others with right teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The opposers were upsetting people, indeed “whole families,” by teaching what was not true. These false teachers were described by Paul in terms disparaging of Cretans, and as people whose lives do not demonstrate the knowledge of God that they professed to have.</p>
<p class="h3">Promoting Right Teaching (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.1-10">2:1-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Titus had a particular responsibility to “promote the kind of living that reflects right teaching.” He was charged to exhort the older men to exercise self-control (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.2">2:2</a>), and he was supposed to teach the older women to live godly lives (v <a href="?bref=Titus.2.3">3</a>). In turn, these women were supposed to train the younger women to live pure and loving lives in their homes so that no one will malign the word of God (vv <a href="?bref=Titus.2.4-5">4-5</a>). Younger men were to show self-control (v <a href="?bref=Titus.2.6">6</a>), and Titus himself was to be an example in word and life so that the opponents would have nothing bad to say about the Christians (vv <a href="?bref=Titus.2.7-8">7-8</a>). Finally, in this section slaves are taught to submit to their masters, to give good and honest service with the motivation that “then they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive in every way” (v <a href="?bref=Titus.2.10">10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Grace (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.11-15">2:11-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">What has been said leads now to a great statement of the purpose of the revelation of the grace of God in Jesus Christ: to bring salvation to all people, who will make a complete break with godless and sensual living so that they may live upright lives with the constant expectancy of the coming again of “our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.” Their lives will show them to be a people who are God’s very own, always eager to do what is right.</p>
<p class="h3">Doing What Is Good (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.1-8">3:1-8</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this section, Paul encourages Titus to tell the Christians at Crete that it is their duty to submit to rulers (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.13.1-7">Rom 13:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.13-17">1 Pt 2:13-17</a>) and to be available in the community for honest work. Again, the quality of lifestyle is emphasized—in particular, courtesy and the desire for peace in relationships with others. This lifestyle comes from spiritual transformation. The means of that transformation is the saving work of Christ—not merited, but entirely of his mercy. He has brought cleansing from sin, “rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Final Remarks and Greetings (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.9-15">3:9-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this final section, Paul encourages Titus to avoid those who like to debate about religion for the sake of debating. And he tells Titus how to deal with those who cause divisions.</p>
<p>Following this, Paul tells Titus that he will send him Artemas (not mentioned otherwise in the NT) or Tychicus. Then he encourages Titus to take care of Apollos and Zenas if they pass by Crete. Titus himself is supposed to come to Paul in Nicopolis before winter.</p>
<p>The epistle closes with a final exhortation to “good deeds” and to a spiritually fruitful life.</p>

<p class="list">1. Forefather of a family of people who returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem following the exile. This family was not able to prove their Jewish descent (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.60">Ezr 2:60</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.62">Neh 7:62</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ammonite who opposed Nehemiah when he arrived in Jerusalem about 445 <span class="era">BC</span>. Tobiah was known as “the Ammonite official” (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.10,19">Neh 2:10, 19</a>), a designation associated with a person of high office, such as a governor. He, together with Sanballat and Geshem, the other leading opponents of the reconstruction of the walls, were high-ranking officers in the Persian Empire. He was connected by marriage with the Jews in two ways. He married the daughter of Shecaniah, the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.18">6:18</a>). These marriage relations to a prominent Jerusalem family gave him strong ties with the Jerusalem aristocracy (v <a href="?bref=Neh.6.17">17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Nehemiah had to face the threat posed by Tobiah and his influential allies. Nehemiah was charged with the intent of leading the Jerusalem population in a revolt against King Artaxerxes (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">Neh 2:19</a>). As the work of rebuilding the wall progressed, Tobiah joined in the conspiracy of besieging Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Neh.4.8">4:8</a>). Nehemiah ordered the Jews to defend themselves. They continued their labors of repairing the wall with the protection of armed guards, and when the enemy forces came closer, every worker held a weapon in addition to his trowel (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.4.17-19">17-19</a>). They were encouraged by the belief that “our God will fight for us” (v <a href="?bref=Neh.4.20">20</a>). Tobiah also joined in the plot to assassinate Nehemiah after the walls were rebuilt (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.2-4">6:2-4</a>). Nehemiah was further tested by libelous reports of insurrection and by a Jerusalemite hired by the allies to tempt Nehemiah into entering the temple proper and thereby discredit his standing among the faithful (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.6.5-13">5-13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After Nehemiah left Jerusalem in order to report to Artaxerxes, Tobiah succeeded in reestablishing himself with those who had remained faithful to him. The priest Eliashib was also related to Tobiah and gave in to Tobiah by preparing a large room previously used for offerings in the temple (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.4-5">Neh 13:4-5</a>). Tobiah used these quarters when visiting Jerusalem. One of Nehemiah’s first actions, upon his return, was to evict Tobiah from the temple (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.13.8-9">8-9</a>) and then restore the room for its proper use.</p>

<p class="fl">The book, which may be described as a tale of pious fiction, was written by a devout Jew who was possibly a native of Palestine. A full-orbed monotheism is evident in the writer’s conception of the transcendent deity who is referred to as “the God of our fathers” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.8.5">Tb 8:5</a>), as “our Lord and God, he is our Father for ever” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.4">13:4</a>), and as “the King of heaven” (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.7,11,15">7, 11, 15</a>).</p>
<p>The work has come down to us in three recensions of the Greek text, in two Latin versions, two Syriac versions, four Hebrew versions, and in Ethiopic. Hebrew and Aramaic fragments have been discovered at Qumran; from this some have argued for a Semitic original. There is no notice in the work of Maccabean history, which makes a date after that time most unlikely. A number of historical as well as geographical errors militate against a date as early as the book purports to be from, and most scholars are inclined to date it around 200 <span class="era">BC</span> or a little later.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Since the historical character of the work cannot be sustained, it is appropriate to ask what the writer’s motivation and purpose might have been. He is apparently concerned to set forth the necessity of righteous conduct in view of the righteous character of God. Even when Tobit’s fortunes took a turn for the worse, he continued to perform acts of charity to his fellow Jews and was especially concerned to bury those who had been the victims of the king’s cruelty.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">Tobit was a pious Israelite of the tribe of Naphtali living in Nineveh. Despite his good works and uprightness, he became blind when birds defecated in his eyes. Greatly afflicted, he asked God to let him die (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.1.1-3.6">Tb 1:1–3:6</a>). On the very same day Sarah, Tobit’s young relative who lived in Ecbatana, also prayed for death. She had been married seven times, and every one of her husbands was killed on their wedding night by Asmodeus, a jealous demon (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.3.7-15">3:7-15</a>). And so the archangel Raphael was sent to help (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.3.16-17">16-17</a>). Tobit decided to send his son Tobias to the Median city of Rages (now Rai, near Teheran, Iran) to recover money left there with a friend. Raphael assumed a disguise and introduced himself as Tobit’s kinsman Azariah (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.5.13">5:13</a>). In this guise the angel went along as Tobias’s guide. They were accompanied by Tobias’s dog, Toby. Important things happened en route: Tobias caught a large fish; on the advice of Raphael, he kept its heart, liver, and gall for use as healing remedies (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>); at Ecbatana, the angel arranged the marriage of Tobias and Sarah; in the wedding chamber Tobias used the fish’s heart and liver to defeat Asmodeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.6.9-8.21">6:9–8:21</a>). Raphael succeeded in recovering Tobit’s money. Tobias, Sarah, Raphael, and the dog returned to Nineveh. There Tobias used the fish’s gall to heal his father’s eyes. Then, his mission accomplished, Raphael revealed his identity and disappeared. But Tobit was inspired by the archangel’s final exhortation and so recited his own praises to God (ch <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.1-18">13</a>). According to chapter <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.14.1-15">14</a>, Tobit lived happily to the age of 112. Before his death, he predicted the destruction of Nineveh. Upon his father’s advice, Tobias and Sarah returned to Ecbatana before this occurred.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Message">Message</p>
<p class="fl">Tobit gives us a good indication of the piety that characterized the Jews even prior to the period of the Maccabees. It is a beautiful portrayal of Jewish family life in postexilic times. The work was highly regarded by many of the church fathers. Luther spoke of it as “a truly beautiful, wholesome, and profitable fiction, the work of a gifted poet . . . a book useful and good for Christians to read.”</p>
<p>In Tobit, the mercy of God is emphasized. His mercy is exalted, for “all his ways are mercy and truth” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.3.2">3:2</a>). He is a Father to his people (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.4">13:4</a>). Although he afflicts them for their iniquities, he will show mercy (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.5">5</a>). And though he scatters them among the nations, he will not hide his face from them (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.6">13:6</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.14.5">14:5</a>). Even the Gentiles will one day come to acknowledge him, for “many nations will come from afar to the name of the Lord God, bearing gifts in their hands, gifts for the king of heaven” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.13.11">13:11</a>). In its ethical teaching Tobit sets a high moral tone: honor and respect of parents (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.4.3-4">4:3-4</a>); regard for God’s commandments (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.4.5">5</a>); the necessity of a disciplined life (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.4.14">14</a>); and the exhortation “what you hate, do not do to anyone” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.4.15">15</a>). As a religious romance, it occupied a unique place in Jewish households, and its influence in the history of Christianity has also been evident.</p>

Beth-togarmah was one of the principal trading partners of Tyre, providing war horses and mules.

  <title>Tongues, Speaking in</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TONGUES, Speaking in</p>
<p class="fl">Supernatural manifestation of speech in a language not known to the speaker; the Greek term is <span class="greek">glossolalia</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p>Tongues-speaking was first manifested in the early church on the Day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit filled 120 Christians meeting together. They burst out in praise to God in a multitude of different languages. According to <a href="?bref=Acts.2.8-11">Acts 2:8-11</a>, the audience of Jerusalem could understand them, since they were communicating the gospel in the hearers’ own languages. (Verses <a href="?bref=Acts.2.9-11">9-11</a> list about 16 nations whose representatives in Jerusalem hear the disciples speaking in their own language.) In subsequent occurrences, when a group of people were baptized in the Holy Spirit, the book of Acts indicates that they spoke in tongues (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.46">10:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.6">19:6</a>). But not all spoke in tongues when they received the Spirit (see <a href="?bref=Acts.8.15-17">8:15-17</a>), so it wasn’t <span class="ital">the</span> unique sign for having received the Holy Spirit. The Scripture teaches that all believers are baptized by the Spirit as they become integrated into the body of Christ, the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Cor 12:13</a>). The genuine evidence of the work of the Holy Spirit is the “fruit of the Spirit” as defined in <a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-23">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.</p>
<p>In the days of the early church, some Christians spoke in tongues and some didn’t. According to Paul, speaking in tongues, when practiced in the church meetings, required interpretation. If no one could give an interpretation, it was to be practiced as a private devotional exercise, for one’s own edification. As a means of private worship, the practice of glossolalia is tantamount to speaking to oneself and to God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.28">1 Cor 14:28</a>). However, under certain conditions formulated by Paul, glossolalia may become one of the spiritual gifts to be used in ministry to the church for the common good. In this case, the main concern is that the public use of glossolalia not be reduced to praying in tongues or speaking in tongues without interpretation.</p>
<p> In order to establish firmly the public practice of glossolalia as a ministry to the church and to prevent its abuse as a quest for personal fulfillment, Paul put forth a set of rules designed to control its corporate exercise (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.27-33">1 Cor 14:27-33</a>):</p>
<p class="list-space">1. A limit of one, two, or three persons is set for participation in tongues per worship session.</p>
<p class="list">2. The one, two, or three tongues-speakers are to make their contribution in sequence, “one at a time” or “in turn,” never simultaneously.</p>
<p class="list">3. Before a worshiper decides to speak in tongues, he or she is to secure an interpreter. Should no such person be available, he or she is to refrain from speaking in tongues.</p>
<p class="list">4. The person speaking in tongues should not be the one to provide the interpretation (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.10">1 Cor 12:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. If there are too many believers speaking in tongues and not enough interpreters, the former should pray, instead, for the power to interpret (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.13">1 Cor 14:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. When the contribution in tongues has been interpreted in intelligible language, it becomes a prophecy that needs to be evaluated by the recipients.</p>
<p class="list">7. The genuineness of the experience is to be tested by those who have the ability to distinguish between spirits (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.10">1 Cor 12:10</a>) so that they can test everything, hold fast to what is good, and abstain from every form of evil.</p>
<p class="sp">Persons participating in worship should be in control of their conduct at all times. They may not appeal to ecstatic states to excuse disorderly conduct or infractions to the rules of worship. Disorder and confusion are not inspired by God, since he is a God of peace and unity.</p>
<p>The gift of tongues is not to be desired or sought after. Only the “higher gifts” involving communication through directly intelligible speech are to be earnestly desired (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.31">1 Cor 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.1,5">14:1, 5</a>). However, should the gift of tongues be present, it should not be stifled, provided it can be used according to the rules and for the common good.</p>

<p class="h1">TOPHETH</p>
<p class="fl">Location within the valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem where Israel profaned the Lord by offering human sacrifices to Molech. As part of his religious reform, Josiah defiled Topheth and tore down its altars (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">2 Kgs 23:10</a>). Josiah’s reforms appear to have had only temporary impact, for the practice recurred under Manasseh (<a href="?bref=2Chr.33.6">2 Chr 33:6</a>) and was later condemned by Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.31-32">Jer 7:31-32</a>). Jeremiah prophesied that the valley would be renamed the “Valley of Slaughter” because it would be the site where the Babylonians would rout Judah during their siege of Jerusalem. Jeremiah repeated the prophecy during his parable of the potter’s flask, emphasizing the fact that Jerusalem would be destroyed so thoroughly that it would resemble Topheth (<a href="?bref=Jer.19.12">19:12</a>). By this time, Topheth had evidently become a sort of city dump where broken pottery was thrown away and where burials that could not be accommodated in any of the city cemeteries would take place (v <a href="?bref=Jer.19.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>While Topheth is not mentioned in the NT, it is linked to Gehenna (Aramaic form of “valley of Hinnom”). Gehenna refers to the place of destruction and is typically translated “hell” in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22,29-30">Mt 5:22, 29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.9">18:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.43-47">Mk 9:43-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">Lk 12:5</a>).</p>

  <title>Torah*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TORAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Word translated “law” in the OT, derived from the Hebrew verbal root <span class="hebrew">yarah</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to throw” or “to shoot.” The idea behind the word is to inform, instruct, direct, or guide. In Jewish tradition it is most frequently used to designate the text of the first five books of the Bible, also called the Pentateuch. Quite properly, however, the word has a wider meaning, acknowledged by OT usage, which embraces all directives that come from God. This is true in the NT as well where <span class="hebrew">torah</span>—represented by the Greek <span class="greek">nomos</span>—may refer to either the Mosaic legislation (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.14">Rom 7:14</a>) or a broad behavioral principle (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.31">9:31</a>).</p>
<p>For the Jew, the law includes what has been called the “oral Torah,” that is, the sayings of the rabbis and venerated fathers of Judaism throughout the centuries. Such verbal tradition, while not part of the canonical books of the OT, seeks to interpret the texts of the Law to enable people to comply with the will of God. This method has often resulted in lessening the demands in the Law through reinterpreting them. Without temple worship, priesthood, or sacrifice—all prescribed by the Torah—such compromise with the Torah’s demands became inevitable. These oral traditions were firmly entrenched at the time of Christ’s advent and were held by many Jews to have been implicit in the Torah given to Moses (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.7.3">Mk 7:3</a>).</p>
<p>The Pharisees believed that the failure of the Jews to obey the Torah resulted in the great Babylonian captivity in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. Furthermore, it is commonly taught that until the Torah is rigorously subscribed to by all Jews, the Messiah will not appear upon the earth.</p>
<p>For the Sadducees, the Torah represented the only part of the OT that they accepted as authoritative. Their tendency, however, was to deemphasize the supernatural elements in the Pentateuch. Contrary to their viewpoint on resurrection, Jesus Christ quoted from the Torah to affirm eternal life (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.22.31-32">Mt 22:31-32</a>).</p>
<p>From the most ancient days, the reading of the Torah in the synagogue has been accompanied by great ceremony. To be called upon to read from these sacred scrolls is a high honor. It is written in Hebrew by a highly skilled craftsman known as a <span class="hebrew">sofer</span><span class="ital">,</span> or scribe. The Torah is found in the form of a roll, the scroll for which is of parchment taken from the skin of ceremonially clean animals. The rods around which the Torah is rolled are usually of wood, silver, or ivory. Ornately designed ends of the rods are magnificent aesthetic creations frequently wrought in precious metals and stones. A person reading from the scroll uses a delicate pointer, called a <span class="hebrew">yad</span><span class="ital">,</span> to follow the words. Use of the pointer safeguards the scroll, which would soon be damaged by the constant running of fingers over the fine manuscript. Moreover, the <span class="hebrew">yad</span> minimizes the possibility for error in oral recitation by preventing the reader from losing his place and possibly skipping some words of God’s sacred revelation.</p>
<p>Among Jewish orthodoxy it is maintained that inasmuch as the Torah was the gift of God to Israel, the gentile nations are not required to submit to its regulations. However, Maimonides, the medieval Jewish scholar, taught that Gentiles would have a share in the world to come by obeying the covenant God made with Noah. Seven commands are commonly linked to that agreement, namely, the abstaining from idolatry, incest, shedding of blood, profaning the name of God, injustice, robbery, and eating the flesh of live animals.</p>
<p>The new covenant maintains that the Torah, while a necessary stage in the outworking of redemption, was never given to enable individuals to receive salvation on the basis of obeying the law. Although <a href="?bref=Lev.18.5">Leviticus 18:5</a> appears to hold out the possibility of working for righteousness, flawless obedience to God’s will is beyond the reach of fallen humanity. The OT clearly bore witness to the role of grace in redemption by revealing the great patriarch Abraham to be justified by faith (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Gn 15</a>). Since that covenant preceded the Torah by four centuries, it presents an unalterable witness to the way in which God receives sinful people. A primary function of the law is to reveal people’s fallen spiritual condition and thereby serve as a tutor leading them to Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.24">Gal 3:24</a>). As a sinner is exposed to the demands of the law, he or she is convicted of great sinfulness (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.7">Rom 7:7</a>) and consequently seeks the grace of God in Christ. It is clear that Jesus Christ held the Torah in high regard, the purpose of his ministry being the fulfillment of its contents. That great work of satisfying the demands of the law is reckoned in the lives of all who entrust themselves to Christ; he is the end of the law so that everyone who has faith in him may be justified (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.4">Rom 10:4</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TRACHONITIS*, TRACONITIS</p>
<p class="fl">One of the five Roman provinces east of the Jordan River, along with Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, and Iturea. The region of Traconitis (apparently including Gaulanitis, Batanea, and Auranitis) was part of the tetrarchy of Philip, the brother of Herod (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). Traconitis was an extremely desolate region northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Its name in Aramaic was Argob, which signified that the region was a “heap of stones.” Other than the reference in Luke, Traconitis is seldom mentioned in historical references. Josephus suggests that it was colonized by Uz, the son of Aram (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.23">Gn 10:23</a>). The Romans gained control of the region when Augustus deposed Zenodorus, a local robber-chieftain. Herod the Great was deeded the land on the condition that he control the local bandits. Philip received the land at the death of his father but apparently retained only nominal control over the region. The region is currently named el-Lejah and is located in southern Syria and northern Jordan.</p>

<p class="h1">TRADITION</p>
<p class="fl">Respect for tradition was particularly strong among Jews during the period at the beginning of the Christian era. Among these traditions, the most important collection was <span class="ital">Pirke Aboth</span> (Traditions of the Fathers). This consisted of comments by famous rabbis in explanation of the written Law. This and a growing collection of other rabbinic traditions interpreting the Law became an authoritative commentary on the written code. This collection was esteemed to be equal to the written Law.</p>
<p>The Pharisees used the expression “tradition of the elders” when speaking to Jesus about hand washing (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.2">Mt 15:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.5">Mk 7:5</a>). In his response, Jesus referred to the “traditions of men,” thus drawing attention to their human origin. In fact, in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.8">Mark 7:8</a>, he definitely set the commandment of God over these traditions, which had become a burden to the people. Jesus strongly criticized the scribes and Pharisees for the way these traditions were enforced (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-39">Mt 23</a>). He noted that adherence to the tradition had become more important than the moral and personal effect of the teaching.</p>

  <title>Tradition*, Oral</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TRADITION*, Oral</p>
<p class="fl">Oral tradition is both sharply distinguished from written tradition and yet closely connected with it. Many literary traditions are based on oral traditions, making it necessary to investigate how transitions were made from one to the other.</p>
<p>In the ancient Near East, all significant events were committed to writing by the scribes. At the same time, an oral version of the occurrences would enable the information to be disseminated in contemporary society, and perhaps also to subsequent generations. It is important to realize the coexistence of written and oral forms of the same material, so that the way in which material was transmitted will be understood properly.</p>
<p>Oral transmission was very important in Judaism, and one of the strongest characteristics of rabbinic theology is the importance attached to the oral law in addition to the written Law. This oral law consisted of traditional interpretations that had been handed down from teacher to pupil. In the course of the passing on of the tradition, further explanations of basic principles were added. Rabbinic literature supplies many indications of the careful methods that were used in the schools for the study of the Law. The teacher’s main aim was to ensure that the disciples accurately memorized the content of the teaching. There is no doubt that in rabbinic Judaism the passing on of the oral tradition had developed into a highly organized technique.</p>
<p>Such care is not surprising in view of the fact that the oral law carried equal weight with the written Law. It was essential that the transmission of this tradition should not be left to chance. Authorized oral tradition was an essential feature of Jewish life. There is little doubt that in the earliest period the words and works of Jesus were passed on by word of mouth. Whether Jesus himself followed the rabbinic teaching method is doubtful, but as much care went into preserving his teachings as the rabbis used in preserving their oral law.</p>

  <title>Transfiguration*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TRANSFIGURATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Event in Jesus’ earthly ministry described in four passages in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-8">Mt 17:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2-8">Mk 9:2-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-36">Lk 9:28-36</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-18">2 Pt 1:16-18</a>), wherein Jesus was glorified in the presence of three disciples: James, Peter, and John.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLocationoftheEvent">The Location of the Event</p>
<p class="fl">The exact site where the Transfiguration took place is not given in the NT. <a href="?bref=Matt.17.1">Matthew 17:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">Mark 9:2</a> simply state that it took place on a “high mountain.” Various suggestions have been made as to which mountain, with the traditional site being Mt Tabor, a round hill located in the plain of Esdraelon approximately 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) southwest of the Sea of Galilee. There are, however, two major problems with this suggested location. For one, it is difficult to see how Mt Tabor can justifiably be called a “high mountain,” for it is less than 2,000 feet (609.6 meters) above sea level. Second, in the time of Jesus a Roman garrison was stationed on Mt Tabor, and thus it would be unlikely that Jesus would have walked with his disciples up this mountain. A second suggestion for the site is Mt Carmel, which is located on the coast, but this seems off the main route of Jesus’ travel after the events of Caesarea Philippi. A third suggestion is Mt Hermon, which is over 9,000 feet (2,743.2 meters) high and lies about 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) to the northeast of Caesarea Philippi. Mt Hermon is indeed a high mountain and has the additional advantage of being located near Caesarea Philippi.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheEvent">The Event</p>
<p class="fl">Six days after the events of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus took Peter, James, and John to be alone with him on a high mountain. As on several other instances, these three disciples alone accompanied Jesus (cf. also <a href="?bref=Mark.5.35-43">Mk 5:35-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32-42">14:32-42</a>). According to the Gospel accounts, three things took place at the Transfiguration:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. “He was transfigured.” The various accounts all witness to an unusual transformation of Jesus. Jesus is transfigured: “his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light” (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.2">Mt 17:2</a>). This transformation is described in Matthew and Mark by the Greek verb <span class="greek">metamorpheo</span><span class="ital">,</span> the root for the word “metamorphosis.” This indicates that a tremendous change occurred.</p>
<p class="list">2. Moses and Elijah appeared and spoke to Jesus. These men, who undoubtedly represent the Law and the Prophets, are said to have spoken to Jesus of his “exodus,” or departure (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.31">Lk 9:31</a>). The term used in <a href="?bref=Luke.9.31">Luke 9:31</a> to describe Jesus’ “exodus” (or death) is rather unusual and clearly portrays the death of Jesus not as a tragedy or defeat but as a victorious journey.</p>
<p class="list">3. After Peter’s remark that it was good for the three disciples to be present and witness this, and after his suggestion that they build three booths, a voice came from heaven saying, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">Mk 9:7</a>). These words were clearly a rebuke for Peter having placed Jesus on the same level as Moses and Elijah. To make three booths (one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for Jesus) loses sight of who Jesus is, and the voice from heaven pointed out Peter’s error. The rebuke also must be understood in light of what Peter had said a few days earlier at Caesarea Philippi. Had Peter forgotten that he had just said to Jesus, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God”?</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMeaningoftheEvent">The Meaning of the Event</p>
<p class="fl">In order to understand the significance of the Transfiguration, it is important to contrast the heavenly voice at Jesus’ transfiguration with the heavenly voice at Jesus’ baptism. At the baptism both <a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mark 1:11</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.3.22">Luke 3:22</a> indicate that the voice was addressed to Jesus: “You are my beloved Son.” At the Transfiguration, however, the voice is not addressed to Jesus but to Peter, James, and John: “This is my beloved Son” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">Mk 9:7</a>). Clearly the events of the Transfiguration are primarily directed toward the disciples rather than Jesus. “He was transfigured before them” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">2</a>); “there appeared to them Elijah with Moses” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.9.4">4</a>); “a cloud overshadowed them . . . ‘listen to him’ ” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">7</a>); “they no longer saw any one with them but Jesus only” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.9.8">8</a>). Evidently from these references, the incident is not meant so much for Jesus’ sake as for the disciples’. Following closely after the events of Caesarea Philippi, God appeared to affirm at the Transfiguration what Peter had previously confessed at Caesarea Philippi: Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-18">2 Peter 1:16-18</a> the writer recounts that he was an eyewitness of the Transfiguration. John seems to have done the same thing when he wrote the prologue to his Gospel and said, “We have beheld his glory” (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>). At the Transfiguration the true form (Greek <span class="greek">morphe</span>) of the Son of God temporarily broke through the veil of his humanity and the disciples saw his preexistent glory. In this transformation of Jesus, the three disciples witnessed something of Jesus’ preincarnate glory, as well as his future glory, which he received at his resurrection and which all will see when he returns to judge the world.</p>
<p>When Christ returns in his glory, all the believers will be transfigured and thereby receive a glorious, resurrected body. Thus, Christ’s transfiguration is the preview of every believer’s transfiguration (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.42-45">1 Cor 15:42-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.20-21">Phil 3:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.4">Col 3:4</a>).</p>

  <title>Transformation</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TRANSFORMATION</p>
<p class="fl">An inward renewal and reshaping of the mind through which a Christian’s inner person is changed into the likeness of Christ. Paul told the Roman believers, “Be transformed by the renewing of your minds” (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>). As one’s Christian life progresses, the person should gradually notice that his or her thought life is being changed from Christlessness to Christlikeness. Transformation does not happen overnight—regeneration is instantaneous, but transformation is not. Christians are transformed to Christ’s image gradually as they spend time beholding him in intimate fellowship. Eventually, they will begin to mirror the one they behold. Paul said, “We all with unveiled face, mirroring the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from one degree of glory to another, even as from the Lord who is the Spirit” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>—from the Greek). This does not come from conscious imitation but from spiritual communion with the Lord. The result will be beyond our expectations. The apostle John said it well: “We can’t even imagine what we will be like when Christ returns. But we do know that when he comes we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.2">1 Jn 3:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

In the OT the expression “beyond the Jordan” is often used for the area (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.10-11">Gn 50:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.20">Dt 3:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.47">4:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.10">Jos 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.8">13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.7">18:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.17">Jgs 5:17</a>), although the same expression is used occasionally for the area west of Jordan (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.25">Dt 3:25</a>).

<p class="fl">In biblical times travelers found roads bad and often impassable. Sea voyages were made in comparatively small ships, usually by military and commercial personnel, and hardly ever for simple tourist traffic. With little reason to travel, ordinary citizens tended to remain in fairly limited areas. From time to time, there were group migrations, and sometimes people traveled for religious festivals or fled from war or famine.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TravelOnTheAppianWay"/>
<p class="h2" id="TravelinOldTestamentTimes">Travel in Old Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">Several accounts depict the people of Israel moving over restricted areas to graze their flocks. Joseph’s brothers took their flocks from the south of the land up to Shechem and then to Dothan (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.12-17">Gn 37:12-17</a>), but this was a mere 60 miles (96.5 kilometers). David traveled around Palestine and even went to Moab (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.3">1 Sm 22:3</a>). The Danites moved from their home southwest of Jerusalem to the north, just south of the Lebanon Mountains (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">Jgs 18</a>).</p>
<p>Examples of travel for pasturage, migration, and protection could be multiplied. Such travelers would normally walk, though the ass was used both for riding and as a pack animal. The ox was employed for transporting heavy loads and sometimes for people (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.5">Gn 46:5</a>). Later the camel came into general use (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2">1 Kgs 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.9">2 Kgs 8:9</a>). Little is known of resting places for travelers in OT times. There are only a few references to a “lodging place” (<span class="hebrew">malon</span>) in OT narratives (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.27">Gn 42:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.21">43:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.4.24">Ex 4:24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TravelinNewTestamentTimes">Travel in New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">The Roman world knew a great deal of travel: to fulfill religious obligations at festival time, for trade, for government administration, for military purposes. Not the least among first-century travelers were the early Christian missionaries.</p>
<p>The advent of Roman peace and authority and the construction of well-made stone roads made travel relatively safe and quick. The modes of travel improved over that known in OT times. Long distances were traveled within the Roman Empire over good roads and in comparative safety. There were some hazards, however, notably in sea travel, from wind, storms, and pirates (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39">Acts 15:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.18-22">18:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.24-25">Rom 15:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.25-26">2 Cor 11:25-26</a>). Paul’s sea journey to Rome, for example, was perilous (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-28.14">Acts 27:1–28:14</a>).</p>
<p>The NT mentions a number of journeys on foot. Mary journeyed from Galilee to Judea to visit Elizabeth (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.39-40,56">Lk 1:39-40, 56</a>). The baby Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the census (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-7">2:1-7</a>); Jesus was brought to Jerusalem to comply with the Jewish purification law (v <a href="?bref=Luke.2.22">22</a>). Thus three trips were made from Nazareth to Jerusalem, a distance of about 70 miles (112.6 kilometers), from the time of Jesus’ conception to Mary’s purification. The annual Passover visit was made by Joseph and Mary (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.2.41-51">41-51</a>). Other journeys are mentioned (<a href="?bref=John.2.13">Jn 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.1-10">7:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.1">12:1</a>). Jesus himself walked to Jericho from Galilee (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1-11">Mk 1:1-11</a>) and also to the region of Tyre and Sidon (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.24">7:24</a>). He was in Samaria more than once (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.11">Lk 17:11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.4">Jn 4:4</a>). His last journey to Jerusalem was via Jericho and up through the hills to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.1,46">Mk 10:1, 46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.1">11:1</a>). His last journey after the resurrection was to Emmaus (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.13-35">Lk 24:13-35</a>).</p>
<p>Paul traveled by sea on each of his missionary journeys (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-14">Acts 13:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.41-18.22">15:41–18:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.23-21.17">18:23–21:17</a>), generally accompanied by friends. He also made many journeys on foot in Palestine, Asia Minor, and the Greek peninsula. But not all travel was on foot in NT times. The ass, used for carrying loads, often carried people. Jesus once rode from Bethphage to Jerusalem, a short but highly symbolic journey (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.2-7">Mt 21:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.1-11">Mk 11:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.12-15">Jn 12:12-15</a>). When Joseph traveled with his pregnant wife, Mary, to Bethlehem for the census at the time of Jesus’ birth, Mary probably rode on an ass. The Ethiopian eunuch was riding in a chariot after worshiping at Jerusalem and was joined by Philip traveling on foot (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.26-38">Acts 8:26-38</a>). Roman soldiers both marched and made wide use of horses. When Paul was brought to Caesarea from Jerusalem, mounts were prepared for him (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.23-24">23:23-24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="RoadsandSeaLanes">Roads and Sea Lanes</p>
<p class="fl">The roads of biblical times figured prominently in the geography, topography, and history of Palestine—a land that served as a bridge between Egypt and centers of civilization and trade in the Middle East. Many of the roads were strategically important, both commercially and militarily. Some roads gained significance as pilgrim routes to facilitate travel to religious centers like Jerusalem. Roads in biblical times were of three main types: long-distance international roads, medium-distance intraregional roads, and a variety of roads inside each region or state.</p>
<p class="h3">Great International Roads</p>
<p class="fl">These linked the Mediterranean coast to the northern Tigris Valley and southern Mesopotamia. Some linked Mesopotamia to Asia Minor, while others led south to Egypt, either along the coast or east of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea and across the Sinai Peninsula. There were trade routes between Anatolia and Assyria early in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Apparently the military campaign referred to in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Genesis 14</a> aimed to secure the great trade route, the King’s Highway, from northern Mesopotamia to Egypt. Military invaders and travelers from Babylonia, Assyria, and Persia would head across the hinterlands of Syria toward the coast before turning south into Palestine and Egypt. The advent of European powers, Greece and Rome, into the Middle East opened up another vast network of international roads for the peoples of the East. Until Roman times, these roads were not surfaced with stone but were cleared pathways. They were very rough, ungraded, and in wet weather, impassable in many places. But they were evidently well defined by “waymarks” and “guideposts” (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.21">Jer 31:21</a>). With the coming of the Romans, important roads were built with deep foundations and with large blocks of flat stone at the surface. The remains of these roads are still seen in many places in the Middle East and in Europe. Distance markers or milestones were regularly placed along the roads.</p>
<p class="h3">International North-South Roads in Palestine</p>
<p class="fl">The roads that linked countries to the north with Egypt passed through Palestine, a natural land bridge. There were three major roads. The coastal road began in Damascus and passed via Hazor across the plain of Esdraelon, through the Megiddo Pass, down the coast past Gaza and into Egypt. This was probably “the way of the sea” (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1">Is 9:1</a>). The Sinai road led from Egypt into the southern Negev and then to Kadesh-barnea, Beersheba, Hebron, Jerusalem, Shechem, Acco, Tyre, and Sidon. The Red Sea road entered the Palestine area from the Gulf of Aqaba, where the ancient port of Elath and Solomon’s port of Ezion-geber stood (<a href="?bref=Num.33.35">Nm 33:35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.17">2 Chr 8:17</a>). From there it led through the mountainous areas of Transjordan, crossing the deep wadis and then north through the Hauran region to Damascus. This was the road taken by caravans from southern Arabia to Damascus, the ancient King’s Highway (<a href="?bref=Num.20.17">Nm 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.21.22">21:22</a>).</p>
<p>There were other north-south roads of lesser importance. One coastal road led from Joppa via Caesarea and Dor to Acco, where it linked with the Sinai road. Evidently it was not very significant until Roman times, when the port of Caesarea was built. The marshes in the plain of Sharon posed many problems. The plain of Esdraelon was also marshy and interrupted the roads north in bad seasons. A raised road across the swampy sections was eventually constructed. Another road led north from Hazor, branching off the main trunk road to Damascus. The Jordan Valley road skirted the southwestern part of Galilee and led down the Jordan Valley to Jericho.</p>
<p class="h3">East-West Roads</p>
<p class="fl">Several important roads ran east-west, intersecting the larger roads leading north. One such road led from Gaza to Beersheba and then down the Arabah, with an offshoot to Petra. Another led from Ashkelon, via Gath, to Hebron and on to En-gedi on the Dead Sea. Another road led from Joppa east up the valley of Aijalon (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.6-14">Jos 10:6-14</a>) to Bethel and on to Jericho. One well-used road led from Joppa to Shechem, across the Jordan at Adam (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.16">3:16</a>) and into Gilead in Transjordan. Other roads led from Acco eastward to Galilee and also up the coast to Tyre and Sidon. There were, indeed, numerous east-west roads that provided contact between various parts of Palestine. In Roman times, when the speedy movement of armies was essential, some of the old roads were greatly improved and new ones built.</p>
<p class="h3">Sea Lanes</p>
<p class="fl">The people of Israel, unlike the Phoenicians, seldom used the sea lanes. When Solomon planned to send ships down the Red Sea to Ophir (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-28">1 Kgs 9:26-28</a>), he used Phoenician seamen. Jehoshaphat planned a similar expedition, but his ships were wrecked (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48-49">22:48-49</a>). Coastal traffic in OT times was in the hands of Philistines and Phoenicians. There were several ports along the Mediterranean Sea coast, such as Gaza, Joppa, Dor, and Acco, but none was very good. There were also sea lanes linking the Mediterranean coast with Egypt and distant Tarshish (probably Spain). The other coastal water was the Gulf of Aqaba with its two ports—Ezion-geber for Transjordan, and Elath for west of the Jordan. Solomon’s fleet used Ezion-geber as its home port.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientShipOfTheLargestSize"/>
<p>In NT times things changed considerably. The Middle East produced commodities used by peoples farther west, especially the Romans. Alexandria in Egypt and Antioch in Syria handled both cargo and travelers. Smaller ports like those in Palestine and many others around the coast of Asia Minor provided a haven for ships. One ingenious scheme to avoid a 200-mile (321.8-kilometer) journey around the Greek peninsula was to drag small boats across the five-mile- (8-kilometer-) wide isthmus at Corinth. Even the largest ship in NT times was in danger from wind and storm at sea (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-44">Acts 27</a>), so sea travel was undertaken preferably when the risk of storms was minimal, roughly from November to March. There was a lot of sea traffic in the Mediterranean Sea at appropriate seasons, largely for trade. Grain ships crossed regularly from Rome to Egypt and to the east.</p>
<p>Ships were driven by sail power supplemented as necessary by oars operated by slaves. Some indication of the size of ships comes from the discovery of ancient wrecks and from Latin and Greek literature. An old dry dock 130 feet (39.6 meters) long found near Athens was once used for Greek war vessels, which were smaller than the cargo vessels. The Roman writer Lucian refers to an Alexandrian grain ship 180 feet (54.9 meters) long, suggesting a capacity of about 1,200 tons (1,088.6 metric tons). Paul’s ship carried 276 persons (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.37">Acts 27:37</a>). Modern underwater archaeology is providing valuable information about these ancient ships.</p>
<p class="h3">Reasons for Travel</p>
<p class="fl">The most important reason for travel in NT times was for trade and commerce, which involved far more than merely transporting goods. There were agents, supervisors, insurers of cargo, bankers, and a whole range of people involved in the acquisition and safe delivery of the cargo.</p>
<p>Military travel was considerable. A wide variety of tasks had to be undertaken in the way of reconnaissance, procuring of supplies, forward arrangements for the bivouacking of troops, and the transport of both troops and equipment.</p>
<p>Some travelers were tradespeople changing their place of employment, like Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2-3">Acts 18:2-3</a>). Aquila had traveled from Pontus on the Black Sea to Rome and then, in a time of persecution, he had fled to Corinth with his wife. Many others traveled for similar reasons.</p>
<p>People on religious pilgrimage traveled by land or sea. Jews from many lands journeyed to Jerusalem for the annual Passover festivities (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.5-11">Acts 2:5-11</a>). Non-Jews went to religious centers at Ephesus, Athens, and Eleusis, where there were important temples. Many minor temples also attracted pilgrims. The construction of new temples and a variety of government administration buildings brought craftsmen from afar. Often the materials used in construction had to be transported to the site. Some people made trips for health reasons to temples famed for healing miracles or to enjoy the benefits of hot springs like those at Capernaum or Tiberias. Athletes traveled to centers for important contests like the Olympic games, and crowds of people flocked to witness the spectacle. Some travelers were students or teachers going to great centers of learning—the universities of those times. Yet others traveled as official emissaries bearing important government and commercial documents. Despite all this activity, vast numbers of ordinary citizens hardly ever traveled more than a few miles from their homes.</p>

  <title>Treasurer</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TREASURER</p>
<p class="fl">An officer in charge of financial matters. In OT times he had charge of the royal or sacred treasures, which consisted of goods, documents, money, and jewels. He was steward of the king’s possessions and overseer of the treasury. David appointed Azmaveth over the king’s treasuries, Jonathan over the treasuries in cities and villages (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.25">1 Chr 27:25</a>), and Ahijah over the temple treasuries (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.20">26:20</a>). Solomon’s temple treasury was in the care of Jehiel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.7-8">29:7-8</a>). In Isaiah’s day there was a treasurer for the household named Shebna (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.15">Is 22:15</a>). An inscription found near Jerusalem may record his name.</p>
<p>Treasurers held positions in other lands too. King Cyrus of Persia entrusted his temple treasures to Mithredath (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.8">Ezr 1:8</a>). Artaxerxes ordered the treasurers of the province “beyond the river” to supply funds to Ezra the priest (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.21-22">7:21-22</a>). Nehemiah appointed treasurers over storehouses to distribute goods (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.44">Neh 12:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.13">13:13</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, two treasurers are known. The Ethiopian eunuch was in charge of the treasury of Candace, queen of Ethiopia (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.27">Acts 8:27</a>), and Erastus was the city treasurer of Corinth (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">Rom 16:23</a>). An inscription left at Corinth by Erastus, a Roman treasurer, may be his.</p>

  <title>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL</p>
<p class="fl">Forbidden tree in Eden, whose fruit imparted knowledge and subsequent death, i.e., separation from God and ultimate expiration (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.9,15-17">Gn 2:9, 15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">3:1-24</a>). The tempting serpent promised Eve equality with God if she ate the fruit. The result of Eve and Adam eating from this tree was that they indeed attained the “knowledge of good and evil.” According to the usage of the phrasing “knowing good and evil” in the rest of the Bible (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.39">Dt 1:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.15-16">Is 7:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.14">Heb 5:14</a>), the idea is that it describes a stage in a child’s life when he or she passes from innocence to moral awareness.</p>
<p>Accompanying this knowledge is sexual self-awareness. Thus, when Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, they became aware of their own sexuality. At the same time, they were able to see as God saw and thereby thought that God would shame them for their nakedness. The story came to symbolize the loss of innocence and divine companionship through deliberate disobedience in an attempt to attain godhood.</p>
<p>The sad result of eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was that Adam and Eve lost their innocence and were subsequently separated from God. Banishment from Eden followed to prevent the eating of fruit from a second tree, “the tree of life,” which would have made them immortal. But they would have been immortal in their fallen, sinful state. Thus, it was a blessing to banish them.</p>

  <title>Tree of Life</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TREE OF LIFE</p>
<p class="fl">Tree placed by God in the midst of the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.8-9">Gn 2:8-9</a>), a tree whose fruit could give eternal life. God told Adam that he could eat from every tree of the Garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">16-17</a>). When Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were expelled from the garden lest they “take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever” (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.22">3:22</a>).</p>
<p>The Genesis narrative suggests that God intended the tree of life to provide Adam and Eve with a symbol of life in fellowship with and dependence on him. Human life, as distinguished from that of the animals, is much more than merely biological; it is also spiritual—it finds its deepest fulfillment in fellowship with God. Life in the fullness of its physical and spiritual dimensions, however, could remain a person’s possession only so long as he or she remained obedient to God’s command (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.17">Gn 2:17</a>). Apart from Genesis, the only other OT occurrences of the phrase the “tree of life” are found in Proverbs (quoted here from <span class="sc">rsv</span>), where it symbolizes the enrichment of life in various ways. In <a href="?bref=Pr.3.18">Proverbs 3:18</a> wisdom is referred to as “a tree of life to those who lay hold of her”; in <a href="?bref=Pr.11.30">11:30</a> “the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life”; in <a href="?bref=Pr.13.12">13:12</a> a fulfilled desire is as “a tree of life”; and in <a href="?bref=Pr.15.4">15:4</a> “a gentle tongue is a tree of life.”</p>
<p>The book of Revelation contains the only references to the tree of life in the NT (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.7">Rv 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.2,14,19">22:2, 14, 19</a>). The Bible begins and ends with a Paradise in the midst of which is a tree of life. The way to the tree of life, which was closed in <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Genesis 3</a>, is open again for God’s believing people. This was made possible by the second Adam, Jesus Christ. Those who have washed their robes in the blood of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.7.14">Rv 7:14</a>) and have sought forgiveness of their sin through the redemptive work of Christ, receive the right to the tree of life (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.14">22:14</a>), but the disobedient will have no access to it.</p>

  <title>Tribulation</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TRIBULATION</p>
<p class="fl">An experience of suffering, distress, affliction, trouble, or persecution. The Greek word appears in the NT about 45 times. There is a Hebrew equivalent that appears in four or five OT passages, never in the prophetic books. Therefore, it is appropriate to focus mainly on the NT for a definition of tribulation.</p>
<p>The NT contains a few references where the word “tribulation” is used to denote the hardships that occur in the lives of common people. The labor pains of a woman in childbirth (<a href="?bref=John.16.21">Jn 16:21</a>), the worldly concerns that arise in marriage (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.28">1 Cor 7:28</a>), and the affliction of widows (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.27">Jas 1:27</a>) are all called tribulation. In a more general way, a scourge like the famine that afflicted Egypt and Canaan during the patriarchal age is characterized as “great tribulation” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.11">Acts 7:11</a>).</p>
<p>In a more narrow sense, the word “tribulation” refers to a specific Christian experience. The teachings of Christ provide basic definitions for this meaning of “tribulation.” He said that whenever the gospel is present in the world, tribulation becomes its unavoidable corollary. As the word of the gospel is sown, tribulation and persecution appear spontaneously (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.21">Mt 13:21</a>).</p>
<p>This concept of the ineluctable presence of tribulation during the church age is carefully developed in Jesus’ teaching on future events in the Olivet discourse (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">Mt 24–25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.1-38">Lk 21</a>). This discourse provides the only explicit description of, and clear chronological reference available in the Bible to, the tribulation of his followers. In it, Jesus predicted the time of the beginning, the extent, and the end of tribulation. This teaching on the tribulation was handed down to the 12 disciples privately, as a matter directly relevant to their lives (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.3">Mt 24:3</a>). Jesus told the Twelve that they would be delivered up to tribulation and that this tribulation would take the form of persecution to the death for his name’s sake (v <a href="?bref=Matt.24.9">9</a>). The context of this teaching indicates that the tribulation taught by Jesus would affect Christians in many places throughout history. But the fact that Jesus predicted to the 12 disciples that they would fall victim to the tribulation, at the very beginning of the sufferings (v <a href="?bref=Matt.24.8">8</a>), provides a clear reference to the starting point of the tribulation during the disciples’ lifetimes.</p>
<p>Likewise, the same group of disciples were to be witnesses of the “great tribulation” that would befall Jerusalem as predicted by the prophet Daniel (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.15-21">Mt 24:15-21</a>). It is clear that, in the Olivet discourse, Jesus was referring to the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. The fall of Jerusalem at the hands of the Roman legions was to be viewed as an archetypal representation of the perennial tribulation. This is attested to by Matthew’s parenthetical editorial comment in <a href="?bref=Matt.24.15">24:15</a> (“let the reader understand”), intended to alert his original readers to the fulfillment of Jesus’ prediction within their lifetimes. Moreover, the parallel section in <a href="?bref=Luke.21.20-24">Luke 21:20-24</a> makes it clear that the desolation of Jewish Jerusalem would be followed by a long period of gentile domination, which is precisely what happened after <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>The NT forewarns believers of the inevitability of tribulation; it also prescribes the appropriate response of Christians. They should rejoice because tribulation produces perseverance and strength of character (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.3-4">Rom 5:3-4</a>). They should bear it patiently (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.12">12:12</a>), knowing that God comforts the faithful in all tribulations (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.4">2 Cor 1:4</a>) and that the present tribulation prepares believers for incomparable glory in eternity (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.17">2 Cor 4:17</a>).</p>
<p>Except for rare and exceptional circumstances that enable Christians to enjoy affluence and freedom, most believers throughout history have suffered tribulation. The normal vocation of the church has been to endure as a beleaguered and persecuted minority in a hostile world. For Christians providentially protected from tribulation, it is easy to relegate tribulation to a future period in history. For Christians suffering in the throes of opposition, however, the tribulation is an ever-present reality. The virulence and the severity of the tribulation may vary from time to time and from place to place, yet Christ’s promise remains true, “In the world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world” (<a href="?bref=John.16.33">Jn 16:33</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Suffering_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Suffering</a>; <a href="?item=Eschatology_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Eschatology</a>; <a href="?item=Persecution_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Persecution</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">TRINITY*</p>
<p class="fl">Term designating the three members of the triune God: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The word “Trinity” does not appear in the Bible; it was created by scholars to describe the three members of the Godhead. Throughout the Bible, God is presented as being Father, Son, and Spirit—not three “gods” but three personas of the one and only God (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Mt 28:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.23-24">1 Cor 16:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.13">2 Cor 13:13</a>). The Scriptures present the Father as the source of creation, the giver of life, and God of all the universe (see <a href="?bref=John.5.26">Jn 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.6">1 Cor 8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.14-15">Eph 3:14-15</a>). The Son is depicted as the image of the invisible God, the exact representation of his being and nature, and the Messiah-Redeemer (see <a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-6">Phil 2:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.14-16">Col 1:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-3">Heb 1:1-3</a>). The Spirit is God in action, God reaching people—influencing them, regenerating them, infilling them, and guiding them (see <a href="?bref=John.14.26">Jn 14:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.6">Gal 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.18">Eph 2:18</a>). All three are a tri-unity, inhabiting one another and working together to accomplish the divine design in the universe (see <a href="?bref=John.16.13-15">Jn 16:13-15</a>).</p>

  <title>Troas</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TROAS</p>
<p class="fl">City in Turkey on the Aegean shore, 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) south of the ancient site of Troy, scene of the Trojan War immortalized by the poet Homer. Both the ancient city of Troy and the Roman city of Troas are on the Troad Plain, an area about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) in length bordering the sea. Paul sailed from Troas into Macedonia in response to the call “Come over to Macedonia and help us” (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.9">Acts 16:9</a>).</p>
<p>The Seleucid king Antigonus founded the city about 300 <span class="era">BC</span> and named it after himself. Later, the name was changed to Alexandria Troas in honor of Alexander the Great, who had passed through it in pursuit of the Persians. The city became a Roman colony when Roman influence replaced that of the Greeks. According to some scholars, Julius Caesar envisioned Troas as his eastern capital, and Constantine considered making it his capital before deciding on Byzantium instead. It was an important seaport during the time of Paul because it was the easiest and shortest route from Asia to Europe.</p>
<p>On the second missionary journey, Paul and Silas came to Troas after being forbidden to preach the Word of God in Asia (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a>). Although this trip to Europe is not stressed in Acts, many scholars think this short voyage was as important historically as Caesar’s invasion of Britain. After this vision, Paul and Silas embarked, passed the island of Samothrace, and landed at Neapolis (modern Kavalla), their first stop in Europe (v <a href="?bref=Acts.16.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>We know that a church must have been established in Troas because of events that are described later. After his mission in Ephesus was finished, Paul stayed and preached the gospel in Troas (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.12">2 Cor 2:12</a>). On his way to Jerusalem for the last time, Paul stopped in Troas, where he preached until after midnight, causing one of the young men to fall asleep and fall from a window to his death. But Paul called him back to life and continued on with the meeting until morning (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.6-12">Acts 20:6-12</a>). Paul visited Troas again and left behind a cloak and parchments, presumably when he was arrested there. In a letter to Timothy, Paul asks him to bring these to him at his prison in Rome (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.13">2 Tm 4:13</a>).</p>

In <a href="?bref=Acts.20.15">Acts 20:15</a>, some manuscripts indicate that Paul’s ship stopped at this place on his trip to Jerusalem near the end of his third missionary journey. Since Trogyllium is a promontory jutting out into the sea between Samos and Miletus, it is not unlikely for the sailing vessel to have landed there for the evening. However, most textual critics consider the phrase “after remaining at Trogyllium” (see Textus Receptus and <span class="sc">kjv</span>) to be a later insertion into the text.</p>

<p class="fl">One of the Asians who accompanied Paul on his final trip to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>). Because the Jews had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with Paul in Jerusalem, they incorrectly assumed that he had accompanied Paul into the temple (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.29">21:29</a>). Since Trophimus was not a Jew, his alleged act of profaning the temple served as the pretense for Paul’s arrest and subsequent imprisonment. Trophimus was traveling with Paul as one of the representatives of the Asian church who had been selected to superintend the collection for the Jerusalem church. Trophimus was probably one of the two brothers who accompanied Titus in the delivery of 2 Corinthians to Corinth (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.16-24">2 Cor 8:16-24</a>). According to <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.20">2 Timothy 4:20</a>, Trophimus had been accompanying Paul (prior to his final imprisonment) but then stayed behind in Miletus due to illness. Legend suggests that Trophimus was ultimately beheaded by the order of Nero.</p>

<p class="h1">TRUTH</p>
<p class="fl">That which is real and verifiable by experience.</p>
<p>In Scripture, truth is a very important concept because God is the God of all truth (<a href="?bref=Ps.31.5">Pss 31:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.108.4">108:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.146.6">146:6</a>), who speaks and judges truly (<a href="?bref=Ps.57.3">57:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.13">96:13</a>). He is the real source and cause of the whole universe. Scripture also focuses on the revealed truth in the gospel of God’s redeeming grace through Christ. This is the truth Christ and the apostles proclaimed (<a href="?bref=John.8.44-46">Jn 8:44-46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.37">18:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1">Rom 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.2">2 Cor 4:2</a>), which was foreshadowed in the OT (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.10-12">1 Pt 1:10-12</a>), and witnessed to by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.16.13">Jn 16:13</a>). The OT teaching was never false, but it was shadowy and incomplete in comparison with the revealed truth of the NT. So Christ brought spiritual reality (<a href="?bref=John.1.17">Jn 1:17</a>), and the Holy Spirit leads believers into the experience of all that is real in Christ (<a href="?bref=John.16.13">16:13</a>).</p>
<p>Christ is the truth because, being God, his words carry divine authority. They are truth and life (<a href="?bref=John.6.63">Jn 6:63</a>). In addition, the life of Christ epitomized truthfulness and utter reliability. When people live in obedience to the truth, they themselves are true and reliable. Scripture calls upon people to “do the truth” (<a href="?bref=John.3.21">Jn 3:21</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Those who have experienced God’s reality in Christ know, by experience, that Christ is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">Jn 14:6</a>).</p>

The fact that Tubal traded with Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.13">Ez 27:13</a>) supports the premise that Tubal was located in a coastland region. Beyond this sketchy evidence, it is difficult to determine Tubal’s precise ethnic identification or location. It has been identified with the Scythians, the Iberians, the region between the Black and the Caspian Seas, Thessaly, and various Hittite tribes.</p>

<p class="fl">One of the believers who accompanied Paul in his trip to collect and deliver the offering for the Jerusalem church (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>). Since he is often mentioned with Trophimus of Ephesus, Tychicus was likely also a native of that city. He served as the courier for Paul’s letter to Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.21">Eph 6:21</a>) as well as Paul’s letters to Philemon and the Colossians (<a href="?bref=Col.4.7">Col 4:7</a>).

Paul mentioned Tychicus twice in his later letters, first sending him to Crete to be with Titus (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.12">Ti 3:12</a>), and later mentioning to Timothy that he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.12">2 Tm 4:12</a>).

  <title>Type</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TYPE</p>
<p class="fl">The English word “type” is derived from the Greek <span class="greek">tupos</span><span class="ital">,</span> which has the basic meaning of “a visible impression or mark made by a blow or by pressure.” In the Greek NT, the word occurs 16 times, with various meanings. A type is formed as a copy, print, or a form cast in a mold. In <a href="?bref=Acts.7.43">Acts 7:43</a> it is applied to “figures” of idols or false gods. A type can be a pattern according to which something is made (e.g., the tabernacle, <a href="?bref=Acts.7.44">Acts 7:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.5">Heb 8:5</a>). It is an example or model, whether of evil to be avoided (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.6-11">1 Cor 10:6-11</a>) or of good to be emulated (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.17">Phil 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.9">2 Thes 3:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.12">1 Tm 4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.7">Ti 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.3">1 Pt 5:3</a>). It is like a form for pouring concrete, which determines both the shape and content of what is made.</p>
<p>A type is also an entity found in the OT that prefigures one found in the NT. The initial one is called the “type” and the fulfillment is designated the “antetype.” Either type or antetype may be a person, thing, or event, but often the type is messianic and frequently refers to salvation.</p>
<p> A type can be distinguished from a symbol in that a symbol is a timeless sign. It can refer to past, present, or future, while a type always foreshadows that which is to come.</p>
<p>Some examples help to identify some biblical types and antetypes. The serpent lifted up on a pole in the wilderness to give healing to the Israelites was a type of Jesus being lifted up on a cross to give salvation to the world (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.21.9">Nm 21:9</a>). The Passover lamb (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-13">Ex 12:1-13</a>) is a type of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>). The rock from which Israel drank in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.6">Ex 17:6</a>) prefigures Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.3-4">1 Cor 10:3-4</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rom.5.14">Romans 5:14</a> Adam is called “a type of the one who was to come,” that is, of Christ.</p>
<p>The book of Hebrews is full of examples of types that represent the Messiah. All of the sacrifices ordained by the ritual law that God gave at Sinai typify some aspect of the person and work of Jesus. The blood that was sprinkled on the altar spoke of the blood of the one who was slain once for all (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.12-22">Heb 9:12-22</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">TYRANNUS, Hall of</p>
<p class="fl">Place in Ephesus where Paul taught daily for two years (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.9">Acts 19:9</a>). Paul’s ministry in Ephesus had begun at the synagogue, where he had preached for three months. Finding increasing opposition there, Paul rented the Hall of Tyrannus (<span class="sc">nasb</span> “school of Tyrannus”), where he began a ministry to both Jews and Greeks (v <a href="?bref=Acts.19.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>In Greek, the term “hall” literally means “leisure” or “rest.” It eventually became associated with the kind of activity carried on during times of leisure, that is, lectures, debates, and discussion. Finally, the term came to mean the place where these leisure activities occurred.</p>
<p>Virtually nothing is known about Tyrannus himself. Some scholars have suggested that he was a Greek rhetorician, sympathetic to Paul’s preaching. This suggestion is made plausible by an addition in the Western text that states that Paul taught in the hall “from the fifth hour until the tenth,” that is, from 11 <span class="sc">am</span> until 4 <span class="sc">pm</span> (<span class="sc">nrsv</span> mg). This would mean that Paul used the hall only during afternoon rest periods, for in all Ionian cities, work ceased at 11 <span class="sc">am</span> and did not resume until late afternoon because of the intense heat. Possibly these rest periods made the hall available for Paul’s use, and Tyrannus himself lectured there before and after these hours.</p>

  <title>Tyre</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">TYRE</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient Phoenician city-state located on the Mediterranean coast 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) south of Sidon and 23 miles (37 kilometers) north of Acre. Tyre consisted of two major parts: an older port city on the mainland and an island city a half mile (.8 kilometer) from the coast where the majority of the population lived. According to Herodotus, Tyre was founded around 2700 <span class="era">BC</span>. Its earliest historical attestations, however, are references in a 15th-century Ugaritic document and an Egyptian citation from the same period. Tyre first appears in the Bible in the list of cities that comprised Asher’s inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.29">Jos 19:29</a>). At that time, it was described as a “strong city” and was evidently never conquered by the Israelites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.7">2 Sm 24:7</a>). Tyre was most significant as a mercantile center, with maritime contacts throughout the Mediterranean region and overland traffic with Mesopotamia and Arabia.</p>
<p>During David’s and Solomon’s monarchies, Tyre was a strong commercial ally of Israel. Both David and Solomon contracted with Hiram of Tyre for timber, building materials, and skilled laborers, for which they provided Tyre with agriculture produce (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.11">2 Sm 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.1-11">1 Kgs 5:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.1">1 Chr 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.3-16">2 Chr 2:3-16</a>). After the division of the kingdom, Tyre evidently maintained friendly relations with Israel for some time. Ahab’s wife, Jezebel, was the daughter of “Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians,” a king who is known elsewhere as Ithobal of Tyre (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">1 Kgs 16:31</a>; cf. Menander). At some point, however, the pressure of Assyrian and Babylonian aggression dissolved the alliance, so that by the time of Samaria’s fall, Tyre and Israel were no longer aligned and shortly thereafter became enemies.</p>
<p>During the later kingdom period, Tyre was the focus for some of the strongest prophetic denunciations recorded in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.1-18">Is 23:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.22">Jer 25:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-11">27:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.26.1-19">Ez 26:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.4-8">Jl 3:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.9-10">Am 1:9-10</a>). Tyre’s condemnation was justified for several reasons. Because of its commercial significance, Tyre was the focal point of Assyrian and Egyptian rivalries. Tyre managed, however, to play these rivals against each other while building its wealth and exploiting its neighbors. Additionally, the city of Tyre was not only a city of unscrupulous merchants but also a center of religious idolatry and sexual immorality. Foremost among Tyre’s sins was pride induced by its great wealth and strategic location. Ezekiel’s prophecy against Tyre offers a detailed picture of the city, its commercial empire, its sin, and its eventual demise (<a href="?bref=Ezek.26.1-28">Ez 26:1-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.18-20">29:18-20</a>). The final destruction of Tyre did not come for almost 1,900 years (<span class="era">AD</span> 1291), though it was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar for 13 years (587–574 <span class="era">BC</span>), and conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 <span class="era">BC</span> after a seven-month siege, during which he built a causeway out to the island. Ezekiel’s description of Tyre’s arrogance can be compared to that of Satan’s, with Tyre’s words “I am a God, I sit in the seat of God” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) being the expression that led to the fall of both Satan and Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.2">Ez 28:2</a>).</p>
<p>Despite Alexander’s destruction of the city, Tyre had regained prominence by the NT period, being equal to or greater than Jerusalem in terms of population and commercial power. Jesus visited the region surrounding Tyre during his early ministry, healing the Syrophoenician woman’s daughter (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.21-28">Mt 15:21-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.24-31">Mk 7:24-31</a>). Jesus also compared the Galilean towns that had rejected him to Tyre and Sidon, suggesting that the Galileans would bear greater responsibility for their rejection because of the number of miracles he had performed among them (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.13-14">Lk 10:13-14</a>).</p>
