<p class="h1">GABRIEL</p>
<p class="fl">One of the two angels mentioned by name in the Bible (the other is Michael). Gabriel appeared in human form to Daniel to reveal to him the meaning of a vision, to show what would transpire on the Day of Judgment, and to give Daniel wisdom and understanding (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.16">Dn 8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.21-22">9:21-22</a>). In the NT Gabriel appeared to Zechariah the priest as he served in the temple, to announce the birth of Zechariah’s son, John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.11-20">Lk 1:11-20</a>). Six months later Gabriel appeared to Mary to announce that she would become the mother of Jesus, the long-awaited Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-33">Lk 1:26-33</a>). Gabriel is commonly called an archangel but is not referred to as such in the Bible.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of material about Gabriel in the noncanonical writings of the Jews. In the books of Enoch he is pictured as one of the four chief angels, along with Michael, Raphael, and Uriel (1 Enoch 40:3, 6). He is one of the holy angels (20:7) who looks down from heaven and is a principal intercessor (1 Enoch 9:1; 40:6; 2 Enoch 21:3). He is to destroy the wicked (1 Enoch 9:9-10) and cast them into the furnace (54:6) and is set over all powers (40:9). Michael sits at God’s right hand, and Gabriel sits on the left (2 Enoch 24:1). Michael, as guardian angel of Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1">Dn 12:1</a>) and a high priest of heaven, is more occupied with affairs in heaven, but Gabriel is God’s messenger who goes from heaven to execute God’s will on earth.</p>

Delighted with giving Jacob another son, Leah named the boy Gad, meaning “good fortune” (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.11">Gn 30:11</a>). Later, Gad moved his family with Jacob to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.4">Ex 1:4</a>). When Jacob blessed his sons, he predicted that Gad would constantly be troubled by foreign invaders but would successfully withstand them and put them to flight (see <a href="?bref=Gen.49.19">Gn 49:19</a> and discussion below under Gad, Tribe of). Gad became the father of seven sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.16">Gn 46:16</a>) and the founder of the Gadites (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.12,16">Dt 3:12, 16</a>), one of the 12 tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.2.14">Nm 2:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GAD, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Descendants of Jacob’s seventh son Gad (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.11">Gn 30:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.1.24-25">Nm 1:24-25</a>), and eighth largest of the 12 tribes that came out of Egypt with Moses (according to the number of warriors in <a href="?bref=Num.1.1-3,24-25">Nm 1:1-3, 24-25</a>). They raised livestock and had a reputation for being fierce in battle (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1">Nm 32:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.33.20">Dt 33:20</a>).</p>
<p>During the wilderness period, they were led by Eliasaph’s son Deuel (<a href="?bref=Num.1.14">Nm 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.2.14">2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.42">7:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.20">10:20</a>). When Israel encamped, Gad was located south of the tabernacle behind the tribes of Reuben and Simeon (<a href="?bref=Num.2.14-15">2:14-15</a>). They are mentioned at the tribal offering to the tabernacle, and after the plague, which God brought upon Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.7.42-47">7:42-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.15,18">26:15, 18</a>). Maki’s son Geuel represented the tribe as one of the 12 spies sent by Moses into Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.15">13:15</a>).</p>
<p>At the close of the wilderness period, Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh’s tribe requested permission to settle east of the Jordan, for it had good pastureland (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-2">Nm 32:1-2</a>). This was permitted on the condition that they would help in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.32.20-22">Nm 32:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.1.12-18">Jos 1:12-18</a>).</p>
<p>During the Conquest under Joshua, Gad is mentioned only at the battle of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.4.12">Jos 4:12</a>). After the end of the conflict, Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh settled their land east of the Jordan (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.34.13-14">Nm 34:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.6">Jos 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.8">13:8</a>).</p>
<p>Gad’s inheritance was between Manasseh’s tribe to the north and Reuben’s to the south. The Arabian Desert formed its eastern border and the Jordan River its western. There seem to have been no fixed borders between the two and a half tribes, and the whole area was often referred to as Gilead and Bashan (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.33">2 Kgs 10:33</a>). Its land ran north to the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee), but among the mountains it seems to have run eastward only as far as the Jabbok River. To the south, the cities of Aroer and Heshbon mark their southern limits (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.12-13">Dt 3:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.1-6">Jos 12:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.24-28">13:24-28</a>).</p>
<p>The history of Gad from its settlement to the Captivity was closely tied with the two neighboring Hebrew tribes. Shortly after returning to their lands, these two and a half tribes almost started a civil war by erecting a large altar (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.10-34">Jos 22:10-34</a>). During the time of the judges, Gilead (including Gad) was threatened, if not occupied, by the Ammonites until they were defeated by Jephthah (Jgs 11). Some Gadites joined David at Ziklag during his exile (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.14,37">1 Chr 12:14, 37</a>). In the 14th year of David’s reign the two and a half tribes were formally brought together under an overseer named Jerijah (and his brothers, <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.30-32">26:30-32</a>).</p>
<p>During the time of the divided kingdom, the tribes east of the Jordan were constantly under attack. During Jehu’s reign (841–814 <span class="era">BC</span>), Hazael annexed all the land east of the Jordan, and they were later carried off into captivity by Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.26-27">1 Chr 5:26-27</a>). Subsequently, the Ammonites occupied Gad’s land (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.1">Jer 49:1</a>).</p>
<p>In the postexilic period Gad is mentioned only once—in Ezekiel’s vision of the restoration of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.48.1,27-28,34">Ez 48:1, 27-28, 34</a>). In the NT, Gad is mentioned only in the book of Revelation, in the list of the tribes sealed by God (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.5">Rv 7:5</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">GADARA*, GADARENES</p>
<p class="fl">City of the Decapolis and its inhabitants, mentioned only once in the better manuscripts of the NT. Jesus had crossed to the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee and healed the demoniac named Legion, whom he encountered in “the country of the Gadarenes” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.28">Mt 8:28</a>). Mark’s account in <a href="?bref=Mark.5.1">5:1</a> and Luke’s in <a href="?bref=Luke.8.26,37">8:26, 37</a> read “Gerasenes.” (The <span class="sc">kjv</span>, following the Textus Receptus, has variant names here; in <a href="?bref=Matt.8.28">Matthew 8:28</a> it reads “Gergesenes,” and in Mark and Luke it reads “Gadarenes.”) The variant names among the Gospel writers may be due to the fact that Gerasa was the wider geographical area of which Gadara was a chief city. Geographers conclude that the most likely location for the leap of the swine into the sea would have been a strip of steep coastline near Gergesa, a smaller, less important town of the area. This would fit another suggestion that Matthew was a native of the region and so he pinpointed the precise place, while Mark and Luke intended to point out the general location for their Greek and Roman readers, since Gergesa was small and relatively unknown, while Gadara was a Greek city of some importance.</p>
<p>The name Gadara indicates that the city was of Semitic origin. It was located five to six miles (8 to 10 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee, and its territory included the hot springs of el Hamme, north of the Yarmuk River. The first reference to it in history was when it was captured by Antiochus III (218 <span class="era">BC</span>). Later, it was taken by the Jews under Alexander Janneus (103 <span class="era">BC</span>), and the inhabitants were enslaved and forced to receive the law of Moses. The city was demolished by the Jews, but when the area was reconquered by Pompey, it was rebuilt (63 <span class="era">BC</span>). It became a free city under Pompey and joined the federation of Greek cities in the Transjordan known as the Decapolis. Augustus Caesar added Gadara to the territory of Herod the Great (30 <span class="era">BC</span>), and at Herod’s death it was annexed to Syria (4 <span class="era">BC</span>). During the Jewish rebellion (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70), Vespasian took the city, and it continued to flourish for many years. It was the seat of a Christian bishopric from <span class="era">AD</span> 325 until the Muslim conquest. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Decapolis_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Decapolis</a>; <a href="?item=GerasaGerasenes_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Gerasa, Gerasenes</a>; <a href="?item=GergesaGergesenes_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Gergesa, Gergesenes</a>.</p>

  <title>Galatia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GALATIA</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient kingdom resulting from migrations of Gallic people from the west and settlement on the central plain of Asia Minor. An earlier migratory movement resulted in the sack of Rome by the Gauls (or Celts) in 390 <span class="era">BC</span>, but in a later attempt to overrun Greece the Gallic invaders were repulsed. That unsuccessful invasion into Greece led the Gauls to turn their attention to Asia Minor. They penetrated the larger part of the area but were defeated by Attalus I in 230 <span class="era">BC</span>. As a result, they became restricted to that part of Asia later known as Galatia. By that time, the Gauls consisted of three tribes, the Trocmi, Tolistobogii, and Tectosages, which settled into the towns of Tavium, Pessinus, and Ancyra, respectively. In 189 <span class="era">BC</span> these Galatians were subdued by the Romans but were allowed to govern themselves.</p>
<p>After the death of Amyntas in 25 <span class="era">BC</span>, Galatia became a Roman province. Within its boundaries were the ethnic areas of Galatia proper, Lycaonia, Isauria, and parts of Phrygia and Pisidia. The new province, therefore, included the towns of Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, and Pisidian Antioch, all of which the apostle Paul visited on his first missionary journey. The term “Galatia” was used in two different ways, one to describe the area occupied by the Gauls in the north, and the other to describe the whole Roman province, including the southern towns. That ambiguity has given rise to a problem over the destination of Paul’s letter to the Galatians.</p>
<p>The original inhabitants of north Galatia were Phrygians, many of whom still remained in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, together with some Greeks and a fairly large community of Jews. Although the area was cosmopolitan, the Celtic element predominated. These people were known for their sturdy independence as well as for their drunkenness and revelings. In religious matters there is evidence that they were highly superstitious and were especially attracted to the wild rites of the goddess Cybele.</p>
<p>In towns of the southern region, Greek influence was more pronounced, especially among the more educated members of the communities. But the Phrygian element was still strong among the humbler inhabitants. They, too, were predominately devotees of Cybele, although there the cult had become modified by Greek influences. In Pisidian Antioch, for instance, the goddess was known as the Genius of Antioch, while in Iconium she was known as Athena Polias.</p>
<p>Geographically the northern towns, situated on a well-watered plateau and served by a major road from the Aegean shores to the west, became prosperous centers of commerce. But access from north to south was difficult and communication poor because of the mountainous terrain leading up to the plateau. The southern towns were situated on the route between Syria and Asia. Their strategic location explains why churches were established in those towns on Paul’s first missionary journey (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-14.28">Acts 13–14</a>).</p>
<p>Galatia, linked with Phrygia, is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.18.23">18:23</a>, but it is not clear whether Paul ever visited or established churches in the northern area. The only other references to Galatia in the NT are probably to the southern towns (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1">1 Cor 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.10">2 Tm 4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pt 1:1</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=GalatiansLettertothe_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Galatians, Letter to the</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">The author of the epistle is explicitly stated to be Paul the apostle (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.1">Gal 1:1</a>). The letter gives some brief but telling glimpses of his experience before he became a Christian. He mentions his former life in Judaism (v <a href="?bref=Gal.1.13">13</a>). The fact that he had been a thoroughly devout Jew has an important bearing on what he writes in this letter. He remembered his passionate devotion to his former faith, in whose cause he had violently persecuted the church of God. He reminded the Galatians about this, for the Jewish traditions had meant a great deal to him. There is no doubt that he had once regarded his violent opposition to the church as a religious act of the highest order. Indeed, his strong devotion to Judaism sets in clear relief the remarkable transformation that occurred when he became a Christian. A revelation from God, he was convinced, gave him special authority to write the way he did.</p>
<p>In this epistle he mentioned two features of his conversion experience that had a profound effect on him. One is the purpose of God for his life, which he recognized as reaching back even before he was born (v <a href="?bref=Gal.1.15">15</a>). He did not go into detail, but he never tired of talking about the grace of God. He had turned his back on the idea of earning merit through his own efforts. The second aspect of his conversion that deeply impressed him was the recognition that his call to preach could be traced to that occasion. When he preached to the Galatians, he did so with divine authority because he was conscious of having received a divine commission. The apostles and elders of the church did not decide it would be a good thing for him to preach the gospel; it was God who planned it. Moreover, Paul was equally convinced that the gospel he preached was not of his own making. He had received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ (v <a href="?bref=Gal.1.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>Paul went to some lengths to demonstrate that he had received his apostleship from God (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.1">1:1</a>). He was conscious not only of a call to preach but also of a call to exercise apostolic authority on an equal footing with the Jerusalem apostles. He certainly seemed to be on the defensive, but this was prompted by the special situation that had arisen among the Galatians and that caused this letter to be written.</p>
<p>Paul gives one biographical detail in this letter that is not mentioned in his other letters. He states that after his conversion he went away into Arabia (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.17">1:17</a>). The apostle does not tell us what he did there, but probably he was quietly reorienting his thoughts. According to the book of Acts, when he returned to Damascus he powerfully proved that Jesus was the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.22">Acts 9:22</a>). He also refers to traveling in Syria and Cilicia (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.21">Gal 1:21</a>), which must have been prior to his first missionary journey.</p>

<p class="fl">It is impossible to determine the date of this letter before discussing its destination.</p>
<p class="h3">Destination</p>
<p class="fl">Paul addresses his letter to the Galatians. But there has been much debate over where they lived, because the term Galatia was used in two different senses. It was used of the province that stretched from the borders of Pamphylia in the southern part of Asia Minor to the border of Pontus toward the northern seacoast. The term was also used of a part of the province in the north where a group of people from Gaul had settled and given their name to the whole area. Hence “Galatia” could mean either the geographical area in the north or the whole province. It is not easy to decide what the term meant when used by Paul. The debate is between the view that the term was used geographically, in which case some churches in the north are in mind (North Galatian Theory), or politically, in which case Paul may be referring to the churches in southern Galatia founded on his first missionary journey (South Galatian Theory). It may at first sight seem a quite unimportant issue, but since the decision affects the date of the letter and to some extent its occasion and purpose, a review of the positions must be made.</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the 20th century, no one seems to have questioned that Paul was writing to the inhabitants of the geographical district in the northern part of the province. This view agrees with the oldest use of the term, since the provinces did not come into existence until 25 <span class="era">BC</span>, whereas there were Galatians in the north some time before this. It is reasonable to suppose that the southerners would not have taken too kindly to being addressed as “Galatians.” It may be argued that most people in those days would have thought of the northern peoples when hearing the name.</p>
<p>Luke’s habit when writing Acts was to use geographical rather than political descriptions of places. He refers, for instance, to Lystra and Derbe as cities of Lycaonia, not as cities of Galatia. It is reasonable, therefore, that when he refers to Phrygia and Galatia in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.6">Acts 16:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.18.23">18:23</a>, he means that Paul went through the northern area. There were three main towns in that district—Ancyra, Tavium, and Pessinus—and it would therefore follow that Paul must have established churches there.</p>
<p>The traditional North Galatian view has, however, been challenged. It is pointed out that although Luke prefers geographical descriptions, Paul prefers political ones for grouping his churches. In this letter he mentions the churches of Christ in Judea (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.22">1:22</a>). Elsewhere he mentions the “churches of Asia” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>). Several times Paul refers to the believers in Macedonia (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1">2 Cor 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.2">9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.10">1 Thes 4:10</a>) and in Achaia (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.15">1 Cor 16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1">2 Cor 1:1</a>), while both are mentioned together in <a href="?bref=Rom.15.26">Romans 15:26</a>, <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.2">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>, and <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.7">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a>. This seems to be Paul’s normal habit, in which case a letter addressed to the Galatians would be circulated to all the existing churches in the province of Galatia.</p>
<p>South Galatian supporters do not agree that the southern people would have resented the name Galatians, maintaining that there would have been no other name available with which to describe them. One fairly positive piece of evidence is found in Paul’s statement that it was because of a bodily ailment that he first preached to the Galatians (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.13">Gal 4:13</a>). But a glance at the map, particularly a relief map, would show that the route to the northern area was over mountainous terrain, and it is difficult to think that a sick man would have attempted it. Under the southern theory, the journey would have been much shorter and less arduous.</p>
<p>Another argument in support of the South Galatian Theory assumes that <a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">Acts 20:4</a>, which mentions the names of those who accompanied Paul to Jerusalem, is referring to delegates appointed by the churches in support of the collection to aid the poor churches of Judea. If this assumption is right, it is noticeable that no representative is included from the northern area, although both Gaius and Timothy were from the south. This would be more weighty if Acts had actually mentioned the collection. One last point is that Barnabas is mentioned three times (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1,9,13">Gal 2:1, 9, 13</a>) suggesting that he is known to the readers. Yet according to Acts, he accompanied Paul only on the first missionary journey.</p>
<p>It is difficult to reach a conclusion, but it seems that the arguments for a South Galatian Theory have more weight than those for the older theory.</p>
<p class="h3">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Under the North Galatian Theory, it is claimed that the letter was written after the events mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.18.23">Acts 18:23</a>—that is, during the course of the third missionary journey (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 56), possibly while Paul was at Ephesus or soon after.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the letter was addressed to the south Galatian churches founded on the first missionary journey, any date after that journey is possible, including during the third journey, as mentioned above. But a further possibility opens up since a much earlier date might more readily fit into the background of the letter. Thus, it is possible that this letter is among the earliest that Paul wrote.</p>
<p>The main problem with assigning a date is that in <a href="?bref=Gal.1.1-2.21">Galatians 1–2</a> Paul mentions two visits to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.18">1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">2:1</a>), whereas Acts mentions (or implies) three visits (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.26">Acts 9:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.29-30">11:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.2">15:2</a>). It has traditionally been supposed that the second visit (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">2:1</a>) can be identified with the events of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>. This would mean that Paul was giving his own account of the decisions of the so-called Council of Jerusalem. There is much to be said for this view. There are similarities between the two passages. In both, Barnabas is mentioned. In both, questions are asked about the circumcision of the Gentiles. And in both, Paul and Barnabas give a report about the matter to the Jerusalem leaders. The main difficulty is that Paul’s wording in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">Galatians 2:1</a> suggests that this event took place on his <span class="ital">second</span> visit to Jerusalem, whereas <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> relates his <span class="ital">third</span> visit. It is traditionally explained that on the second visit Paul and Barnabas had no contact with the apostles but simply handed over the collection from the Antioch church to the Jerusalem elders (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a>). A difficulty with this view is that <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a> speaks only of conversations with the three leading apostles at Jerusalem and does not mention the whole church (as <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> clearly does). Paul does not refer to the decision reached by the church, but only to his agreement with those he calls the “pillar” apostles. It could, of course, be that before the general meeting of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> (which occured in <span class="era">AD</span> 50), Paul and Barnabas had a behind-the-scenes meeting with the leaders and preferred to mention the decision reached with them rather than quote an ecclesiastical edict. This may also explain another difficulty—the lack of any mention of the prohibitions that the Jerusalem church imposed on the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.20">Acts 15:20</a>). Paul simply mentions the need to remember the poor (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.10">Gal 2:10</a>). Yet another difficulty with the traditional view is that Paul mentions his dispute with Peter over the question of Gentile-Jewish fellowship (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-14">11-14</a>) <span class="ital">after</span> his account of the agreement reached with the Jerusalem apostles. This places Peter in a compromising position. It is difficult to explain his inconsistency. He may have agreed that Gentiles should not be circumcised, but then vacillated over the question of fellowship.</p>
<p>An alternative view suggests that when Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem with the collection they also had private talks with the leading apostles. <a href="?bref=Acts.11.29-30">Acts 11:29-30</a> is set in a period of political activity against the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-25">Acts 12</a> records the martyrdom of James and the arrest of Peter), and this may explain the private nature of the meeting. This interpretation would explain why Paul makes no mention of the church’s decision—because the meeting happened before the Jerusalem Council. It would also make it easier to explain Peter’s actions at Antioch, if this behavior occurred before the church as a whole had discussed and resolved the matter. According to this view, Paul’s Letter to the Galatians may be the earliest of his letters (pre–<span class="era">AD</span> 50).</p>
<p>There are, however, some difficulties with this view. <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a> mentions no apostles as meeting Paul and Barnabas. Nor is there any reference to Titus, whom Paul says they took with them (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">Gal 2:1</a>). Further, Paul’s references to preaching among the Gentiles (v <a href="?bref=Acts.2.2">2</a>) would seem to require a date after the first missionary journey, unless he was thinking of his work in Antioch, a Jewish-Gentile church.</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide between these two views. Chronological considerations (based on Paul’s mention of 14 years in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">2:1</a>) slightly favor a later date, while the relationship of the content of this epistle to the Jerusalem Council (<span class="era">AD</span> 50) points to an early date.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Difficulties had arisen in the Galatian churches because a group of people had been insisting that Gentiles must be circumcised. These people must have been Judaizers, that is, Christian Jews who could see no hope for Gentiles unless they accepted circumcision as an initiatory rite. Linked with this was a criticism of Paul’s apostolic status. The opponents were claiming the support of the Jerusalem apostles, whom they regarded as superior to Paul. This would explain why Paul saw the issue so clearly as a challenge to the gospel he preached. His letter strongly expressed his understanding of the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>Interpretation will vary slightly according to which date one assigns to the letter. If it was written before the Jerusalem Council (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>), the circumcision issue had not yet been thrashed out and the Galatian situation would be the first major crisis over it. But if the Jerusalem Council had already happened, the south Galatian churches would already have received those decisions (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.4">16:4</a>), and apparently had allowed themselves to be affected by Judaizers who took a harder line than the Jerusalem apostles had. If the northern churches are indicated, there is no direct evidence to show that they had received the decrees.</p>
<p>We may conclude that the apostle’s aim in this letter is twofold—to maintain the validity of his apostleship, and to uphold the character of the gospel he preached. In the first part of the letter he is concerned to show his relationship with the Jerusalem “pillar” apostles in order to demonstrate his equality with them, while at the same time claiming his independence of them. Moreover, he asserts that there is only one gospel, which suggests that his opponents were charging him with preaching a different gospel. But he claims to have received his gospel from God, not from men.</p>
<p>In the course of his letter, Paul expressed some important theological truths. The main body of the letter issues a strong warning against a form of legalism that is applicable not only to the situation Paul confronted in the Galatian churches but wherever dependence on legal observances is considered essential for salvation. If a Gentile could not become a Christian without being circumcised, it would not only make an external rite a condition for Christian salvation but in addition would imply a commitment to keep the whole Jewish law. When Paul argued against justification by works of the law, he showed the superiority of justification by faith or lawkeeping. The whole letter extols the doctrine of grace.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in contesting the doctrine of works, the apostle gave no support to spiritual license. He posited that the alternative to legalism is not the absence of all restraint. Although Christ has secured freedom for the believer, that freedom must not be used to indulge the flesh (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.13">Gal 5:13</a>). Indeed, Paul’s exposition of the Christian life in this letter is of a high moral order. He sets the standard himself by declaring that he has been crucified with Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">2:20</a>). Not only is this letter a charter for Christian liberty, but it is also a charter for Christian living.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Introduction (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.1-5">1:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The opening to this letter is more abrupt than those in Paul’s other letters. He omits the usual thanksgiving and expands the usual greeting. In the first words he strongly affirms the divine origin of his apostleship.</p>
<p class="h3">The Opponents (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.6-10">1:6-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul is astonished that the Galatians have allowed themselves to be influenced so quickly by those who were perverting the gospel. He expresses an anathema against any who preach another gospel.</p>
<p class="h3">A Defense of His Apostleship (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.11-2.14">1:11–2:14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">There are several stages in Paul’s argument about his own position. He states that his teaching has come from God, not from men, showing his awareness that God has not only called him to be an apostle but has also sanctioned his gospel. It is important for him to make clear that he is not dependent on others for his position, although he proceeds to show that there is no difference between him and the leading apostles (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.11-12">1:11-12</a>). He next contrasts his former zeal in Judaism with his calling to preach the gospel, again emphasizing the divine nature of his call (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.1.13-17">13-17</a>).</p>
<p>He then proceeds to mention that he has on two occasions had meetings with the Jerusalem apostles. As a result, he has been offered the right hand of fellowship—a way of showing that there is no disagreement between them. It was agreed that Paul should be entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, and that Peter should go to the circumcised. There was no questioning of Paul’s apostleship. They all agreed on the Christian responsibility to remember the poor (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.18-2.10">1:18–2:10</a>).</p>
<p>In order to give a tangible example of his apostolic position, Paul mentions the occasion of his public rebuke of Peter. Peter had acted inconsistently for fear of certain men who had come from James in Jerusalem, and who were representatives of the circumcision party. Paul’s challenge to Peter sets the scene for the introduction of the doctrinal part of the letter (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-14">2:11-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">A Defense of the Gospel (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.15-4.31">2:15–4:31</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul introduces the issue of justification by works of the law and contrasts it with justification by faith. He sees the whole situation as a choice between Christ and the law (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.15-21">2:15-21</a>).</p>
<p>His aim is to show the superiority of Christianity over Judaism in the matter of salvation. He notes first that the Galatians had become Christians through the Spirit and wonders what is possessing them to return to the works of the law, which Paul then equates with the “flesh” (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.1-5">3:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>Abraham is brought into the discussion presumably because the opponents were maintaining that only Abraham’s seed would receive the inheritance, and circumcision was regarded as an indispensable sign of a son of the covenant. But Paul points out that even Abraham was justified by faith, not by the law (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-9">3:6-9</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, the law could only bring a curse on those who disobeyed. This leads Paul to show how Christ has become a curse for us. Hence, he claims that in Christ we may still inherit the blessing promised to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.10-14">3:10-14</a>).</p>
<p>Paul anticipates that some may say it is invalid to appeal to the promise to Abraham to counteract justification by works of the law. He shows that the promise preceded the law by four centuries and cannot be invalidated by it (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.15-18">3:15-18</a>).</p>
<p>This leads the apostle to reflect on the function of the law. He points out that it served to prepare the way for Christ by showing mankind’s need and by revealing its own inability to give life. Paul calls the law our custodian, whose function (in ancient times) was to guard and guide a son until he reached the age of independence (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.19-29">3:19-29</a>).</p>
<p>The contrast between those under a guardian versus fully independent sons causes Paul to reflect on the superior position of sons. The Spirit of God has enabled believers to call God “Abba” (Father), something the law could not do (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.1-7">4:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle has made his point, but he supports it with a personal appeal. He reminds his readers of their state of bondage before they became Christians and deplores that they have returned to such a state in wanting to observe ritual feast days after the Jewish manner. He also reminds them of the former affectionate relationship they had with him when they first became Christians. He is deeply affected by their present attitude (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.8-20">4:8-20</a>). Finally, Paul appeals to a scriptural allegory in support of his argument. He sees Isaac and Ishmael, both sons of Abraham, as representing the distinction between sonship and slavery, which he has already mentioned (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-31">21-31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Practical Advice (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.1-6.10">5:1–6:10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul proceeds to draw out the practical consequences of his doctrinal arguments. He sets out the way in which those who are liberated in Christ should live. They should not commit themselves to Judaism by submitting to circumcision (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.1-6">5:1-6</a>). Paul again attacks those who were leading the Galatians astray (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.5.7-12">7-12</a>). The new principle that must replace legalism is love. Love is possible only by living in the Spirit. This will lead not only to a rejection of the works of the flesh but also to the development of the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.13-26">5:13-26</a>). The spiritual man will have a concern for the burdened and will seek to help others, particularly fellow Christians (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.1-10">6:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Conclusion (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.11-18">6:11-18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Paul now takes the pen and writes his final word with his own hand. He sees fit to contrast his own aim in glorying in the cross of Christ with his opponents’ aim to glory in the flesh. There are no greetings at the end of this letter, only a request that no one should bother him further.</p>

<p class="h1">GALBANUM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the ingredients used to make a special perfume for the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.34">Ex 30:34</a>). Galbanum comes from a waxy, brownish gum excreted from the lower part of a plant that is a member of the carrot or parsley family and is native to Syria and Persia. It is a tall herb that bears small, greenish-white flowers and fruit at the stem tip in bunches or clusters. Its leaves are compound and divided into many fine parts like the leaves of parsley or carrots. An incision made in the stem a few inches above soil level yields a milky sap that hardens. Galbanum is presently used in the manufacture of varnish.</p>
<p>Galbanum is mentioned in the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus as having a pleasant odor (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.24.15">24:15</a>). Although galbanum is not an agreeable perfume when used alone, it was evidently mixed with other substances to yield a fragrant ointment.</p>

<p class="h1">GALILEE</p>
<p class="fl">Area in northern Palestine that, in Israel’s earlier history, had boundaries that were not clearly defined but that became more precisely defined in the period of Roman rule. The English name Galilee comes from two Hebrew words meaning “circuit” or “district.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoricalBackground">Historical Background</p>
<p class="fl">In OT times Galilee was not significant in Israelite life, but in NT times it was a prominent Jewish population center. Galilee is first mentioned in the Bible as the location of Kedesh, a city of refuge in the hill country of Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.7">Jos 20:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.21.32">21:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.76">1 Chr 6:76</a>).</p>
<p>Galilee originally designated the area occupied by the tribes of Naphtali, Zebulun (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1">Is 9:1</a>), and possibly Asher (if Cabul in <a href="?bref=Josh.19.27">Jos 19:27</a> is the same city as in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.11-13">1 Kgs 9:11-13</a>). None of those tribes was able to completely expel the original Canaanite inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.30-33">Jgs 1:30-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>), and as a result, Galilee tended to be racially mixed. The cities that King Solomon gave to Hiram, gentile king of Tyre, were within Galilee (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.11">1 Kgs 9:11</a>), and the gentile intermixture in that area may have influenced Solomon’s choice of those cities for a gift. This racially mixed condition is also the probable basis for the designation in <a href="?bref=Isa.9.1">Isaiah 9:1</a>, “Galilee of the nations” (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.4.15">Mt 4:15</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.15">1 Macc 5:15</a>).</p>
<p>During the monarchy, Galilee was a buffer zone between Israel and Syria, and it bore the brunt of Syrian invasions against Israel. This fact is cited by the prophet Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1">Is 9:1</a>), but he saw it as the prelude to a brighter day when the messianic king would reign. Galilee was conquered by Syrian King Ben-hadad (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.20">1 Kgs 15:20</a>) and was probably recovered by Israel’s King Ahab. Galilee was later subjugated by the Arameans under Hazael (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32">2 Kgs 10:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.18">12:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.22">13:22</a>) and regained by Jeroboam II (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23-25">2 Kgs 14:23-25</a>). As a result of Assyrian conquests in the area of Damascus and Galilee in 732 <span class="era">BC</span> by Tiglath-pileser III (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>), more Gentiles were imported into the area while many of the Jewish inhabitants were deported. This naturally led to greater gentile influence and domination in Galilee. Under the successive influence of Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Syria, Galilee was constantly experiencing infiltration and migration. From the time of the Assyrian conquest of Israel to about the end of the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, Galilee’s population was dominated by Gentiles, with only a few Jews.</p>
<p>The Jews remaining in Galilee were brought to Judea by Simon Maccabeus in 164 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.21-23">1 Macc 5:21-23</a>). Galilee was conquered by Aristobulus I (104–103 <span class="era">BC</span>), who forced the inhabitants to be circumcised and to submit to Jewish laws, a work that probably already had been initiated by John Hyrcanus (134–104 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="SeaOfGalilee"/>
<p>Herod the Great (ruler under Rome, 37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>) affixed Galilee to his kingdom, and more Jews were attracted there. Josephus recorded that Galilee had 240 cities and villages and 100,000 men available to fight against the Romans. After the death of Herod the Great, Galilee was included in the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 39). With the banishment of Herod Antipas in <span class="era">AD</span> 39, Galilee was added to the territory of Herod Agrippa I, who ruled it until he died in <span class="era">AD</span> 44. Rome directly administered Galilee until it was put under the rule of Herod Agrippa II. By siding with the Romans during the Jewish revolts, he was able to retain his position until <span class="era">AD</span> 100. In spite of the Galileans’ attempt to gain independence, the revolutionary faction was brought under subjection by Vespasian in <span class="era">AD</span> 67. After Herod Agrippa II’s death, Galilee became part of the Roman province of Syria.</p>
<p>Following the fall of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the Sanhedrin and many other Jews of southern Palestine flocked to Galilee. As a result, such cities as Tiberias and Sepphoris became Jewish, and the dispersed Jews came to think of Galilee as their center. Tiberias became a center for Jewish learning, and it was there that such major contributions as the Tiberian system of vowel pointing the Hebrew consonantal text were made, as well as the formulation of the Mishnah and the Palestinian Talmud.</p>
<p>From about <span class="era">AD</span> 451 until the Muslim rule over Galilee began in the seventh century, Galilee was governed by the Christian patriarchate of Jerusalem, set up by the Council of Chalcedon in <span class="era">AD</span> 451. Muslim rule from the seventh century on was continuous except for the intervals caused by the twelfth-century Crusades and World War I. All of Galilee has been included in the modern state of Israel since its establishment in 1948.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Boundaries">Boundaries</p>
<p class="fl">Galilee was bounded on the east by the upper Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee and on the south by the plain of Esdraelon, which served as a natural boundary between Galilee and Samaria. At times the plain was included in Galilee, as it was during the intertestamental period (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.30">1 Macc 10:30</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.47-49">12:47-49</a>). While the northern boundary was uncertain and variable during Galilee’s history, in NT times it reached to Lake Huleh. The western boundary followed the Mediterranean Sea to Mt Carmel.</p>
<p>From the time of the divided kingdom until the Assyrian conquest of Galilee (734 <span class="era">BC</span>), it was the northernmost part of the kingdom of Israel. The area was divided into upper Galilee and lower Galilee by the plain of Ramah, which ran between Capernaum and Ptolemais (cf. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.8">Jdt 1:8</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.49">1 Macc 12:49</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">War</span> 3.3.1). In the Mishnah (compilation of early rabbinical interpretation of the Law), Galilee is divided into three parts corresponding to the natural divisions of plain, hill country, and mountain. Under Roman rule, Galilee was about 25 to 30 miles (40 to 50 kilometers) from east to west and about 35 to 40 miles (55 to 65 kilometers) from north to south.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">The attractive Galilean landscape is made up of volcanic limestone hills and fertile alluvial plains. Its climate is cooler than that of any other part of Palestine, and its beauty and fertility contrast sharply with the barren, sun-baked hills of southern Palestine.</p>
<p>The physical features range from the high mountains in the north to the plain of Esdraelon in the south. Mt Tabor is prominent on the east, while Mt Carmel stands out on the west. Much of upper Galilee is 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) above sea level, and in NT times it was largely forested and less densely inhabited than lower Galilee. Lower Galilee starts at 1,500 to 2,000 feet (450 to 600 meters) above sea level and descends sharply to the Sea of Galilee, more than 600 feet (182.9 meters) below sea level.</p>
<p>Besides the average annual rainfall of 25 inches (63.5 centimeters), Galilee is watered by the streams that flow from springs in the hills and are the main sources of the beautiful Kishon River at Janin, and the headwaters of the Jordan River, the largest river in Palestine. The ground is also moistened by heavy dews resulting from climatic conditions created by the Lebanon mountain range to the north.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Cities">Cities</p>
<p class="fl">Among the more notable cities in Galilee’s early history were Kedesh in Naphtali, a city of refuge (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.7">Jos 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.32">21:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.76">1 Chr 6:76</a>), and Hazor, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) north of the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.10">Jos 11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15">1 Kgs 9:15</a>). During the time of Christ, Chorazin (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.21">Mt 11:21</a>) and Capernaum (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13">4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.23">11:23</a>) were prominent cities located in the northeast near the Sea of Galilee. Capernaum seems to have been a center for Jesus’ ministry in the area (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13">Mt 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.1">Mk 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.33">9:33</a>; etc.). Nazareth is especially significant as the city of Christ’s childhood (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.22-23">Mt 2:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.39">Lk 2:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.16">4:16</a>; etc.). Nain (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.11-17">Lk 7:11-17</a>), located on the northern edge of the mountain now called Little Hermon, and Cana of Galilee (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-11">Jn 2:1-11</a>) also figured prominently in Christ’s ministry. Sepphoris and Tiberias were important cities during Roman administration.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RoadsandTravel">Roads and Travel</p>
<p class="fl">Many roads traversed Galilee, and those in NT times were superior due to Roman construction and maintenance.</p>
<p>Among the best-known trade routes was the Via Maris (the Way of the Sea), which ran through Galilee on its way from Damascus to Egypt. Another main road ran from Tiberias, near the Sea of Galilee, to Acco (Ptolemais), a port on the Phoenician coast. Major caravan routes also connected Galilee with the markets of the East. The area was tied together by a network of spurs and connecting roads that branched from the main highways.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Inhabitants">Inhabitants</p>
<p class="fl">The occupants of Galilee (Galileans) were basically Jewish in religious and patriotic orientation, but they were composed of various ethnic elements. The influence of this mixture was sufficient to cause recognizable differences in speech from that of southern Palestine (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.69,73">Mt 26:69, 73</a>). The Galileans absorbed more Greek and Roman influences than did the Judean Jews. The racial mixture, differences in speech, and location caused Judean Jews to view Galilee and its inhabitants with contempt (<a href="?bref=John.1.46">Jn 1:46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.41,52">7:41, 52</a>).</p>
<p>Lower Galilee was densely settled with villages, and in NT times the population was probably about three million. The fertility of the soil and resultant fruitfulness of the country produced a prosperous Jewish populace, particularly in the centuries immediately after the time of Christ.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Government">Government</p>
<p class="fl">Galilee was under the Roman rule of emperors Augustus and Tiberius during the time of Christ. Roman fortifications throughout Galilee were a constant reminder of the presence and influence of the Roman Empire. During Christ’s ministry, Rome installed the tetrarch Herod Antipas (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.1">Mt 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.5-7">Lk 23:5-7</a>) to rule the territory. He was appointed to office when 17 years old. Sepphoris was his first capital; in about <span class="era">AD</span> 22 he built Tiberias on the shore of the Sea of Galilee as his new capital, in honor of the emperor.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Products">Products</p>
<p class="fl">Abundant crops enabled Galilee to provide produce for the neighboring Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon around the middle of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>. Main crops included grapes, pomegranates, olives, and grains. Fishing in the Sea of Galilee was a prominent business in NT times (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-20">Mk 1:14-20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusandGalilee">Jesus and Galilee</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus was raised in Galilee (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16">Lk 4:16</a>), and 11 of his 12 disciples were from there (Judas Iscariot was the only Judean).</p>
<p>The culture, commerce, farming, and fishing business of the area formed the background for much of Jesus’ ministry, as his parables show (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.1-8">Mt 20:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.33">21:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.3">Mk 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.6-9">Lk 13:6-9</a>). The first three Gospels are largely occupied with Christ’s ministry in Galilee, with much of it being spent around the Sea of Galilee. Most of his parables (19 of 32) were spoken here, and the vast majority of his miracles (25 of 33) were performed in Galilee. Jesus received his greatest response in this region. The Sermon on the Mount was spoken in Galilee, and one of its mountains was the scene of the Lord’s transfiguration. Many of the women who followed Christ and ministered to him also came from there (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.55">Mt 27:55</a>). Two of Christ’s most significant postresurrection appearances took place in Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.16-20">Mt 28:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.1-23">Jn 21:1-23</a>), and one of Christ’s own titles, Jesus of Nazareth (<a href="?bref=John.1.45">Jn 1:45</a>), identified him as a Galilean.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Galileans">Galileans</p>
<p class="fl">Since Jesus and most of the 12 disciples were from Galilee, it was natural for the term to be applied to all of his followers, especially since it implied that the movement was not as pure as Judean Judaism. Some interpreters believe that <a href="?bref=Luke.22.59">Luke 22:59</a> is an example of the use of “Galilean” as a title; in <a href="?bref=Acts.1.11">Acts 1:11</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.2.7">2:7</a> it is merely a geographical reference. One sure reference to Christians by that title appears in the work of the pagan philosopher Epictetus (<span class="era">AD</span> 50?–135?), who was impressed with how Christians died for their faith. It is not clear how common the title of Galilean was, but it had obviously spread from Judea to Rome, where Epictetus lived.</p>

<p class="list">2. Very bitter, poisonous herb that cannot be identified with certainty, although the hemlock, colocynth, and poppy have been suggested. The Hebrew word occurs periodically in the OT and refers to (1) “gall” in <a href="?bref=Deut.29.18">Deuteronomy 29:18</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>); (2) the “poison” of a venomous snake in <a href="?bref=Job.20.14,16">Job 20:14, 16</a>; (3) “gall” or “poison” given to a person for food in <a href="?bref=Ps.69.21">Psalm 69:21</a>; (4) divine punishment upon Israel as “water of gall” (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.14">Jer 8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.15">23:15</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; or “poison,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>); (5) Israel’s bitter experience of divine judgment (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.5,19">Lam 3:5, 19</a>); (6) divine judgment upon Israel sprouting up like “hemlock” in the furrows of the field (<a href="?bref=Hos.10.4">Hos 10:4</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; or “poisonous weeds,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>); and (7) Israel’s perversion of justice by turning “judgment into gall” (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.12">Am 6:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>

<p class="fl">Marcus Annaeus Seneca’s son, and brother of the philosopher Seneca, who lived from 3 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 65. Born in Cordoba, Spain, Gallio came to Rome during Tiberius’s reign. His given name was Marcus Annaeus Novatus, but he assumed the name Gallio after his adoption by the rhetorician Lucius Junius Gallio. The wealthy Lucius trained him for his career in administration and government.</p>
<p>Gallio served as Roman proconsul of Achaia sometime between <span class="era">AD</span> 51 and 53. During the apostle Paul’s first visit to Corinth, the Jews brought the apostle before the proconsul, accusing him of having persuaded people to practice religion in an unlawful manner (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">Acts 18:12-17</a>). Gallio abruptly dismissed the charge since it dealt with Jewish and not Roman law. His action reflected the characteristic behavior of Roman governors toward religious disputes.</p>
<p>Forced to leave Achaia because of illness, Gallio returned to Rome as consul suffectus under Nero. His involvement in a conspiracy against Nero resulted in temporary pardon but eventual obligatory suicide.</p>

<p class="list">1. Pedahzur’s son and captain or prince of Manasseh’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.10.23">Nm 10:23</a>). Gamaliel was chosen by Moses to help take the census in the wilderness near Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Num.1.10">1:10</a>) and to organize the tribe for the journey to the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.2.20">2:20</a>). He participated in the special 12-day ceremonial offering by the princes at the dedication of the altar following completion of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.7.54,59">7:54, 59</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Jewish scholar. This man lived in the first century <span class="era">AD</span> and died 18 years before the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 by Titus, the Roman general.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Peter and the other apostles were brought before the enraged and threatening council in Jerusalem, Gamaliel, who was highly respected by the council, offered cautionary advice that probably saved the apostles’ lives in that situation (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.27-40">Acts 5:27-40</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Gamaliel is also mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">Acts 22:3</a> as the rabbi with whom the apostle Paul studied as a youth in Jerusalem. During that period in Israel, a number of rabbinical schools evolved. Two of the most influential were the rival Pharisaic schools of Hillel and Shammai. Both of those teachers had vast influence on Jewish thinking. Hillel’s school emphasized tradition even above the law. Shammai’s school preserved the teaching of the law over the authority of tradition. Hillel’s school was the more influential, and its decisions have been held by a great number of later rabbis.</p>
<p class="list-text">Traditionally, Gamaliel is considered to be the grandson of Hillel, and he was thoroughly schooled in the philosophy and theology of his grandfather’s teaching. Gamaliel was a member of the Sanhedrin, the high council of Jews in Jerusalem, and he served as president of the Sanhedrin during the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. Unlike other Jewish teachers, he had no antipathy toward Greek learning.</p>
<p class="list-text">The learning of Gamaliel was so eminent and his influence so great that he is one of only seven Jewish scholars who have been honored by the title Rabban. He was called the “Beauty of the Law.” The Talmud even says that “since Rabban Gamaliel died, the glory of the Law has ceased.”</p>

<p class="fl">Location in the east of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.8">Gn 2:8</a>) in the Tigris-Euphrates area of Mesopotamia, referred to 14 times in the OT. The information in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.8-10">Genesis 2:8-10</a> indicates that it was in the Shinar Plain area, and that four “heads” or branches were formed from the one river flowing through Eden to water the Garden. The heads were the Tigris and Euphrates (both of which are familiar modern rivers) and two rivers that have disappeared—the Pishon and Gihon. The latter were most probably natural water channels, later used as irrigation canals, since in cuneiform there is no separate word for “river” and “irrigation canal.” If Pishon and Gihon were in fact irrigation canals, then Genesis places Adamic man in an actual geographical setting and therefore obviates the notion that Eden was a myth. If the above identification is correct, Cush referred to the land of the ancient Kassites, while Havilah may have indicated Arabia.</p>
<p>Eden was the testing ground of man’s fidelity to God’s commands, and through disobedience, the Garden was lost. It will be regained in the form of the new paradise (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.14">Rv 22:14</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Walled city (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.6">2 Chr 26:6</a>) and one of the five chief cities of the Philistines, which also included Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, and Ekron (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.3">Jos 13:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.6.17">1 Sm 6:17</a>), all situated on or near the southern coast of Palestine. Although frequently involved in conflict with the Israelites, the city was apparently not subdued until David’s time (<a href="?bref=1Chr.18.1">1 Chr 18:1</a>). It was a Canaanite city, the home of the giant Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.4">1 Sm 17:4</a>) and other men of great height (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.18-22">2 Sm 21:18-22</a>).

<p>When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they carried it from Ebenezer to Ashdod, from there to Gath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.5.8">1 Sm 5:8</a>), and then to Ekron.

<p class="h1">GAULANITIS*</p>
<p class="fl">Small province east of the Sea of Galilee, situated between Mt Hermon and the Yarmuk River and extending perhaps to the Jordan River. It took its name from the ancient town of Golan. Archaeologists have discovered extensive ruins 17 miles (27 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee, which they consider to be the remains of Golan. Moses named Golan as a city of refuge for Manasseh’s half-tribe east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.41,43">Dt 4:41, 43</a>), and Joshua assigned it to the Gershonite Levites (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.8">Jos 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.27">21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.71">1 Chr 6:71</a>). According to Josephus, Alexander Janneus suffered a heavy defeat in this place and later destroyed the town (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 8.2.3). Josephus also identified a Judas who led a tax revolt as being from Gaulanitis (18.1.1), whereas Luke called him a Galilean (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.37">Acts 5:37</a>). Later, Josephus called him a Galilean as well (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 20.5.2; <span class="ital">War</span> 2.8.1). It is quite possible that this Judas lived in these places at different times.</p>
<p>After Herod’s death in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, Philip inherited Gaulanitis, making his capital Bethsaida Julias, which he had rebuilt and named after Augustus Caesar’s daughter. Jesus traveled in this area (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.45">Mk 6:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.22">8:22</a>), and it remained under firm Roman control until <span class="era">AD</span> 66, when the Jewish war broke out. Jewish revolutionaries subsequently hid in its heights and the Romans fought several campaigns here.</p>

  <title>Gaza</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GAZA</p>
<p class="fl">City near the Palestinian coast, about 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) west-southwest of Jerusalem. It has been occupied almost continuously since ancient times; modern Gaza has played an important part in the conflict between Arabs and Israelis. Gazite and Gazathite are biblical names for the residents of the town.</p>
<p>Set about midpoint of the length of the plain of Philistia, Gaza was a rich agricultural area where wheat and similar grains flourished. Situated some three miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Mediterranean, Gaza’s position as the greatest trading center of ancient Palestine did not come from the sea but from the highways, which brought caravans from all parts of the Fertile Crescent. This accessibility was also a handicap, for the roadways along the coast were the easiest route for the armies of Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, Greece, and Rome. Often Gaza was the victim of their passage.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfGaza"/>
<p>In the records of secular history, Gaza first shows up in the annals of Thutmose III in the temple of Karnak. Thutmose wisely scheduled his Asiatic campaigns just after the Egyptian harvest and in time to seize the harvest of Palestine.</p>
<p>In Amarna Letter 289, Abdu-Heba of Jerusalem acknowledged that Gaza was loyal to the king of Egypt but complained that Addaya, the Egyptian ruler of Palestine whose residence was at Gaza, had taken the garrison the pharaoh had sent for Jerusalem. From the late 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>, there is a satirical letter that was composed as an exercise for training scribes. In this letter, written from one scribe to belittle another, various itineraries are traced, including one from the frontier of Egypt to Gaza.</p>
<p>Pharaoh Neco (610–595 <span class="era">BC</span>) captured and chastised Gaza and Ashkelon in the reign of Josiah and Judah (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.47.1,5">Jer 47:1, 5</a>).</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) refers to Hanno of Gaza, who fled to Egypt just prior to the capture of Gaza by the Assyrians. On the Oriental Institute Prism and the Taylor Prism, Sennacherib (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) tells of his invasion of Palestine and of how he shut up Hezekiah “like a bird in a cage.” He captured 46 of Hezekiah’s fortified cities and gave them to three minor kings, including Sillibel of Gaza, who is also mentioned by Esarhaddon (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Ashurbanipal (669–633 <span class="era">BC</span>). Reference to “the king of Gaza” also appears in the records of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (604–562 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>In 332 <span class="era">BC</span> Gaza was captured and punished by Alexander the Great. He was angered because it had held out against him for two months, so he killed all of the men and sold the women and children into slavery. During the Maccabean period, it was taken by Alexander Janneus, who slaughtered its inhabitants.</p>
<p>In the Bible, Gaza is first mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.19">Genesis 10:19</a>, where it is said that the territory of the Canaanites extended from Sidon to Gaza. In a summary of the conquests of Joshua, one of the dimensions of the conquered area is “from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza” (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.41">Jos 10:41</a>). Joshua destroyed all the Anakim in the land, but some remained in Gaza and other Philistine cities (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.22">11:22</a>). Another ancient people, the Avvim, “who lived in villages as far as Gaza,” were annihilated and replaced by the Caphtorim from Caphtor, or Crete (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.23">Dt 2:23</a>). Gaza, along with its towns and villages, was listed among the tribal inheritance of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.47">Jos 15:47</a>). At the time of Joshua’s advanced age, Gaza and the other four cities of the Philistine Pentapolis are said to be among the territories not yet taken (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.3">13:3</a>); in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.18-19">Judges 1:18-19</a>, however, it is reported that Judah took it.</p>
<p>During the time of the judges, Midianite raiders swept through Israel, looting and destroying, even as far as Gaza (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.4">Jgs 6:4</a>). In this period the main biblical interest in Gaza centers in the life and exploits of Samson. Philistine women were Samson’s weakness. He went to Gaza and found a prostitute with whom he had relations (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.1">16:1</a>). The people of Gaza learned that he was there and determined to kill him in the morning, but Samson arose at midnight and went to the gate of the city, took the doors, posts, and the bar of the gate and carried them to the top of a hill facing Hebron.</p>
<p>His involvement with another Philistine woman, Delilah, resulted in his capture by the Philistines, who gouged out his eyes and took him to Gaza (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.21">Jgs 16:21</a>), where he was bound and forced to grind at a mill in the prison. On a festival day in the temple of Dagon, the reveling worshipers called for Samson to be brought so they could make sport of him. His strength was returning, and God answered his prayer for vengeance. Samson dislodged the two pillars that were the support of the stone slab roof of the pagan temple, so Samson died, along with a great number of Gazites.</p>
<p>Gaza is named as the southern boundary of Israel during the time of Solomon, who ruled over “all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.24">1 Kgs 4:24</a>). Hezekiah defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.8">2 Kgs 18:8</a>). When he rebelled against Assyria, Sennacherib came and took 46 of Hezekiah’s cities and gave them to the king of Gaza and two other kings.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Jer.47.1-7">Jeremiah 47</a> records a prophecy against the Philistines, which the Lord gave to the prophet before Pharaoh attacked Gaza (v <a href="?bref=Jer.47.1">1</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Jer.47.5">5</a>; see Neco above). Amos gives specific prophecies of judgment against Gaza (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.6-7">Am 1:6-7</a>). Zephaniah also states that Gaza would be deserted (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.4">Zep 2:4</a>). <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-17">Zechariah 9</a> gives an oracle of judgment in which it is said that Gaza will suffer and that its king shall perish.</p>
<p>In the NT there is only one reference to Gaza (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.26">Acts 8:26</a>). Philip, who was preaching in Samaria, was told by an angel to go south to “the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza.” Here he met the treasurer of Cush, who was reading <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> as he rode in his chariot. Philip preached the gospel to this man and baptized him.</p>

<p class="fl">Levitical city in the territory of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.24">Jos 18:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.17">21:17</a>), about seven miles (11.3 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem and south of Michmash (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.5">1 Sm 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.29">Is 10:29</a>). It is easily confused with Gibeah, the hometown of Saul, which is also in Benjamin, to the southwest of Geba. Both names mean “hill.” The phrase “from Geba to Beersheba” indicated the northern and southern extremities of Judah’s tribe (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.8">2 Kgs 23:8</a>).</p>
<p>In the time of Saul the Philistines had a garrison at Geba (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.3">13:3</a>). Jonathan defeated this outpost and stirred up the Philistines, who swarmed into Israel with an army vastly outnumbering the forces of Saul. Saul and his men were at Geba (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.16">13:16</a>) and later approached Gibeah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.2">14:2</a>). The Philistines had set up a garrison at Michmash, just opposite Geba. Jonathan proposed to his armor bearer that they go over to this outpost and suggested that if the Philistines called to them to come over, that would be a sign that the Lord had given their enemy into their hand. The Philistines did just that, so the two Israelites approached and killed some 20 of the Philistines, putting the garrison and the entire army to rout. During the reign of David, another horde of Philistine invaders was struck down by him “from Geba to Gezer” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.25">2 Sm 5:25</a>).</p>
<p>Men from Geba are mentioned among the Jews who returned from the Babylonian exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.26">Ezr 2:26</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Gaba”; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.31">Neh 11:31</a>).

<p class="list">1. One of the earliest villages in Phoenicia and Syria (along with Ras Shamra and Tell Judeideh); also called Byblos (“books”) by the Greeks. It was situated on the Mediterranean about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) north of modern Beirut and was an important commercial center and outlet for the hardwoods of Lebanon in the period when it was an Egyptian colony and when the diplomatic and commercial interests of Egypt reached all over Syria. It was a city-kingdom according to the Amarna letters (c. 1400–1350 <span class="era">BC</span>), and seal impressions found there from a very early period suggest that it was on a major exchange route through Palestine and Syria. Its inhabitants were called Gebalites (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.5">Jos 13:5</a>). While it was a great commercial center, a more important achievement of the Gebalites was the development of a syllabic script modeled on the Egyptian.

In 586 <span class="era">BC</span> Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, appointed Gedaliah as governor over the Jews remaining in Israel to work the fields, vineyards, and orchards (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.12,22">2 Kgs 25:12, 22</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Gedaliah established his headquarters at Mizpah, where he was joined by the prophet Jeremiah and the Jewish commanders and their guerrilla forces who had escaped capture during the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.6-8">Jer 40:6-8</a>). Gedaliah assured them that if they would settle down and live in peaceful subjection to Babylon, all would be well (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.23-24">2 Kgs 25:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.40.9-10">Jer 40:9-10</a>). On the basis of that assurance, many of the Jews who were dispersed in the Transjordan and other countries returned to Israel to work the land into great productivity (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.11-12">Jer 40:11-12</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Though warned about a plot against him by Ishmael, Gedaliah entertained the schemer at a meal and was killed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.25">2 Kgs 25:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.40.11-12">Jer 40:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.41.1-3">41:1-3</a>).

<p class="list">5. Amariah’s son, grandson of King Hezekiah, and grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.1">Zep 1:1</a>).</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Gehenna">
  <title>Gehenna*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GEHENNA*</p>
<p class="fl">English transliteration of the Greek form of an Aramaic word, which is derived from the Hebrew phrase “the Valley of [the son(s) of] Hinnom.” The name properly designates a deep valley delimiting the territories of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.8">Jos 15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>). It is commonly identified with Wadi el-Rababi that runs from beneath the western wall of the Old City, forming a deep ravine south of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The place became notorious because of the idolatrous practices that were carried out there in the days of Judah’s kings Ahaz and Manasseh, especially involving the heinous crime of infant sacrifices associated with the Molech ceremonies (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.3">2 Kgs 16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.6">21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.3">2 Chr 28:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.6">33:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.19.6">Jer 19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.35">32:35</a>). The spiritual reformation of King Josiah brought an end to these sinister proceedings (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">2 Kgs 23:10</a>). The prophet Jeremiah referred to the valley in picturing God’s judgment upon his people (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.23">Jer 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.30-32">7:30-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.19.5-6">19:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the valley appears to have been used for the burning of the city’s refuse and the dead bodies of criminals. Interestingly, a well-established tradition locates the scene of Judas’s suicide and the consequent purchase of the Potter’s Field on the south side of this valley.</p>
<p>The ravine’s reputation for extreme wickedness gave rise, especially during the intertestamental period, to use of its name as a term for the place of final punishment for the wicked (1 Enoch 18:11-16; 27:1-3; 54:1ff.; 56:3-4; 90:26; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.7.36">2 Esd 7:36</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.30.33">Is 30:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.24">66:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.10">Dn 7:10</a>). Jesus himself utilizes the term to designate the final abode of the unrepentant wicked (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.22">Mt 5:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.9">18:9</a>). Since Gehenna is a fiery abyss (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.43">Mk 9:43</a>), it is also the lake of fire (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.42,50">Mt 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.14-15">Rv 20:14-15</a>) to which all the godless will ultimately be consigned (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.15,33">Mt 23:15, 33</a>), together with Satan and his devils (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.20">Rv 19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10">20:10</a>).</p>
<p>Gehenna must be carefully differentiated from other terms relative to the afterlife or final state. Whereas the OT “Sheol” and NT “hades” uniformly designate the temporary abode of the dead (before the last Day of Judgment), “Gehenna” specifies the final place where the wicked will suffer everlasting punishment (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.49.14-15">Ps 49:14-15</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">Mt 10:28</a>). The Greek form “Tartarus” occurs only in <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Peter 2:4</a> and identifies the particular abode of the angels who fell in the primeval satanic revolt.</p>

<p class="fl">Summary of the important points of rabbinic discussion on the Mishnah (the oral tradition). The Gemara and Mishnah together form the Talmud (which many Jews consider authoritative for their faith). In Aramaic, <span class="ital">Gemara</span> means “acquired learning.” That meaning reflects the teaching method of the rabbis, who passed on the Gemara by committing it to memory rather than writing it down. The word’s Hebrew root means “to complete.” Since the Gemara takes the form of a running commentary on the Mishnah, it serves to supplement and complete it.</p>
<p>Pages of the Talmud are arranged with the Mishnah in the middle and the Gemara in blocks of print on the side. The Gemara does not necessarily quote the same sources twice when dealing with similar passages from the Mishnah on the same problem, nor does it always contain commentary on the Mishnah. The Gemara also includes folklore, astronomy, astrology, medicine, homiletic parables, and examples from great rabbis’ lives.</p>

<p class="h1">GEMATRIA*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the rabbinic hermeneutic rules for interpreting the OT. It consisted of explaining a word or group of words according to the numerical value of the letters or by substituting and rearranging certain letters according to a set system. By that rule of interpretation, for example, some rabbis have argued that Eliezer (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2">Gn 15:2</a>) was worth all the servants of Abraham put together, for Abraham had 318 servants and Eliezer’s name equaled 318 (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.14">Gn 14:14</a>). The name Babylon is arrived at in <a href="?bref=Jer.25.26">Jeremiah 25:26</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.51.41">51:41</a> by substituting the last letter of the Hebrew word for the first letter of the same word.</p>
<p>The pseudepigraphal Epistle of Barnabas interprets the 318 servants of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.14">Gn 14:14</a>) as pointing to Jesus’ death on the cross, because 300 is the numerical value of the Greek letter “t,” which is cross-shaped, and 18 the value of the first two letters of the Greek word for Jesus. In the book of Revelation the number of the beast is 666 (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.18">Rv 13:18</a>). If the number seven is considered to be the perfect number in the Bible, and if three sevens represent complete perfection, then the number 666 falls completely short of perfection.</p>

  <title>Genealogy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GENEALOGY</p>
<p class="fl">Record or study of descent involving a tracing backward or forward of the ancestry of a nation, tribe, family, or individual. The Hebrews were not the only people in the ancient world to take an interest in maintaining genealogical records. The Sumerian king list of the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span> contains records of the early rulers of Mesopotamia. In Babylonian records the word “son” was frequently used in the sense of “descendant of.” King Tirhakah of Egypt (c. 685 <span class="era">BC</span>) referred to his “father,” Sesostris III, who lived some 1,200 years before him. Greeks and Romans also kept genealogical records. However, the biblical genealogies, especially those in Genesis and <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-9.44">1 Chronicles 1–9</a>, are unique in the literature of the ancient Near East. Only at the beginning of the Islamic age are such broad genealogical records found. Even today among tribal Semites, such as Arab nomads, there is an intense interest in genealogy, and it is not unusual for an Arab to be able to recite accurately the names of his ancestors for 10 or 15 generations back, covering a period of several hundred years.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TermsUsed">Terms Used</p>
<p class="fl">The word “genealogy” occurs only once as a noun in the Hebrew OT (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.5">Neh 7:5</a>), where it refers to a register of those who returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel at the end of the exile. The verbal form of the same word is found a total of 20 times in 1—2 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. The terms “generations” and “book of the generations,” used in Genesis and elsewhere in the OT, convey the same idea. The equivalent NT terms are found in <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.4">1 Timothy 1:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Titus.3.9">Titus 3:9</a> (“genealogies”) and <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Matthew 1:1</a>, which refers to the “book of the genealogy” of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeofGenealogicalRecords">Purpose of Genealogical Records</p>
<p class="fl">The keeping of genealogical records in ancient Israel was an important activity and served a number of useful purposes. God’s promise of a land to Abraham and his descendants made such records necessary to establish and preserve the allotment of the land; a genealogical record served as evidence of a legitimate title to the ancestral property. Genealogies were essential for the preservation of the exclusive priesthood that had been established by the Mosaic law. In the time of Josephus every priest was supposed to be able to prove his descent.</p>
<p>One of the most important reasons for keeping genealogical records was to establish and maintain the right of royal succession in Judah through the family of David. The belief that the Messiah would come from the Davidic house made such records even more important.</p>
<p>Other purposes served by these family records included the imposition of military duty according to families (<a href="?bref=Num.1.2-3">Nm 1:2-3</a>). Position in camp and on the march from Egypt was determined by tribes and families (<a href="?bref=Num.2.2,17">2:2, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.11-28">10:11-28</a>). Also, God’s blessings were passed from one member of the family to his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-46">Gn 27</a>). The stress placed on the purity of the congregation (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-4">Dt 7:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.23.1-8">23:1-8</a>) required complete family records, particularly in the postexilic period. With the insistence of Ezra and Nehemiah upon racial purity, and with the purging of foreign elements from among the people (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.59-63">Ezr 2:59-63</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.9-44">10:9-44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-28">Neh 13:23-28</a>), written evidence of purity of descent became essential; interest in the compilation of genealogies became intense after the exile.</p>
<p>Lineage was ordinarily traced through the male members of the family, with females being mentioned only rarely (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.11.29">Gn 11:29</a>, Sarah and Milcah; <a href="?bref=Gen.22.23">22:23</a>, Rebekah; and <a href="?bref=Num.26.33-27.11">Nm 26:33–27:11</a>, where the property inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad was involved). Matthew mentions three women: Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth; and in the second group alludes to Bathsheba (see discussion below).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PrincipalGenealogicalListsintheBible">Principal Genealogical Lists in the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">The principal sources of genealogical material in the OT are found in Genesis, Numbers, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 1—2 Chronicles (which contain the greatest amount of genealogical material in the Bible), Ezra, and Nehemiah. The genealogies of Jesus Christ in <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-25">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.3.1-38">Luke 3</a> are the only NT records. Together they contain a genealogical record from Adam to Christ.</p>
<p>Grouped together by historical periods, the following are the principal genealogical lists found in the Bible:</p>
<p class="h3">Before the Flood</p>
<p class="fl">Three lists are from this period. The first, found in <a href="?bref=Gen.4.17-22">Genesis 4:17-22</a>, traces the descendants of Cain through seven generations and explains the hereditary origin of certain occupations and crafts. The second, <a href="?bref=Gen.4.25-26">Genesis 4:25-26</a>, begins the account of the descendants of Seth, the posterity of Adam whose faithfulness to God is contrasted with the ungodly posterity of Cain. The third list, <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-32">Genesis 5:1-32</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-4">1 Chr 1:1-4</a>), traces the descendants of Adam through Seth down to Noah and his sons at the time of the Flood.</p>
<p class="h3">From Noah to Abraham</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Genesis 10:1-32</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.4-23">1 Chr 1:4-23</a>), frequently called the “table of nations,” contains a list of the nations descended from the sons of Noah (Shem, Ham, and Japheth). <a href="?bref=Gen.11.10-26">Genesis 11:10-26</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.24-27">1 Chr 1:24-27</a>) traces the descendants of Shem to the time of Abraham, and <a href="?bref=Gen.11.27-30">Genesis 11:27-30</a> (see also <a href="?bref=Gen.22.20-24">Gn 22:20-24</a>) lists the descendants of Nahor, Abraham’s brother.</p>
<p class="h3">From Abraham to the Descent into Egypt</p>
<p class="fl">The descendants of Abraham by Hagar, Sarah, and Keturah are found in <a href="?bref=Gen.16.15">Genesis 16:15</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-3">21:1-3</a>, and <a href="?bref=Gen.25.1-4">25:1-4</a> (introducing the Arabs as descendants of Abraham; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.28-34">1 Chr 1:28-34</a>). <a href="?bref=Gen.19.37-38">Genesis 19:37-38</a> links the Moabites and Ammonites to Abraham through his nephew Lot. A very important genealogical list during this period is that of the descendants of Jacob, giving the account of the parentage, birth, and naming of the founders of the 12 tribes of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.31-30.24">Gn 29:31–30:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.16-26">35:16-26</a>). Esau is acknowledged as the ancestor of the Edomites; his Edomite descendants are traced through his three wives (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.34">Gn 26:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1-43">36:1-43</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.35-54">1 Chr 1:35-54</a>). The list of Jacob’s family at the time he entered Egypt, numbering 70, is found in <a href="?bref=Gen.46.1-27">Genesis 46:1-27</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.6.14-16">Ex 6:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.1-51">Nm 26:1-51</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1-8.40">1 Chr 2–8</a>). A partial list of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Reuben, Simeon, and Levi is found in <a href="?bref=Exod.6.14-25">Exodus 6:14-25</a>; the chief purpose of this genealogy is to establish Aaron and Moses as members of Levi’s tribe.</p>
<p class="h3">From the Exodus to the Conquest of Canaan</p>
<p class="fl">While the tribes were still in the desert after leaving Egypt, a census was taken to determine the total number of Israelites (<a href="?bref=Num.1.4-54">Nm 1:4-54</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.2.2-33">2:2-33</a>). During this same period, a genealogy of the family of Aaron was compiled, and a separate census was taken of the Levites (<a href="?bref=Num.3.1-39">3:1-39</a>). A list of the 12 spies who searched out the land and the tribes they represented is given in <a href="?bref=Num.13.4-16">Numbers 13:4-16</a>; the most important names on this list are Caleb and Joshua. Near the end of the wilderness wanderings, another census of the people was ordered; the total number was approximately the same as that of the first census almost 40 years earlier (<a href="?bref=Num.26.4-51,57-62">26:4-51, 57-62</a>). As the tribes neared the Promised Land, a list was prepared of the tribal representatives who would take part in the division of the land (<a href="?bref=Num.34.16-29">34:16-29</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Period of the Kings</p>
<p class="fl">During the entire period of the monarchy, over 400 years, the only genealogical records of any consequence are those that pertain to David. His descendants are traced through 20 rulers who sat upon the throne of Judah until the nation fell to the Babylonians in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> (1—2 Kgs; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.1--2Chr.36.21">1 Chr 11:1—2 Chr 36:21</a>). A list of David’s children is found in <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.2-5">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a> and <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.14-16">5:14-16</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1-9">1 Chr 3:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.4-7">14:4-7</a>). His mighty men, an elite group of soldiers, are named in <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.8-39">2 Samuel 23:8-39</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.10-47">1 Chr 11:10-47</a>). His recruits at Ziklag are recorded in <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.1-22">1 Chronicles 12:1-22</a>. Those who were his musicians and doorkeepers when the ark was brought to Jerusalem are named in <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.1-24">1 Chronicles 15:1-24</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.5-6,37-43">1 Chr 16:5-6, 37-43</a>). David’s political and religious organization of the kingdom—including the Levites, priests, singers, porters and other administrative officials, and military officers—is found in <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.1-27.34">1 Chronicles 23–27</a>. In spite of the literary activity associated with the reign of Solomon, the only genealogical record preserved from this period is that of Solomon’s princes and 12 officers (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.1-19">1 Kgs 4:1-19</a>). The genealogy of one prophet is traced back four generations (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.1">Zep 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Postexilic Period</p>
<p class="fl">During the postexilic period, the keeping of genealogical records probably received its greatest impetus through the activity of Ezra and Nehemiah, primarily because of their insistence upon racial purity and the purging of foreign elements from the community. A list of the exiles who returned with Zerubbabel is found in <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.1-70">Ezra 2:1-70</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.7.6-73">Neh 7:6-73</a>, where the same list is found). A list of those who returned with Ezra is included in <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.1-20">8:1-20</a>. Ezra’s own genealogy is also recorded (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.5">Ezr 7:5</a>). There is a list of the Jews who married foreign women that included priests, Levites, singers, porters, and other Israelites (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.18-44">Ezr 10:18-44</a>). <a href="?bref=Neh.8.4-7">Nehemiah 8:4-7</a> names the Levites and others who assisted Ezra when he read the law publicly. Nehemiah also contains a list of those who participated in the ceremony of sealing the covenant (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.1-27">Neh 10:1-27</a>) and a list of those who lived in Jerusalem and other cities (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.3-36">11:3-36</a>). His interest in the priesthood is reflected in the list of priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.1-9">12:1-9</a>), of the high priests from Jeshua to Jaddua (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.12.10-11">10-11</a>), of the heads of the priestly families (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.12.12-21">12-21</a>), of the Levites and porters who served under the high priest (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.12.22-26">22-26</a>), and of the princes and priests who were present at the dedication of the rebuilt wall of Jerusalem (vv <a href="?bref=Neh.12.31-42">31-42</a>).</p>
<p>The final genealogical record that must be mentioned is the genealogy from Adam to Saul (<a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-8.40">1 Chr 1–8</a>), the longest section of genealogical material in the Bible. It is properly included with the genealogies compiled during the postexilic period, as the unknown chronicler (some think he was Ezra) prepared this list around 400 <span class="era">BC</span> from extant records and documents available to him. His purpose seems to have been to conserve the purity of blood in the restored nation and to insist that the nation’s well-being depended on its faithfulness to God’s law.</p>
<p class="h3">The New Testament Period</p>
<p class="fl">The only genealogies of consequence in the NT are those concerning Jesus Christ in <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-17">Matthew 1:1-17</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.3.23-38">Luke 3:23-38</a>. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=GenealogyofJesusChrist_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Genealogy of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="MatthewsGenealogy">Matthew’s Genealogy (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-17">1:1-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Matthew 1:1</a> presents Jesus Christ as “the son of David, the son of Abraham.” By those two names, Matthew highlights Jesus’ earthly relationship to the Abrahamic (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-8">Gn 17:1-8</a>) and Davidic (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.12-16">2 Sm 7:12-16</a>) covenants of promise. Then beginning with the patriarch Abraham, Matthew traces Jesus’ human ancestry through King David to Joseph, “the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.16">Mt 1:16</a>). Matthew summarizes his account: “So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.17">17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>An examination of Matthew’s handling of this genealogical material discloses several interesting peculiarities:</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TheGenealogyOfJesusChrist"/>
<p class="list-space">1. The arrangement of the names into three groups of 14 seems to be an artificial device. </p>
<p class="list">2. To have 14 names in the second group, Matthew omits three kings—Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah—between Joram and Uzziah (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.8">8</a>), and one, Jehoiakim, between Josiah and Jeconiah (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.11">11</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. In the first group Matthew mentions three women—Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth; and in the second group, he alludes to Bathsheba. This is an uncommon practice in genealogies, and all the more strange when it is noted that these four represent what could be regarded as moral blemishes in the history of the Davidic dynasty— Tamar, a victim of incest; Rahab, a prostitute; Ruth, a Moabitess; and Bathsheba, an adulteress.</p>
<p class="list">4. In the first group Matthew mentions Judah’s brothers and Zerah, Perez’s brother. In the second group he refers to Jeconiah’s brothers.</p>
<p class="list">5. In verse <a href="?bref=Matt.1.6">6</a> David is called “the king.”</p>
<p class="sp">From these data, it is obvious that Matthew does not intend to present a strict genealogy; the arrangement is contrived, and extraneous material is included, probably for some other purpose than merely to present Jesus’ forebears. Matthew’s arrangement of the names into groups of 14, probably guided by an interest in portraying Jesus to Jews as the promised king of Israel and rightful heir to the Davidic throne, gives a definite historical movement to the genealogy by dividing it into three periods of time. These respectively highlight the origin, rise to power, and decay of the Davidic house, the last point represented by the lowly birth of the promised heir to a carpenter of Nazareth.</p>
<p>The 14 names in each group may be an effort to call attention to the thrice-royal character of Mary’s son by focusing on the numerical value 14 of the Hebrew letters in David’s name (d=4, v=6, d=4). This number also happens to be twice the sacred number seven, so that the whole list is composed of three sets of two sevens each. It may be, however, that the contrived groupings were merely intended to aid in memorization.</p>
<p>With respect to the second peculiarity—the “missing name” in the third group—one must conclude that either David or Jeconiah is to be counted twice, these being the pivotal names separating the three groups, or that a name was mistakenly dropped out in a copy of Matthew’s original Gospel.</p>
<p>The third peculiarity presents no difficulty at all. Numerous genealogies in Scripture omit some names. Ancient Near Eastern writers often used the phrase “the son of,” or the word “begat,” quite flexibly, relating grandsons or great-grandsons, for instance, to earlier forebears without indicating every intervening ancestor. The modern mind should not require a precision in ancient records that ancient writers themselves did not insist on.</p>
<p>The women listed in the genealogy—the fourth peculiarity—may have been intended to disarm Jewish criticism about Jesus’ birth (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-25">1:18-25</a>) by showing that irregular unions were not disqualifications for the Messiah’s legal ancestry.</p>
<p>The reason for including several brothers in the genealogy at three points—the fifth peculiarity—is not readily discernible. The mention of “Judah and his brothers” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.2">1:2</a>) may simply be following an established practice of speaking of the 12 patriarchs together.</p>
<p>Finally, David’s description as “the king” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.6">1:6</a>) underscores the Davidic or royal character of the list.</p>
<p>The sources employed in compiling the first group in the genealogy drew upon records preserved in <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.27-2.15">1 Chronicles 1:27–2:15</a> and in <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ruth 4:18-22</a>. The second group followed the records found in 1—2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. The third group relied mainly on public or private records from the intertestamental period; the nine names from Abiud to Jacob are not mentioned elsewhere in Scripture.</p>
<p>On the basis of this genealogy, if there had been a Davidic throne in Joseph’s day, the lowly carpenter would have been the legal heir to it, and Jesus stood after him as the next in line to inherit the royal seat.</p>
<p>It has been argued against this understanding of Matthew’s genealogy that the presence of Jeconiah in the list (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.11">Mt 1:11</a>) jeopardizes, if not completely negates, the legal claim to the Davidic throne of everyone descending directly from him. That is because the Lord declared of him: “Write this man down as childless, . . . for none of his offspring shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David, and ruling again in Judah” (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.30">Jer 22:30</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Therefore, it is said, it could not have been Matthew’s intention to represent the men from Shealtiel to Joseph as legal heirs to the throne.</p>
<p>This is a point that admittedly could dispose of the view that the list presents David’s descendants if it were not for the fact that Shealtiel, who in Matthew’s record is represented as the son of Jeconiah, appears also in Luke’s genealogy as the son of Neri (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.27">Lk 3:27</a>). Neri’s name is unique to Luke’s Gospel, so it is impossible to check its use elsewhere to discover the actual parentage of Shealtiel. But it is not surprising in the light of <a href="?bref=Jer.22.30">Jeremiah 22:30</a> to find him listed in both accounts with different parents. Neri most likely was Shealtiel’s real father, and while it is impossible to determine Neri’s precise relationship to Jeconiah, it may be that those responsible for determining and keeping the record of the legal heirs to the Davidic throne looked to the collateral line of Neri and selected Shealtiel as the man to be legally adopted into the line and the one through whom the line would continue. Shealtiel may well have died without a male descendant, which made it necessary to look to Zerubbabel, the son of Pedaiah, Shealtiel’s brother by adoption, as the legal heir to the Davidic throne. By this pair of adoptions, the curse upon Jeconiah was fulfilled while an actual grandson of Jeconiah continued the line, inasmuch as the grandson was legally the son of Shealtiel, who in turn was the actual son of Neri. Jeconiah’s presence in the genealogy is a strength, rather than a weakness, for the interpretation that Matthew’s Gospel intended to present the legal heirs of the Davidic throne, since only a writer conscious of the problems surrounding Jeconiah’s lineage, but also aware of an explanation, would present such an ancestry to a Jewish audience he was seeking to convince that Jesus was indeed the royal Messiah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LukesGenealogy">Luke’s Genealogy (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.23-38">3:23-38</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Luke’s genealogy also has peculiarities.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Some expositors have thought it significant that Luke’s genealogy appears not at the beginning of the Gospel but at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry.</p>
<p class="list">2. Luke’s account, in contrast to Matthew’s, begins with Jesus and traces his lineage back through OT history. This seems irregular, for most genealogies follow the order of succession.</p>
<p class="list">3. Luke’s account, furthermore, does not end with Abraham but goes all the way back to “Adam, the son of God” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.38">Lk 3:38</a>).</p>
<p class="sp">Some have seen the first peculiarity as a result of Luke’s desire to bring a period of sacred history to its close, and to signal the beginning of another with the person and especially the ministry of Jesus. The genealogy, located as it is, sets off the work of Christ from the accounts of his birth and preparation.</p>
<p>Many have suggested that the regressive order in the genealogy is probably Luke’s instrument to focus attention on Jesus. The fact that Luke traced Jesus’ ancestry back to Adam, “the son of God,” was probably due to the fact that he wrote for Romans and Greeks. By tracing Jesus’ ancestry back to Adam, he shows Jesus to be related to the whole human race. In Luke’s genealogy Jesus and Adam are both “sons of God”; Jesus, of course, is the son of God by nature; Adam, the son of God by having been created in God’s image.</p>
<p>As to his sources, it is rather certain that Luke used the Septuagint version (ancient Greek version of the OT) of <a href="?bref=Gen.11.12">Genesis 11:12</a>, which inserts the name Cainan between Shelah and Arphaxad (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.36">Lk 3:36</a>), and the records of <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-3.24">1 Chronicles 1–3</a> for the history down to David. For the period from David to Jesus, most expositors agree that Luke relied upon information probably received directly from Mary or from persons close to her. It was a common practice among the Jewish people for genealogical records to be maintained both publicly and privately. There was special concern in families of Davidic descent to preserve their ancestral records because of OT prophecies that Messiah would be born in the house of David.</p>
<p>Luke no doubt intended to accomplish more by his list than merely a presentation of a number of Jesus’ ancestors. Since Luke did not highlight David in his list, it may be assumed that he was not zealous to present a list of legal heirs to the Davidic throne—not that the issue is of no concern to him (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.1.27,32,69">Lk 1:27, 32, 69</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.4,11">2:4, 11</a>). Rather, a concern throughout Luke’s Gospel is this emphasis—that of portraying the Christ as the Savior of Romans and Greeks—indeed, of the world. Therefore, though Luke traced Jesus’ ancestry through Joseph’s ancestral line to David, he continued beyond David to Adam. Jesus is a member of the race to which all people belong.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRelationshipbetweentheTwoRecords">The Relationship between the Two Records</p>
<p class="fl">Even a cursory examination of the two genealogies of Jesus will show several differences. For example, Matthew’s genealogy comprises 41 generations, while Luke lists 76. Luke includes the period between Adam and Abraham; Matthew does not. While the two lists are practically identical from Abraham to David, they diverge for the period from David to Jesus, Matthew tracing Jesus’ lineage from David through Solomon in 27 generations, whereas Luke traces Jesus’ lineage from David through Nathan, another son, in 42 generations. Furthermore, at only one point do the lines converge during this period: at the names of Shealtiel and Zerubbabel, who are doubtless the same men in both lists. Finally, Matthew represents Joseph as the son of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.16">Mt 1:16</a>), whereas in Luke’s account he is the son of Heli (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.23">Lk 3:23</a>).</p>
<p>How are these differences to be explained? The differences between these lists stem from the purposes for which they were compiled and the meanings they were intended to convey.</p>
<p>A widely held explanation is that Matthew gives Jesus’ ancestry through Joseph and that Luke gives his ancestry through Mary. On this interpretation Jacob was Joseph’s real father, and Heli (probably Mary’s father) became Joseph’s foster father, that is, Joseph was Heli’s “son,” or heir, by his marriage to Mary, assuming that Heli had no sons (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-11">Nm 27:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.36.1-12">36:1-12</a>). This view is certainly a possibility and should not be rejected out of hand. If Mary was a direct descendant of David, it could be literally said of any son of hers, “He is the seed of David.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, many scholars prefer to regard Luke’s genealogy as that of Joseph rather than Mary, since it is to Joseph’s ancestry that Luke calls the reader’s attention (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.27">Lk 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.4">2:4</a>). Furthermore, nowhere in Scripture is Mary said to be of Davidic descent. If the fact that Joseph was not the actual father of Jesus nullifies any value that Joseph’s lineage might otherwise possess for a real son, why does Luke point to Joseph’s lineage twice, and to Mary’s not at all?</p>
<p>A major difficulty for the view that regards both genealogies as Joseph’s is related to Joseph’s two fathers. One solution is that Matthew gives the legal descendants of David but Luke gives the actual descendants of David in the line to which Joseph belonged. This would mean that Heli was Joseph’s real father and that Jacob was his legal foster father. How this could be is readily explainable. Assuming that Jacob’s father, Matthan (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.15">Mt 1:15</a>), and Heli’s father, Matthat (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.24">Lk 3:24</a>), are the same person, then Jacob (the elder) may have died without a male descendant so that his nephew, the son of his brother Heli, would have become his heir.</p>
<p>If Matthan and Matthat are not the same person, one might postulate that Jacob, the legal heir to the throne, died without a descendant and that Joseph, son of Heli, became the legal heir immediately upon the death of Heli and was counted as Jacob’s son in a list of legal heirs to the throne. Possibly Heli, a relative, married Jacob’s widow, thereby making Joseph, the son of that union, Heli’s son and Jacob’s son by levirate marriage. In other words, there are a number of possible explanations of this divergence.</p>
<p>One other major objection to the view that regards both genealogies as Joseph’s is that, because of the virgin birth of Jesus, one may in no sense speak of Jesus as being literally the seed of David—a proposition that Scripture seems to insist upon. This objection has been adequately countered: (1) because of the realistic manner in which the Jews looked upon adoptive fatherhood; and (2) because the relationship in which Jesus stood to Joseph was much closer than a case of ordinary adoption, there being no earthly father to dispute Joseph’s paternal relation to Jesus. Jesus could and would have been regarded as Joseph’s son and heir with complete propriety, satisfying every scriptural demand that he be the “seed of David.” The question, therefore, whether Mary as well as Joseph was a descendant of David does not need to be answered one way or the other by one who desires to defend Jesus’ Davidic descent.</p>
<p>It is beyond human reach to discover for certain the full solution to the divergences between the two genealogies of Jesus, or the actual relationship of Jesus to them. Enough has been said to demonstrate that they are reconcilable, and the purposes of each, suggested here, indicate that either of the ways outlined above does full justice to the Davidic descent of Jesus, as rightful heir to his ancestor’s covenanted throne, and also to his virgin birth by Mary.</p>

<p class="fl">The name Genesis comes into English as a transliteration of the Greek word meaning “origin” or “beginning.” This name was given to the book in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, known as the Septuagint. Genesis reflects both the content of the book and the Hebrew name for it, which is taken from its first word, <span class="hebrew">bere’shith</span><span class="ital">,</span> “in the beginning.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The authorship of Genesis is closely related to the authorship of the entire Pentateuch (lit. “five-volumed,” the first five books of the Bible, which in Hebrew are called the Torah). It is clear that the Bible regards the human author of these books as Moses. On several occasions the Lord commanded Moses to write down various things: “in a book” (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.14">Ex 17:14</a>) “write these words” (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.27">34:27</a>). The Pentateuch reports that “Moses wrote all the words of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">24:4</a>); he wrote the itinerary of the exodus wanderings (<a href="?bref=Num.33.2">Nm 33:2</a>); “Moses wrote this law” (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.9">Dt 31:9</a>). (Here it is not certain that all five books are meant, but it must refer to at least the greater part of Deuteronomy.) In <a href="?bref=Exod.24.7">Exodus 24:7</a> it is said that Moses read the Book of the Covenant, which he must have just completed.</p>
<p>The rest of the OT bears witness to the writing of the Pentateuch by Moses. David referred to “the law of Moses” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.3">1 Kgs 2:3</a>). In the time of Josiah, there was found in the temple the “Book of the Law of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> . . . given through Moses” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.14">2 Chr 34:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Day by day Ezra read from “the Book of the Law of God” (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.18">Neh 8:18</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>In the NT, Jesus refers to “the book of Moses” (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.26">Mk 12:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.37">Lk 20:37</a>) and otherwise mentions the commands or statements of Moses (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.4">Mt 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.10">Mk 7:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.16.31">Lk 16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">24:44</a>). The Jews also quoted from the Torah as coming from Moses, and Jesus did not contradict them.</p>
<p>Of Genesis in particular, it may be said that Moses had the opportunity and ability to write the book. He could have written it during his years in Egypt or while exiled with the Kenites. As the recognized leader of the Israelites, he would have had access to, or perhaps even custody of, the records that Jacob brought from Canaan. He was “instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.22">Acts 7:22</a>) and probably could have written in several languages and in several scripts (hieroglyphic, cuneiform, Old Hebrew). Although Moses was admirably fitted for the task of writing, one must remember that he was not putting together a human composition but was writing under the inspiration of God (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.21">2 Pt 1:21</a>). We may with confidence conclude that Moses was the human author of Genesis.</p>
<p>The liberal view of the authorship of Genesis is that the book is an editorial composite—a view first put forward by a French physician, Jean Astruc, who suggested that the different names for God indicated different documents or sources for the writing of the book. The German higher critics expanded the view of the use of documents in the writing of Genesis and developed it into the Graf-Wellhausen-Kuenen, or Documentary, Hypothesis, which may also be called the JEDP theory of the authorship of the book. This view holds that there were four basic documents: (1) J, which uses the name YHWH (Jehovah or Yahweh) for God, dates from about the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span> and comes from Judah; (2) E uses the name Elohim, dates from the eighth century, and comes from the northern kingdom; (3) D is Deuteronomy and is supposed to come from the time of Josiah, about 621 <span class="era">BC</span>; and (4) P is the priestly element, which deals with matters of the priesthood and ritual, dating to the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> or later. Some may date portions of Genesis as late as the Hellenistic period. According to this theory, the various documents were blended together by editors, so that there was a JE, JED, and so on.</p>
<p>The science of archaeology discredited many of the extreme postulations of these critics, and the work of W. F. Albright and his followers did much to restore confidence in the historicity of Genesis. Within the last several decades, the patriarchal narratives and the account of Joseph have again come under strong attack, but these views are extreme, and much of the evidence adduced by Albright and earlier scholars like R. D. Wilson, W. H. Green, and others still has validity.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The date of the book is also a matter of debate. Even among those who accept Mosaic authorship there is debate as to when Moses lived. Based on the biblical data, Moses should have lived in the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span> (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.11.26">Jgs 11:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kgs 6:1</a>), but many scholars incline toward a 13th-century date. As outlined above, the liberal view of the date of Genesis would be from the ninth to the fifth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, with the final editing coming around the fifth century or perhaps even later.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Genesis sketches the origin of many things: the universe, the earth, plants, animals, and mankind. It gives the beginnings of human institutions, professions, and crafts. It describes the origin of sin and death, and illustrates the insidious working of Satan in human life. Above all, Genesis relates the beginning of the history of redemption with the announcement of a Redeemer who was to come (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>). It names the early progenitors in the lineage of the Messiah and the beginning of the Hebrew people through whom the Bible and the Savior came. Genesis also gives a selective history of people and events as viewed from the perspective of the purposes of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Structure">Structure</p>
<p class="fl">The book is divided into 11 parts of uneven length, each set off by the expression “these are the generations [descendants, history] of” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.4">2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.6.9">6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.10.1">10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.11.10,27">11:10, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.12,19">25:12, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1">36:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.37.2">37:2</a>). Only three times does the formula coincide with the first verse of a chapter. Usually called a heading or superscription, the expression serves as a kind of link between what precedes and what follows.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The Creation (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-2.25">1:1–2:25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">These two chapters have been a scientific-theological battleground for many years, as researchers and students have tried to probe the origins of the universe and of life. Much of the evidence is not subject to scientific scrutiny, for science by definition requires that the evidence must be reproducible by experiment.</p>
<p>The statement of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</a> remains the grandest, most precise, and most accurate statement of origins: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” He did this <span class="ital">ex nihilo</span> (“out of nothing”) by his word (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.3">Heb 11:3</a>); he spoke the word of command and it was done (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.3,6,9,11,14,20">Gn 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6,9">Ps 33:6, 9</a>).</p>
<p>The date of the beginning is unknown. Uniformitarian cosmogonists (students of the origins of the universe who believe that natural events have always followed a uniform pattern; cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.3-7">2 Pt 3:3-7</a>) have speculated that the beginning of the universe was billions of years ago. But some creationists posit a world thousands of years old.</p>
<p>To accommodate geological ages and the existence of extinct animals, some interpreters have proposed a gap between <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1">Genesis 1:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">1:2</a>, with <a href="?bref=Gen.1.2-2.3">Genesis 1:2–2:3</a> representing a second or new creation. But this is conjecture. So is the idea that each day represents a geological age.</p>
<p>As the text stands, there is a correlation between the first three days and the second three days. Day one saw the creation of light; day four, the light bearers. Day two was the time of the creation of the firmament (better, “expanse”), which divided the waters; day five, birds and swarming water creatures. On day three, God made the dry land and plants; on day six he created the land animals and man. He made man in the image of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26">Gn 1:26</a>), “a little less than God” (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Ps 8:5</a>), and gave him dominion over the earth. He made everything “according to their kinds,” so that each kind is distinct and unique. The perfection of his work is affirmed in that “God saw that it was good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.4,10,12,18,21">Gn 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21</a>; “very good,” v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">31</a>). The seventh day was a time of cessation from the activity of creating and served as a type for mankind’s day of rest (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-3">2:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>Critical scholarship eyes <a href="?bref=Gen.2.4-25">2:4-25</a> as a doublet in conflict with <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-2.3">Genesis 1:1–2:3</a>. To conservative scholars, the second chapter is the same account from a different perspective. Chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">1</a> gives the Creation from the standpoint of sequence; chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">2</a> shows it in view of the centrality of mankind in God’s creative work.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">2</a> gives details of the creation of man of “dust from the ground” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">7</a>) and woman from a rib of the man (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.2.21-22">21-22</a>). She was created to be “a companion who will help him” (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.2.18-20">18-20</a>). They were created as mature adults, with the gift of speech and with great intelligence. Adam had imagination and vocabulary sufficient for naming all of the animal species (v <a href="?bref=Gen.2.19">19</a>).</p>
<p>The location of the Garden of Eden is given (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.2.10-14">10-14</a>). Two of the four rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, can be identified with certainty. So man lived in this beautiful garden in the bliss of innocence.</p>
<p class="h3">The History of Humankind from Eden to Babel (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-11.26">3:1–11:26</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">The Fall</p>
<p class="fl">The loss of Eden and the break in fellowship with God is the saddest chapter in human history. The serpent, the devil, approached Eve with the same philosophy he always uses: doubt of God’s word (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1">Gn 3:1</a>), denial of death (v <a href="?bref=Gen.3.4">4</a>), and the suggestion of equality with God (v <a href="?bref=Gen.3.5">5</a>). He gained access to her will by deceiving her with the promise that the fruit would make her as wise as God is (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.5">Gn 3:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.16">1 Jn 2:16</a>). Eve was deceived, but when she offered the fruit to Adam, he took it willingly, knowing what he was doing (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.6">Gn 3:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.14">1 Tm 2:14</a>). Later, he tried to blame God for giving him the wife who gave him the fruit (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.12">Gn 3:12</a>). Fellowship with God was broken (v <a href="?bref=Gen.3.8">8</a>), yet God came seeking Adam and found him.</p>
<p>With sin came judgment, and the Lord pronounced righteous judgment on the serpent, the woman, and the man. The earth was also “subjected to frustration” and now groans as it awaits renewal (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.21-22">Rom 8:21-22</a>). God gave hope to man and a promise of a Redeemer (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>), who was to bruise the serpent’s head. Adam and Eve were forced out of the Garden, and it was made inaccessible to them.</p>
<p>The impatience of humankind is shown in Eve’s expectation that her son Cain was the promised Deliverer. Instead, he developed a wrong-hearted attitude toward God and became so jealous of his younger brother that he murdered him. Apprehended by God and confronted with his crime, Cain showed only self-pity and went east from Eden, where he built a city (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.1-16">4:1-16</a>). Chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.4.1-26">4</a> closes with another contrast: the brazen Lamech, who called for vengeance, while others began to call upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="h4">The Generations of Adam</p>
<p class="fl">This genealogical table (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-32">5:1-32</a>) brings humankind to the time of Noah and the Flood. The longevity of the antediluvian patriarchs seems very striking to us, but one must remember that the earth had not yet been subjected to pollution and that the effects of sin on the human race were still nominal. The refrain “and he died” reminds us of man’s mortality. For Enoch, however, there was something better: “He enjoyed a close relationship with God throughout his life. Then, suddenly, he disappeared because God took him” (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.24">5:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Flood</p>
<p class="fl">With increased population came an eruption of sin (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-5">6:1-5</a>). As men multiplied, so did their corruption. The universal condemnation of verse <a href="?bref=Gen.6.5">5</a> shows a world ripe for judgment. Noah, however, “found favor with the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,” for he was a righteous and blameless man who walked with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.8-9">6:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord planned to annihilate the human race, but he determined to save Noah and his family. Intending to flood the earth, God instructed Noah to build an ark. Noah was directed to take animals aboard the ark, two by two, male and female, for the preservation of each species. When all was in readiness, the Flood came: “the underground waters burst forth on the earth, and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky” (<a href="?bref=Gen.7.11">7:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). It rained for 40 days and 40 nights. The highest mountains were covered, and life outside the ark perished. “But God remembered Noah” and sent a wind to evaporate the waters (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.1">8:1</a>). Eventually the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat (v <a href="?bref=Gen.8.4">4</a>). Noah made a sacrifice to the Lord, and the Lord determined that he would never again bring such destruction upon the earth.</p>
<p>The Flood is another of God’s acts that has been much debated. Many have argued for a local flood, which affected only part of Mesopotamia. Archaeologists have pointed to various flood strata in the excavation of Mesopotamian city-mounds as evidence for the account of the flood and have cited the various flood stories from that area as the source of the Genesis record. The epic of Gilgamesh gives an interesting tale of this hero, who went on a mission to visit Utnapishtim, the cuneiform Noah, in quest of eternal life. The flood story told by Utnapishtim has many parallels to Genesis, but there are greater contrasts, which demonstrate that the Bible preserves the true account.</p>
<p>Both the Genesis account and the references to it in the NT (cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.6">2 Pt 3:6</a>) favor the view that the deluge was not a minor episode in the Tigris-Euphrates area but was an unprecedented worldwide catastrophe. Christian geologists affirm that the Flood had far-reaching effects on the earth itself. Flood stories are almost universally known, lending support to the conclusion that the Flood covered the whole earth. Following the Flood, God blessed Noah and his sons, Ham, Shem, and Japheth. God made a covenant with Noah, promising that he would never again send a worldwide flood. As a sign of this, he established the rainbow.</p>
<p>Noah was the first tiller of the soil, and he planted a vineyard (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.20">9:20</a>). Noah became drunk from wine he made and lay uncovered in his tent. Ham saw him and reported this to his brothers, who discreetly covered him. Ham and his son Canaan were cursed; Shem and Japheth were blessed.</p>
<p class="h4">The History of the Nations</p>
<p class="fl">“This is the history of the families of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the three sons of Noah. Many children were born to them after the Flood” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1">10:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This chapter lists the descendants of Noah’s three sons, in the order of Japheth (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.2-5">2-5</a>), Ham (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.6-20">6-20</a>), and Shem (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.21-31">21-31</a>). Many of the names of their descendants are preserved in tribes and nations of the world.</p>
<p class="h4">The Tower of Babel</p>
<p class="fl">The building of the Tower of Babel (“Gate of God”) illustrates man’s perversity and his tendency to want independence from God. The desire of man to displace God follows the fateful example of Lucifer and is a basic tenet of many cults. God thwarted the designs of the builders of Babel by confusing their languages, so that the project came to a halt (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">11:1-9</a>). The site of this tower is not known with certainty. Some associate it with Birs Nimrud, not far from the ruins of the city of Babylon. <a href="?bref=Gen.11.10-25">Genesis 11:10-25</a> picks up the line of Shem and carries it down to Terah, the father of Abram.</p>
<p class="h3">The History of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.27-25.10">11:27–25:10</a>) and Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-28.5">21:1–28:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Abram came from Ur of the Chaldees, a prosperous city. The city had an imposing ziggurat (temple-tower), with many temples, storehouses, and residences. Abram and Sarai, his half sister and wife, went with his father to Haran in Syria, which like Ur was a center of the worship of the moon god, Sin (or Annar).</p>
<p class="h4">Abram’s Call</p>
<p class="fl">The call of God came to Abram directing him to leave his relatives and move to a land that the Lord would show him (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1">12:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.7.2-3">Acts 7:2-3</a>). Abram obeyed. At the age of 75, he, Sarai, and his nephew Lot left Haran and went to Shechem, where the Lord appeared to him and promised that land to his descendants.</p>
<p>Famine drove Abram down to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.10-20">Gn 12:10-20</a>). Because of Sarai’s beauty, he feared that someone might kill him to get her, so he passed her off as his sister. She was taken into the pharaoh’s harem. When the Lord plagued Pharaoh because of this, Abram’s lie was discovered and Sarai was returned to him.</p>
<p class="h4">Abram and Lot</p>
<p class="fl">Abram and Lot returned to Canaan, where strife broke out between Abram’s herdsmen and those of Lot. Abram suggested that they should separate, and he gave Lot the choice of territory. Lot chose the well-watered Jordan Valley and the cities of the plain, Sodom and Gomorrah (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.13.1-18">13</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Invasion of the Four Kings from the East</p>
<p class="fl">The four kings who invaded along the King’s Highway in Transjordan cannot be identified with certainty. Those kings were successful in their attack against the five cities of the plain, and they moved off with much booty and many captives, including Lot. Abram took 318 retainers, born in his household, and set off after them. By surprise attack, Abram recovered both Lot and the loot. On his return he was met by Melchizedek, king of Jerusalem, to whom Abram paid tithes (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">14</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">The Lord promised Abram a son as heir, and in an impressive nighttime ceremony, God made a covenant with Abram and promised him the land from the River of Egypt (Wadi el Arish) to the Euphrates (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">15</a>). Because of her own barrenness, Sarai gave her Egyptian maid, Hagar, to Abram. Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, the progenitor of the Arab peoples. When trouble arose between the women, Sarai sent Hagar away, which was her right according to Near Eastern customs (as illustrated by the Nuzi tablets). God showed mercy to Hagar and promised that she would have a great posterity (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">16</a>).</p>
<p>God repeated his promise to Abram concerning his descendants and changed the names of Abram (“exalted father”) and Sarai to Abraham (“father of many”) and Sarah (“princess”). A covenant sign of circumcision was given to Abraham (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">17</a>). This operation had already been practiced among the Egyptians for several centuries.</p>
<p class="h4">The Destruction of the Cities of the Plain</p>
<p class="fl">The Lord and two angels appeared to Abraham and announced the birth of the promised heir within a year, as well as proclaimed the impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, concerning which Abraham bargained with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.22-33">18:22-33</a>). Lot and his immediate family were rescued from Sodom, and the cities were destroyed by God with brimstone and fire (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.24-25">19:24-25</a>). Lot’s two daughters, wishing to preserve their family line, got their father drunk and had sexual relations with him. Moab and Ammon, enemies of Israel in later times, were the result.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">Genesis 20:1-18</a>, Abraham again represented Sarah as his sister and got into trouble with Abimelech, king of Gerar.</p>
<p class="h4">Isaac</p>
<p class="fl">When Isaac was born (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.1-3">21:1-3</a>), trouble again broke out between Sarah and Hagar. Hagar was driven out a second time, and once more was befriended by the Lord.</p>
<p>A disagreement arose between Abraham and Abimelech concerning a well, but they made a covenant of peace at Beersheba (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.25-34">21:25-34</a>).</p>
<p>God tested Abraham’s faith by asking him to sacrifice Isaac on Mt Moriah, which probably is the same site David later bought from Araunah the Jebusite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.16-25">2 Sm 24:16-25</a>), the place where the temple was to stand. As Abraham was about to use the knife, God called to him and showed him a ram caught in a thicket. Isaac was freed and the animal was sacrificed in his stead.</p>
<p>Sarah died at Hebron, and Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">23</a>), in a transaction typical of Near Eastern business dealings. To find a wife for Isaac, Abraham sent his servant Eliezer back to the area of Haran, and the Lord directed Eliezer to Rebekah (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-67">24</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.25.1-34">25</a> records the marriage of Abraham to Keturah, who bore him a number of children. Abraham died at the age of 175 years and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his two sons, Isaac and Ishmael.</p>
<p class="h3">The History of Jacob and Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.19-37.1">25:19–37:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Rebekah gave birth to twin sons, Esau and Jacob. When the boys were grown, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a meal of red pottage (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.27-34">25:27-34</a>).</p>
<p>When famine came to the land, Isaac went to Gerar, as his father had done (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-18">20</a>), and repeated his father’s lie by calling his wife his sister (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.1-11">26:1-11</a>). Trouble arose with the Philistines over wells, but Isaac was a peaceable man and preferred digging new wells rather than fighting over old ones (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.26.17-33">17-33</a>).</p>
<p>In Isaac’s old age, when his sight had failed, Rebekah connived with Jacob to trick Isaac into giving to Jacob the blessing of the firstborn, which was rightfully Esau’s. This oral blessing had legal validity and was irrevocable, according to the ancient Nuzi tablets. Fearing for Jacob’s life at the hands of Esau, Rebekah arranged to send Jacob to Haran to find a wife from among her own people. At Bethel, God appeared to Jacob in a dream of a ladder leading up to heaven; God renewed with Jacob the promise made to Abraham and Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.10-22">28:10-22</a>).</p>
<p>Jacob reached Haran, found his uncle Laban, and was employed by him (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-35">29</a>). His wages for seven years of labor were to be Laban’s younger daughter, Rachel, as his wife. But Laban substituted Leah, so that Jacob had to work another seven years for Rachel. The Lord prospered Jacob, but he continually had difficulties with Laban. The Lord directed Jacob back to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.3">31:3</a>), so he left secretly with his wives, children, and property. Laban pursued them because his household gods were missing (possession of these “gods” made the holder heir to the owner’s estate, according to Nuzi custom). Rachel had taken them but successfully concealed them from her father, and Laban went back to Haran.</p>
<p>Fearing a meeting with Esau as they passed through Edom, Jacob sent gifts to his brother and divided his own party into two camps for security. On this return journey, Jacob had an unexpected wrestling bout with the Angel of the Lord, and he was left with a limp and a new name, Israel (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.32.1-32">32</a>).</p>
<p>The meeting with Esau was friendly, and Jacob went on to Shechem (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.33.1-20">33</a>), where his sons killed the male Shechemites because of the rape of their sister Dinah (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.34.1-31">34</a>). God told Jacob to go to Bethel and build an altar to the Lord. All idols of foreign gods were buried (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.1-4">35:1-4</a>). At Bethel, God reaffirmed his promise of a posterity and the land (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.35.9-15">9-15</a>). Rachel died on the way to Bethlehem, while giving birth to Benjamin, Jacob’s 12th and last son. Isaac died at Hebron at age 180 and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by Esau and Jacob.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Gen.36.1-43">Genesis 36</a> records “the generations of Esau” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1">1</a>). Here Esau is also named Edom (“Red”; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">25:30</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The History of Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.2-50.26">37:2–50:26</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Joseph was Jacob’s favorite son and thus incurred the jealousy of his brothers. This was heightened by Joseph’s dreams of lordship over them. Their resentment of Joseph came to a climax when Jacob gave Joseph a beautiful coat. The brothers determined to kill Joseph, but they compromised by selling him to a caravan of merchants, who took him to Egypt and sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an Egyptian captain of the guard (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.36">37:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.39.1">39:1</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Gen.38.1-30">38</a> relates a historic case of levirate marriage. Judah failed to give his widowed daughter-in-law to his third son. She deceived him into fathering twin sons and forced him to acknowledge his faults. The elder son, Perez, is named in Luke’s genealogy of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.33">Lk 3:33</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord blessed Joseph, who soon was put in charge of Potiphar’s household (<a href="?bref=Gen.39.1-23">Gn 39</a>). The young man attracted the attention of Potiphar’s wife, who, after many attempts to seduce him, at last accused him of attempted rape. Sentenced on this charge, Joseph met with favor in prison, where he had opportunity to interpret dreams for two of the pharaoh’s servants (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.40.1-23">40</a>). When the king had dreams that his magicians and wise men could not interpret, Joseph was summoned from jail. Joseph told Pharaoh that the dreams meant seven years of plenty, followed by seven years of famine. Joseph was then exalted to the office of vizier, or prime minister, second only to the king, and put in charge of the administration of the land (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.37-44">41:37-44</a>).</p>
<p>When the famine came to Palestine, Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to purchase grain. Joseph recognized his brothers but did not reveal his identity to them. Joseph put them to the test by accusing them of being spies (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.9">42:9</a>), by keeping one of the brothers (Simeon) hostage (v <a href="?bref=Gen.42.19">19</a>), and by demanding that if they came to Egypt again, they must bring their youngest brother with them (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.20">42:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.3">43:3</a>). The famine became so severe in Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.1">43:1</a>) that Jacob at last allowed Benjamin to go with his brothers to Egypt. The brothers were again set up by Joseph, who had his silver cup put into Benjamin’s grain sack and then had him apprehended as a thief (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.44.1-34">44</a>).</p>
<p>At this point Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.4-15">45:4-15</a>) and there was much rejoicing. Joseph pointed out that it was God who had sent him to Egypt (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.45.7-8">7-8</a>), in order to preserve the lives of all the family. Jacob was then sent for (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.1">46:1</a>), and Joseph met him in the land of Goshen (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.28-29">46:28-29</a>). The Israelites were assigned land in the region of Goshen, where they prospered (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.27">47:27</a>).</p>
<p>In Jacob’s final illness, Joseph brought his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to his father for his blessing. Jacob gave the primary blessing to the second-born, Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.13-20">48:13-20</a>). Jacob blessed each of his own sons and then died at the age of at least 130 years. Joseph arranged for Jacob’s body to be prepared for burial according to Egyptian custom (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.2-3">50:2-3</a>). After the burial of their father in the cave of Machpelah at Hebron, Joseph’s brothers worried about vengeance, but Joseph declared, “As far as I am concerned, God turned into good what you meant for evil. He brought me to the high position I have today so I could save the lives of many people” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.50.20">20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Joseph died at age 110 with the prophetic request that when the Israelites went up from Egypt they would take his bones with them (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.25">50:25</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.13.19">Ex 13:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GENNESARET</p>
<p class="fl">Area on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee between Capernaum and Magdala, where many of Jesus’ healing miracles took place (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.34">Mt 14:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.53">Mk 6:53</a>).</p>
<p>The plain of Gennesaret, as the region was called, curves along a distance of about four miles (6.5 kilometers) with an average width from sea to mountains of approximately one mile (1.6 kilometers). The topography is generally level, with the land rising slowly as it nears the bordering mountains. The unusually fertile soil is laced with flowing streams and rivers and noted for its productivity. Temperatures ranging from hot to mild allow for a long growing season and abundant crops. The fruits of Gennesaret were so exceptional that the rabbis did not allow them in Jerusalem during feast observances, fearing many would attend only to enjoy their succulence. Rabbis termed this area the Garden of God. During Jesus’ lifetime, the area was considered the garden spot of Palestine. Trees such as the walnut, palm, olive, and fig, which require a wide diversity of growing conditions, all flourished here. Rich harvests of grapes, walnuts, rice, wheat, vegetables, and melons, as well as wild trees and flowers, were common. Later, centuries of neglect caused the plain to be largely overgrown with thornbushes, although in more recent years, certain areas have been cleared and productivity restored.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Luke.5.1">Luke 5:1</a>, the Sea of Galilee is referred to as the Lake of Gennesaret. The alternate name undoubtedly derived its origin from the bordering plain.</p>
<p>Gennesaret (more accurately termed Gennesar) was also the later name of the town Chinneroth (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.2">Jos 11:2</a>), an ancient city that had long since fallen into ruin by Jesus’ day.</p>

Its adjectival and adverbial forms (“gentle,” “gently”) can mean courteous and unpretentious (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.4">Prv 15:4</a>), quiet and tender (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.2">Dt 32:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.6">Is 8:6</a>), or unharsh (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.5">2 Sm 18:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.15.11">Jb 15:11</a>).</p>

  <title>Gerar</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GERAR</p>
<p class="fl">City located in the western Negev. It was used as a geographical landmark defining the western boundary of the Canaanite territory from Sidon to Gaza (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.19">Gn 10:19</a>). Abraham resided temporarily in this city, at which time he deceived Abimelech the king by giving him the impression that Sarah was his sister (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.1-2">20:1-2</a>). Later, Isaac settled in this city and also disguised his marriage to Rebekah for fear of reprisals from the men of the city. Isaac eventually left the town, moving to the nearby valley of Gerar on account of his conflicts with the Philistines. Here the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s servants over a newly dug well, and Abimelech, king of the Philistines, made a covenant with Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.1-26">26:1-26</a>). It is doubtful that King Abimelech of Gerar (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.2">20:2</a>) was the same person as Abimelech, king of the Philistines (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.8">26:8</a>). Abimelech was probably a surname or an official title.</p>
<p>During the patriarchal period, Gerar appeared as a dominant Canaanite city in the Negev; however, in Joshua’s recounting of the Conquest, this town was not named among the Philistine cities yet to be conquered (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.2-3">Jos 13:2-3</a>) or in the list of cities already defeated (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.21-22">15:21-22</a>). Later, in the period of the kings, Gerar was mentioned as the southernmost city to which the Ethiopian army fled before it was completely destroyed by King Asa of Judah (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>) and his army (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.13-14">2 Chr 14:13-14</a>). Perhaps the fertile valley of Gedor (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.39">1 Chr 4:39</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.26.17">Gn 26:17</a>), formerly inhabited by the sons of Ham (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.10.19">Gn 10:19</a>), was identical with the valley of Gerar. Gedor was possibly a later scribal error where the copyist confused the Hebrew letter <span class="ital">r</span> for a <span class="ital">d.</span></p>
<p>The site of Gerar is identifiable with Tell Abu Hureireh along the northwestern bank of the Wadi esh-Sheri’ah, 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) northwest of Beersheba and 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) southeast of Gaza.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">GERASA*, GERASENES</p>
<p class="fl">City and district in the Decapolis. Gerasa was a well-known Roman city situated in the hills of the Transjordan about 35 miles (56 kilometers) southeast of the Sea of Galilee and 19 miles (31 kilometers) east of the Jordan River. It was originally established as a Greek city by Alexander the Great around 333 <span class="era">BC</span>. In 85 <span class="era">BC</span> the Jewish monarch Alexander Janneus conquered the city. Gerasa remained in Jewish hands until Pompey brought it under Roman control in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, at which time it was incorporated into the province of Syria and later included in the Decapolis. The site of Gerasa is identical with the modern Jerash.</p>
<p>Although the city is not named in the NT, <a href="?bref=Mark.5.1">Mark 5:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.8.26-37">Luke 8:26-37</a> mention the “country of the Gerasenes” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) as the place where Jesus healed the demoniac and the swine drowned in the Sea of Galilee. The parallel account in <a href="?bref=Matt.8.28">Matthew 8:28</a> reads the “country of the Gadarenes” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The reading of “Gerasenes” in Mark and Luke is found in the better manuscripts of the NT over the later scribal alterations of “Gadarenes” and “Gergesenes.” Gadara was an important city of the Decapolis whose political jurisdiction extended to the eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee. It was added perhaps by later copyists to harmonize Mark’s and Luke’s accounts with Matthew’s Gospel. Gergesa was a city along the eastern coastline of the Sea of Galilee and the name was probably inserted in the texts of Mark and Luke to make better geographical sense of Jesus’ miracle. Nonetheless, “the district of the Gerasenes” has the best textual support and should be understood as the intended site of Mark and Luke for Jesus’ exorcism and miracle. To the non-Palestinian Roman and Greek readers of Mark and Luke’s Gospels, the small regional district of Gadara would be unknown; however, the affluent Roman city of Gerasa would be widely known and suitable as a geographical designation for Jesus’ miracle at the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p class="fl">Mountain (modern Jebel et-Tor) from which the blessings were to be pronounced, just as the cursings were to come from Mt Ebal (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.29">Dt 11:29</a>). The two mountains designated by God were opposite each other, and the setting was a memorable one with six tribes positioned on Mt Gerizim and six on Mt Ebal, the Levites standing in the valley between—reciting the blessings and the cursings (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.11-28.68">Dt 27:11–28:68</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.33-35">Jos 8:33-35</a>). The mountain is near Shechem, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) southeast of the city of Samaria, and it is referred to by the woman of Samaria in <a href="?bref=John.4.20-23">John 4:20-23</a> as the mountain where “our fathers worshiped.” Abraham, indeed, had built an altar in this area (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.6-7">Gn 12:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.33.18-20">33:18-20</a>), and it had been the revered site for Samaritan worship for centuries. Jesus responds to the woman by pointing out that the physical locality of worship (whether Gerizim or Jerusalem) is not important—the spirtual reality is. One must worship in spirit and in truth.</p>

<p>It was in this area that the bones of Joseph were buried (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>) and that Joshua called upon the people to renew their allegiance to the God of their fathers (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.24.25-27">25-27</a>). Josephus records in his <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> (11.8.2-4) Sanballat’s promise to Manasseh to preserve for him the honor of the priesthood and also to build a temple on Mt Gerizim like that at Jerusalem. It was apparently destroyed later by the Maccabean forces under Hyrcanus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.9.1).

Some passages indicate that they were at times dominant among the functioning Levitical groups (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.11">Gn 46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.16">Ex 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.17">Nm 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.57">26:57</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.1,16">1 Chr 6:1, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.6">23:6</a>).</p>
<p>According to the book of Numbers, the Gershonites were encamped behind the tabernacle to the west during the wilderness wanderings (<a href="?bref=Num.3.23">Nm 3:23</a>). Early in the second year after the exodus from Egypt, the Gershonite males numbered about 7,500 (v <a href="?bref=Num.3.22">22</a>). Only those between the ages of 30 and 50 could serve in the tabernacle, which at the time of that early census totaled 2,630 men (<a href="?bref=Num.4.39-40">4:39-40</a>). They were responsible for the care and transportation of the external furnishings of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.3.25-26">3:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.24,27-28">4:24, 27-28</a>) and were given two wagons and four oxen for the purpose, being supervised by Aaron and his sons (<a href="?bref=Num.4.27">4:27</a>).</p>
<p>After the initial settlement of Canaan, the Gershonites were allotted 13 cities among the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh in the northern part of Palestine (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.6">Jos 21:6</a>).</p>
<p>During the time of King David, they were listed among the Levites appointed to service in the temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.6-11">1 Chr 23:6-11</a>). The Gershonite families of Ladan and Jehieli were in charge of the treasury of the house of God (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.20-22">26:20-22</a>). At David’s request, music in the temple was directed in part by Asaph and his family, who were Gershonites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1-2">25:1-2</a>). In the reign of King Hezekiah the Gershonites are mentioned among the Levites who cleansed the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1-6,12">2 Chr 29:1-6, 12</a>). In the postexilic period the descendants of Asaph celebrated the laying of the temple foundation (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.10">Ezr 3:10</a>) and the dedication of the city walls (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.31-36">Neh 12:31-36</a>) with music.</p>

Most Bible geographers place it near Bashan, on the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee. In their conquest of the land, the Israelites defeated Og, king of Bashan, and Jair of Manasseh took Bashan as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.14">Dt 3:14</a>). Though the land of the Geshurites was given to the Transjordanian tribes (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.11">Jos 13:11</a>), Israel did not drive them out (v <a href="?bref=Josh.13.13">13</a>).

<p class="fl">Place to which Jesus and his disciples walked after their Last Supper together in the upper room. In Gethsemane, Jesus underwent a great inner struggle, as he realized the hour of his betrayal was at hand (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.36-56">Mt 26:36-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32-50">Mk 14:32-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.39-53">Lk 22:39-53</a>).</p>
<p>The name Gethsemane, used only in the Gospels of Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.36">26:36</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.32">14:32</a>), means “oil press,” suggesting the presence of an olive grove. The use of the Greek word “place” in the Gospel accounts indicates that Gethsemane was an enclosed piece of ground. It may be that the grove was privately owned and that Jesus and his disciples had special permission to enter.</p>
<p>Though the Gospels of Luke and John do not mention the word Gethsemane, they both record Jesus’ agony before his betrayal. Luke says the location was on the “Mount of Olives” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.39">Lk 22:39</a>). John describes the area as “across the Kidron Valley” (<a href="?bref=John.18.1">Jn 18:1</a>); John’s is the only Gospel to call the spot a garden. From those accounts it is also evident that Jesus and his disciples gathered in Gethsemane often for fellowship and prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.39">Lk 22:39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.2">Jn 18:2</a>).

  <body>
<p class="h1">GEZER</p>
<p class="fl">Modern Tell Jezer (also known as Tell Abu Shusha), and an important ancient city in a strategic position in the north Shephelah hills. The city of the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span> was protected by a brick wall, which was replaced by a 13-foot- (4-meter-) thick stone wall. The Canaanite city reached its zenith during the 20th to 14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. The so-called outer wall was 14 feet (4.3 meters) thick and enclosed an area of 27 acres. There was a Canaanite high place (c. 1600 <span class="era">BC</span>) with 10 pillars or standing stones (up to 10 feet, or 3 meters, high) and a stone altar or basin. A 216-foot (65.8-meter) tunnel with steps led down to a spring in a cave, so that there was safe and ready access to water in time of siege, as at Gibeon and other Palestinian sites. Objects found indicate cultural and commercial contacts with Egypt. The Gezer Calendar, a stone tablet with a Hebrew inscription that gives the months of the year in terms of agricultural activities, has been dated to the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Horam, the king of Gezer, was defeated by the Israelites under Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.33">Jos 10:33</a>). Gezer was a Levitical city in the tribal territory of Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.3">16:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.21">21:21</a>), but Ephraim was unable to drive out the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.29">Jgs 1:29</a>). Merneptah (c. 1225–1215 <span class="era">BC</span>) of Egyptian dynasty 19 lists Gezer, along with Ashkelon and Yanoam, on the Israel Stele, which gives an account of his conquests.</p>
<p>During the reign of David, the Philistines invaded the plain of Rephaim, but the Lord instructed David in a successful ambush and David struck down the Philistines “from Geba to Gezer” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.25">2 Sm 5:25</a>).</p>
<p>After Solomon’s marriage to the daughter of the king of Egypt, the pharaoh, whose identity is uncertain, captured and burned Gezer and gave it as a dowry to his daughter (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.16">1 Kgs 9:16</a>). Solomon rebuilt Gezer, along with a number of other cities that served as store-cities or chariot-cities (cf. vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15-19">15-19</a>). He fortified Gezer and made a strong gate with four sets of piers, like those at Hazor and Megiddo.</p>
<p>In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, Shishak (Sheshonk), king of Egypt, invaded Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">1 Kgs 14:25</a>). Gezer is included in the list of captured cities inscribed on the wall of the temple of Karnak.</p>
<p>The capture of Gezer by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) was shown in reliefs on the walls of his palace at Nimrud (biblical Calah). The Assyrians brought to Gezer conquered people from other areas, as they did at Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24">2 Kgs 17:24</a>). Cuneiform tablets of contracts testify to their presence.</p>

  <title>Giants</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GIANTS</p>
<p class="fl">English translation of four different Hebrew words. One of these words occurs in <a href="?bref=Job.16.14">Job 16:14</a>, where the Hebrew word is translated “warrior” in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>, and “giant” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. Another Hebrew word is translated “giants” in the <span class="sc">nlt</span> and “Nephilim” (a transliteration of the Hebrew) in the <span class="sc">rsv</span> (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.4">Gn 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Nm 13:33</a>). The original meaning of this Hebrew term is unknown, but it seems to be used of a group or race of people. Since none of the terms translated “giants” has that actual meaning, we cannot be sure that the Nephilim were of unusual physical stature.</p>
<p>In several passages the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates “giants” and the <span class="sc">rsv</span> translates “Rephaim” (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">Dt 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.4">Jos 12:4</a>). That word, usually in plural form, refers to several tribes of people who inhabited Palestine and who may have been unusually large in physical size. They included the Anakim of Judah’s coastal area and hill country around Hebron (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.11">Dt 2:11</a>), the Emim of Moab (v <a href="?bref=Deut.2.10">10</a>), the Zamzummim of Ammon (v <a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">20</a>), and the inhabitants of Bashan (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">3:11</a>). The word also appears in Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.4">Jos 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.12">13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.15.8">15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.15">17:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>). Some interpreters have suggested that these people were the original inhabitants of Palestine who were distinct tribes of tall people and who were eventually conquered and absorbed by the Canaanites, Philistines, Hebrews, and other invading peoples. Other interpreters contend that they were not distinct racial tribes but were individuals of great stature, perhaps the result of disease, who were found among the various races and tribes of Palestine. Neither contention can be established with certainty. Another Hebrew term is translated “giant” in both the <span class="sc">kjv</span> and <span class="sc">nlt</span> (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.16-22">2 Sm 21:16-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.20.4-8">1 Chr 20:4-8</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous giant in biblical literature is Goliath of Gath, the Philistine soldier who challenged King Saul’s army at the valley of Elah and caused them to be dismayed and afraid (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.1-58">1 Sm 17</a>). He is said to have been six cubits and a span tall, which has been variously interpreted as being between seven and a half and nine and a half feet (2.3 to 2.9 meters). David’s defeat of Goliath brought the youth prominence in Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.5-7">18:5-7</a>). Goliath is not referred to in the text as a “giant,” but his height marks him as one of gigantic size. King Og of Bashan was another unusually tall person (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.11">Dt 3:11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GIBEAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Town in the hill country of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.57">Jos 15:57</a>). Its exact location is uncertain. Gibeah is listed as being among other towns located in the section of Judah southeast of Hebron and probably was in the fertile plateau containing Maon, Ziph, and Carmel.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in the province of Benjamin, also called “Gibeah of Saul” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.4">1 Sm 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.34">15:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.29">Is 10:29</a>), and its inhabitants are called Gibeathites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.3">1 Chr 12:3</a>). It is first mentioned in the description of the territory assigned to Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.28">Jos 18:28</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Gibeath”) and comes to prominence in the biblical narrative as a result of the atrocity recounted in <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-21.25">Judges 19–21</a> of the Levite and his concubine.</p>
<p class="list-text">Gibeah was also noted as the home of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.26">1 Sm 10:26</a>). After his anointing as king of Israel, Saul returned to Gibeah, which probably remained his home and his capital (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.26">10:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.6">22:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.23.19">23:19</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The site of ancient Gibeah has been generally identified as the modern Tell el-Ful. The OT references place Gibeah north of Jerusalem, between Jerusalem and Ramah, and situated near the primary south-north road through the hill country (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.11-19">Jgs 19:11-19</a>). Tell el-Ful is about three and a half miles (5.6 kilometers) north of Jerusalem and is situated on one of the highest areas in that mountain range. Excavations reveal that an early Israelite village was there about the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span> and was destroyed by fire. Probably during the 11th century a stone fortress was built, and its corner tower is still evident. It probably was the citadel of Saul and his royal residence. A second fortress was built about 1000 <span class="era">BC</span> but fell into disuse when David established the Israelite capital at Jerusalem. It then served as an outpost for the capital city. The tower was alternately destroyed and rebuilt through the centuries until its final destruction in the war between Antiochus III and Ptolemy V. Josephus wrote that a village existed at the site of Gibeah during the Roman period, but it finally ceased to exist with the Roman destruction of Jerusalem (<span class="era">AD</span> 70).</p>
<p class="list">3. Town in the hills of Ephraim that was given to Phinehas, son of Eleazar. It was the burial site of Eleazar (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.33">Jos 24:33</a>). An addition to the Septuagint indicates that Phinehas was also buried here. Its exact location is unknown, and several sites have been suggested: Nibi Saleh, about six miles (9.7 kilometers) northwest of Jifna; Jibia, four miles (6.5 kilometers) northwest of Jifna; et-Tell, northeast of Jifna and south of Sinjil; and Awertah, near Shechem.</p>
<p class="list">4. Gibeath-elohim (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “hill of God”; <span class="sc">nlt</span> “Gibeah of God”). At this site Samuel, following Saul’s anointing as king, predicted that Saul would meet a company of prophets and would prophesy with them. This was to be a sign of God’s selection of Saul as Israel’s king. Some have suggested that this is the same place as Gibeah of Benjamin, the home of Saul, but the context suggests that Saul reached this place before he arrived at his home.</p>
<p class="list">5. Hill near Kiriath-jearim, where the ark of the covenant was housed by Abinadab after its return from the Philistines and until it was moved by David to the house of Obed-edom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-4">2 Sm 6:1-4</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GIBEON, GIBEONITES</p>
<p class="fl">Place and its inhabitants figuring prominently in the OT from the days of Joshua to the days of Nehemiah, though both were in existence outside these time limits. The site may be identified with confidence as el-Jib some five and a half miles (8.9 kilometers) north of Jerusalem. This identification was proposed as early as 1838 by Edward Robinson. Since the excavation of this site in the years 1956, 1957, 1959, 1960, and 1962, and the discovery of 31 jar handles bearing the name of Gibeon, the identification is placed beyond doubt. Certain geographical and chronological considerations also support this. The location of Gibeon, north of Jerusalem and accessible to that city in the days of David, Solomon, and Jeremiah, as well as its location southwest of Ai combine geographically to support this identification. Further, the periods of occupation at el-Jib revealed by excavation are parallel to historical data supplied by the OT.</p>
<p>The first mention of Gibeon and its inhabitants comes in <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">Joshua 9</a> and <a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-43">10</a> in the days of Joshua, perhaps about 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>. Hearing of the success of the people of Israel at Jericho and Ai, the people of Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim plotted to obtain a covenant of peace from them. By pretending that they had come from afar and displaying worn-out clothing and footwear as well as dried bread, they were able to deceive Joshua into making a treaty with them. When their deception was discovered, they were sentenced to chop wood and carry water for the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.21-27">Jos 9:21-27</a>). Neighboring groups of people from Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, led by Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem, launched an attack on Gibeon because of its defection to Joshua. The Gibeonites appealed to Joshua, and the Israelites made a forced march from Gilgal to assist them. The enemies of Gibeon were driven down the road to Beth-horon. Their rout was completed with the assistance of hailstones. In that day the sun stood still over Gibeon (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.9-13">10:9-13</a>). Only Gibeon made peace with the incoming Israelites (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.19">11:19</a>). In due course the town became part of Benjamin’s territory (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.25">18:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.17">21:17</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheBattleforGibeon"/>
<p>In the days before David was king, Saul’s general encountered some of David’s men at Gibeon and engaged in an unusual contest at the pool of Gibeon. Twelve men from each side fought and were all thrust through by the swords of their opponents (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.12-17">2 Sm 2:12-17</a>). This encounter was followed by a further skirmish in which David’s men were successful (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.18-32">18-32</a>). Later, David’s nephew Amasa, captain of the rebel army of Absalom, was attacked by Joab at the “great stone which is in Gibeon” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.8">20:8</a>) and left to die in the highway in his blood. In David’s time also, seven sons of Saul were executed “at Gibeon on the mountain of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-9">21:1-9</a>) in retribution for Saul’s violation of the ancient covenant between Gibeon and Israel when he slew men of Gibeon (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-6">1-6</a>).</p>
<p>There was an important high place still operating at Gibeon in David’s time. The tabernacle of the Lord rested there, and an altar of burnt offering as well (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.39">1 Chr 16:39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.29">21:29</a>). It was at Gibeon, according to <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.3-9">1 Kings 3:3-9</a>, that Solomon had a dream in which Solomon asked for wisdom to govern Israel well (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.1.2-13">2 Chr 1:2-13</a>). A second time God appeared to Solomon at Gibeon to assure him that his prayer had been heard and to urge him to walk in God’s ways (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.2-9">1 Kgs 9:2-9</a>). Gibeon was among the cities taken by Pharaoh Shishak in the second half of the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Presumably Gibeon remained an important center during the days of the kings. There was a prophet in Gibeon in the days of Jeremiah, although he prophesied falsely (<a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-4">Jer 28:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>Some of the Gibeonites went into exile in Babylon and a small group returned (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.25">Neh 7:25</a>) and assisted Nehemiah in repairing the Jerusalem wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.7-8">3:7-8</a>). Later still, Josephus relates that Cestius pitched his camp at Gibeon on his march to Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 66 (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.515-516). Biblical references cover a period from about 1200 <span class="era">BC</span> to about 445 <span class="era">BC</span>, in archaeological terms from the beginning of the Iron I period, through the Iron II period, and into the Persian or Iron III period. We would expect, therefore, to find evidence for at least these periods in an excavation.</p>

  <title>Gideon</title>

<p class="h1">GIDEON</p>
<p class="fl">Judge of Israel, son of Joash, of the clan of Abiezer and the tribe of Manasseh. Of the 12 judges of Israel, more verses are devoted to Gideon than any other—Samson running a close second. The narrative in which he is the central character antedates the Christian era by roughly 11 centuries.</p>
<p>Following seven years of cruel oppression by the Midianites, Israel cried out to the Lord for relief (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.6">Jgs 6:6</a>). An unknown prophet informs the Israelites that their miserable conditions stem from their forgetting to give exclusive devotion to the one true God. God sends his angel to Gideon. A touch of humor earmarks the angel’s greeting, for the “mighty warrior” (v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.12">12</a>) is threshing wheat secretly for fear of the Midianites. Yet God addresses Gideon in realization of what his mighty power is able to accomplish in him (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.6.14-16,34">14-16, 34</a>). Conscious of his own weakness and the formidable task before him, Gideon is an ideal vehicle for God’s tremendous work of deliverance (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.27">1 Cor 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.10">2 Cor 12:10</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="GideonsBattle"/>
<p>Gideon’s first task is to tear down his father’s altar to Baal and the adjacent one to Asherah, Baal’s female consort (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.42.8">Is 42:8</a>). Knowing that the people would resist such an act, Gideon and his servants destroy these images of debased Canaanite religion at night. The following day the men of Ophrah confront Gideon and seek his life in retaliation for the act. Joash pleads the cause of his son, inviting Baal, if he indeed is deity, to contend for himself. Out of this confrontation the name Jerubbaal (“let Baal contend”) is ascribed to Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.32">Jgs 6:32</a>).</p>
<p>Yet Gideon is a man of inconstant faith, and his desire of further assurance is not rebuked as God graciously and patiently accedes to his requests concerning the dew and the fleece (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.36-40">Jgs 6:36-40</a>). Subsequently Gideon is informed that mere numbers will not assure victory. Moreover, there must be no doubt whatever as to the true source of Israel’s liberation (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.2">7:2</a>). From 32,000, Gideon’s troops are trimmed down to only 300 by an unusual method of reduction (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.7.3-7">3-7</a>). A secret reconnaissance mission to the outskirts of the oppositions’ camp enables Gideon to receive further strengthening as he and his servant Purah overhear a Midianite soldier reveal his dream indicating Israel’s imminent victory (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.7.13-14">13-14</a>). In response to this additional encouragement, he worships the Lord (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.15">Jgs 7:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.6.24">6:24</a>).</p>
<p>Divided into three companies, Gideon’s army stations itself at night outside the Midianite stronghold. At Gideon’s signal each man blows a trumpet (made from an animal’s horn) and smashes an empty jar containing a torch, shouting, “A sword for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> and for Gideon!” (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.20">Jgs 7:20</a>). The effect of the clamor is overwhelming. Thinking themselves outnumbered, the confused and disheartened Midianites flee eastward across the Jordan. In hot pursuit, Gideon’s men are joined by Israelites from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, who follow the enemy into the Transjordan area. The men of Ephraim, whose efforts are now called upon for the first time, capture and kill two of the Midianite leaders. Angry with Gideon for failing to enlist their services earlier, the Ephraimites are nonetheless appeased by Gideon’s tactful response to their queries (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.1-3">8:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>Gideon’s unselfishness shines in response to the people’s desire to make him king, but he declines (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.22-23">Jgs 8:22-23</a>). He does, however, receive an immense personal fortune from the spoils of war (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.8.24-26">24-26</a>). The unfortunate conclusion of Gideon’s story relates to his making an ephod from the gold won in battle. Perhaps a garment patterned after the high priest’s or a freestanding image, the object ensnares the people, and they worship it at Ophrah (v <a href="?bref=Judg.8.27">27</a>). In <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.21">2 Samuel 11:21</a> Gideon’s alternate name, Jerubbaal, becomes Jerubbesheth, “Baal” being replaced with the Hebrew word for “shame” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">besheth</span><span class="ital">).</span></p>
<p>Gideon has been singled out in the Letter to the Hebrews as a hero of the faith whose trust in God brought glory to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.32">Heb 11:32</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Gedeon”). As far back as the time of Isaiah, “the day of Midian” had become proverbial for deliverance accomplished by the hand of God apart from human strength (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.4">Is 9:4</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Site in Jerusalem where Solomon was anointed as king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.33,38,45">1 Kgs 1:33, 38, 45</a>). There are two sources of running water in Jerusalem: The first is the Ain Umm el Daraj’ (also known as the spring of the Mother of Steps, in the OT as Gihon, and to Christians as the Virgin’s Fountain), which lies at the eastern ridge. The second is Bir ’Ayub, or the well of Job. The importance of the spring of Gihon for the defense of Jerusalem in time of siege is emphasized by Hezekiah’s measures to deny his enemies access to the water supply and provide access for those who defended the city (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kgs 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.30">2 Chr 32:30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.4">2 Kgs 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.3-4">2 Chr 32:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Is 7:3</a>). Hezekiah’s tunnel brought the waters from the spring of Gihon in the Kidron Valley (eastern) into the central valley where the present-day pool of Siloam is located. The spring was unable to supply all of Jerusalem’s needs after the exile, and in the Roman period aqueducts were built to bring additional water.</p>

<p>Many battles were fought in the area, including Deborah’s defeat of Sisera. At that time the flooding of the Kishon, which rose in Gilboa, greatly helped in the victory (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.21">Jgs 5:21</a>).

<p class="list">1. Region east of the Jordan River.

Specifically, Gilead is the area of the Transjordan lying between the Yarmuk and Arnon Rivers and divided by the Jabbok River.</p>
<p class="list-text">The so-called Dome of Gilead is an extension of the central hill country of Judah, rising to heights of more than 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) above the Jordan Valley. The valleys and hills were well watered by numerous rivers and tributaries, making flatter portions of the countryside well suited for agriculture, especially olive trees, grapevines, and grains (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.11">46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.8">Hos 2:8</a>). The densely forested and rugged hills were sometimes compared to those of Lebanon (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.6">Jer 22:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.10">Zec 10:10</a>) and made the land a refuge for those in flight, since the terrain prohibited ready pursuit by enemies (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.31.21">Gn 31:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.7">1 Sm 13:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Originally the region of Gilead was allotted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>). The period of the judges saw Israelite security there assailed by the Midianites and Amalekites, only to be checked by the military exploits of Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-7.25">Jgs 6–7</a>). Half a century later, Jephthah was recalled from his banishment to rescue Gilead from oppressive Ammonite rule (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.10.1-11.40">10–11</a>). During the united monarchy, Saul delivered Jabesh-gilead from Ammonite dominance (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-11">1 Sm 11:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.8-13">31:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-7">2 Sm 2:1-7</a>). Abner installed Ish-bosheth as a rival to David in Gilead (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-9">2 Sm 2:8-9</a>). David conquered the Ammonites controlling Gilead as he extended the borders of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.11-12">8:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-19">10:1-19</a>). He fled there for refuge in the face of Absalom’s rebellion (chs <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-17.29">15–17</a>) and was finally restored to the throne when Absalom was slain in the forest of Ephraim (chs <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-19.43">18–19</a>). Gilead remained a battleground during the divided monarchy, as first the Israelites warred with the Syrians (Arameans; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.23-43">1 Kgs 20:23-43</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-4,29-40">22:1-4, 29-40</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.22">2 Kgs 13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.3">Am 1:3</a>) and then with the Assyrians, who wrested the territory from Pekah in 733 <span class="era">BC</span> and deported the Israelite population, thus severing Gilead’s tie to the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.27-31">2 Kgs 15:27-31</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GILGAL</p>
<p class="list">1. Town near Jericho. Gilgal was assigned to Benjamin’s tribe when Canaan was divided among the tribes of Israel. For many years it was a center of religious, political, and military importance, especially during the periods of the conquest of Canaan and the early monarchy under Saul.</p>
<p class="list-text">Gilgal was the first place where Israel encamped in Palestine after the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Josh.4.19">Jos 4:19</a>). No doubt the tabernacle was set up here, since Israel occupied Gilgal for some time and used it as the center of the commonwealth. Several significant religious events occurred at Gilgal: the circumcision of all Hebrew males born in the wilderness during the 40 years of wandering (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.2-9">5:2-9</a>), the celebration of the Passover (v <a href="?bref=Josh.5.10">10</a>), the cessation of the manna (v <a href="?bref=Josh.5.12">12</a>), and a divine manifestation to Joshua by the “commander of the army of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.5.13-15">13-15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Militarily, Gilgal was Israel’s first foothold in Canaan and the base of operations for the Conquest. From here Joshua led Israel to the conquest of Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-27">Jos 6</a>) and Ai (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.3">8:3</a>), formed a treaty with the Gibeonites (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.3-15">9:3-15</a>), attacked the five Amorite kings (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.6-43">10:6-43</a>), and launched his northern campaign (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-23">11</a>). At Gilgal, Judah, Manasseh, and Ephraim were assigned their portions of Palestine (chs <a href="?bref=Josh.15.1-17.18">15–17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After the relocation of the tabernacle at Shiloh, Gilgal retained its importance to Israel. It was one of the towns visited regularly by Samuel in his annual circuit as judge (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.16">1 Sm 7:16</a>) and was one of the primary places for offering sacrifices (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.8">10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.9-10">13:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.21">15:21</a>). At Gilgal, Saul, a Benjamite, was crowned king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.14-15">11:14-15</a>), and later rejected (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.4-15">13:4-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.17-31">15:17-31</a>). Here the men of Judah met David returning to Palestine after Absalom’s rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.15">2 Sm 19:15</a>). That Gilgal was still a religious center of some importance as late as the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> is indicated in the denunciation by Hosea and Amos of the sanctuary and sacrificial cult located there (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.15">Hos 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.11">12:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.4">Am 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.5">5:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The exact location of Gilgal is disputed among archaeologists. Some locate it at Khirbet en-Nitleh about two miles (3.2 kilometers) east of modern Jericho. Others prefer Khirbet Mefjir, a mound about one mile (1.6 kilometers) from ancient Jericho (Tell es-Sultan). <a href="?bref=Josh.4.19">Joshua 4:19</a> places it on the eastern border of Jericho, and Josephus gives the distance from the Jordan fording place to Gilgal as 50 stadia (5.8 miles, or 9.3 kilometers), with Gilgal being about 10 stadia from Jericho (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 5.6.4). These distances fit best with Khirbet Mefjir.</p>
<p class="list">2. Place perhaps near Jericho (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.30">Dt 11:30</a>); however, the language of the passage implies that it is located in the neighborhood of Mt Ebal and Mt Gerizim.</p>
<p class="list">3. KJV rendering of “Goiim in Galilee” in <a href="?bref=Josh.12.23">Joshua 12:23</a>. Although its location is uncertain, the context places it in northern Palestine in the area of Galilee. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Goiim_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Goiim #2</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. Place describing the northern border of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.7">Jos 15:7</a>). It was near Adummim and was perhaps identifiable with Geliloth in <a href="?bref=Josh.18.17">Joshua 18:17</a>.</p>
<p class="list">5. Place mentioned in connection with Elijah and Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1">2 Kgs 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.38">4:38</a>). It was apparently a town farther from the Jordan River than #1 above. In the story of Elijah’s translation into heaven, he and Elisha were going from Gilgal to Bethel to Jericho. Since the account places Bethel between Gilgal and Jericho, it could not have been the first Gilgal. It may refer to the modern Jiljiliah, a town on top of a hill in central Palestine, about seven miles (11.3 kilometers) north of Bethel.</p>

  <title>Gilgamesh Epic*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GILGAMESH EPIC*</p>
<p class="fl">Popular legendary composition about a Sumerian hero’s life of adventure and acquisition of wisdom. Gilgamesh was king of Uruk, or Erech (Tell Obeid; modern Warka), at the end of the fourth millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. The legend, which emerged from the first Babylonian dynasty (about 1830–1530 <span class="era">BC</span>), was discovered in the palace library of Ashurbanipal (669–627 <span class="era">BC</span>) at Nineveh.</p>
<p>Written on 12 tablets, the Gilgamesh Epic tells how a strong ruler, Gilgamesh, became friends with Enkidu, a hunter the gods had created to overthrow him. Together the two killed the monster Huwawa. Ishtar, the goddess of love, made advances to Gilgamesh. In resisting her, he killed the sacred heavenly bull. Enkidu died as a punishment for that crime. Gilgamesh, overcome by grief, traveled the world seeking the source of immortality, finally arriving at the homeland of Utnapishtim. In Tablet XI Utnapishtim describes a devastating flood that drowned a large area of Mesopotamia. Through his piety Utnapishtim was saved and given immortality by the gods. The final tablet contains an expression of sadness over Gilgamesh’s mortality.</p>
<p>Biblical scholars have compared the epic’s flood narrative with the one in the book of Genesis. Both accounts concern a flood, a person or persons to be delivered, the sending out of birds, and a sacrifice made by the hero. There are, however, several differences. The biblical account gives a moral reason for the Flood; the Gilgamesh Epic has a more frivolous one: the gods were irritated by human noise. The types of birds, names of heroes, dimensions of the ark, and duration of the flood all differ. The Genesis account clearly does not depend on the epic. Both may go back to a common tradition. It is also possible that the two accounts are independent descriptions of the same devastating flood.</p>

  <title>Glorification</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GLORIFICATION</p>
<p class="fl">The expression of God’s glory and splendor. The Hebrew word for “glory” originally meant “weighty, heavy, or important.” From there it moved to the idea of an influential, rich, or prominent person. In ancient cultures the wealthy and the powerful were marked by the finery of their dress and jewels. Hence, a person’s glory meant the ostentatious signs of wealth and power. Glory also suggested beauty, since fine clothes and jewels were items of beauty. The concept was then extended to God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GloryofGod">Glory of God</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT the glory of God means something obvious about God. The book of Exodus is rich with references to God’s glory. There was the fiery pillar and the glory that entered into the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">40:34-38</a>).</p>
<p>In the making of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.1-27.21">Ex 25–27</a>), the concepts of glory and beauty are joined. There is evidence that the “goodness” of the Lord that Moses saw (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.19">Ex 33:19</a>) could also be translated as “beauty.” Hence, God’s glory is his beauty.</p>
<p>The NT continues the thought of the OT that God is a God of glory (cf. the vision of God in his glory in <a href="?bref=Rev.4.1-11">Rv 4</a>). But the primary message in the NT centers on the glory of Christ. The transfiguration of Christ was a breaking out into the open of his glory (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-8">Mt 17:1-8</a>). The apostle Paul called Jesus the Lord of glory (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.8">1 Cor 2:8</a>) and wrote that the glory of God radiated from his face (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>). John’s Gospel is uniquely the Gospel of glory. In the Incarnation, the Son of God showed the glory that was his as the only begotten of the Father (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>). The raising of Lazarus was a manifestation of the glory of God in Christ (<a href="?bref=John.11.40">11:40</a>). Jesus’ prayer in <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">John 17</a> is filled with comments on the glory of Christ, including the affirmation that the disciples of the Lord would share in that glory.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GlorificationoftheBeliever">Glorification of the Believer</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a> spiritual transformation is described as a changing from glory to glory. Glorification is implied as the last event in the change from glory to glory. In the process of salvation Paul lists glorification as the last and final event (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.28-30">Rom 8:28-30</a>). The verb used in verse <a href="?bref=Rom.8.30">30</a> is in the past tense, which some have taken to mean the certainty and finality of glorification. Glorification is the completion, the consummation, the perfection, the full realization of salvation.</p>
<p>Glorification is the perfection of sanctification as it pertains to one’s inner character. No one passage treats this theme extensively, but <a href="?bref=Eph.5.27">Ephesians 5:27</a> may be taken for all. In that passage Paul wrote of presenting the church to Christ, but what he says of the church is true of each Christian. Jesus will present the church to himself in “splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she [the church] might be holy and without blemish.” Or in the language of <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10">2 Timothy 2:10</a>, “Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus with its eternal glory” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Just as the inner person undergoes glorification, so does the believer’s body. Paul calls the resurrection of the body the redemption of the body (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Rom 8:23</a>). In <a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Philippians 3:21</a> Paul speaks of the transformation of bodies of humiliation (i.e., humiliated by sin and mortality) into bodies of glory identical to that of Christ. The power that shall do this is the power of God by which he subjects all things to his reign.</p>
<p>The most extensive treatment on the glorification of the body is found in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">1 Corinthians 15</a>, with some additional details in <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-21">2 Corinthians 5</a>. Paul’s theme in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">1 Corinthians 15</a> is that as Christians have borne the image of the mortal clay of Adam, they shall bear the image of the immortal Son of God. Paul contrasts the two bodies. The present body is perishable; the resurrection body will be imperishable. This body is one of dishonor; the resurrection body will be one of glory. This body is one of weakness; the resurrection body is one of power. This body is of the current physical order; the resurrection body will be of the future, spiritual, eternal order.</p>
<p>Salvation involves justification, regeneration, and sanctification in this life. In the life to come it means the glorification of the inner person and the resurrection of the body in glory. But such a glorified person must live in a glorified environment. Hence, Scripture must logically end the course of salvation with a glorious new heaven, new earth, and a new Jerusalem.</p>

The Scriptures record praise to his glorious name (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.5">Neh 9:5</a>), describe him as the glorious Father (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.17">Eph 1:17</a>) and the King of glory (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.1-10">Ps 24</a>); he is exalted above the heavens, and his glory is over all the earth (<a href="?bref=Ps.57.5,11">Pss 57:5, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.108.5">108:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.113.4">113:4</a>). He is the God of glory who appeared to the patriarchs of the OT (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.2">Acts 7:2</a>). He is jealous to maintain his glory and unwilling that it be given to another (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.8">Is 42:8</a>); he acts to bring glory to himself (<a href="?bref=Ps.79.9">Ps 79:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.11">Is 48:11</a>).</p>
<p>The glory of God is proclaimed by the Creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">Pss 19:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.6">97:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.20">Rom 1:20</a>). It is revealed by his mighty acts of salvation and deliverance (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.24">1 Chr 16:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.72.18-19">Pss 72:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.3">96:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.145.10-12">145:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.4,40">Jn 11:4, 40</a>). His glory is the theme of the praise (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.24-29">1 Chr 16:24-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.1-2,9">Pss 29:1-2, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.66.1-2">66:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.7-8">96:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.1">115:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.12">Is 42:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.20">Rom 4:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">As His Presence</p>
<p class="fl">References to the glory of the Lord are often to particular historical manifestations of his presence; images of light and fire are prominently associated with these occurrences. The foremost example is what is known in rabbinical literature as the shekinah glory, a phrase meaning the “dwelling glory.” It refers primarily to the presence of God in the pillar of cloud and fire in the OT.</p>
<p>The first explicit reference to the glory cloud is found in <a href="?bref=Exod.13.21-22">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. At the time of the exodus, the glory of God appeared in the pillar of cloud and fire to lead the people through the sea and wilderness (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.11-12,19">Neh 9:11-12, 19</a>). At Sinai, with Israel encamped around the mountain, the glory of God comes in the cloud and fire to speak with Moses in the sight of the people (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.9,16-18">Ex 19:9, 16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.15-18">24:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.5,22-24">Dt 5:5, 22-24</a>). When Moses is given a glimpse of that glory unconcealed by the cloud and fire, his own face becomes radiant and must be veiled because of the people’s fear (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.18-23">Ex 33:18-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.29-35">34:29-35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.7-18">2 Cor 3:7-18</a>).</p>
<p>The picture of Israel encamped around the glory of God on Sinai portrays God dwelling in the midst of his people. When the tabernacle is completed and the people set out on their march, the glory cloud of God’s presence dwells above them throughout their journey (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">Ex 40:34-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.11-12">Nm 10:11-12</a>). When they encamp, the tribes encircle the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.1.50-2.2">Nm 1:50–2:2</a>), and the cloud reminds them of his presence in their midst. Later, the same glory filled the new temple that Solomon builds (<a href="?bref=2Chr.5.13-6.1">2 Chr 5:13–6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.1-3">7:1-3</a>). The psalmists celebrated Jerusalem and the temple as the place where his glory dwelt (<a href="?bref=Ps.26.8">Pss 26:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.63.2">63:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.85.9">85:9</a>); God was in their midst.</p>
<p>Later in Israel’s history they denied God’s glorious presence (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.8">Is 3:8</a>) and exchanged the glory of the Lord for idols made by human hands (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.20">Ps 106:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.10-11">Jer 2:10-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.1.23">Rom 1:23</a>). Because of their disobedience, judgment came against Jerusalem; the penalties of covenant violation were enforced. God would no longer be the God of a disobedient people (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.9">Hos 1:9</a>). God’s presence in the glory cloud left the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.10.4,18-19">Ez 10:4, 18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.22">11:22</a>), and Israel went into exile (<a href="?bref=Ezek.12.1-15">12:1-15</a>).</p>
<p>Yet out of this judgment God determined to bring a remnant to rebuild the city and the temple. In his visions Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord return to dwell in the temple again (<a href="?bref=Ezek.43.2-9">Ez 43:2-9</a>), a time when the glory would return to a purified people and dwell among them forever. When the exile was over and the second temple was under construction, Haggai and Zechariah urged the people on with the promise of the return of the glory of God to fill the temple as it had done in the first temple and to “be glory in their midst” (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.3-9">Hg 2:3-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.5,10-11">Zec 2:5, 10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGloryofGodinJesusChrist">The Glory of God in Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="fl">We are not told if the shekinah glory returned to the second temple. But we are told that God’s glory was seen again on earth in the person of Jesus Christ. <a href="?bref=John.1.14">John 1:14</a> says, “The Word became flesh and <span class="ital">dwelt</span> among us, and we beheld his <span class="ital">glory, glory</span> as of the only Son” (italics added). As such, Jesus was the new tabernacle for God’s abiding glory. In Jesus, God dwelt among people. Since Christ was (and is) the very image of God, to see the light of his face was to know the glory of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4-6">2 Cor 4:4-6</a>). To see Jesus was to see a “light to the Gentiles and the glory of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.30-32">Lk 2:30-32</a>). The disciples who witnessed the Transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-8">Mt 17:1-8</a>) saw his glory in a marvelous way (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-17">2 Pt 1:16-17</a>), for it was a glory that burst out of his human body. This outburst of glory prefigured the glorification Christ experienced in resurrection and ascension (see <a href="?bref=John.17.5">Jn 17:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-11">Phil 2:5-11</a>).</p>
<p>Because Jesus humbled himself and was obedient to the point of death, God highly exalted him (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.8-9">Phil 2:8-9</a>). After he suffered death on the cross, he entered into his glory (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.26">Lk 24:26</a>) with a new and glorious body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.39-43">1 Cor 15:39-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Phil 3:21</a>). The glorified Christ appeared to his servants. Stephen saw his glory (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.55">Acts 7:55</a>), and Saul was blinded by his splendor (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.3">9:3</a>). That same Christ is predicted to return in glory. He will sit on his throne in judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31">Mt 25:31</a>); evil will be punished (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">24:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mk 13:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.27">Lk 21:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.9-10">2 Thes 2:9-10</a>). Those who have professed him before men need not fear his glorious appearing (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.38">Mk 8:38</a>).</p>
<p>At the consummation, the whole earth will be filled with his glory (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.19">Ps 72:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Is 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.2.14">Hb 2:14</a>). No longer will a glory cloud rest above a temple to mark the Holy Place, for there will be a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1">Rv 21:1</a>). The Holy City will have the radiance of the glory of God (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.21.10-11">10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="GloryandthePeopleofGod">Glory and the People of God</p>
<p class="fl">The people of God have experienced the glory of the presence of God. The glory cloud of the OT was <span class="ital">their</span> glory (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.20">Ps 106:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.11">Jer 2:11</a>). Christ came as the embodiment of the glory of God; God was in the midst of his people. When Christ ascended, he sent his Spirit to the believers (<a href="?bref=John.16.7-14">Jn 16:7-14</a>) so that God could live in the midst of his people. The Spirit of glory rests on those who suffer for the name of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.14">1 Pt 4:14</a>); that Spirit is the guarantee of the glorious inheritance of the saints (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.16-17">Rom 8:16-17</a>).</p>
<p>God has given to his people the hope of glory (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.2">Rom 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Phil 3:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Col 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.24-25">Jude 1:24-25</a>). Those whom he has chosen he will also glorify (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.30">Rom 8:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.23">9:23</a>); they will share in the glory of Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.3.4">Col 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.14">2 Thes 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.10">2 Tm 2:10</a>). The sufferings of this age do not compare with the glory that will be revealed (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.18">Rom 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.17">2 Cor 4:17</a>). The whole of creation longs to see the glorious freedom of the children of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.21">Rom 8:21</a>). This hope of glory is so certain that Peter can speak of participating in it even now (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1">1 Pt 5:1</a>) while looking forward to that eternal glory (v <a href="?bref=Rom.5.10">10</a>). As partakers in the glory of Christ, the church is called to glorify God. Because of the hope that is in them, they purify themselves (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.3">1 Jn 3:3</a>).</p>

  <title>Gnosticism*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GNOSTICISM*</p>
<p class="fl">Religious thought distinguished by claims to obscure and mystical knowledge, and emphasizing knowledge rather than faith. Until the mid-20th century, Gnosticism was regarded as a Christian heresy that developed through the interweaving of Christian experience and thought with Greek philosophy. More recently, many scholars define the Gnostics more broadly as devotees of a religious view that borrowed ideas from many religious traditions. The meanings of these borrowed terms and practices were shaped into mythological expressions of experiential salvation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GnosticismasaHeresy">Gnosticism as a Heresy</p>
<p class="fl">During the 20th century, many discoveries of Gnostic documents have enabled scholars to define Gnosticism more accurately. Prior to the 20th century, most of the information available concerning the Gnostics came from early Christian writers (heresiologs) who penned treatises against heretics, and in the process described some of their beliefs and practices. These heresiologs, such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Hippolytus, viewed the Gnostics as distorters of Christianity. The Gnostics developed many misinterpretations of the Bible, especially of the creation account and the Gospel of John. Indeed, the Gnostic writers Heracleon and Ptolemais are the first known commentators on the fourth Gospel. The anger of the Christian apologists is well summarized by Irenaeus when he likens the Gnostic interpreter to one who tears apart a beautiful picture of a king and then restructures it into a picture of a fox.</p>
<p>Apparently a number of Gnostics continued as members of local churches and some served in high offices. Indeed, there is speculation that Valentinus may have been considered as a possible candidate for bishop at Rome. Moreover, Marcion, the fabled Christian heretic, reinterpreted Paul in such a way that the OT God became the god of evil and Christ became the messenger of the good God of grace. Many Gnostic heretical tendencies have been associated with Marcion, who developed his own censored canon of the NT and thereby forced the Christians to counter by clarifying their own canon. The early Christian historian Eusebius (d. <span class="era">AD</span> 339), who excerpted some of the early lost works of heresiologs like Hegesippus, also provides insight into the hostility of Christians against various Gnostics like Marcion, Basilides, Tatian, Satornil, Dositheus, and the so-called father of all heresy, Simon the sorcerer.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TypesofGnostics">Types of Gnostics</p>
<p class="list">1. The Iranian type of Gnostic myth that arose in Mesopotamia is an adaption of Zoroastrianism. The myths are constructed with a horizontal dualism in which the opposing powers of good (light) and evil (darkness) are regarded as fairly equal in strength. In the first stage of the myth, a segment of the light is captured by the jealous darkness when the light transcends itself and reaches into the realm occupied by the darkness. The capture of the light has been viewed by some scholars as the Iranian cosmic “fall.” Since the Gnostics themselves are usually identified with the captured light particles, a major task of their myths is to describe the process by which the light particles (encapsulated within the bodies of Gnostics) are released. The body, or “flesh” in the Greek sense, is merely a worthless covering or tomb, while the spirit—the spark in man linked to the divine—is the part that seeks release and return to the heavenly bliss. In the Iranian system the light forces regroup and make a partially successful counterattack on the forces of darkness. Then, primarily through the work of an alien messenger of strength who has gained a foothold in the world, the good forces are able to challenge the work of the evil captors and supply advice (<span class="greek">gnosis</span>) to their devotees. This <span class="greek">gnosis</span> leads to salvation or release.</p>
<p class="list">2. The Syrian type of Gnostic myth, which arose primarily in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, is more complex and involves a vertical dualism. In this system there is only one ultimate being or group of divinities (not two as in the horizontal system). Their dualism is usually explained as the result of a flaw, or error, in the good. The error in good, for example, is frequently attributed to the least member in the good pantheon. The guilty deity is usually designated as Sophia (the Greek term for “wisdom,” which indicates the Gnostic’s low opinion of the Greek philosopher’s quest for wisdom). This Gnostic myth details how, instead of being satisfied with her station in life, Wisdom lusts for the Ultimate Depth. Since this ultimate god cannot tolerate distortion and weakness in the godhead, he must exclude Wisdom’s lust from the heavenly realm. This lust is exiled to a lower heaven, is personalized as the Lower Wisdom (sometimes called the demiurge), and becomes the creator of the world. As lesser deities, the creator and subordinate gods (often called fates) are unable to perceive the upper heavenly realm and falsely consider themselves to be ultimate. The upper godhead deviously maneuvers the Lower Wisdom in creating human beings and giving life to them through the process of passing on the breath of life. Unknowingly, in the act of creation, the Lower Wisdom not only gives life to human beings but also passes on the divine light particles. Thus, with the help of a savior—an alien messenger of knowledge sent by the upper godhead and often designated as Jesus—humanity is enabled to perceive even more than the creator and to conquer the spiritual stupor that has come upon him when his spirit was encased by the creator in an earthly body.</p>
<p class="list-text">As a result of the split within the deity in this system, the biblical Garden of Eden story becomes radically reinterpreted. The creator provides a tree of life (which is a misnomer) and actually offers humanity bondage instead. The lower god also forbids access to the tree of knowledge (<span class="greek">gnosis</span>), which appears in his creation without his authorization, being provided by the upper godhead for the purpose of awakening Gnostics to the state from which they have come.</p>
<p>Because only those people who have light particles are capable of being saved, the process of salvation in most Gnostic myths is deterministic. Moreover, salvation really occurs at the end of the Gnostic’s life when he seeks to escape from the created world. Concurrent with the escape, the Gnostic strips off the created elements of the body from his spirit and climbs through the fates to the heavenly realm.</p>
<p>With respect to both systems of Gnosticism, recent discoveries have clarified our understanding of the myths. New primary sources for the Iranian type of Gnosticism became available during the first half of the 20th century and include the publication of a Manichean psalter (1938) and a Manichean book of homilies (1934). New primary sources for the Syrian type of Gnosticism were made available through the publication of the Berlin manuscript in 1955, but more significantly, our knowledge has recently increased through the discovered codices usually designated as the Nag Hammadi manuscripts.</p>
<p class="h2" id="UnderstandingtheGnosticPurpose">Understanding the Gnostic Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Perhaps one of the greatest problems for the uninitiated readers of Gnosticism is understanding the purpose of the Gnostic myths. The myths often seem so strange that the readers are tempted to scratch their heads and wonder how anyone with any intelligence could believe such wild stories. One must realize, however, that the myth writers were seeking to communicate elements of the unexplained relationships between the human and the divine.</p>
<p>The bondage of evil in the world and its relationship to a good God has stretched the minds of the greatest theologians and philosophers of history. The Gnostics devised their answer to the problem of evil by shifting the blame from this world back to either God himself or to divisions within the divine realm. By compartmentalizing good and evil, it was possible to decide one’s destiny by the alignments one made.</p>
<p>But the role of evil was seen as so strong in this world that the Gnostics, like the Greek philosophers before them, concluded the world was a hopeless context for the victory of the good. Accordingly, they abandoned the world to the evil god and developed a theology that focused on salvation as the process of escape from the world. Their theory also provided a salvation while on earth: Since the Gnostics contained divine light particles, they were in fact immortal, and their spirits, though existing in an evil context, would not ultimately be contaminated. The body and all its lust and lower animal desires would be shed from the spirit as it rose through the realms of the lower godhead to be reunited with the divine spiritual realm after death. Some Gnostics, indeed, carried the idea of noncontamination to ridiculous lengths and devised systems whereby sexual relations with various persons represented divine-human encounters—the more, the better! Others tended to affirm more ascetic tendencies whereby they sought to conform the miserable body to the lifestyle of the incorruptible spirit.</p>
<p>One of the realities the Gnostic interpreters encountered was the fact that not everyone accepted their theories. Accordingly, they devised mythical methods to distinguish between various types of people. Using ideas suggested by Paul in <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.1-16">1 Corinthians 2</a> and <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-39">Romans 8</a>, the Gnostics developed a highly sophisticated categorization of people. The pneumatic, or spiritual (i.e., Gnostic), persons were divine in origin, being from light particles. The sarkic, or fleshly, persons were formed totally from the substances made by the creator and could never inherit the divine realm. The Christians whom they saw as struggling to be obedient to the biblical message, however, were a kind of mixture. They needed desperately to work out their salvation, and if they were obedient as psychic people, they might gain some form of acceptance. This elitism of the Gnostics and their distortion of the Christian message clarifies the hostility of the Christians against the Gnostics.</p>
<p>The myths were the methodological formulations the Gnostics used to express their theological constructs. To understand them the reader needs the key of <span class="greek">gnosis</span><span class="ital">,</span> or knowledge. Interpretation of the myths was in fact an early type of demythologizing, not unlike the process Rudolf Bultmann, an early-twentieth-century theologian and NT scholar, employed in interpreting the Bible. The Gnostic writers were among the brightest minds of their day. Their creativity is to be admired. Their theology, however, is to be rejected as a distortion of the biblical message. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=NagHammadiManuscripts_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Nag Hammadi Manuscripts</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Inherent characteristics of God revealed in Scripture and displayed in God’s actions in biblical history. They are characteristics equally of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God’s attributes are revealed in progressively richer and fuller ways within the history of redemption.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the entire creation shows God’s deity and eternal power (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">Ps 19:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.20">Rom 1:20</a>).

The fullest revelation of God’s attributes is seen in his work of redemption through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>How does Scripture express the characteristics of God?

Some of God’s attributes are revealed implicitly in the biblical accounts of Creation, fall, Flood, Babel, and the exodus, and more fully in the various covenants God made with his people. To Israel, he identified himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.15">Ex 3:15</a>). To the pharaoh, he identified himself as the “God of Israel” or the “God of the Hebrews” (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.1-3">5:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>By the time the people of Israel had reached Mt Sinai, the revelation of God’s attributes in the biblical narrative had become more explicit: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children’s children, to the third and the fourth generation” (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">Ex 34:6-7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This summary is repeated elsewhere with slight variations (<a href="?bref=Num.14.18">Nm 14:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.17">Neh 9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.8">Ps 103:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.18">Jer 32:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.4.2">Jon 4:2</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheAttributesofGod">The Attributes of God</p>
<p class="fl">The historic Christian confessions refer to various characteristics of God without calling them attributes or classifying them. The Westminster Shorter Catechism (1647) shows a tendency toward classification, describing God as “a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and unchangeable in his being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness and truth.” The first four attributes qualify the others.</p>
<p>Several ways of classifying the attributes have been suggested. Generally such schemes divide the divine attributes into pairs: negative and positive, natural and moral, absolute and relative, immanent and eminent, intransitive and transitive, quiescent and operative, antithetical and synthetical, or incommunicable and communicable. Roman Catholics prefer the distinction of negative and positive, or natural and moral. Lutherans generally favor the distinction between quiescent and operative attributes. Reformed and evangelical scholars usually distinguish incommunicable and communicable attributes. Karl Barth grouped the attributes under freedom and love, and then proposed pairs of attributes that reflect freedom-love or love-freedom. In spite of the diversity of labels given the groups of attributes, surprising agreement exists in the attributes listed under each group.</p>
<p>This article will make a distinction between incommunicable and communicable attributes without considering the classification itself as significant. No classification of God’s attributes is fully satisfactory. The <span class="ital">incommunicable</span> attributes emphasize the absolute distinctness of God, his transcendent greatness and exalted nature. Such attributes have little or no analogy in God’s creatures. The <span class="ital">communicable</span> attributes find some reflection or analogy in human beings created in God’s image. They indicate the immanence of God in relation to creatures. Yet all the attributes are God’s attributes; the distinction between God and man, between Creator and creature, is always basic.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IncommunicableAttributes">Incommunicable Attributes</p>
<p class="fl">Acknowledging some diversity of theological opinion, the following attributes will be considered incommunicable: unity, spirituality, independence, immutability, eternity, and immensity. In addition, the incomprehensibility of God must be mentioned.</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">incomprehensibility</span> is sometimes included in lists of his attributes. It seems preferable to regard it as a description of human inability to understand God fully. Incomprehensibility is therefore not an attribute, although it is a given in every discussion of God. Through his revelation God is truly known by faith, yet no creature will ever comprehend God the Creator. Likewise, no one will ever fully understand any one of God’s attributes. Acknowledgment of God’s incomprehensibility should contribute to a spirit of humility in every consideration of God and his attributes (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.6">Pss 139:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.145.3">145:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.28">Is 40:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.8-9">55:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.25-27">Mt 11:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.33-36">Rom 11:33-36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.6-16">1 Cor 2:6-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.8-13">13:8-13</a>).</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">unity</span> is an expression of monotheism—the fact that the God of Scripture is the only, living, true God (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">Dt 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.29">Mk 12:29</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.3">Jn 17:3</a>). All other gods are idols and figments of human imagination. This attribute is reflected in the first commandment: “You shall have no other gods before me” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.3">Ex 20:3</a>).</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">spirituality</span> indicates that God is not physical and is invisible. Positively it means that God is personal, living, self-conscious, and self-determining. The invisible God cannot be seen by human eyes (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.20">Ex 33:20</a>), so the second commandment forbids every visible representation of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4">20:4</a>). Because God is Spirit, he must be worshiped in spirit and in truth (<a href="?bref=John.4.24">Jn 4:24</a>).</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">independence</span> or self-existence indicates that he is not dependent upon anything outside himself. He is self-sufficient in his existence, in his decrees, and in all his works. God has “life in himself” (<a href="?bref=John.5.26">Jn 5:26</a>) and “he himself gives life and breath and everything” (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.25">Acts 17:25</a>). To Israel, he revealed himself as the “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.14">Ex 3:14</a>), and he made Israel a covenant people for his own possession. God continues to work out his will in the world, and even though he uses various means, his independence remains intact. Thus, he enters into fellowship with his covenant people, and he publishes the gospel through human agents.</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">immutability</span> or constancy expresses his changelessness and his faithfulness to himself, to his decrees, promises, and works. He remains forever the same true God who undergoes no change from within or from anything outside himself. And so in <a href="?bref=Jas.1.17">James 1:17</a> we read: “Every good endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). God’s oath to Abraham expressed his immutability so that his covenant people could be sure of the “unchangeable character of his purpose” (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.17">Heb 6:17</a>). Samuel told King Saul that the Lord would not “change his mind; for he is not a man” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.29">1 Sm 15:29</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.23.19">Nm 23:19</a>). “For I the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> do not change” (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.6">Mal 3:6</a>). That was God’s explanation for not destroying sinful Judah; he shows mercy and keeps his covenant. Because “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever,” Christians are warned not to be “led by diverse and strange teachings” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.8-9">Heb 13:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>God’s immutability or constancy does not imply that he is static or immobile. He is a dynamic, living God who is constantly working (<a href="?bref=John.5.17">Jn 5:17</a>). Sometimes God is described as being sorry, repenting, or changing his mind (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.6-7">Gn 6:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.11">1 Sm 15:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jon.3.10">Jon 3:10</a>). In their contexts, such figurative expressions show the constancy of a God who, in holiness and righteousness, always abhors sin and reacts against it. In his grace and mercy, he forgives the penitent, and he carries out his promises without fail (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.4">Ps 110:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.10">Is 46:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.7-10">Jer 18:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>). Thus, the constancy of God is significant in all human relationships with him, including petitions offered in prayer.</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">eternity</span> indicates his transcendence over time. He is timeless and everlasting. He has no beginning or end; he does not undergo growth, development, or maturation. He existed before the creation of the world; he dwells now in eternity; he will continue as the eternal God even when history ends. Scripture speaks of God as “eternal” (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.27">Dt 33:27</a>), “the King” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.17">1 Tm 1:17</a>), “the beginning and the end” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.13">Rv 22:13</a>). He “inhabits eternity” (<a href="?bref=Isa.57.15">Is 57:15</a>) and his “years have no end” (<a href="?bref=Ps.102.27">Ps 102:27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.8">2 Pt 3:8</a>). Although God is above time and is timeless, time is his creation and history is the arena of his work. “When the time had fully come God sent forth his Son” (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.4">Gal 4:4</a>); Jesus Christ died on a Friday and rose on the third day.</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">immensity</span> and <span class="ital">omnipresence</span> express his transcendence over space. God fills heaven and earth (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.23-24">Jer 23:23-24</a>). Heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, so he is not restricted to a temple building (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.1">Is 66:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.24">Acts 17:24</a>). Yet God is immanent in this world and is actively at work in it to establish his kingdom. No one can hide from the omnipresent God (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.6-12">Ps 139:6-12</a>). Jesus promised, “I am with you always, to the close of the age” (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.20">Mt 28:20</a>). Since Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>), the Holy Spirit is said actually to dwell within the bodies of believers (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">1 Cor 6:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="CommunicableAttributes">Communicable Attributes</p>
<p class="fl">Many attributes of God can be classified under this heading, although it is sometimes difficult to say which biblical references to God should be regarded as attributes. A rich diversity of terminology is found in Scripture, with many synonyms. For convenience, the communicable attributes are often classified as intellectual, moral, and volitional.</p>
<p class="h3">Intellectual Attributes</p>
<p class="fl">God’s <span class="ital">knowledge</span> indicates that in a unique way God knows himself and all things possible and actual. <span class="ital">Omniscience</span> means that “he knows everything” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.20">1 Jn 3:20</a>). “Even before a word is on my tongue, lo, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, thou knowest it altogether” (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.4">Ps 139:4</a>), including the secret thoughts of a person’s heart. God’s righteous judgment is rooted in the fact that he “knows the thoughts of man” (<a href="?bref=Ps.94.11">Ps 94:11</a>). Acknowledging that God’s omniscience is incomprehensible, the psalmist finds it a source of comfort (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-5">139:1-5</a>). All the “treasures of wisdom and knowledge” are hidden in Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.2.3">Col 2:3</a>); therefore, the Christian is told to bring every thought captive to obey Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.5">2 Cor 10:5</a>). Christian sanctification includes renewal in knowledge to become more like Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>).</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">wisdom</span> indicates that he uses his knowledge in the best possible manner to achieve his goals. God’s works are varied, but they are all done in wisdom (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.24">Ps 104:24</a>). “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> by wisdom founded the earth” (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.19">Prv 3:19</a>); his providence also displays his wisdom (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.20">Gn 50:20</a>). Redemption through Jesus Christ reveals God’s wisdom (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.24">1 Cor 1:24</a>) and awakens awe and praise (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.33-36">Rom 11:33-36</a>). Human beings should seek wisdom (<a href="?bref=Pr.3.21">Prv 3:21</a>)—wisdom rooted in the fear of God (<a href="?bref=Job.28.28">Jb 28:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.111.10">Ps 111:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.9.10">Prv 9:10</a>). Christians are said to be “wise in Christ” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.10">1 Cor 4:10</a>), and Christ charges them to act wisely (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.16">Mt 10:16</a>), thus emulating the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">veracity</span> expresses his truthfulness and faithfulness. He is the truth and he is faithful to himself, to his Word, and to his promises (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.13">2 Tm 2:13</a>). “God is light and in him is no darkness at all” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5">1 Jn 1:5</a>); therefore, his followers are to walk in the light (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.6-7">6-7</a>). Jesus is “the way, and the truth, and the life” (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">Jn 14:6</a>); hence, Christians are to walk in the truth and show faithfulness in their lives.</p>
<p class="h3">Moral Attributes</p>
<p class="fl">The most comprehensive description of God’s moral character is his <span class="ital">goodness.</span> God deals bountifully and kindly with all his creatures. He is “good to all” (<a href="?bref=Ps.145.9">Ps 145:9</a>). Jesus insisted that “no one is good but God alone” (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.18">Mk 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.19">Lk 18:19</a>). The redeemed praise God for his goodness (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.34">1 Chr 16:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.5.13">2 Chr 5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1">Pss 106:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.1">107:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.118.1">118:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1">136:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.11">Jer 33:11</a>) and are called upon to emulate this divine characteristic (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.45">Mt 5:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.27-36">Lk 6:27-36</a>).</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">love</span> is the heartbeat of the gospel. Perfect love flows among the Persons of the Trinity (<a href="?bref=John.3.35">Jn 3:35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.24">17:24</a>). At Sinai God revealed himself as abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">Ex 34:6-7</a>), and all his covenantal relations with Abraham’s descendants showed his steadfast love. The chief manifestation of God’s love was the sending of his Son, Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>). The apostle John, who declared that “God is love,” pointed to the cross to indicate what that love really meant: “he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.8,10">1 Jn 4:8, 10</a>).</p>
<p>God’s love shown to undeserving sinners is called <span class="ital">grace</span> (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.6-8">Eph 1:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.7-9">2:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.4">Ti 3:4</a>). <span class="ital">Mercy</span> is God’s love (sometimes his goodness) shown to those in misery and distress. God is <span class="ital">longsuffering</span> or patient in his love; he gives time for repentance.</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">holiness</span> depicts the moral purity and excellence of God. The description of Jesus’ holiness is applicable to each of the Persons of the Trinity: “holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">Heb 7:26</a>). The root idea of holiness is to be separate or set apart. Because of his inherent holiness, God is distinct from everything impure or unholy. God alone is holy; his name is holy, and he bears the name the “Holy One” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.41">Pss 78:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.18">89:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.3,9">99:3, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.111.9">111:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.12.6">Is 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.5">Jer 51:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.15.4">Rv 15:4</a>). Angels praise God’s holiness (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">Is 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.4.8">Rv 4:8</a>). Objects, places, and people are called holy when set apart for the worship of God. Because God is holy, his people are called to holiness (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.44-45">Lv 11:44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.14-15">1 Pt 1:14-15</a>). God’s discipline of his people is aimed at making them share his holiness (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.10">Heb 12:10</a>). The holiness of God is so prominent in Scripture that some have (mistakenly) regarded it as God’s chief attribute.</p>
<p class="h3">Volitional Attributes</p>
<p class="fl">God’s <span class="ital">sovereignty</span> indicates the divine authority with which he rules the entire creation and in his sovereign good pleasure does whatever he wills. God is King over the entire creation, and he rules the destiny of human beings and nations. He restores his kingdom through Jesus Christ; the risen Lord revealed that all authority in heaven and on earth was given to him (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.18">Mt 28:18</a>). Election to salvation in Christ is “according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). God’s sovereign will, though free, is not arbitrary; it is righteous and holy. He created the world and gave his law as the rule for his people’s lives; he covenants, blesses, and judges. God is the “King of kings and Lord of lords” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.15">1 Tm 6:15</a>); he calls all his subjects to obedient love (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-5">Dt 6:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.37-40">Mt 22:37-40</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.3">1 Jn 5:3</a>).</p>
<p>God’s <span class="ital">sovereign power</span> means that he is without bounds or limit in ability; he is <span class="ital">omnipotent</span> or almighty (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.8">Rv 4:8</a>). By his powerful word, he created all things, and upholds “the universe by his word of power” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>). There is nothing too hard for the Lord God Almighty (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.14">Gn 18:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.27">Jer 32:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.26">Mt 19:26</a>); he keeps his gracious covenant and fulfills all his promises (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.37">Lk 1:37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.13">2 Tm 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.18">Heb 6:18</a>). The gospel is “the power of God for salvation” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>), for Christ is “the power of God” to save (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.24">1 Cor 1:24</a>). Hence, believers must come to know “the immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe, according to the working of his great might which he accomplished in Christ when he raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.19-20">Eph 1:19-20</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Glory</p>
<p class="fl">All the attributes of God are summarized in Scripture’s references to the <span class="ital">glory</span> of God. The majesty, splendor, beauty, and brilliance of God who dwells in unapproachable light are expressed by this indefinable term. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.2">Acts 7:2</a>); God showed his glory to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.18-19">Ex 33:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">34:6-7</a>). The God of the Lord Jesus Christ is the Father of glory (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.17">Eph 1:17</a>). The heavens declare the glory of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">Ps 19:1</a>); the majesty and glory of God fill heaven and earth (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.1">8:1</a>). When finally every tongue shall confess Jesus as Lord, it will be for the glory of God the Father (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.11">Phil 2:11</a>). Human beings were created for God’s glory, and Christian believers are instructed to do everything for the glory of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.31">1 Cor 10:31</a>), thus reflecting in themselves his inherent glory.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheBiblicalIdeaofName">The Biblical Idea of Name</p>
<p class="fl">In the Scriptures the name and person of God are inseparably related. This is in keeping with the biblical conception of what a name signifies.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew language, the term for “name” most probably meant “sign” or “distinctive mark.” In the Greek language, “name” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">onoma</span><span class="ital">)</span> is derived from a verb that means “to know.” A name, therefore, indicates that by which a person or object is to be known. But the idea of name is not to be taken in the sense of a label or an arbitrary means of identifying or specifying a person, place, or object. “Name” in biblical usage correctly describes the person, place, or object and indicates the essential character of that to which the name is given. Adam named the animals according to their nature (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.19-20">Gn 2:19-20</a>); Noah means “one who brings relief and comfort” (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.29">5:29</a>); Jesus means “savior” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>). When a person was given a new position or a radical change took place in his life, a new name was given to indicate that new aspect—for example, Abraham (“father of many,” <a href="?bref=Gen.17.5">Gn 17:5</a>), and Israel (“one who strives with God” or “God strives,” <a href="?bref=Gen.32.28">32:28</a>). The name of a person or people expressed what the person or people thought the proper description or statement of character was.</p>
<p>With regard to the names of God, there are considerable differences, and these are most clearly seen when biblical scholars and theologians confront the question of whether the names of God are ascriptions given by God concerning himself or they are ascriptions given to God by people who observed his acts and reflected on his character as discerned through a study of divine deeds. Here are some examples of various kinds of divine names:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Proper names: El, Yahweh, Adonai, Theos (God), Kurios (Lord).</p>
<p class="list">2. Personal names: Father, Abba, Son, Jesus, Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="list">3. Titles: Creator, Messiah/Christ, Paraclete/Comforter.</p>
<p class="list">4. Essential names: Light, Love, Spirit.</p>
<p class="list">5. Descriptive names: Rock, Ba’al, Master, Rabboni, Shepherd.</p>

<p class="fl">The name <span class="hebrew">’El</span> is found over 200 times in the Hebrew Bible. It is best translated as “God.” The term <span class="hebrew">’el</span> has a number of possible meanings. The root is thought by some to be <span class="hebrew">’ul</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to be first” or “to be strong.” Others suggest the root is <span class="hebrew">’alah</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to precede” and suggests “leader” or “commander.” It can also mean “to be afraid.” Thus God as <span class="hebrew">’alah</span><span class="ital">,</span> as the strong one, is to be feared. Still others suggest the preposition <span class="hebrew">’el</span> (“to, toward”) as the root; the idea then is of “one giving self to others” or of “one to whom others go for help.” Some scholars suggest that the word <span class="hebrew">’alim</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “to bind,” should be considered as a root also—that is, “the strong one binds and holds firm control.” Common to these four suggested root meanings is the idea of strength, power, and of supreme excellence and greatness.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’El</span> in the OT is used particularly in the earlier books, where it describes God’s exercising dynamic power as distinguished from authority. <span class="hebrew">’El</span> speaks of God as the great doer and producer. He is the One who exercises such power that whatever is made, done, kept, or destroyed is his doing (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>). <span class="hebrew">’El</span> is also used to express the idea that God is not to be identified as part of creation but as the One who is above, behind, and beyond creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">Ps 19:1</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> is also commonly used as the name of God, occurring over 2,500 times in the OT. There are differences of opinion concerning the exact origin and meaning of this plural name. Some have suggested that <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> is the plural form of <span class="hebrew">’El</span><span class="ital">,</span> but it seems more likely that it is a plural of <span class="hebrew">’Eloah</span><span class="ital">,</span> which appears in the poetical writings. Some critical writers have suggested that this plural form is borrowed from pagan polytheistic sources, but no such plural form is found among pagans as the name of a deity. Others have suggested that the plural form is used to indicate the triune nature of God, and support for this has been seen in the use of a singular verb with this plural noun. The biblical doctrine of the Trinity, as it is developed throughout the Scriptures, does not appear to be based on the use of this plural form of God’s name, even though the two positions are not contradictory.</p>
<p>The plural form, <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span><span class="ital">,</span> is best understood as expressing intensity. God makes himself known by this name as the Lord of intense and extensive glory and richness as he exercises his preeminence and power in the created cosmos. Hence, when the Scripture speaks of creation, it states, “In the beginning <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> created the heavens and the earth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1">Gn 1:1</a>). This name is repeated 35 times in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">2</a> in connection with God’s power as revealed in Creation. In the book of Deuteronomy the name <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> is used repeatedly to stress the majestic power of God that was shown in Israel’s release from bondage in Egypt, preservation in the wilderness, and preparation for entrance into the Promised Land. In this context, God <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span><span class="ital">)</span> is also recognized as the Lawgiver who will powerfully execute judgment on covenant breakers. The psalmists also used this named repeatedly as they acknowledged and praised God the majestic ruler who had demonstrated his omnipotence in many dimensions of life (see <a href="?bref=Ps.68.1-35">Ps 68</a>, in which <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> appears 26 times.)</p>
<p>Some scholars point to the use of <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> when God spoke to Abraham and said he would be <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> to the patriarch and his seed; that is, God would be in a covenant relationship to them (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-8">Gn 17:1-8</a>). Included in this relationship is the idea that God is ever ready to use his power on behalf of those who are in covenant with him. Thus, <span class="hebrew">’</span><span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> also expresses the concept of God’s faithfulness in regard to the covenant and the promises and blessings involved in it.</p>
<p>The name <span class="hebrew">’</span><span class="hebrew">Eloah</span> occurs mainly in the poetical writings, no fewer than 41 times in Job. Isaiah used it to express the incomparable character of God (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.8">Is 44:8</a>). In like manner David asked, “Who is God [<span class="hebrew">’</span><span class="hebrew">Eloah</span>], but the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>?” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.32">2 Sm 22:32</a>). Moses was the first to use the name <span class="hebrew">’</span><span class="hebrew">Eloah</span> in his song (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.15-17">Dt 32:15-17</a>), referring to Israel’s God in the context of the “no-gods,” which had been chosen in place of the Rock of salvation and the incomparable One. This name was probably used to stress the fact that God is the only true and living One, the One to be adored and worshiped; he is to be revered with a holy fear.</p>
<p>Another closely related name is <span class="hebrew">’Elah</span><span class="ital">,</span> found in Ezra and Daniel. Some think <span class="hebrew">’Elah</span> is a Chaldee or Aramaic form of <span class="hebrew">’Eloah</span><span class="ital">.</span> Its root is said to be <span class="hebrew">’alah</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to fear” or “to be perplexed.” God as <span class="hebrew">’Elah</span> is the God to be feared and worshiped accordingly. In view of this meaning, it can be understood why, in the time of Israel’s exile and immediately after their return, this name was commonly used.</p>
<p>Three other names of God include the term <span class="hebrew">’El</span><span class="ital">:</span></p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’El ‘Elyon</span> is the name used to designate the God of Melchizedek (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18-22">Gn 14:18-22</a>) as God Most High. In <a href="?bref=Ps.57.2">Psalms 57:2</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.78.56">78:56</a> the Hebrew reads <span class="hebrew">’Elohim ‘Elyon</span><span class="ital">.</span> It is believed that the term <span class="hebrew">‘Elyon</span> is derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">‘alah</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “go up, be elevated, to be exalted.” There are a number of instances where the term <span class="hebrew">‘Elyon</span> is used alone, but the context indicates that it is then used as a synonym for God (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.24.16">Nm 24:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.83.18">Ps 83:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.14">Is 14:14</a>). The term <span class="hebrew">‘elyon</span> is used quite frequently as an adjective; it is then translated as “high, highest, upper, uppermost.” The basic ascription given to God when this name is employed is to One who is above all things as the maker, possessor, and ruler. He is incomparable in every way; he is subject to no one and no thing; he is the Exalted One.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’El Shaddai</span> is used in the longer form seven times in the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">Gn 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.3">28:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.11">35:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.14">43:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.48.3">48:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.3">Ex 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.5">Ez 10:5</a>). In the shorter form <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span><span class="ital">),</span> it appears more frequently: in <a href="?bref=Job.30.1-31">Job 30</a> times; in <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1">Psalms 19:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.68.14">68:14</a>; once in Ruth (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.21">1:21</a>), Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.6">13:6</a>), Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.24">1:24</a>), and Joel (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.15">1:15</a>). In these passages the combined ideas of God as the all-powerful, all-sufficient, transcendent, sovereign ruler and disposer are present. This meaning is generally accepted, but there are differences as to the exact meaning of the term <span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span><span class="ital">.</span> Some have begun with <span class="hebrew">shad</span> as the first concept to be considered; its meaning is “breast, pap, or teat,” and it is considered a “precious metaphor” of the God who nourishes, supplies, and satisfies. The root of <span class="hebrew">shad</span> <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">shadah</span><span class="ital">),</span> in Semitic usage, is to moisten. This meaning is not the preferred one in the context of which <span class="hebrew">’El Shaddai</span> appears; nor is <span class="hebrew">shed</span> (demon), which some scholars have sought to use because it appears in <a href="?bref=Deut.32.17">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.106.37">Psalm 106:37</a> speaking of Israel’s idolatry. In addition to the fact that <span class="hebrew">shed</span> is spelled differently, the connection between the concept of demon and God as all-powerful is difficult to establish. More acceptable is the suggestion that <span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span> is a composite term of <span class="hebrew">sha</span> (“the one who”) and <span class="hebrew">dai</span> (“is sufficient”). The later Greek versions have adopted this meaning. The most preferred explanation is that <span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span> is derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">shadad</span> (“to overpower, to deal violently, or to devastate”). A clear connection between <span class="hebrew">shadad</span> and <span class="hebrew">Shaddai</span> is said to be found in <a href="?bref=Isa.13.6">Isaiah 13:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Joel.1.15">Joel 1:15</a>. God as <span class="hebrew">’El Shaddai</span> is presented as the all-powerful One, totally self-sufficient, absolute ruler, and the One who can and does make final disposition. The Septuagint has adapted this meaning; it translates <span class="hebrew">’El Shaddai</span> as <span class="greek">Pantokrator</span><span class="ital">,</span> the “All-Ruler” or “Sovereign One.”</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’El ‘Olam</span> is used to refer to God as the everlasting or eternal One, a clear instance where the name of God and an attribute of God are combined. The term <span class="hebrew">‘olam</span> has a wide range of uses. It is usually defined in lexicons as meaning “long duration, antiquity, and indefinite futurity.” It is used to speak of God’s existence, of God’s covenant and promises, and of the Messiah’s reign. Speaking to God, the psalmist said, “You are from <span class="hebrew">‘olam</span> (everlasting) to <span class="hebrew">‘olam</span> (everlasting)” (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.2">Ps 90:2</a>), and the prophet Isaiah spoke of God as the everlasting Creator (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.28">Is 40:28</a>) and as everlasting strength (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.4">26:4</a>), and Jeremiah spoke of God as everlasting King (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.10">Jer 10:10</a>). God’s everlastingness or eternity speaks of his infinity in relation to time. <span class="hebrew">‘Olam</span><span class="ital">,</span> as ascribed to God, should not be thought of as duration prolonged indefinitely backward and forward. Rather, the word speaks to God’s transcending all temporal limits; in addition, <span class="hebrew">‘olam</span> refers to the quality of God that differs essentially from time. The Scriptures speak of <span class="hebrew">’El ‘Olam</span> in contexts where the believer’s assurance of well-being, security, and hope are presented as prized possessions.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’El Gibbor</span> is a name that speaks of God’s power and might. <span class="hebrew">Gibbor</span> alone is used in reference to mighty and heroic men. The two terms together always refer to God, and in some instances <span class="hebrew">Haggadol</span> (“the greatest”) is added (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.17">Dt 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.18">Jer 32:18</a>) to emphasize the greatness and awesome majesty of God. <span class="hebrew">’El Gibbor</span> is also used to describe the Messiah in <a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">Isaiah 9:6</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.45.4">Ps 45:4</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’El Ro’i</span> is used once to describe God as the seeing One. Hagar described the Lord this way when she was found in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.13">Gn 16:13</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-2">Psalm 139:1-2</a> expresses this concept of God as the all-seeing One from whose eye nothing is hidden (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.33.18">Ps 33:18</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> is a distinctly proper name of God. It is never used to refer to any pagan gods; neither is it used in regard to men. It appears 6,823 times in the OT, occurring first in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.4">Genesis 2:4</a>, where it is joined with <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span><span class="ital">.</span> <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> is used 164 times in Genesis, and it appears 1,800 times in Exodus through Joshua. It never appears in a declined form in the Hebrew language, and it never occurs in the plural form or with suffixes. It is abbreviated as <span class="hebrew">Yah</span> and <span class="hebrew">Yahu</span> (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.15.2">Ex 15:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.4">Ps 68:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.12.2">Is 12:2</a>; etc.).</p>
<p>The exact meaning of the name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> is difficult to determine. Some have sought the root in the verb <span class="hebrew">hayah</span> (“to be”) or in an ancient form of that same verb, <span class="hebrew">hawah</span><span class="ital">.</span> There is no agreement as to whether the <span class="hebrew">qal</span> or <span class="hebrew">hiphil</span> form of the verb should be considered as the root. Those who opt for the <span class="hebrew">hiphil</span> form read <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> to mean “cause to be”; thus <a href="?bref=Exod.3.14">Exodus 3:14</a> would read, “I will cause to be what has come to be.” Others look to the <span class="hebrew">qal</span> form and then translate the name as “I Am” or “I Shall Be.” Still others are inclined to disassociate the name from the verb <span class="hebrew">hayah</span> and regard it as an original and independent term, expressing the uniqueness of Israel’s gracious God.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="GodsNameYHWHinAncientHebrewLetters"/>
<p>Translators of the OT have not agreed upon the correct translation of the name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">.</span> Since it is translated into the Greek as <span class="greek">kurios</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “Lord,” many have rendered <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> as “<span class="divine-name">Lord</span>.” But <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> which is best rendered “Lord,” appears with <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> in various instances. The <span class="sc">kjv</span>, for example, translates <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> as “God,” and <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> as “Lord.” Some modern translators have chosen to use <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> (see <span class="sc">jb</span> and <span class="sc">njb</span>). The name Jehovah, as used in the <span class="sc">asv</span> (1901), has been judged unacceptable. This name arose due to the Jewish practice of not pronouncing <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> because of <a href="?bref=Lev.24.16">Leviticus 24:16</a>, “He that blasphemes the name of <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> shall surely be put to death.” This warning against a vain or blasphemous use of the name was taken in an absolute sense, especially after Israel’s deportation (cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.6.10">Am 6:10</a>). Hence, when reading the OT the Jews substituted either <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span> or <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> for <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">.</span> From this, the practice of adding the vowels of <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> to YHWH (JeHoWaH) became established.</p>
<p>The interpretation of <a href="?bref=Exod.6.2-3">Exodus 6:2-3</a> has caused much debate. “And God said to Moses, ‘I am <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">;</span> I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as <span class="hebrew">’</span><span class="hebrew">El Shaddai</span><span class="ital">,</span> but by my name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> I did not make myself known to them.’ ” This passage has been understood to mean that the name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> was not known or used prior to the time of Moses. But that is not what the passage states; rather, it speaks of the patriarchs not knowing God as <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">.</span> They knew him as <span class="hebrew">’El Shaddai</span> in actual revelatory historical deeds. They had not come to know God according to his unique character, that is, as <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">.</span> In other words, God had always been <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">;</span> he is saying to Moses that the descendants of the patriarchs would come to know the full, rich meaning of the name by the way God dealt with them.</p>
<p>This name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> reveals God’s nature in the highest and fullest sense possible. It includes, or presupposes, the meaning of the other names. <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> particularly stresses the absolute faithfulness of God. God had promised the patriarchs that he would be their God, that he would be with them and deliver and bless them, keep them, and give them a land as a place of service and inheritance. Moses is told by God that Israel is about to behold and experience the unchangeableness of God as he steadfastly and wondrously remembers his word and executes it to the fullest degree. God would prove to be a faithful, redeeming, upholding, restoring God. In working out this redemption, God would demonstrate that he is all that his name implies: merciful, gracious, patient, full of loving-kindness, truthful, faithful, forgiving, just, and righteous (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.5-6">Ex 34:5-6</a>). Truly, Jacob had received an insight into the meaning of the name when he exclaimed, “I wait for thy salvation, O <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span>” (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.18">Gn 49:18</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">,</span> then, is the name par excellence of Israel’s God. As <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">,</span> he is a faithful covenant God who, having given his word of love and life, keeps that word by bestowing love and life abundantly on his own.</p>
<p>In view of the richness of the name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">,</span> it can be understood why there were stringent rules regarding its proper use (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.11,16">Lv 24:11, 16</a>). It also explains why thankful, rejoicing, worshiping Israelites used the abbreviated form of <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> in song when they sang Hallelujah: “Praise Yah” (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.35">Pss 104:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.1">106:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.1">149:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1">150:1</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> is used in a number of phrases that are considered names of or ascriptions of God. The most common of these compound names is <span class="hebrew">Yahweh Tseba’oth</span> (“hosts”). The word “hosts” is used frequently in the Pentateuch to refer to the armies of Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.10.14-28">Nm 10:14-28</a>). This is because the word is derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">saba</span><span class="hebrew">’</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means “to wage” war. It also means “to serve” in some contexts; for example, <a href="?bref=Num.8.24">Numbers 8:24</a> clearly has reference to the service performed in the tabernacle. The noun <span class="hebrew">tseba’oth</span> first occurs in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1">Genesis 2:1</a>, where it refers to the many components of the earth and heaven. Some would limit the reference in these contexts to the stars. Still others would suggest that the <span class="hebrew">tseba’oth</span> refers to the angels, appealing to <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6">Psalm 33:6</a> for confirmation.</p>
<p>The compound name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh Tseba’oth</span> first appears in <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.3">1 Samuel 1:3</a>. In view of the frequent use of <span class="hebrew">tseba’oth</span> in 1—2 Samuel to refer to armies (<a href="?bref=1Sam.12.9">1 Sm 12:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.50">14:50</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.55">17:55</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8">2 Sm 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.16">8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.16">10:16</a>), it is thought that the compound name refers to <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> as the God of armies, that is, God has his armies to serve him. These are considered to be armies of angels who are ministering servants to God. It has been correctly pointed out that the compound name <span class="hebrew">Yahweh Tseba’oth</span> is used most frequently by the prophets (Jeremiah, 88 times; Zechariah, 55 times; Malachi, 25 times; Haggai, 14 times) at times when God’s people had either suffered defeat at the hands of enemy armies or were threatened by defeat. Therefore, the compound name was used to remind them that their covenant God had great hosts to fight and work for him on behalf of his people. Thus, though Israel’s armies failed, their covenant God was sufficient for every possible circumstance. And it was to this <span class="hebrew">Yahweh Tseba’oth</span> that Israel’s commanders were to give allegiance (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.14-15">Jos 5:14-15</a>), and in whose name Israel was blessed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.18">2 Sm 6:18</a>).</p>
<p>Several other compound names occur infrequently:</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh-Nissi</span> (<span class="hebrew">nissi</span><span class="ital">,</span> “my banner”) is the name that Moses called on when he built an altar celebrating Israel’s God-given victory over the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.15">Ex 17:15</a>). Isaiah uses the term <span class="hebrew">nissi</span> when speaking of the coming Messiah who is to be the conqueror (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.10">Is 11:10</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh-Rapha</span> (<span class="hebrew">rapha’</span><span class="ital">,</span> “healer”) appears in <a href="?bref=Exod.15.26">Exodus 15:26</a>, when Israel is assured that God, their healer, will prevent the diseases of Egypt from affecting Israel. Although the name is only used once, God was often called upon and praised as the healing One (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.103.3">Ps 103:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.26">Is 30:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.14">Jer 6:14</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh-Rohi</span> (<span class="hebrew">ro‘i</span><span class="ital">,</span> “my shepherd”) appears in <a href="?bref=Ps.23.1">Psalm 23:1</a>. The concept of <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> as shepherd is explicated in <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.1-31">Ezekiel 34</a>. “I myself will be the Shepherd of my sheep” (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.15">15</a>). Jesus demonstrated this concept’s full meaning when as a shepherd he gave his life for his sheep.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh-Jireh</span> (<span class="hebrew">yir’eh</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to see ahead or to provide”) appears in <a href="?bref=Gen.22.14">Genesis 22:14</a>. Abraham gave this name to the place where God provided a substitute for his son Isaac, whom Abraham was to offer as a sacrifice to God. <span class="hebrew">Yahweh-Shalom</span> (<span class="hebrew">shalom</span><span class="ital">,</span> “peace”) is the name Gideon gave to the altar he built when the angel of the Lord came to give him orders to fight the Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.24">Jgs 6:24</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> appears with a few forms of the term <span class="hebrew">tsadaq</span><span class="ital">,</span> “righteousness.” <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> is spoken of as our righteousness in <a href="?bref=Jer.23.6">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; the thought evidently is that David’s Righteous Branch (the Messiah) will attribute God’s righteousness to those who are incorporated in the new covenant. This concept is expressed in the Pentateuch a number of times when it is said that God has provided a way for living righteously; that is, God provides a way of sanctification (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.20.8">Lv 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.9">22:9</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> as a name for God appears about 360 times in the OT, though it is not uniformly used. It is first found in <a href="?bref=Gen.15.2">Genesis 15:2</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.8.1-22">8</a>, when Abram requests more definite information concerning a son and the Promised Land. It appears only 14 times after that in the Pentateuch. It appears repeatedly in the Psalms (over 50 times), and certain of the prophets use it frequently (Isaiah, 47 times; Jeremiah, 29 times; Ezekiel, over 150 times; and Amos, 27 times).</p>
<p>The word <span class="hebrew">’adan</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “master, ruler, owner, lord,” is thought to be the root of the noun <span class="hebrew">’adon</span><span class="ital">,</span> which is frequently used of men. For example, in Genesis and 1—2 Samuel the term is used often for men who own slaves or are in positions of authority. <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> is correctly described as the name of personal communication between the believer and God. In such communication the worshiper acknowledged God’s intense majesty and greatness and also the sense of belonging to this God. <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> coming from human lips, expressed honor for God and humble submission on the part of the believing person. <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> thus, is the name that expresses faith, assurance, security, ready service, and thanksgiving (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.2">Pss 16:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.9-10">57:9-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Old Testament Name Combinations</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT the names of God appear in various combinations. For example <span class="hebrew">’Elohim-Yahweh</span><span class="ital">,</span> <span class="hebrew">’Elohim-Yahweh-’Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> and <span class="hebrew">’Elohim-’Adonai</span> are very common. These combinations were an effort to express the fullness of God’s being and character as these had been revealed. Names of God in combination with “Israel” occur also as, for example, with <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span>-God-Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.3">Jgs 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.17.6">Is 17:6</a>). God is also invoked in relation to Israel without the mention of one of his names—for example, <span class="hebrew">Qedosh Yisrael</span> (“Holy One of Israel,” <a href="?bref=Isa.43.14">Is 43:14</a>) and <span class="hebrew">’Abir Yisrael</span> (“Mighty One of Israel,” <a href="?bref=Gen.49.24">Gn 49:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.2">Ps 132:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.26">Is 49:26</a>). By means of these phrases, the covenantal relationship between God and his people was expressed and God’s unchanging character was positively acknowledged.</p>
<p class="h3">Old Testament Personal Names</p>
<p class="fl">The personal names of God are Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and variations of these.</p>
<p>The term <span class="hebrew">’Abh</span> (“father”) appears more frequently in Genesis than in any other book, and in the Pentateuch more than in any other division of the OT. But it is not used there of God but rather of one who has generated children (i.e., the male parent), the progenitor—head, chief, and ruler of the family group or clan. It is used often in the sense of the responsible one through whom God has spoken, with whom God has dealt, and through whom he has given a rich heritage to the children and descendants of the patriarchs.</p>
<p>In the poetical books, God is referred to as Father but is not directly named as such. Job is asked, “Has the rain a father?” (<a href="?bref=Job.38.28">Jb 38:28</a>). The reference is to God as the maker, source, and controller of rain. In <a href="?bref=Ps.68.5">Psalm 68:5</a> God in his holy dwelling place is the “Father of the fatherless”; the parallel phrase, “protector of widows,” indicates the sense. <a href="?bref=Ps.89.26">Psalm 89:26</a> says that David will cry to God, “Thou art my Father,” and the parallels use the terms “God” and “Rock of my salvation.” The idea here is of God as Creator and Savior who raised up, delivered, and protected David. In <a href="?bref=Ps.103.13">Psalm 103:13</a>, “Father” is used analogously, “As a father pities his children.”</p>
<p>Isaiah uses the term “Father” in relation to God four times. Three times it refers to the One who has made, saved, formed, kept, and directed Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.16">Is 63:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.64.8">64:8</a>). Isaiah says the promised child is to be named Everlasting Father (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">9:6</a>). Used in this sense, the term establishes the Son’s equality with the Father in stature, function, ability, and responsibility. Jeremiah also refers to God as Father in <a href="?bref=Jer.3.4,19">Jeremiah 3:4, 19</a>, meaning the origin, keeper, and friend of his people Israel. <a href="?bref=Mal.1.6">Malachi 1:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Mal.2.10">2:10</a> speak of God as the parent who deserves honor from his children and as the origin and ruler of all people.</p>
<p>The term “son” is one of the most-used terms in the OT; it commonly occurs in the sense of offspring and descendant. It also appears in the sense of follower or successor. There are a few indirect references to the second person of the Trinity.</p>
<p>The messianic <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Psalm 2</a> has such a reference: “You are my son” (v <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">7</a>). It is stated in the context of the king speaking to one who rules and is to rule with and under the sovereign. The immediate reference may be to the theocratic king; however, the reference is revealed in the NT to be the second person of the Trinity (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.33">Acts 13:33</a>). Thus, the term “son” is applied to the promised Messiah who is set forth as the divine sovereign ruler and judge of the nations. The Son is perceived to be equal with the Father in deity and function. Not all biblical scholars accept this interpretation, but support is found in such NT passages as <a href="?bref=Heb.1.8">Hebrews 1:8</a> which quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.45.6">Psalm 45:6</a>. As stated above, Isaiah speaks of the son to be given (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">Is 9:6</a>), the One born of the virgin (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">7:14</a>), who is Immanuel, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p>
<p>The name “Holy Spirit” occurs only a few times in the OT. The Spirit is referred to frequently by terms and phrases such as “the Spirit of God” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Gn 1:2</a>), “the Spirit of the Lord God” (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Is 61:1</a>), “the Spirit of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1">Ez 37:1</a>), “the Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Num.11.17">Nm 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.27.18">27:18</a>), “my Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">Gn 6:3</a>), and “your Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.11">Ps 51:11</a>). Though the character of the Spirit is not developed as clearly in the OT as in the NT, it can be safely stated that the relationship posited between God and the Spirit is such that there is no doubt that the OT teaches the deity of the Spirit. The character and function of the Spirit is referred to especially in relation to the work of creation (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Gn 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6">Ps 33:6</a>; etc.) and the equipping of servants for the service of God—for example, craftsmanship (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.31">Ex 35:31</a>), leadership (<a href="?bref=Num.11.17">Nm 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.27.18">27:18</a>), and prophecy (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.6">1 Sm 10:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.2">2 Sm 23:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.1">2 Chr 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.5">Ez 11:5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNamesofGodintheNewTestament">The Names of God in the New Testament</p>
<p class="h3">Proper Names of God</p>
<p class="fl"><span class="greek">Theos</span> is the NT equivalent of the OT names <span class="hebrew">’El </span>and <span class="hebrew">’Elohim</span><span class="ital">;</span> <span class="hebrew">‘Elyon</span> appears in the NT as <span class="greek">Hupsistos</span><span class="ital">,</span> the Highest (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.7">Mk 5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.32,76">Lk 1:32, 76</a>). <span class="greek">Pantokrator</span> (<span class="hebrew">‘El Shaddai</span>) appears with <span class="greek">Theos</span> (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.18">2 Cor 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.7">Rv 16:7</a>). This name was used not only to express God’s transcendency, power, sovereignty, and lordship, but also to express that God is one who has a close relationship with his people. This fact is established by the very frequent use of personal pronouns with <span class="greek">Theos</span><span class="ital">.</span> The name <span class="greek">Theos</span> appears over 1,000 times in the NT.</p>
<p><span class="greek">Kurios</span><span class="ital">,</span> “Lord,” is used to express the OT names <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> and <span class="hebrew">‘Adonai</span> in the Septuagint, and the NT follows it. <span class="greek">Kurios</span> means “power,” so the meaning is not the same as with <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">;</span> yet the NT does give <span class="greek">Kurios</span> the full weight of meaning that the OT gave to <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span><span class="ital">,</span> especially when used of Jesus Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.36">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>; etc.)</p>
<p><span class="greek">Despotes</span> is used five times of God or Jesus in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.29">Lk 2:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.24">Acts 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.11">2 Pt 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.4">Jude 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.10">Rv 6:10</a>). It expresses the idea of authority. The idea of brutality conveyed by the modern concept “despot” is absent from the NT usage even when applied to men, where its central thought is ownership (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.21">2 Tm 2:21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Personal Names of God</p>
<p class="fl">In the baptismal formula, which is part of the Great Commission (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19-20">Mt 28:19-20</a>), the three personal names of God appear: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. These names carry the OT meaning, but since the relationship of the three Persons is explicated, the NT meaning of the names is enriched.</p>
<p>“Jesus” is the personal name of the Son, the second person of the triune Godhead. It means “savior” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>). The root of this name “to save” gave rise to names such as Joshua, Hoshea, and Hosea. The basic meaning of the OT root is “to bring into a safe, wide-open place.” Joshua, bringing Israel into Canaan, personally did what his name meant. The NT explanation (“save from sin”) is not contrary to the OT meaning. To be saved from sin is to be restored to fellowship with God and to enter into the paradise of the heavenly kingdom.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">GOD-FEARER</p>
<p class="fl">One who fears God. This can be a term of reverence, an emotional reaction of terror, or a dread of God’s vengeance.</p>
<p>Phrases describing the God-fearer in the OT are frequently coupled with such terms as “stood in awe” and “held in awe” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.25">1 Chr 16:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.23">Ps 22:23</a>). Reverence for the Lord is used less frequently, but it is used with this meaning when Obadiah hid the prophets in a cave to save them from being assassinated by Jezebel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.3-4,12">1 Kgs 18:3-4, 12</a>). A man could expect to receive justice from a God-fearing ruler (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.3">2 Sm 23:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.19.7">2 Chr 19:7</a>), and long life was a reward for those who feared the Lord (<a href="?bref=Pr.10.27">Prv 10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.14.27">14:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.19.23">19:23</a>). A God-fearing family would rely on the Lord for practical help in time of trouble (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1">2 Kgs 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.14.26">Prv 14:26</a>). The fear of the Lord was effective in driving away sin and was itself the beginning of wisdom (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.10.13">Wisd of Sol 10:13</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT fear of God is frequently used in conjunction with admonitions to love and serve the Lord (<a href="?bref=Col.3.22">Col 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.17">1 Pt 2:17</a>). In the Magnificat, Mary’s statement “His mercy is on those who fear him” is used in the sense of revere and obey (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.50">Lk 1:50</a>). In Acts, the term “God-fearer” is given a specific interpretation, being used with reference to Gentiles who attended the synagogue. Paul mentions them separately when introducing his address: “Men of Israel, and you that fear God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.16">Acts 13:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Cornelius was an honest, generous, and God-fearing Roman centurion who, although not a Jew, was recognized as leading a life acceptable to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.2,35">10:2, 35</a>).</p>
<p>The fear of God was also used in both the OT and the NT to denote dread or terror of the mighty power and judgment of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.10">Gn 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.9.19">Dt 9:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.6.4">Jb 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.9.28-29">9:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.76.8">Ps 76:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.7">Mt 17:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.10">28:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.10">Lk 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.5,11">Acts 5:5, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.20">1 Tm 5:20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GODS AND GODDESSES</p>
<p class="fl">Male and female deities worshiped by pagans. Although the Bible teaches that there is only one God (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.18,21-22">Is 45:18, 21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.32">Mk 12:32</a>), heathen people in ancient times quickly developed a belief in large numbers of so-called gods (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.11">Jer 10:11</a>) and goddesses. Eventually each nation created and worshiped its own deities, usually more than one. Many of these “foreign gods” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.3">1 Sm 7:3</a>) are named in the Bible, and in most cases we are told to what nation each belonged. The list from Mesopotamia, a center of idol worship, is the longest: Adrammelech and Anammelech (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.31">2 Kgs 17:31</a>), Bel (also known as Marduk, <a href="?bref=Isa.46.1">Is 46:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.50.2">Jer 50:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.44">51:44</a>), Kaiwan (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.26">Am 5:26</a>), Nebo or Nabu (<a href="?bref=Isa.46.1">Is 46:1</a>), Nergal (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.30">2 Kgs 17:30</a>), Nisroch (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.37">19:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.38">Is 37:38</a>), Rephan (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.43">Acts 7:43</a>), Sakkuth (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.26">Am 5:26</a>), Succoth-benoth (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.30">2 Kgs 17:30</a>), Tammuz (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.14">Ez 8:14</a>), and Tartak (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.31">2 Kgs 17:31</a>). The Syrians were devoted to Ashima (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.30">30</a>) and Rimmon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.18">5:18</a>), who was also worshiped under the compound name Hadad-rimmon (<a href="?bref=Zech.12.11">Zec 12:11</a>). Israel’s eastern neighbors, Ammon and Moab, worshiped Milcom or Molech (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.5-7,33">1 Kgs 11:5-7, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.13">2 Kgs 23:13</a>) and Chemosh, respectively, although the Moabites also worshiped a local manifestation of Baal (<a href="?bref=Num.25.3-5">Nm 25:3-5</a>). The Philistine gods were Dagon and Baal-zebub (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.2-3,6,16">2 Kgs 1:2-3, 6, 16</a>), who is the equivalent of the NT Beelzebul (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.24">Mt 12:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.15">Lk 11:15</a>). One Canaanite god, Baal, and two Canaanite goddesses, Asherah and Ashtoreth, are mentioned frequently in the OT; Ashtoreth was the same as the Mesopotamian Ishtar, also known as the “Queen of Heaven” (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.18">Jer 7:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.17-19,25">44:17-19, 25</a>). The gods of Egypt are represented by only two names in the Bible: Amon (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.25">Jer 46:25</a>) and Apis (v <a href="?bref=Jer.46.15">15</a>). Nibhaz (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.31">2 Kgs 17:31</a>) was probably an Elamite god.</p>
<p>At least three Greco-Roman deities are mentioned in the NT: the Greek goddess Artemis (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.24-28,34-35">Acts 19:24-28, 34-35</a>), known as Diana by the Romans, and the Greek gods Zeus and Hermes (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.12-13">Acts 14:12-13</a>), known as Jupiter and Mercury, respectively, by the Romans.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly teaches that the gods of the nations have no objective reality (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.11">Jer 2:11</a>), even though their worshipers sincerely believe that they actually exist (v <a href="?bref=Jer.2.28">28</a>). But the Lord proclaims that “they are no gods,” (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.11">Jer 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.20">16:20</a>) or “gods that are not gods” (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.7">5:7</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The NT further declares of idols that “an idol has no real existence” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.4">1 Cor 8:4</a>) and that “gods made with hands are not gods” (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.26">Acts 19:26</a>). It is not surprising, then, that when the Israelites began to encounter other nations in significant ways—that is, as early as the time of the exodus—they were told repeatedly that the Lord is greater than all other gods (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.11">Ex 15:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.18.11">18:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.17">Dt 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.25">1 Chr 16:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.5">2 Chr 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.8">Pss 86:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.95.3">95:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.4-5">96:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.7-9">97:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.5,136">135:5, 136:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.47">Dn 2:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.11">Zep 2:11</a>).</p>
<p>Such so-called gods were not worthy of Israel’s attention or veneration. Since there is only one God, other gods could not claim and did not deserve Israel’s worship (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.3">Ex 20:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.7">Dt 5:7</a>). The Hebrew language did not even have a word for “goddess” and therefore had to use its word for “god” to express that concept (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.5,33">1 Kgs 11:5, 33</a>). The Israelites were to make no images (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4,23">Ex 20:4, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.4">Lv 19:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.8">Dt 5:8</a>) or mention (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.13">Ex 23:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.7">Jos 23:7</a>) of the gods and goddesses of their heathen neighbors.</p>
<p>Yet despite all God’s warnings, idolatry was Israel’s besetting sin from the earliest times. During the patriarchal period, God’s people were attracted to the “household idols” (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.32">Gn 31:32</a>) of their relatives, and they continued to worship other gods throughout most of their history (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-4,8,23,31">Ex 32:1-4, 8, 23, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.15">34:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.2">Hos 11:2</a>). Idolatry eventually led to the destruction of the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.7-18">2 Kgs 17:7-18</a>) in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> and of the southern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.17">2 Kgs 22:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.29.25-28">Dt 29:25-28</a>) in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. During their time of exile in Babylonia, the Jewish people saw idolatry at its worst and turned away from it, but their ancestors could have avoided untold agony if they had simply followed the example of Joshua: “As for me and my house, we will serve the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.15">Jos 24:15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">GOG</p>
<p class="list">1. Reubenite, Shemaiah’s son (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.4">1 Chr 5:4</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Individual described as the prince of Meshech who ruled over the land of Magog (<a href="?bref=Ezek.38.2-21">Ez 38:2-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.1-16">39:1-16</a>). Magog was evidently a territory located far from Palestine whose inhabitants would attack Jerusalem in a final attempt to overthrow God’s people. The Lord, through Ezekiel, promised Gog a catastrophic defeat.</p>
<p class="list-text">Attempts to identify Gog with some historical ruler have not been convincing. Gyges of Lydia, who drove out Cimmerian invaders, has been suggested, but equally probable are Gaga, mentioned in the Amarna tablets, and Gagi, king of the city-state of Sabi. Some have maintained a mythological interpretation, in which Gog is a symbol of evil actively opposing good. Certainly Gog—connected in Scripture with godless nations such as Gomer, Put, Persia, Sheba, and Tarshish—is depicted as leading an alliance of world powers in opposition to God. Gog also appears in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-9">20:7-9</a>), where Satan mobilizes Gog and Magog (i.e., the nations of the world) against God’s saints in a final battle. A literal view contemplates an attack on Jerusalem by hostile forces (cf. <a href="?bref=Zech.14.1-21">Zec 14</a>), while a symbolic interpretation envisions a climactic conflict between good and evil.</p>

<p class="list">1. People or region mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1,9">Genesis 14:1, 9</a> as ruled by a king named Tidal.

Tidal, together with three other kings—Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, and Kedorlaomer of Elam—attacked several cities in the valley of Siddim near the Dead Sea (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.3">Gn 14:3</a>).

  <title>Golgotha</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GOLGOTHA</p>
<p class="fl">Place where Jesus and two thieves were crucified, in the vicinity of Jerusalem. The term appears in the NT only in the accounts of the Crucifixion. Three of the Gospels use the Hebrew-Aramaic term, “Golgotha” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.33">Mt 27:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.22">Mk 15:22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.17">Jn 19:17</a>), while one uses the Latin equivalent, “Calvary,” meaning “skull or cranium” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.33">Lk 23:33</a>).</p>
<p>The reason why this place was called “the skull” is unknown, although several explanations have been offered. An early tradition, apparently originating with Jerome (<span class="era">AD</span> 346–420), asserted that it was a common place of execution and that the skulls of many who had been executed were strewn around the site. No first-century evidence has been found to substantiate this viewpoint. Some suggest that it was a place of execution and that “skull” was used figuratively, simply as a symbol of death. Origen (<span class="era">AD</span> 185–253) mentioned an early, pre-Christian tradition that the skull of Adam was buried in that place. This is probably the oldest explanation of the name, and is referred to by several writers after Origen. Others have said that the name resulted from the fact that the place of the Crucifixion was a hill that had the natural shape of a skull. No early evidence from any sources has been found to substantiate this view, and the NT accounts do not refer to the place as a hill.</p>
<p>The location of the site is disputed. The biblical references give us only general indications. It was outside the city proper (<a href="?bref=John.19.20">Jn 19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.12">Heb 13:12</a>). It may have been on an elevated site, since it could be seen from a distance (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mk 15:40</a>). It was perhaps near a road since “passersby” are mentioned (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.39">Mt 27:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.29">Mk 15:29</a>). John’s account places it near a garden that contained the tomb in which Jesus was buried (<a href="?bref=John.19.41">Jn 19:41</a>). The use of the definite article, <span class="ital">“the</span> place of the skull,” would indicate that it was a well-known place.</p>
<p>There seems to have been little interest in the site of Golgotha until the early part of the fourth century. Eusebius, who lived in Jerusalem for several years, said that Constantine the emperor instructed Bishop Macarius to find the site of the Crucifixion and burial. Later accounts said that the bishop was guided to the site by a vision of the Queen Mother Helena. The site that he settled on contained a Hadrianic temple of Aphrodite, which Constantine destroyed. There, tradition says, he found fragments of the cross of Christ. On that site he built two churches, and this is the site of the modern Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Although destroyed and rebuilt several times, this has remained a fixed site since the time of Constantine.</p>
<p>In 1842 Otto Thenius contended that Golgotha was a rocky hill about 250 yards (228.5 meters) northeast of the Damascus Gate. He based his contention on the assertions that it had been a Jewish place of stoning, lay outside the city wall, and was shaped like a skull. Later General Charles Gordon also advocated this spot, and it has come to be known as “Gordon’s Calvary.”</p>

  <title>Goshen</title>

<p class="h1">GOSHEN</p>
<p class="list">1. Geographical region in Egypt occupied by the Israelites during their sojourn in Egypt from the time of Joseph to the exodus. <a href="?bref=Gen.46.1-47.31">Genesis 46–47</a> gives us several pieces of information concerning Goshen: (a) It was a definite part of Egypt. (b) It was the place where Joseph met his father after their years of separation, when Jacob moved his family to Egypt. (c) It was an area good for grazing flocks. Goshen has been associated with Egyptian bull cults and was important for animal husbandry. At one period the princes of Thebes sent their cattle to the Delta for pasture, even though it was controlled by the Hyksos. Sacred cattle were probably pastured there by Egyptians also. (d) It is called “the best of the land” in two different verses (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.6,11">Gn 47:6, 11</a>) and is identified as the “land of Rameses.” (e) It probably had a military outpost on its eastern border and may not have been heavily inhabited by Egyptians.</p>
<p class="list-text">The name Goshen is not of Egyptian origin but is Semitic and attests to the occupation of the region by Semites before the New Kingdom of Egypt. The Septuagint reads “Gesem of Arabia” instead of “land of Goshen” in <a href="?bref=Gen.45.10">Genesis 45:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.46.34">46:34</a>. Ptolemy the geographer said that Arabia was an Egyptian name for the eastern border of the Nile Delta, and this would account for the terminology of the Septuagint.</p>
<p class="list-text">Goshen was a region of about 900 square miles (1,448.1 square kilometers), consisting of the two districts. The western half ran from Zoan to Bubastis, a distance of about 35 miles (56.3 kilometers) from north to south. This district was an irrigated plain containing some of the most fertile land in Egypt. It is about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) wide at the Mediterranean Sea and narrows to about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) between Zagazig and Tell el-Kebir on the south. The eastern sector contains a large desert area between the Nile Plain and the Suez. As it stretches to the south from Daphnai to the Wadi Tumilat, it increases in width to about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) from east to west. South of this section more desert area stretches to the Suez on the south and from the Bitter Lakes on the east to Heliopolis on the west. The physical arrangement of Goshen is important in determining the route of the exodus. Given the above description, the Wadi Tumilat would have been the most logical route to the Red Sea for people who were driving flocks and herds. The route would have led from the south side of the field of Zoan near Bubastis, east of the edge of the wilderness and the head of the Bitter Lakes.</p>
<p class="list">2. Area in the territory conquered and occupied by the Israelites under Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.41">Jos 10:41</a>, country of Goshen; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.16">Jos 11:16</a>, land of Goshen). It was probably in the hill country of Judah between Hebron and the Negev.</p>
<p class="list">3. Town in the territory of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.51">Jos 15:51</a>). It may have been the central city of the district discussed in #2 above, but this is uncertain.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheGospelMessageofIsaiah">The Gospel Message of Isaiah</p>
<p class="fl">Of all the passages cited, those of Isaiah provide the most important background for the gospel in the NT. According to Isaiah’s gospel, it is God alone who saves, and there is no explanation for his saving action except in his own nature. Israel’s deliverance is undeserved; she is no more worthy of the divine love now than when she went into captivity. In whatever measure she has paid the just due for her past sins (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.2">Is 40:2</a>), she remains a sinful people (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.25">42:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.12-13">46:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.1">48:1</a>). It is only by God’s grace that she is saved (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.1-7">55:1-7</a>). By God’s design, Israel’s salvation depends not upon her own righteousness but upon his (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.10">41:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.24">45:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.13">46:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.51.5-6">51:5-6</a>). There being no righteousness to reward, the Lord acts to <span class="ital">create</span> righteousness in Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.8">45:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.3,10-11">61:3, 10-11</a>). Yet as these references indicate, salvation is not accomplished at the expense of justice. The penalty for Israel’s sins is to be paid in full. God’s mercy is not hereby called into question. On the contrary, it is precisely here that his mercy is most poignantly expressed, for the penalty is exacted not from his people but from the Servant appointed to stand in their place (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.4-12">53:4-12</a>). Through the Servant’s work, many shall be justified (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.11">53:11</a>). The coming of the Evangelist—the preacher of the good news—is predicted in <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-11">Isaiah 61</a>. He is called the anointed One (v <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">1</a>) who proclaims the year of the Lord’s favor (v <a href="?bref=Isa.61.2">2</a>). God will be glorified through his preaching (v <a href="?bref=Isa.61.3">3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelintheNewTestament">The Gospel in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In only two places (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.8">Gal 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.2,6">Heb 4:2, 6</a>) does the NT speak of the proclamation of the gospel prior to the Christian era. This is quite remarkable, given (1) the unmistakable presence of the gospel in the OT, (2) the extent of gospel terminology in the NT (in the Greek the noun appears 76 times; and the verb, 54), and (3) the fact that the NT presents Christ as the fulfillment of the OT and draws heavily on the OT to interpret his person and work. Not only is it remarkable; it is very significant. It indicates that the NT usage depends not only upon the <span class="ital">character</span> of the message (truth about salvation) but also upon <span class="ital">historical events.</span> Almost without exception, the NT restricts its application of gospel terminology to proclamations made during the time of fulfillment—the age in which the salvation promised in the OT is actually accomplished. The NT is preoccupied, not with promises of salvation, but with news of salvation. According to <a href="?bref=Mark.1.1-4">Mark 1:1-4</a>, the gospel “begins” not in the OT but with John the Baptist, in whose work OT prophecy is fulfilled. In <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-5">Romans 1:1-5</a> the gospel is represented as a blessing promised in the OT but not actually given until Jesus comes (see also <a href="?bref=Acts.13.32-33">Acts 13:32-33</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGoodNewsofChristsComing">The Good News of Christ’s Coming</p>
<p class="fl">The promised birth of John the Baptist is good news (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.19">Lk 1:19</a>), not only for his parents (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.7,24-25">7, 24-25</a>) but for all the people: John is sent to prepare them for Messiah’s coming (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.14-17,67-79">14-17, 67-79</a>). John’s own preaching is gospel (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.18">3:18</a>) for the same reason. The Messiah would be coming to execute judgment, a process that involves both condemnation and salvation (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.3.3-17">3-17</a>). John’s message is gospel for sinners in that they are warned of impending doom and urged to repent before the ax falls (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.3.7-9">7-9</a>); it is gospel for the repentant in that they are promised forgiveness (v <a href="?bref=Luke.3.3">3</a>) and membership in Messiah’s community (v <a href="?bref=Luke.3.17">17</a>). The birth of the Savior himself is announced as good news bringing great joy (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.10-11">2:10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelaccordingtoJesus">The Gospel according to Jesus</p>
<p class="h3">The Coming of the Kingdom of God</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus was authorized by God and anointed by the Spirit to proclaim the gospel (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.14">Mk 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">Lk 4:18</a>). At the heart of his preaching stands the announcement “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>). (For further references to this gospel, see <a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.35">9:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.14">24:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.13">26:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.35">Mk 8:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.29">10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.10">13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.9">14:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.43">Lk 4:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.16">16:16</a>.) The message is good news for several reasons: (1) The kingdom is coming. The God whom Jesus proclaims is sovereign over all he has made. Yet paradoxically his rule is incomplete: his will is not done on earth as it is in heaven; wrong, not right, prevails. But these conditions are not final, according to Jesus. With the coming of the kingdom, God’s rule will be completed; wrong will be judged, righteousness established, and his people blessed. (2) The kingdom is <span class="ital">now</span> being inaugurated. “The time is fulfilled,” declares Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15a</a>). The time appointed for the fulfillment of the OT promises has arrived. (3) The consummation of the kingdom is therefore no longer a distant prospect; the full realization of God’s rule is “at hand” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15b</a>). (4) God is establishing his rule for a saving purpose. This is implied in Jesus’ call to repentance (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15c">Mk 1:15c</a>). It is especially clear in the passages to which we now turn.</p>
<p class="h3">The Salvation of the Poor</p>
<p class="fl">Invited to read the Scripture in the synagogue at Nazareth, Jesus turns to <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-11">Isaiah 61</a>: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-19">Lk 4:18-19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Having read the prophecy, Jesus announces its fulfillment in his own ministry (v <a href="?bref=Luke.4.21">21</a>). Included among those whom Jesus has come to free are the physically infirm, such as the blind (v <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">18</a>) and the leprous (v <a href="?bref=Luke.4.27">27</a>) (cf. the references to healing miracles in vv <a href="?bref=Luke.4.23,33-41">23, 33-41</a>; the close connection between evangelizing and healing in <a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.35">9:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.21-22">Lk 7:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.6">9:6</a>; and the description in <a href="?bref=Matt.12.22-29">Mt 12:22-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.11-16">Lk 13:11-16</a>, of the physically afflicted as captives of Satan now liberated by Jesus). Also included are the materially poor—people like the widow helped by Elijah during the famine (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.25-26">Lk 4:25-26</a>). It is the literally poor and hungry whom Jesus pronounces “blessed” in <a href="?bref=Luke.6.20-21">Luke 6:20-21</a>. Yet it is primarily “spiritual” poverty that is in view. Still applying <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-11">Isaiah 61</a>, Jesus speaks in <a href="?bref=Matt.5.3">Matthew 5:3</a> of the “poor in spirit.” These are people broken and grieved by misery and poverty, oppression and injustice, suffering and death, national apostasy and personal sin—people who in their extremity turn to God and longingly wait for him to bring forth justice, bestow his mercy, and establish his kingdom. It is to just such people that Jesus brings good news (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-10">Mt 5:3-10</a>). God sent him to usher in the kingdom, to rescue the lost, to liberate the enslaved, to cure the afflicted, to bind up hearts that are broken, and to forgive the guilty (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.5,10,17">Mk 2:5, 10, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-21">Lk 4:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.48-49">7:48-49</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.1-32">15:1-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.10">19:10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Gift of Grace</p>
<p class="fl">The coming of the kingdom is not the effect or the reward of human effort but God’s answer to the human predicament—the gift of his favor (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.32">Lk 12:32</a>). Correspondingly, the explanation for the salvation of the poor lies nowhere but in God’s own character. As the prodigal himself recognized, he hardly deserved to be his father’s servant, much less his son. Nothing he did, not even his repentance, accounted for the father’s love (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.11-32">15:11-32</a>). In the parable of <a href="?bref=Matt.20.1-16">Matthew 20:1-16</a>, it is owing entirely to the goodness of the employer that the last workers to be hired receive a full day’s wages. The first debtor in the story of <a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">Matthew 18:23-35</a> earned nothing but the right to be sold into slavery; instead, the king canceled his enormous debt. The publican, who had nothing to offer God but a confession of sin and plea for mercy, went home justified (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.13-14">Lk 18:13-14</a>). The same holds true for the more virtuous among the poor, such as the persons described in <a href="?bref=Matt.5.7-10">Matthew 5:7-10</a>. Their virtue is real, not imagined. Yet in keeping God’s commands, they do not put him in their debt; they are simply doing their duty (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.7-10">Lk 17:7-10</a>). Furthermore, even the most merciful need divine mercy (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.7">Mt 5:7</a>). For even those most zealous to obey God’s law are unable to fulfill all its requirements (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.11.28-30">11:28-30</a>). The first servant in <a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">Matthew 18:23-35</a> owes far more money than someone in such a situation could possibly pay—which serves to magnify the generosity of the king. Grace depends for its exercise upon the inability of its objects (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.12-14">Lk 14:12-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Call to Salvation</p>
<p class="fl">The Israelites are without exception a sinful people, all of them needing the salvation that Jesus brings (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.77">Lk 1:77</a>). In demonstration of God’s grace, Jesus proclaimed his gospel to the entire nation (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.35">9:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.24">15:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.43">Lk 4:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.6">9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.1">20:1</a>). From the most respectable to the least, all are summoned to submit to God’s rule, all are invited to come and partake freely of the banquet he has spread (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.16-24">Lk 14:16-24</a>). But the gift of salvation must be received if it is to be experienced (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.15">Mk 10:15</a>). And while it is indeed a gift that costs nothing, it is also a priceless treasure for which a wise person will freely sacrifice everything else (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.44-46">Mt 13:44-46</a>), a sacrifice exceeded only by the cost of rejecting the gospel (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.20-24">Mt 11:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.34-39">Mk 8:34-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.24,33">Lk 14:24, 33</a>). “Repent and believe in the gospel,” Jesus commands (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>). The self-righteous and the self-sufficient must be jolted out of their false sense of security and humbly recognize their need for God (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.24-26">Lk 6:24-26</a>). Only then will Jesus’ message to the poor be seen as gospel. An announcement of liberation (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-19">4:18-19</a>) is good news only to people who are enslaved and know they are. The command applies also to the destitute and the afflicted. Those among them who bemoan their lot must repent of their sins. But something further is needed for the response to be complete: a person cannot believe Jesus’ gospel without a commitment to the <span class="ital">Person</span> of Christ (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>). Even those who are already “poor in spirit,” in the sense defined earlier, are not really “blessed” until they acknowledge the truth of Jesus’ claims (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.6">Mt 11:6</a>) and commit themselves to a life of obedience on his terms (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.21-27">7:21-27</a>). This prepares us for the next point.</p>
<p class="h3">Summary</p>
<p class="fl">Throughout Jesus’ earthly ministry, the theme of his gospel remains the dawning of God’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.14">24:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.43">Lk 4:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.16">16:16</a>), a message that is preached almost exclusively to Jews (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.5-6">Mt 10:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.24">15:24</a>). Yet Jesus also provides glimpses into what the gospel was to become once his work on earth was accomplished: (1) In <a href="?bref=Mark.8.35">Mark 8:35</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.10.29">10:29</a> Jesus speaks of individuals who needed to make great sacrifices “for my sake and for the gospel.” While distinguished from each other, the person of Jesus and the gospel are here associated in the closest possible way. The time was approaching when the Proclaimer of the gospel would become the Proclaimed. (2) In <a href="?bref=Mark.13.10">Mark 13:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.24.14">Matthew 24:14</a> (and the textually doubtful <a href="?bref=Mark.16.15">Mk 16:15</a>) Jesus foretells the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the gentile nations. (3) In <a href="?bref=Mark.14.1-72">Mark 14</a>, having interpreted a woman’s action (v <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3">3</a>) as an anointing of his body beforehand for burial (v <a href="?bref=Mark.14.8">8</a>), Jesus declares, “And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.14.9">9</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.13">Mt 26:13</a>). This statement strongly implies that both the person of Jesus and the event of his death will figure prominently in the message that is to be proclaimed; otherwise, it is strange that the gospel and this particular act should be so solemnly bound together. Thus, here in the text already is an indication of how crucial Jesus’ death is both for the provision of the salvation announced in his gospel (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-24">Mk 14:22-24</a>) and for the launching of the evangelistic mission to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">Mt 20:28</a> is vital for explaining the shift from <a href="?bref=Matt.15.24">Mt 15:24</a> to <a href="?bref=Matt.28.18-20">28:18-20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelafterJesusResurrection">The Gospel after Jesus’ Resurrection</p>
<p class="fl">After the resurrection of Jesus, the gospel was proclaimed by his eyewitnesses. The contents of this gospel are recorded in the book of Acts and in Paul’s letters. Of the 43 instances of <span class="greek">euangelizomai</span> (“evangelize”) beyond the Gospels, 15 occur in Acts and 21 in Paul’s writings; of the 64 instances of <span class="greek">euangelion</span> (“gospel”), 2 occur in Acts and no fewer than 60 in Paul.</p>
<p class="h3">The Gospel of Christ</p>
<p class="fl">Having risen from the dead, Jesus Christ again evangelizes (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.16-17">Eph 2:16-17</a>), doing so now through his appointed representatives (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.16-18">Rom 15:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17">1 Cor 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.12-18">9:12-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.4.13-14">Gal 4:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.9-11">2 Tm 1:9-11</a>). More than that, Christ has become the central theme of the gospel; the Proclaimer is now the Proclaimed. This is repeatedly affirmed in Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.42">5:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.4-5,35">8:4-5, 35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.18">17:18</a>) and in Paul’s writings (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-4">Rom 1:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.8-17">10:8-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.19-20">15:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4-6">2 Cor 4:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.4">11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.16">Gal 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.8">Eph 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.15-18">Phil 1:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.8">2 Tm 2:8</a>). The NT always speaks of <span class="ital">the gospel</span>—never the gospels—of Christ. A second gospel is as inconceivable and as unnecessary as a second Christ. This is the one gospel that God authorizes (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1-17">Rom 1:1-17</a>) and proclaims (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13-14">2 Thes 2:13-14</a>). <a href="?bref=Gal.2.7-9">Galatians 2:7-9</a> speaks not of two gospels but of two mission fields. Paul (the apostle to the uncircumcised) and Peter (the apostle to the circumcised) are both entrusted with “the gospel of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.7">Gal 1:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-11">1 Cor 15:1-11</a>), the message that God has ordained for the salvation of Jews and Gentiles alike (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>). The “different gospel” that Paul denounces in <a href="?bref=Gal.1.6-9">Galatians 1:6-9</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.4">2 Corinthians 11:4</a> is not another gospel about Jesus but a message about “another Jesus”—not the real one, but one who exists only in the minds and the messages of those who proclaim him. To preach the true Christ is to preach the true gospel, however questionable one’s motives (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.15-18,27">Phil 1:15-18, 27</a>), and to respond rightly to the gospel is to turn to Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.20-21">Acts 11:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.8-17">Rom 10:8-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.14-16">Gal 2:14-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Gospel as a Witness to Saving Events</p>
<p class="fl">The gospel bears witness to every aspect of Christ’s saving work, from his birth (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.3">Rom 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.8">2 Tm 2:8</a>) and public ministry (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mk 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.36-38">Acts 10:36-38</a>) to his second coming (<a href="?bref=Col.1.5,23">Col 1:5, 23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.5-10">1 Thes 1:5-10</a>) and the last judgment (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.16">Rom 2:16</a>). But it is the death and the resurrection of Christ that are most crucial for the accomplishment of salvation, and that are therefore most prominent in the gospel’s witness. These are the events with which Mark’s proclamation climaxes (chs <a href="?bref=Mark.15.1-16.20">15–16</a>), and for which everything else prepares (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.31">9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.33-34">10:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.6-8">12:6-8</a>); special stress is placed upon Jesus’ death as the means of salvation from sin (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9,22-24">14:3-9, 22-24</a>). In Paul’s gospel, too, the death and resurrection of Jesus are central (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-4">1 Cor 15:1-4</a>), with the cross occupying the very center (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17-2.5">1 Cor 1:17–2:5</a>). Had Christ not risen from the dead, Paul argues, the preaching of the cross would be a waste of time (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.14,17">1 Cor 15:14, 17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.6.3-11">Rom 6:3-11</a>). However, now that Christ has risen, his death deserves special emphasis as the place where God provides atonement for sins (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-26">Rom 3:21-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.6-11">5:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14-21">2 Cor 5:14-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>). The gospel according to Acts proclaims Jesus’ death (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.25">Acts 8:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.24,28">20:24, 28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.10.36-43">10:36-43</a>) and preeminently his resurrection, the event by which he conquered death and was exalted as Lord and coming Judge (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.36-43">10:36-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.32-33">13:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.18,31">17:18, 31</a>). According to 1 Peter, the bearers of the gospel (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.12">1 Pt 1:12</a>) concentrated, as had the OT prophets, on “the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11">1:11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-19">1:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21-24">2:21-24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-22">3:18-22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Gospel as a Power for Salvation</p>
<p class="fl">The gospel is much more than a report of past events and an exposition of doctrine. Paul declares in <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17-18">1 Corinthians 1:17-18</a> and again in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Romans 1:16</a> that the gospel is “the power of God”—not merely a witness to his power but an <span class="ital">expression</span> of his power. Thus, it cannot be fettered (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.8-9">2 Tm 2:8-9</a>). “Our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power,” Paul writes in <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.5">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>. His point is not that the gospel was accompanied by mighty works (though this happened; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.15.18-19">Rom 15:18-19</a>), but that the gospel itself is a mighty work. God makes it so through his Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.18-19">Rom 15:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.1-5">1 Cor 2:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.6">1 Thes 1:6</a>). Furthermore, God’s singular purpose in exercising his power is to change people’s lives, to liberate them from sin and death, and to reconcile them to himself—in short, to save them. The gospel has power to effect the salvation it announces and to impart the life it promises (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.8-17">10:8-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17-18">1 Cor 1:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-2">15:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13-14">2 Thes 2:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8-11">2 Tm 1:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.23-25">1 Pt 1:23-25</a>). If people are to experience salvation, they must hear and believe the gospel. It is precisely in and through this message that the saving power manifested in the person and work of Christ (especially in his death and resurrection) is conveyed to men and made effective in their lives. Similarly it is in association with the gospel, or as a direct result of the reception of the gospel, that the Holy Spirit is imparted to believers (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.36-44">Acts 10:36-44</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.7-8">15:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.4">2 Cor 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.1-2">Gal 3:1-2</a>). In short, the gospel is the decisive place of encounter between the sinner and God the Savior.</p>
<p class="h3">The Gospel of Grace</p>
<p class="fl">According to Peter’s testimony at the Jerusalem Council (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.7-11">Acts 15:7-11</a>), an essential part of the gospel—for Gentiles and Jews alike—is salvation “through the grace of the Lord Jesus.” Toward the close of his missionary career, Paul states that his basic concern has been “to testify to the gospel of the grace of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.24">Acts 20:24</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This statement can be understood only in relation to Paul’s concept of the righteousness of God, particularly as set forth in Romans. Paul is here not merely expounding a divine attribute. Rather, he is dramatizing a divine activity—the manifestation of God’s righteousness now, “in the present time” (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.26">Rom 3:26</a>), in the new age inaugurated by the coming of Jesus. The manifestation is twofold. Viewing the two aspects together, and doing so in the light of the gospel declared by Isaiah and by Jesus (both of whom strongly influenced Paul), respectively, will help us to understand why Paul speaks of “the gospel of the grace of God.”</p>
<p>First, the gospel is a <span class="ital">witness</span> to God’s grace. In offering his Son as a sacrifice for sins (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25a</a>), God demonstrates his righteousness (vv <a href="?bref=Rom.3.25-26">25b-26</a>). That is, in the death of Jesus sins formerly “passed over” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">25</a>c) become the object of God’s wrath (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18">1:18</a>) and judgment. Yet in the very place where God deals justly and decisively with sins, he shows his grace to sinners. For the judgment against sin is focused not upon the sinners themselves but upon the One appointed to act on their behalf and to stand in their place (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.6,11">5:6, 11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>). On this basis, sinners are freely pardoned (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.24">Rom 3:24</a>). “The grace of the Lord Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.11">Acts 15:11</a>) toward the sinful is also in evidence, for he willingly bears their iniquities and suffers the consequences of their wrongdoing (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.9">2 Cor 8:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-8">Phil 2:6-8</a>).</p>
<p>Second, the gospel is a <span class="ital">channel</span> of God’s grace. “The righteousness of God is revealed” in the gospel, says Paul (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>). By this he means, not that the gospel talks about the righteousness of God (though it does), but that God’s righteousness is actively at work in the gospel. This activity in turn explains how the gospel becomes “the power of God for salvation” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">16</a>). And just how does God demonstrate his righteousness at this stage? In short, by bestowing it as a free gift on sinful human beings. It remains the righteousness of God, but by God’s grace, it is a righteousness in which humans may share. Furthermore, partaking of God’s righteousness depends on being personally united with Jesus Christ. In Paul’s view the saved person is one who has been acquitted, justified, “declared righteous” by God the judge. The basis for the verdict is not that I in myself am righteous (God justifies the ungodly, <a href="?bref=Rom.4.5">Rom 4:5</a>). Nor does God treat me as though I were righteous. According to Paul I am declared righteous because I really <span class="ital">am</span> righteous—not in myself but in Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.30">1 Cor 1:30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.9">Phil 3:9</a>). This union is established through the revelation—and the free offer—of God’s righteousness in the gospel (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16-17">Rom 1:16-17</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Responding to the Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">The gospel calls for a threefold response:</p>
<p>1. <span class="ital">Believing.</span> The gospel, says Paul, is “the power of God for salvation to every one who has faith” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>). For Paul, faith is the abandonment of all reliance upon “works of law” for justification (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.28">3:28</a>) and utter dependence upon the grace of God as demonstrated in the work of Christ, especially his death (v <a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">25</a>). Accordingly, the “different gospel” of <a href="?bref=Gal.1.6">Galatians 1:6</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.4">2 Corinthians 11:4</a> is spurious, for it preaches salvation by personal merit rather than (or together with) the work of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.2.16">Gal 2:16</a>). Ultimately faith rests upon God (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.24">Rom 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.8-9">1 Thes 1:8-9</a>) and upon Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.22,26">Rom 3:22, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.16,20">Gal 2:16, 20</a>). Yet it is imperative that one believe the gospel also (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.12">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20-21">11:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.7">15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.8-17">10:8-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17-24">1 Cor 1:17-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.27">Phil 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.2">Heb 4:2</a>), for it is just by this means that God’s salvation is made known and mediated. Moreover, believing the gospel entails repentance (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.15">Acts 14:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.21,24">20:21, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.5-10">1 Thes 1:5-10</a>) and obedience (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.5">Rom 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.16-18">15:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.6">Heb 4:6</a>). Those who refuse to obey the gospel are imperiling their lives (<a href="?bref=2Thes.1.5-10">2 Thes 1:5-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.17">1 Pt 4:17</a>).</p>
<p>2. <span class="ital">Growing.</span> The Gospel is more than a message to be received—it is also a place in which to stand (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-2">1 Cor 15:1-2</a>). It is sustainer of life as well as giver of life. One grows as a Christian not by turning from the gospel to other things (to turn away from the gospel is to abandon God and Christ, <a href="?bref=Gal.1.6">Gal 1:6</a>), but by going ever more deeply into the gospel. In <a href="?bref=Rom.1.15">Romans 1:15</a> Paul expresses his eagerness to proclaim the gospel to the Christians in Rome. In the following chapters, anticipating his visit, he offers one of his most profound expositions of the gospel—one whose truth has never been fathomed and whose power has never been exhausted.</p>
<p>3. <span class="ital">Hoping.</span> “The hope of the gospel” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.23">Col 1:23</a>) includes not only the return of Christ and the glory of heaven (<a href="?bref=Col.1.5">Col 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.14-16">2 Thes 2:14-16</a>) but the final judgment as well. For those who embrace the gospel, the last judgment holds no terrors, because the Judge is the very one who rescues them from the wrath to come (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.10">1 Thes 1:10</a>). Those who are united to him need not dread condemnation now or at the end (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.1">Rom 8:1</a>). Instead, the last judgment will mark their final vindication (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.5">1 Cor 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.5">Gal 5:5</a>). Accordingly, this theme is not just a corollary but an integral part of the Good News (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.16">Rom 2:16</a>). Those who have died since believing the gospel (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">1 Pt 4:6</a>) may seem to have suffered a fate common to all people, or even the condemnation reserved for the lawless; in fact, their response to the gospel assures them of approval by the coming Lord (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.5-6">4:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.4">5:4</a>) and of a share in the imperishable inheritance of heaven (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.4">1:4</a>).</p>

  <title>Governor</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GOVERNOR</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical term translated from at least ten different Hebrew root words and five Greek roots. English versions do not render these words consistently; they use a variety of titles, such as “overseer,” “officer,” “leader,” “judge,” and “deputy,” to translate the same Hebrew word. The situation is similar in the Septuagint (Greek OT).</p>
<p>A governor was someone of superior rank who exercised authority over persons, territory, or both. Sometimes rank and power were his by virtue of the office; other times accession to office was based on noble lineage, wealth, and public attainment. A governor normally received authority from a king; therefore, he was a deputy in the territory he governed. Such was the case with Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.6">Gn 42:6</a>), Gedaliah (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.5">Jer 40:5</a>), Daniel (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.48">Dn 2:48</a>), and Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>). One Hebrew term for “governor,” however, could mean “absolute ruler” (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.2">Jos 12:2</a>) as well as a person who acted under authority.</p>
<p>The term most frequently used in the OT is evidently from an Akkadian expression meaning “lord of a district.” Such governors normally relied on military power to maintain their rule (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.24">2 Kgs 18:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.7">Neh 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.23,28">Jer 51:23, 28</a>). The satrap of the Persian and Greek periods was most probably a civil governor. The leader of a city-state was often known as “governor” in the preexilic period (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.26">1 Kgs 22:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.8">2 Chr 34:8</a>). The writer of <a href="?bref=Ps.22.28">Psalm 22:28</a> used that title to describe God as the ruler of his people. A temple official who imprisoned the prophet Jeremiah in the stocks (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.1">Jer 20:1</a>) was described as a “governor” (<span class="sc">rsv</span> “officer”). One who governed an army probably commanded one or more military units. What appears to be a special title is rendered “governor” in <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.63">Ezra 2:63</a> and <a href="?bref=Neh.7.65">Nehemiah 7:65</a>.</p>
<p>Translation problems from the Greek are also numerous. Different levels and functions in leadership were obviously intended by the various words used. This is most clearly indicated by the use of such terms as <span class="greek">ethnarch</span> (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.14.47">1 Macc 14:47</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.32">2 Cor 11:32</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>), one who governed as a deputy of a king, and by another word referring to Roman provincial officials. Such governors were mentioned in NT writings (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.10.18">Mt 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.2">Lk 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.24">Acts 23:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.14">1 Pt 2:14</a>) and were responsible for maintaining law and order in their assigned territory. In NT times Judea was under the control of the governor of Syria. Archaic uses of “governor” occasionally appear in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>. The “governor” mentioned in <a href="?bref=Jas.3.4">James 3:4</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is the ship’s pilot.</p>

<p class="h1">GRACE</p>
<p class="fl">The gift of God as expressed in his actions of extending mercy, loving-kindness, and salvation to people.</p>
<p>Grace is the dimension of divine activity that enables God to confront human indifference and rebellion with an inexhaustible capacity to forgive and to bless. God is gracious in action. The doctrine of divine grace underlies the thought of both the OT and NT. However, the OT merely anticipates and prepares for the full expression of grace that becomes manifest in the NT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GraceintheOldTestament">Grace in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Early in the narrative of the OT, God reveals himself as a “God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness” (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Ex 34:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). As a result, it becomes possible for undeserving humans to approach him with the prayer, “If now I have found favor [or grace] in thy sight, O Lord, . . .” (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.9">Ex 34:9</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Through divine initiative, human alienation from God is turned by him into a state of unmerited acceptance that opens the way for reconciliation and redemptive usefulness.</p>
<p>Divine grace was already operative in the Garden of Eden when God responded to the debacle of the fall with the promise of redemption (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>) and solicitous care rather than with abandonment or retributive annihilation. The call to Abraham was an extension of grace, not only to him as an individual, but through him as a means of universal outreach. As an inseparable part of God’s promise of individual blessing to Abraham and of a national blessing to his descendants, the indication was given that the individual and the national blessings would be instrumental in bringing about a universal blessing to “all the families of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2-3">Gn 12:2-3</a>). Consequently, both the election of Abraham and the promise of universal blessing find expression in a God-given covenant, the object of which is to extend God’s grace to the whole human race. In a solemn confirmation of the promise to Abraham, God affirmed, “My covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. . . . And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant” (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.4,7">Gn 17:4, 7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This promise was to be understood as finding fulfillment on the basis of grace, not of race, so that it would become applicable to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to Jewish believers, his racial descendants, but also to his spiritual descendants, believers from all nations who profess a faith like Abraham’s (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.16">Rom 4:16</a>). Thus, from the perspective of divine grace, the election of Abraham and of national Israel was not an end in itself. It was God’s plan for extending his redemptive designs to all believers, from all nations. In extending his grace to Abraham, God was establishing the beginnings of the church, the community of grace.</p>
<p>The divine particularism evidenced in the election of Abraham and in his becoming the recipient of God’s grace provides a model for the selection of all the individuals used by God in the history of redemption. Beyond the benefits of grace accorded to individuals such as Abraham, David, the prophets, and later the apostles, by virtue of their call, loomed the potential of their contributions to the fulfillment of the covenant of God on behalf of the community of those who share the faith of Abraham—the church. In the gracious dealings of God with Israel, with its patriarchs and its leaders, God was laying the basis for his outreach of grace to the church universal. God’s gracious interventions in the old covenant were intended to manifest the ultimacy of the church in his redemptive purposes. In the exercise of their ministries, the prophets of the old covenant knew that they were serving not themselves but the church (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.10-12">1 Pt 1:10-12</a>).</p>
<p>As a transitional, mediatory expression of divine grace, the institutions of the old covenant possessed only a temporary validity that has been superseded by the ultimate manifestations of God’s grace in the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-7">Heb 8:6-7</a>). Consequently, the old covenant was to become obsolete and replaced by a new covenant that would display the full manifestation of God’s grace. The proverbial tension between law and grace becomes intelligible in this perspective. Like the election of racial Israel, the law (as one of the most visible institutions of the old covenant) was a temporary measure of divine grace accorded to anticipate and prepare the covenant of justification through grace by faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.23-29">Gal 3:23-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.1">Heb 10:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="GraceintheNewTestament">Grace in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The concept of grace defined as God’s active involvement on behalf of his people receives a sharper focus in the NT. Divine grace becomes embodied in the person of Jesus Christ, who demonstrates visibly the dynamic nature of God’s grace and fulfills in his ministry of redemption the old covenant promises relative to God’s gracious dealings with humanity (<a href="?bref=John.1.14,17">Jn 1:14, 17</a>).</p>
<p>God’s grace manifested in Jesus Christ makes it possible for God to forgive sinners and to gather them in the church, the new covenant community. During his ministry, Jesus repeatedly pronounced the words of forgiveness on a great number of sinners and ministered God’s benevolent succor to a variety of desperate human needs. Through teachings such as the father’s forgiveness of the prodigal son and the search for the lost sheep, Jesus made it clear that he had come to seek and save those who were lost. But ultimately it was his redemptive death on the cross that opened wide the gate of salvation for repentant sinners to find access to God’s forgiving and restorative grace. This simple truth is formulated in the doctrine of justification by faith through grace (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.23">Rom 3:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.7">Ti 3:7</a>). According to this teaching, God’s gracious provision of the substitutionary death of Christ enables him to pronounce a verdict of “just” or “not guilty” on repentant sinners and to include them in his eternal purposes. As a result, they enter into the realm of God’s gracious activity, which enables them to implement the process of individual sanctification in cooperation with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>God’s grace manifested in Jesus Christ also makes it possible for God to bestow on believers undeserved benefits that enrich their lives and unite them together in the church, the body of Christ. Their acceptance on the basis of grace endows them with a new status as children of God, members of the household of God, so that they relate to him as to their heavenly Father (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.4-6">Gal 4:4-6</a>). Consequently, they become members of a community where race, class, and sex distinctions are irrelevant, since they all became equal inheritors of God’s age-long promise to Abraham of universal blessing (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.28-29">3:28-29</a>). In order to enrich their individual lives and to assure the usefulness of their participation in the life of the new community, the Holy Spirit graciously energizes believers with a variety of gifts for the performance of ministries designed to benefit the church (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.6-8">Rom 12:6-8</a>). Foremost among those ministries is that of apostle, itself closely linked to God’s gracious provision (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.5">1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.15-16">15:15-16</a>) since it combines with the ministry of the prophets of old to provide the foundational structure of the church (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.20">Eph 2:20</a>). Because the riches of divine grace are freely lavished upon believers in their community life upon earth (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.7-8">1:7-8</a>), the church translated into eternity will demonstrate, by its very existence, the immeasurable riches of God’s grace in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.6">2:6</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, God’s grace manifested in Jesus Christ makes it possible for God to cause believers to reflect his grace in their character and relationships. The irreducible condition for receiving God’s grace is humility (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.6">Jas 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.5">1 Pt 5:5</a>). Such humility in relation to God enables believers to practice humility in regard to other people. From a position of grace, they can set aside selfishness and conceit in order to treat others with deference (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.3-4">Phil 2:3-4</a>) in an attitude of mutual servanthood (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.21">Eph 5:21</a>), and in a spirit of mutual forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.23-35">Mt 18:23-35</a>) so that even their communication can exhibit divine grace (<a href="?bref=Col.4.6">Col 4:6</a>). Since the grace of Jesus Christ constitutes the existential context of the lives and relationships of believers, they are exhorted not to pervert the grace of God into ungodly practice (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.4">Jude 1:4</a>) but instead to grow in the grace of the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.18">2 Pt 3:18</a>).</p>
<p>The essential meaning of grace in the Bible refers to God’s disposition to exercise goodwill toward his creatures. This favorable disposition of God finds its supreme expression in Jesus Christ. By its very definition, this grace is rendered fully accessible to all humans with no other precondition than a repentant desire to receive it (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.11-12">Ti 2:11-12</a>). As a result, the human condition of alienation from God and from his purposes becomes replaced with access to the otherwise unapproachable majesty of God represented by a throne, so that his grace may become available to meet human need (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.16">Heb 4:16</a>). The tragic alternative to receiving God’s grace is to remain in hopeless alienation or to pursue sterile attempts to merit God’s favor through human efforts doomed to futility (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.21">Rom 1:21</a>). God’s unconditional acceptance of sinners may be conditioned only by their rejection of his acceptance.</p>
<p>Because Christ represents the fulfillment, the embodiment, and the dispenser of divine grace, the early Christians freely referred to God’s grace as “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.” This grace was conceived as being so basic and so pervasive to their individual lives and to the existence of their communities of faith that they naturally coupled the traditional greeting of <span class="hebrew">shalom</span> (“peace”) with a reference to the grace of Jesus Christ. This is the reason for the ubiquitous repetition of numerous variations on the basic greeting formula found in almost every book of the NT, “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.3.18">2 Thes 3:18</a>).</p>

  <title>Gratitude</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GRATITUDE</p>
<p class="fl">Natural expression of thanks in response to blessings, protection, or love. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, gratitude is not a tool used to manipulate the will of God. It is never coerced or fabricated in one’s mind; rather, gratitude is a joyful commitment of one’s personality to God.</p>
<p>In the OT, gratitude to God was the only condition in which life could be enjoyed. For Jews, every aspect of creation provided evidence of God’s lordship over all life. The Hebrew people thanked him for the magnificence of the universe (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-4">Pss 19:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.6-9">33:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.1-24">104:1-24</a>). When they received good news, they thanked God for his goodness and great deeds (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.8-12">1 Chr 16:8-12</a>). When they received bad news, they also gave thanks, trusting that he was a just God (<a href="?bref=Job.1.21">Jb 1:21</a>).</p>
<p>These same sentiments are found in later Jewish writings such as the Talmud. The people of Israel thanked God for his faithfulness to covenant promises: (1) for deliverance from enemies (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.17">Pss 18:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.30.1">30:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-8">44:1-8</a>) and from death (<a href="?bref=Ps.30.8-12">Ps 30:8-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.18-20">Is 38:18-20</a>; (2) for forgiveness of sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.32.5">Pss 32:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.8">99:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.3">103:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.12.1">Is 12:1</a>); (3) for answers to prayer (<a href="?bref=Ps.28.6">Pss 28:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.66.19">66:19</a>); (4) for compassion toward the afflicted and oppressed (<a href="?bref=Ps.34.2">Pss 34:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.72.12">72:12</a>); (5) for executing justice (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.4">Dt 32:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.4">Ps 99:4</a>); and (6) for continuing guidance (<a href="?bref=Ps.32.8">Ps 32:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.20-21">Is 30:20-21</a>).</p>
<p>Gratitude was such a vital part of Israel’s religion that it pervaded most ceremonies and customs. Thank offerings acknowledged blessings from God (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.12-13">Lv 7:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.29">22:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.50.14">Ps 50:14</a>). Shouts of joy (<a href="?bref=Ps.42.4">Ps 42:4</a>), songs of praise (<a href="?bref=Ps.145.7">Pss 145:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.149.1">149:1</a>), and music and dance (<a href="?bref=Ps.150.3-5">Ps 150:3-5</a>) all added to the spirit of thanksgiving in worship. Feasts and festivals were celebrated in remembrance of God’s steadfast love throughout their history (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.9-15">Dt 16:9-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.30.21-22">2 Chr 30:21-22</a>). King David appointed Levitical priests to offer God thanks (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.4">1 Chr 16:4</a>). This custom was carried on by the kings Solomon (<a href="?bref=2Chr.5.12-13">2 Chr 5:12-13</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.2">2 Chr 31:2</a>) and by those who returned from the exile (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.17">Neh 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.24,27">12:24, 27</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, the object of thanksgiving is the love of God expressed in the redemptive work of Christ. The apostle Paul thanked God for that gift of grace (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.4">1 Cor 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.15">2 Cor 9:15</a>) and the ability to preach the gospel (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.14">2 Cor 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.12">1 Tm 1:12</a>). Paul thankfully participated in the spiritual gifts (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.18">1 Cor 14:18</a>). Gratitude for love and faith among believers pervades his letters (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.17">Rom 6:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.15-16">Eph 1:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.3-5">Phil 1:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.3-4">Col 1:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.2-3">1 Thes 1:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>Because the expression of gratitude is tied so closely to the response of faith, Paul encouraged believers to give thanks in all things (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.6">Rom 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.18">1 Thes 5:18</a>). He commanded Christians to pray with thanksgiving (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.6">Phil 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.2">Col 4:2</a>) in the name of Christ, who has made all thanksgiving possible (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.20">Eph 5:20</a>). In his teaching on how to celebrate the Lord’s Supper, Paul specified that Christians should give thanks, just as the Lord “had given thanks” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.24">1 Cor 11:24</a>).</p>

  <title>Greece, Greek</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GREECE, GREEK</p>
<p class="fl">The biblical references to Greece and the Greek people are often ambiguous. In the OT some references have been understood to mean Greece or the Greeks. Javan, the fourth son of Japheth in the “table of nations” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.1-32">Gn 10</a>), seems to fit a Greek identification (<a href="?bref=1Chr.1.5,7">1 Chr 1:5, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.19">Is 66:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.13">Ez 27:13</a>). The name Greece occurs clearly in <a href="?bref=Dan.8.21">Daniel 8:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.20">10:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.2">11:2</a>; and <a href="?bref=Zech.9.13">Zechariah 9:13</a>, and Greeks are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Joel.3.6">Joel 3:6</a>. In the NT the term “Greek” appears to have the special sense of Hellenist, that is, Jews living in Hellenistic cities (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1">Acts 6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.29">9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a>). The term in <a href="?bref=John.12.20">John 12:20</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.14.1">Acts 14:1</a>, and <a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-3">16:1-3</a> seems to refer to Greeks specifically. But often in the NT the term “Greek” was used for non-Jews because the Jews recognized only Jews and non-Jews. Hence the term was virtually synonymous with Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.16">Rom 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.12">10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.22,24">1 Cor 1:22, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.3">Gal 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">3:28</a>). Sometimes the term “Greek” refers to the language (<a href="?bref=John.19.20">Jn 19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.37">Acts 21:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">Rv 9:11</a>). The use of the term “Greek” for the Syrophoenician woman (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.26">Mk 7:26</a>) may be a cultural term. In Acts, references are made to Greeks in the synagogues as observers. These may have been Greeks as such, although certainty is not possible (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.1">Acts 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.4">17:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">18:4</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">The ancient Greek homeland comprised the southern end of the Balkan Peninsula. But at times Greek speakers were to be found in the islands of the Aegean Sea, western Asia Minor, south Italy, and Sicily.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheEmergenceofGreekCulture">The Emergence of Greek Culture</p>
<p class="fl">After the Persian Wars ended (497 <span class="era">BC</span>), Athens entered into a remarkable period of greatness. Athens was rebuilt and its port of Piraeus was fortified. When the Athenian citizens embarked on a course of unbridled democracy, chaos seemed to threaten, but Pericles, a brilliant leader, restored the equilibrium of the state and Athens soon regained her glory. Vast buildings were erected on the Acropolis, notably the Parthenon (dedicated to Athena, the goddess of Athens). Athens became wealthy, partly from the contributions to the Delian League. Athenian sea power grew. There were present in Athens an abundance of slaves, artisans, craftsmen, foreign traders, artists, poets, philosophers, teachers, actors, athletes, scientists, physicians, historians, religious teachers, and experts in military and naval affairs. The great writers of the fifth and early fourth centuries <span class="era">BC</span> included dramatists like Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes, historians like Thucydides and Herodotus, and philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. There occurred a flowering of art and architecture. It was a golden age of spectacular achievement in art, thought, literature, and architecture.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheAgeofHellenism">The Age of Hellenism</p>
<p class="fl">The great glory of Athens withered before the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> was over. Philip of Macedon, with ambitions of empire, drove west, and by 338 <span class="era">BC</span> Athens and Thebes were overwhelmed—Greece became united into a Macedonian Empire. Philip was assassinated in 366 <span class="era">BC</span>, but Alexander, his son, educated in the Athenian tradition, took up his father’s work and before his own death in 323 <span class="era">BC</span> had conquered Persia and reached to the Punjab in India. In the end he exerted his control from the Caucusus to the Libyan Desert and the borders of Ethiopia as well. On the death of Alexander, his vast territories were divided among four generals. After some adjustments three divisions emerged—Egypt under Ptolemy; Asia Minor, Syria, and the East under Seleucus; and Macedonia under Antigonus.</p>
<p>Finally the whole of the Greek area came under the control of the Romans, who moved into Greek areas in 198 <span class="era">BC</span> and over the years established a number of Roman provinces, such as Achaia (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12">Acts 18:12</a>). It was into the world of Hellenism, now under Rome, that the Christians moved with the message of the gospel in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGreeksinPalestine">The Greeks in Palestine</p>
<p class="fl">Excavations have shown that there was contact between Palestine and the Aegean areas over many centuries. From the middle Bronze period (the patriarchal age), middle Minoan II pottery has been found at a number of sites. The Philistines, who formed part of the Sea Peoples in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>, settled in areas of coastal Palestine and developed their own culture there, leaving a great deal of their distinctive pottery. During the period around 1370–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>, various peoples from the Aegean and western Asia Minor found their way to Palestine. Mycenaean pottery has been found in a number of sites. From a later period still, numerous examples of Attic black-figure ware from the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, and Attic red-figure ware from the period around 530–300 <span class="era">BC</span>, have been found in excavations. Silver coins struck in imitation of Attic drachmas come from the same period. With the rise of Hellenism and the occupation of Palestine by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid rulers, Greek influence increased greatly. The presence of Greek pottery, like Rhodian jars, and the influence of Greek architectural features in buildings emphasize the significance of the Greek influence in Palestine as well as throughout the Levant region and the hinterland. With the coming of the Romans, these influences continued. Greek was the language of commerce. Indeed, the NT was written in the Greek of ordinary people, and a wide variety of Greek inscriptions has come to light from Roman times.</p>

  <title>Greek Language</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GREEK LANGUAGE</p>
<p class="fl">Language of the Greek people.</p>
<p>The Greek language is a beautiful, rich, and well-tuned instrument of communication. It is a fitting tool both for vigorous thought and for religious devotion. During its classical period, Greek was the language of one of the world’s greatest cultures. During that cultural period, language, literature, and art flourished more than war. The Greek mind was preoccupied with ideals of beauty. The Greek language reflected artistry in its philosophical dialogues, its poetry, and its stately orations.</p>
<p>The Greek language was also characterized by strength and vigor. It was capable of variety and striking effects. Greek was a language of argument, with a vocabulary and style that could penetrate and clarify phenomena rather than simply tell stories. Classical Greek elaborately developed many forms from a few word roots. Its complex syntax allowed intricate word arrangements to express fine nuances of meaning.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AncientHistory">Ancient History</p>
<p class="fl">Although the antecedents of Greek are obscure, the first traces of what could be called antecedents of ancient Greek appear in Mycenaean and Minoan documents (1400–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>) that use three different scripts: Minoan hieroglyphic (the earliest), linear A, and linear B (the latest). Linear B, generally considered “pre-Greek,” is written in a syllabic script found on clay tablets discovered on the island of Crete and on the Greek mainland.</p>
<p>The Mycenaean civilization and script ended suddenly with the Dorian invasions (1200 <span class="era">BC</span>), and writing seems to have disappeared for several centuries. Later, about the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Greek writing appeared in a different script. That script was based on an alphabet presumably borrowed from the Phoenicians and then adapted to the Greek speech sound system and direction of writing. Greek was first written from right to left, like the West Semitic languages, then in a back-and-forth pattern, finally from left to right. Several dialects appeared during the archaic period (8th to 6th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>): Dorian, Eonian, Achaean, and Aeolic.</p>
<p>During the classical period (5th to 4th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>), Greek culture reached its literary and artistic zenith. Classical (or Attic) Greek was characterized by subtlety of syntax and an expressive use of particles (short, uninflected parts of speech, often untranslatable). As the city of Athens attained cultural and political control, the Attic dialect also gained in prestige. With the Macedonian conquests, Attic Greek, combined with influences from other dialects (especially Ionic), became the international language of the eastern Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HellenismandtheKoineDialect">Hellenism and the Koine Dialect</p>
<p class="fl">The conquests of Alexander the Great encouraged the spread of Greek language and culture. Regional dialects were largely replaced by “Hellenistic” or “koine” (common) Greek. Koine Greek is a dialect preserved and known through thousands of inscriptions reflecting all aspects of daily life. The koine dialect added many vernacular expressions to Attic Greek, thus making it more cosmopolitan. Simplifying the grammar also better adapted it to a worldwide culture. The new language, reflecting simple, popular speech, became the common language of commerce and diplomacy. The Greek language lost much of its elegance and finely shaded nuance as a result of its evolution from classic to koine. Nevertheless, it retained its distinguishing characteristics of strength, beauty, clarity, and logical rhetorical power.</p>
<p>It is significant that the apostle Paul wrote his letter to Christians in Rome in the Greek language rather than in Latin. The Roman Empire of that time was culturally a Greek world, except for governmental transactions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSeptuagint">The Septuagint</p>
<p class="fl">During the centuries immediately before Christ, the eastern Mediterranean had been undergoing not only Hellenization but also Semitization. Both influences can be observed in the Greek translation of the OT.</p>
<p>Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek was an epochal event. The Septuagint (the earliest Greek translation of the OT) later had a strong influence on Christian thought. A necessary consequence of Hebrew writers using the Greek language was that a Greek spirit and Greek forms of thought influenced Jewish culture. The Jews soon appropriated from the rich and refined Greek vocabulary some expressions for ideas that were beyond the scope of Hebrew terminology. Also, old Greek expressions acquired new and extended meanings in this translation of the OT by Greek-speaking Jews.</p>
<p>The Greek OT has been very significant in the development of Christian thought. Often the usage of a Greek word in the Septuagint provides a key to its meaning in the NT. The OT dialect of “Jewish Greek” is at times seen in NT passages translated very literally; at other times, the NT translation of OT texts is very loose.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentGreek">New Testament Greek</p>
<p class="fl">Although most NT authors were Jewish, they wrote in Greek, the universal language of their time. In addition, the apostle John seems to have been acquainted with some Greek philosophy, which influenced his style. John used “word” (Greek <span class="greek">logos</span>) in reference to Christ (<a href="?bref=John.1.1">Jn 1:1</a>), and several other abstract expressions. John may have been influenced by the Egyptian center of Alexandria, where Greek philosophy and Hebrew learning had merged in a unique way.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul also was acquainted with Greek authors (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">Acts 17:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.33">1 Cor 15:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.12">Ti 1:12</a>). Thus, Greek orators and philosophers influenced Paul’s language as well as Hebrew prophets and scholars.</p>
<p>Exactly which dialect of Hebrew or Aramaic Jesus spoke is debated. It is certainly possible that Jesus also spoke Greek. The fact remains that the Gospels were originally written as Greek texts. The records in Greek of Jesus’ teachings and accomplishments prepared the way for the gospel to spread throughout a Greek-speaking culture.</p>
<p>The dignity and restraint of koine Greek used by Christian writers was neither so artificial and pedantic as some classical writings nor so trivial and vulgar as spoken koine.</p>
<p>Greek words took on richer, more spiritual meaning in the context of Scripture. Influenced by the simplicity and rich vividness of Semitic style, the NT was not written in a peculiar “Holy Ghost” language (as some medieval scholars believed) but in koine (common) Greek, largely by Semitic-thinking authors. Tens of thousands of papyri unearthed in Egypt in the early 20th century furnish lexical and grammatical parallels to biblical language, revealing that it was part of the linguistic warp and woof of that era. Yet NT Greek was nevertheless “free,” often creating its own idiom. Christian writers influenced Greek thought by introducing new expressions in order to convey their message about Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">Semitic Influence</p>
<p class="fl">Because NT Greek combines the directness of Hebrew thought with the precision of Greek expression, Greek’s subtle delicacy often interprets Hebrew concepts. The Semitic influence is strongest in the Gospels, the book of Revelation, and the Letter of James. Books like Luke and Hebrews exhibit a more typically Greek style. The NT epistles blend the wisdom of Hebrew and the dialectic philosophy of Greek. Sermons recorded in the NT combine the Hebrew prophetic message with Greek oratorical force.</p>
<p>In addition to direct quotes and allusions from the Septuagint, a pervasive Semitic influence on NT Greek has been noted in many areas. For example, the syntax of NT Greek contains many examples of Semitic style.</p>
<p class="h3">Vocabulary</p>
<p class="fl">The Greek NT vocabulary is abundant and sufficient to convey just the shade of meaning the author desires. For example, the NT uses two different words for “love” (for two kinds of love), two words for “another” (another of the same, or another of a different kind), and several words for various kinds of knowledge. Significantly, some words are omitted, such as <span class="greek">eros</span> (a third kind of love) and other words commonly employed in the Hellenistic culture of that time.</p>
<p>Moreover, Greek words often took on new meanings in the context of the gospel, arising from a combination of new teachings with an exalted morality. The writers did not hesitate to use such words as “life,” “death,” “glory,” and “wrath” in new ways to express new thoughts. Sometimes the literal meaning of a word almost disappears, as when the authors use “water,” “washing,” and “baptism” for Christ’s spiritually purifying power. NT vocabulary also contains words found elsewhere only in the Greek OT, such as “circumcision,” “idolatry,” “anathema,” “diaspora,” and “Pentecost.” Loan words from Hebrew or Aramaic include <span class="greek">alleluia</span> and <span class="greek">amen</span> (Hebrew), and <span class="greek">abba</span><span class="ital">,</span> <span class="greek">mammon</span><span class="ital">,</span> and <span class="greek">corban</span> (Aramaic).</p>
<p>For understanding the meaning of a NT word, then, a lexicon of classical Greek is helpful but not sufficient. One must also know how the word is used in the Greek OT, in Hellenistic writings, and in the inscriptions and documents representing the language of everyday life. Papyrus documents provide many illustrations of the meaning of NT words. For example, the Greek word for “contribution” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1">1 Cor 16:1</a>), at one time thought to be limited to the NT, is commonly used with the same meaning in the papyri. Many Greek words once defined on the basis of classical Greek have been given sharper meaning in the light of their use in the papyri.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TheGreekAlphabet"/>
<p class="h2" id="Grammar">Grammar</p>
<p class="fl">As in other Indo-European languages, the meaning of Greek words is affected by the addition and alteration of various prefixes and suffixes (the process known as inflection). Although its system of inflection is simplified compared to classical Greek, NT Greek is more inflected than are many languages. Greek meaning is thus much less susceptible to ambiguity than English.</p>
<p>In contrast to Hebrew, Greek has a neuter gender as well as masculine and feminine. The many and precise Greek prepositions are subtle, having various meanings depending on their context. NT Greek uses only about half of the particles used in classical Greek.</p>
<p>The Greek verb system, much more complicated than that of Hebrew, is capable of nuances of meaning difficult to express even in English. Each Greek verb has five aspects, which grammarians call tense, mood, voice, person, and number.</p>
<p class="h3">Tense</p>
<p class="fl">Greek verb tense deals primarily with <span class="ital">kind of action</span> rather than <span class="ital">time of action</span> as in English. In Greek there are three basic kinds of action: <span class="ital">durative,</span> expressed by the present, imperfect, and (sometimes) future tenses; <span class="ital">simple</span> or punctiliar, expressed by the aorist and (often) future tenses; and <span class="ital">completed,</span> expressed by the perfect tense (results of past action continue into the present) and pluperfect tense (results are confined to the past).</p>
<p>Greek tenses are often hard to translate into English; the time of action as well as the verb stem’s basic meaning (such as whether it takes an object) must be subtly blended with the kind of action into a single idea.</p>
<p class="h3">Mood</p>
<p class="fl">The mood shows how a verb’s action should be understood. Is the action real? (Use the indicative mood.) Is the action demanded by someone? (Use the imperative mood.) Does the action depend on other conditions? (Use the subjunctive or optative mood.) Is the action basically descriptive of another substantive? (Use a participle.) Is the action basically substantive? (Use an infinitive.) In grammar, a substantive is a word or group of words functioning as a noun; the last two examples are not strictly moods, but they are used that way by grammarians. The moods give a Greek writer a rich choice of verbal expression.</p>
<p class="h3">Voice</p>
<p class="fl">A verb’s voice describes whether action is directed outward (active), inward (middle), or back upon the sentence’s subject (passive).</p>
<p class="h3">Person</p>
<p class="fl">The person of a verb tells who is doing the acting, whether I (first person), you (second person), or another (third person).</p>
<p class="h3">Number</p>
<p class="fl">Verb number shows whether the action is performed by one person (singular) or more than one person (plural).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Style">Style</p>
<p class="fl">The NT contains a variety of writing styles in its use of Greek. The Gospels especially exhibit Semitic features. Matthew uses a style less picturesque than Mark’s and in some respects close to the style of Luke, Acts, Hebrews, James, and 1 Peter. Luke’s style varies from that of both Mark and Matthew; it is elegant. The rather simple style of John contains many Semitisms.</p>
<p>Among the apostle Paul’s letters, differences of style have been noted. The least literary and most direct in expression are his Letters to the Thessalonians. The Pastorals (1—2 Timothy, Titus) have a style nearer to the koine than most of the other epistles—not so Jewish, and not so much influenced by the Septuagint as his other letters.</p>
<p>The Letter to the Hebrews combines elegance with Jewish-Greek style. James’s letter, though high in cultural quality, is not as sensitive in style as Hebrews. Less elegant is 1 Peter, which is strongly influenced by the Septuagint and thus reflects Semitic style.</p>
<p>The Letter of Jude contains elevated, somewhat ponderous diction, and shows the influence of Jewish style. Second Peter, resembling Jude in its high style, is even more influenced by the Septuagint.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation has a generally simple style but shows considerable Semitic influence in its use of parallelism and redundancy. Linguistic scholars have identified a number of apparent grammatical mistakes in the Greek of Revelation.</p>

<p class="h1">GRIEF</p>
<p class="fl">Emotional suffering brought on by bereavement, mishap, or disaster. To grieve is either to cause or feel sorrow or distress. The concept is found in the Scriptures under a variety of circumstances. Isaac and Rebekah experienced grief when their son Esau married a Hittite woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.35">Gn 26:35</a>). God mourned the misery of Israel brought upon them by disobedience (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.16">Jgs 10:16</a>). Because she had no son, Hannah was sad—so much so that she appeared to be drunk while praying (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.16">1 Sm 1:16</a>). Similarly, Samuel, distraught at King Saul’s disobedience, prayed all night. Job was exceedingly sorrowful over his personal loss (<a href="?bref=Job.2.13">Jb 2:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Job.6.2">6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.16.6">16:6</a>), and the psalmist poetically demonstrated distress and sorrow (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.7">Pss 6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.31.9-10">31:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.26">69:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.21">73:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.95.10">95:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.10">112:10</a>). The book of Lamentations is devoted to the expression of grief, and the prophets in general speak of judgment because Israel had grieved a holy God.</p>
<p>Jesus experienced sorrow and distress (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.5">Mk 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.33">Jn 11:33</a>), including crying over the death of a friend (<a href="?bref=John.11.35">Jn 11:35</a>). The Jews are said to have been grieved as the apostles taught about Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.2">Acts 4:2</a>). The apostle Paul instructed believers not to grieve one another (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.15">Rom 14:15</a>) and did not want to cause any sorrow himself (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.1-5">2 Cor 2:1-5</a>). Most of all, the believer is not to grieve the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.30">Eph 4:30</a>). A believer may, of course, experience grief and suffering in an alien world (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.19">1 Pt 2:19</a>). In Bible times grief was given particular expression at a time of death by means of shrieks, wails, and laments (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.17-18">Jer 9:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.16">Am 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.38">Mk 5:38</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">GROVE*</p>
<p class="fl">Mistaken <span class="sc">kjv</span> translation of a Hebrew word that was the name of a Canaanite goddess, Asherah. Often sacred trees were designated as symbols of that fertility goddess; sometimes wooden poles were erected. God commanded the Israelites to destroy those symbols (called “Asherim,” “Asheroth”) by cutting them down (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.13">Ex 34:13</a>) and burning them (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.3">Dt 12:3</a>). Because the poles were wooden, archaeologists have been unable to find any clear remains. In an early sanctuary at Ai, however, a large piece of carbonized wood was discovered lying between incense burners. It may have been a tree trunk from which the branches had been trimmed. Some researchers suggest it was an Asherah pole.</p>
<p>God strictly forbade the Israelites to worship Asherah or to erect sacred symbols in her honor. From time to time Israel disobeyed God and engaged in false worship. One account of the downfall of the northern kingdom attributes its failure to the existence of groves and the worship of the pagan goddess and her male counterpart, Baal (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.7-18">2 Kgs 17:7-18</a>). Jezebel, a priestess of the Tyrian Baal, promoted the spread of such idolatry. The “grove” of <a href="?bref=Gen.21.33">Genesis 21:33</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) was actually a tamarisk tree.</p>

  <title>Gymnasium*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">GYMNASIUM*</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient Greek institution devoted to physical education and intellectual development. By the Hellenistic period, gymnasiums had become centers for the propagation of Greek culture. Students received not only physical training but intellectual and social training also. Gymnasiums were privately owned and organized for children of wealthy families. Attendance was mandatory for Greek youths who wanted to gain citizenship in a particular city.</p>
<p>While under the control of the Ptolemies, a Macedonian dynasty, the city of Jerusalem did not have a gymnasium. At the time of the Seleucids, a Syrian dynasty concerned to Hellenize their subjects, the high priest bribed the ruler, Antiochus IV, in order to receive permission to build a gymnasium in Jerusalem (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.13-15">1 Macc 1:13-15</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.9">2 Macc 4:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg).</p>
<p>The activities and practices of the gymnasium were abhorrent to conservative Jews because Jewish children educated there began to think and dress according to Hellenistic norms. The Greek practice of participating in athletic events in the nude was particularly upsetting to devout Jews. Many youths were removing the sign of their circumcision to enter the games (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.13-15">1 Macc 1:13-15</a>).</p>
<p>Alexandrian Jews were not so opposed to the gymnasium as Jews in Jerusalem, but the Greek population there was disturbed by the attendance of non-Greeks such as Egyptians and Jews. Roman policy made the graduates of the gymnasium Greek citizens, enabling them to participate in local government.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul and most early Christians seemingly did not have the same resentment toward gymnasiums as did the Jews in Jerusalem. Paul often described the Christian life in the language of athletic events that took place there (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.24-27">1 Cor 9:24-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.2">Gal 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.7">5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.30">Phil 1:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.16">2:16</a>).</p>
