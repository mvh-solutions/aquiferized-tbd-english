# What Has Changed In the “KingdomofGodKingdomofHeaven” Article

## Major changes 
The following sentence only concerned English speakers:
> _This fact is obscured in the kjv, which translates the word for “age” by “world.”_

It was therefore reworded as such:
> _This fact is obscured in translations which use the word “world” instead of “age.”_

&nbsp;

The following Bible verse has been changed from one English translation to another, in an attempt to make it easier to translate into other languages:
