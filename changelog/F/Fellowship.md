# What Has Changed In the “Fellowship” Article

## Major changes
Some words and senteces were changed because they seemed too complicated to the general understanding of the target audience.


The expression 'to make abode' was replaced by 'to reside' (line 8):
  As a result of Christ's finished work on the cross, God now makes his permanent abode in each believers heart.
   --> As a result of Christ's finished work on the cross, God now resides permanently in the heart of every believer.
