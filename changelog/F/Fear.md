# What Has Changed In the “Fear” Article

## Major changes
Some words and senteces were simplified for the better understanding of the target audience.

The verb 'to recoil' has been changed by 'to step back' (line 7):
   Adam and Eve recoiled from the presence of the holy God...
   --> Adam and Eve stepped back from the presence of the holy God...

The word 'sternly' was replaced by 'severely' and to word 'incur' by 'cause' (line 7):
    Their fear was entirely reasonable because they had been sternly warned that disobedience would incur a grave judgment.
    --> Their fear was entirely reasonable because they had been severely warned that disobedience would cause a grave judgment.

The word 'unwarranted' was changed by 'unjustified' (line 10):
    Unwarranted fear may harm the efforts of the people of God.
    --> Unjustified fear may harm the efforts of the people of God.
