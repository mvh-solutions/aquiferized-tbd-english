# What Has Changed In the “ArkoftheCovenant” Article

## Major changes
Some words and sentences were changed because they seemed too complicated to the general understanding of the target audience.

The word 'erect' has been replaced by 'build' : 
- Solomon erected a magnificent temple with a place for the ark in the most holy part, behind the curtains.
 --> Solomon built a magnificent temple with a place for the ark in the most holy part, behind the curtains.
