# What Has Changed In the “ChurchMeetings” Article

## Major changes
Several words and sentences were changed because they seemed too complicated to the general understanding of the target audience.

- "Assembling together" was replaced by "gathering":
  - The assembling together of the believers --> The gathering of believers.
  - to designate the people who participate in such assembling together – whether they are actually assembled or not. --> to designate the people who participate  in such gathering – whether they are actually gathered or not.
  - When all the church assembled together to worship God, it should be a display of spiritual unity. --> When all the church gathered to worship God, it should   be a display of spiritual unity.



## Other changes
- The following paragraph was deleted, because it seemed irrelevant to the understanding of the article by the target audience:
 "There is much to be said about how interpreters have confused the local church with the universal church, but this article is devoted to clearing up the confusion about what constitutes the smallest unit of the church—the local church, or what could be called the house church or home gathering."
