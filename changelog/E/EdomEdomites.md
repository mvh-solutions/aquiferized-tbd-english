# What Has Changed In the “EdomEdomites” Article

## Major changes
Some words and senteces were changed because they seemed too complicated to the general understanding of the target audience.

The verb 'to skirt' was replaced by 'walk along', so the target audience can immediatly understand the sentence:
     The Israelites skirted Edom on their journey to the Promised Land.
	 --> The Israelites walked along Edom on their journey to the Promised Land.
