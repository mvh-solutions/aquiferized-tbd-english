# What Has Changed In the “JesusChristTeachingsof” Article

## Major changes 
The following sentence was difficult to simplify:
> _Jewish apocalyptic literature (…)_

It was therefore extrapolated as such:
> _Jewish apocalyptic literature (i.e., a prophetic-like style – …)_

The following other sentences were dropped usually because they seemed unnecessary to the general understanding of the article:
- Some have maintained that he ended his life in disillusionment, but a brief survey of his teaching about his own destiny is sufficient to dispel such a theory.
- the further question, “What meaning did Jesus attach to his forthcoming death?”


&nbsp;

The following Bible verse has been changed from one English translation to another, in an attempt to make it easier to translate into other languages:

| Scripture reference | Original translation | Replacement translation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matthew 6:9 | ASV | WEB |

## Other
85 changes were made meant to simplify the text without changing its meaning.
