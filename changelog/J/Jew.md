# What Has Changed In the “Jew” Article

## Major changes
Some words or sentences were changed because they seemed too complicated to the general understanding of the target audience.

The word 'proselytes' occurs twice in this article. The term was kept, but I added an explanation at the first occurrence of the word in case the taget audience isn't familiar with it:
- Esther 8:17 speaks of Gentiles declaring themselves Jews in the religious sense of becoming proselytes.
 --> Esther 8:17 speaks of Gentiles declaring themselves Jews in the religious sense of becoming proselytes (people who have converted).
