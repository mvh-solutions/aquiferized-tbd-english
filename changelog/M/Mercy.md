# What Has Changed In the “Mercy” Article

## Major changes
Some words and sentences were changed becaus they seemed too complicated to the understanding of the target audience.


The word 'wayward' was replaced by 'rebellious': 
(line 8) God persistently puts up with his disobedient and wayward people…
     --> God persistently puts up with his disobedient and rebellious people…
(line 8) …a yearning heart of compassion upon his rebellious and wayward people.
     --> …a yearning heart of compassion upon his rebellious people.
	 
The verb 'to bestow on' was replaced by 'to give to':
(line 11) …he bestows on those who believe in his Son.
      --> …he gives to those who believe in his Son.
