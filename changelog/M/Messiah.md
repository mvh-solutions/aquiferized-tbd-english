# What Has Changed In the “Messiah” Article

## Major changes
The following sentences were dropped usually because they seemed unnecessary to the general understanding of the article:
- Concluding the 13 articles of Hebraic faith attributed to Moses Maimonides (13th century AD) is the statement still found in many Hebrew prayer books: “I believe with a perfect heart that the Messiah will come; and although his coming be delayed, I will still wait patiently for his speedy appearance.”
- At one time the rabbis applied no less than 456 passages of Scripture to his person and salvation. Preoccupation with the Messiah is evident in the tractate Sanhedrin (Babylonian Talmud), where passages state that the world was created for him and that all the prophets prophesied of his days (Sanhedrin 98b, 99a).
- Jewish scholars of the early Christian era in the Aramaic Targum on the prophets paraphrase Isaiah 42:1, “Behold my Servant Messiah” and begin Isaiah 53, “Behold my Servant Messiah will prosper.”
