# What Has Changed In the “Baptism” Article

## Major changes
Some words and sentences were changed because they seemed too complicated to the general understanding of the target audienc.

The word 'genesis' was replaced with 'origin' :
The genesis of his baptism may be found in the prophetic acted-out parable, which not only symbolized God’s message but also intended to bring it about.
 --> The origin of his baptism may be found in the prophetic acted-out parable, which not only symbolized God’s message but also intended to make it a reality.
 This event has its genesis in a complex interplay of motives, divine and human, within the messianic consciousness of Jesus.
 --> This event has its origin in a complex interplay of motives, both divine and human, within the messianic consciousness of Jesus.

I decided to delete part of the last paragraph, because it seemed irrelevant for the understanding of the word. This risks making things unnecessarily complicated for the target audience.
