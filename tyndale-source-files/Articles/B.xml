  <title>Baal (Idol)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BAAL (I<span class="lc">dol</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Name of the most prominent Canaanite deity. As the god of fertility in the Canaanite pantheon (roster of gods), Baal’s sphere of influence included agriculture, animal husbandry, and human sexuality. The word Baal occurs in the OT in combination with other terms, such as place-names (Baal-peor, <a href="?bref=Hos.9.10">Hos 9:10</a>; Baal-hermon, <a href="?bref=Judg.3.3">Jgs 3:3</a>), or with other adjuncts as in Baal-berith (Baal of the covenant, <a href="?bref=Judg.8.33">Jgs 8:33</a>). Use of the name in connection with a local place-name may indicate a local cult of Baal worship.</p>
<p>Baal worship became prominent in the northern kingdom of Israel during the days of King Ahab (ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>) when he married Jezebel of Tyre, a city in Phoenicia (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.29-33">1 Kgs 16:29-33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.19-40">18:19-40</a>). It later infiltrated the kingdom of Judah when Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, married King Jehoram of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.17-18,24-26">2 Kgs 8:17-18, 24-26</a>). Places for worship of Baal were often high places in the hills consisting of an altar and a sacred tree, stone, or pillar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.5">2 Kgs 23:5</a>). The predominantly urban Phoenicians built temples to Baal; while Athaliah was queen of Judah, even Jerusalem had one (<a href="?bref=2Chr.23.12-17">2 Chr 23:12-17</a>).</p>
<p>In the Ugaritic epic material, Baal is pictured as descending into the netherworld, the domain of the god Mot. That descent was evidently part of a cycle intended to coincide with the cycle of seasons. In order to bring Baal up from the realm of Mot and thus ensure initiation of the fertile rainy season, the Canaanites engaged in orgiastic worship that included human sacrifice as well as sexual rites (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.31">Jer 7:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.19.4-6">19:4-6</a>). Sacred prostitutes evidently participated in the autumnal religious ritual. The worship of Baal was strongly condemned in the OT (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.12-14">Jgs 2:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.3.7-8">3:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.19.1-15">Jer 19</a>).</p>

<p>Identification of Baal-zebub (which means “lord of the flies”) is somewhat uncertain. The god may have been thought to give oracles by the flight or buzzing of a fly, or may have protected his worshipers from plagues of flies. Excavations at Philistine sites have uncovered golden images of flies. Most scholars believe that the name is a corruption of Baal-zebul (“Baal the prince”). The distortion was probably a deliberate effort to demean the god.</p>

Elsewhere it is translated “Babylonia” or “Babylon” (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24">2 Kgs 17:24</a>). The rendering “Babel” in the Genesis passages is intended to relate the name to the early cultural setting reflected by <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">Genesis 11:1-9</a>, especially to the attempt to build a “tower.” The translation “Babel” is also intended to associate the Tower of Babel incident with the popular understanding that Babel is derived from a root meaning “to confuse” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.11.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations have provided information about the building of towers for temples called ziggurats. The excavation of a number of such towers has made it clear they were structures consisting of several platforms, each of lesser dimensions than the one immediately below it. The top platform served as the location for a small temple dedicated to the particular deity of the builder or of the city in which it was built.</p>
<p>The first ziggurat at Babylon was built by Shar-kali-sharri, king of Akkad in the latter part of the 23d century <span class="era">BC</span>. Archaeologists understand that this ziggurat was destroyed and rebuilt several times across the centuries. It apparently lay in ruins from sometime around 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> to around 1830 <span class="era">BC</span>, at which time a forebear of Hammurabi (1728–1636 <span class="era">BC</span>) founded or rebuilt the city named Bab-ilu, or Babel.</p>
<p>The Babylonian Creation Epic gives details concerning the construction of a “celestial city” as the proper abode of Marduk. It was with this theological understanding that the name Babel, “gate of god,” was a significant term. Other terminology associated with the temple built for Marduk and with the ziggurat suggests that Babel, for the early Babylonians, was the on-earth entrance into the heavenly or celestial realm.</p>
<p>Jewish and Arab traditions associate the Tower of Babel of Genesis with a large temple ruin dedicated originally to Nabu in the city of Borsippa, or Birs-Nimrod.</p>

<p class="h1">BABYLON, BABYLONIA</p>
<p class="fl">Land of southern Mesopotamia. Politically, Babylonia refers to the ancient kingdoms that flourished in southern Mesopotamia, especially in the seventh and sixth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, whose capital city was Babylon (or <span class="ital">Bab-ilu,</span> meaning “gate of god”). The term can also be used geographically to designate a whole region (in present-day southeast Iraq). The adjective “Babylonian” has an even looser meaning; it may refer to the land or its inhabitants, to the kingdom or its subjects, or to a dialect of one of the principal ancient Mesopotamian languages.</p>
<p>The two principal features of Babylonia’s geography are the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Rising in mountainous eastern Turkey, they initially flow in opposite directions but converge near Baghdad and join farther south to flow into the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Politically, Babylonia largely corresponded to geographic Babylonia. Its centers, however, were not situated in the fertile alluvial plain between the two rivers, but rather on the banks along the main course and several side branches of the Euphrates. At times the kingdom reached eastward beyond the Tigris, into the flatlands and foothills of the Zagros Mountains, generally along the Tigris’s eastern tributaries.</p>

The earliest interpretable inscriptions from Babylonia, dated at 3100 <span class="era">BC</span>, are in Sumerian, which was the written language throughout Mesopotamia for seven centuries. In fact, cuneiform, the wedge-shaped writing invented by the Sumerians, remained in use for almost 3,000 years.</p>
<p>Eventually the Akkadian way of life began to compete with the Sumerian. Political and cultural leadership was effectively wrested away from the south by Sargon I (<span class="ital">Sharru-kin,</span> meaning “true king”; 2339–2279 <span class="era">BC</span>), who founded the capital Akkad (or Agade).</p>
<p>The Akkadian Empire, which lasted for nearly two centuries under Sargon and his successors (2334–2154 <span class="era">BC</span>), was disrupted by the invasion of the Guti people, mountaineers from the east, who in turn were defeated by the Sumerian king Utuhegal of the city of Uruk. That event marked a period of revival of Sumerian power and culture in Babylonia, led by a dynasty of kings that established itself in the once-prominent Sumerian city of Ur.</p>
<p class="h3">First Babylonian Kingdom: 1900–1600 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="fl">At the same time, Semitic-speaking people from the west—the Amurru (or Martu), nomads from Syria—were exerting migratory and military pressures on Babylonia.</p>
<p>The Amurru—called by modern researchers “Amorites” after their language—were known in the pre-Sargonid period (before 2340 <span class="era">BC</span>) and were looked upon as barbarians by native Babylonians, who scorned their manner of life. During the reign of Shar-kali-sharri (2254–2230 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Amorites began to appear as a menace. A century later, during the early part of the Ur III period, the first major wave of Amorites moved into Babylonia; the second wave came during the reigns of the last two kings of the Ur III dynasty. That second migration coincided with a complex political situation in Babylonia. The undermining of Sumerian political power gave rise to the kingdom of Babylon under Amorite control.</p>
<p>The last Neo-Sumerian king, Ibbi-Sin, was faced with military threats to his kingdom from both east and west. He also had to deal with internal rebellion. Ishbi-Erra, vassal governor of the city of Mari, 500 miles (804.5 kilometers) up the Euphrates, took advantage of the Amorite incursions to revolt against the king and establish a rival kingdom with its capital at Isin, 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) from Ur. At the same time, in Larsa, less than 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) across the Euphrates from Ur, another new dynasty was established by a ruler with an Amorite name.</p>
<p>The founder of the first dynasty of the kingdom of Babylon was Sumuabum (1894–1881 <span class="era">BC</span>). Little is known about him. He and his next four successors, all legitimate descendants—Sumulael (1880–1845 <span class="era">BC</span>), Sabium (1844–1831 <span class="era">BC</span>), Apil-Sin (1830–1813 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Sin-Muballit (1812–1793 <span class="era">BC</span>)—ruled peacefully and uneventfully for a century. They appear to have devoted themselves mainly to religious and defensive construction and to maintenance of an irrigation canal system, though there is some evidence of conquest and territorial acquisition. Still, the territory of the kingdom of Babylon probably extended no more than 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) in any direction from the capital. Hammurabi, the sixth king of that line (1792–1750 <span class="era">BC</span>), enlarged the kingdom toward the dimensions of an empire. At its greatest extent it reached from the Persian Gulf up the Tigris to include some of the cities of Assyria and up the Euphrates to Mari. Babylonia’s glory, however, was short-lived; under the reign of Hammurabi’s son Samsu-iluna (1749–1712 <span class="era">BC</span>) the realm shriveled. It lasted for another century, but within borders narrower than those established by Sumuabum. Minor dynasties took turns ruling over the area from 1600–900 <span class="era">BC</span>. Then the Assyrians took control.</p>
<p class="h3">Assyrian Domination: 900–614 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="fl">The earliest incursions of Assyria into Babylonia were by Shalmaneser III. In 851 <span class="era">BC</span> the brother of Marduk-zakir-shumi, reigning king of the eighth dynasty of Babylon, made a bid for the throne with the backing of the Arameans. Marduk-zakir-shumi called on the Assyrians for aid. Shalmaneser defeated the rebels and entered Babylon, treating the ancient city and its inhabitants with great respect. Thereafter, advancing southward, he came to Sumer, inhabited by the Chaldeans, and pressed them back against the gulf. For whatever reasons, Shalmaneser did not annex Babylonia. Marduk-zakir-shumi remained on the throne, though he swore allegiance to the Assyrian king.</p>
<p>The final years of Shalmaneser III were darkened by revolts all over the Assyrian Empire. Two strong rulers emerged from the political confusion. In Assyria, Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) usurped the throne. In Babylonia three years earlier a Chaldean, Nabonassar (747–734 <span class="era">BC</span>), took the throne of Babylon as a successor king in the eighth dynasty.</p>
<p>At Nabonassar’s death, an Aramean chieftain, Nabu-mukin-zeri (731–729 <span class="era">BC</span>), seized the Babylonian throne and established the ninth dynasty of Babylon. Tiglath-pileser defeated the usurper, ravaged the territory of his tribe, and had himself proclaimed king of Babylon—and thus, of Babylonia—under the name of Pulu (729–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) and as the second king of the ninth dynasty. Little is known of his short-lived successor, Shalmaneser V (727–722 <span class="era">BC</span>). He, too, was proclaimed king of Babylon as well as of Assyria. Under Shalmaneser a siege against the kingdom of Israel began, after its king, Hoshea (732–723 <span class="era">BC</span>), rebelled against Assyria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-6">2 Kgs 17:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Merodach-baladan</p>
<p class="fl">Sargon II (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>) succeeded Shalmaneser. His rise to power is obscure; he was probably a usurper, which is why he chose the name Sargon (“true king”) like his Akkadian namesake 1,500 years earlier. Shortly before Sargon II came to the throne, Elam in the east had begun to take an active part in the affairs of Babylonia by instigating rebellions against Assyria.</p>
<p>After the brilliant successes of his other campaigns, Sargon attacked Babylon again in 710 <span class="era">BC</span>, and this time succeeded in taking it. Although he had himself proclaimed king of Babylon, he acknowledged Merodach-baladan as king of the Yakin tribe. Merodach-baladan evidently took up residence in Elam at that time. In the year that Sargon’s son Sennacherib (705–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) succeeded to the Assyrian throne, Merodach-baladan, assisted by Elamite officers and troops, reappeared. He raised the whole Aramean and Chaldean population of Babylonia against the Assyrians, took Babylon, and had himself proclaimed king again (705 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>During that brief period, Merodach-baladan sent an embassy to King Hezekiah of Judah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>) “with letters and a present,” ostensibly to show sympathy for Hezekiah because of the king’s illness (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12">2 Kgs 20:12</a>). More likely, Merodach-baladan’s purpose was to secure another ally against Assyrian hegemony; the account of Hezekiah’s cordial reception of the Babylonian envoys shows his willingness to join the alliance. Evidently the king’s vanity overruled his political sense, and he treated the Babylonians to an extensive tour of his treasury. The proud gesture was rebuked by the prophet Isaiah, who predicted Babylonia’s later conquest of Judah, when the king’s storehouse would be sacked and his family carried off captive (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.13-19">2 Kgs 20:13-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-8">Is 39</a>).</p>
<p>Sennacherib was able to quickly dislodge Merodach-baladan from the Babylonian throne, force him into exile, and replace him with a king of his own choice, Bel-ibni.</p>
<p class="h4">War and Peace</p>
<p class="fl">Sennacherib’s successor and youngest son, Esarhaddon (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>), came to the throne of Assyria after a bloody war of succession with his brothers. One of his first acts was to rebuild and enlarge the city of Babylon. Esarhaddon thus won the friendship of many of his Babylonian subjects, who enabled him to enjoy a peaceful reign in that part of his empire. Three years before his death, Esarhaddon named his son Ashurbanipal as his successor (669–627 <span class="era">BC</span>), and another son, Shamash-shum-ukin (668–648 <span class="era">BC</span>), as viceroy in Babylonia.</p>
<p>The empire was not divided by having two sons on two thrones. Ashurbanipal had precedence over his brother, bearing responsibility for the whole empire. Shamash-shum-ukin and his Babylonian subjects, on the other hand, enjoyed sovereignty; as viceroy, he was granted full authority within his realm. That arrangement lasted for 17 years until Shamash-shum-ukin, backed by the Elamites and numerous Arab tribes, rebelled against Ashurbanipal. The revolt was brutally suppressed by 648 <span class="era">BC</span>, and a Chaldean noble, Kandalanu, was appointed Babylonian viceroy. Shortly afterward, Ashurbanipal launched a punitive expedition, devastating Babylonia and completely destroying Elam in the process.</p>
<p class="h2">Neo-Babylonian Empire: 614–539 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="fl">Both Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu, his viceroy in Babylon, died in 627 <span class="era">BC</span>. For a year, Babylonia had no recognized ruler. Then the throne was seized by the Chaldean prince Nabopolassar (625–605 <span class="era">BC</span>), who established the 10th dynasty of Babylon, which has come to be called the Chaldean or Neo-Babylonian dynasty.</p>
<p>Aided by Media, the kingdom of the Iranian Plateau, Nabopolassar put an end to the Assyrian Empire. By 612 <span class="era">BC</span> Assyria’s chief cities had fallen: Asshur, then the religious center; Nineveh, the administrative center; and Nimrod, the military headquarters. The last light of Assyria was snuffed out by Nabopolassar in 609 <span class="era">BC</span>. Under his son Nebuchadnezzar II (604–562 <span class="era">BC</span>), Babylonia fell heir to the Assyrian Empire. For a moment in history, Babylonia was master of the whole Near East. Nebuchadnezzar brought about the end of the Hebrew kingdom of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, deporting part of its population to Babylonia in the event referred to as the exile (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-25.21">2 Kgs 24:1–25:21</a>).</p>
<p>Under Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon became the fabled city of luxury and splendor with which its name is commonly associated. Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his son, son-in-law, and grandson within the space of six years. Thereafter, one of his high diplomatic officials, Nabonidus, took the throne (555–539 <span class="era">BC</span>). During his reign, the Medes, formerly allies of the Chaldeans, came under a new ruler, Cyrus II of Persia (559 <span class="era">BC</span>), who over the next 10 years conquered an empire nearly 3,000 miles (4,827 kilometers) in extent, from the Aegean Sea to the Pamirs (mountains in central Asia).</p>
<p>During Cyrus’s decade of conquest, Nabonidus was strangely absent from Babylon, residing in Arabia. Although the book of Daniel relates events occurring in the court of Babylon during Nabonidus’s reign, his name is never mentioned. Instead, Belshazzar, whom Nabonidus appointed regent in Babylon during his absence, is described as king (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.1">Dn 5:1</a>). Perhaps because of his extended absence or perhaps because of his attachment to the moon god Sin and Sin’s city, Haran, rather than to the Babylonian national god Marduk and Marduk’s city, Babylon, Nabonidus lost the support of the Babylonians. When he finally returned to Babylon, it was on the eve of Cyrus’s attack on the city (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.30-31">Dn 5:30-31</a>). Instead of offering resistance, however, the Babylonian army defected to Cyrus and the city gave itself up without a battle (October 539 <span class="era">BC</span>). That surrender ended the Chaldean dynasty and the history of an independent Babylonia.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheExcavationOfNebuchadnezzarSBabylon"/>
<p>The Babylon of Nebuchadnezzar’s time appears frequently at the end of 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles and in the early part of Daniel. Ezra and Nehemiah record the subsequent return of the remnant of Judah from their Babylonian exile.</p>
<p>Among the prophetic books, Isaiah speaks of Babylon during the period of Assyrian dominance. A century later Jeremiah warns of the threat of Nebuchadnezzar, and Ezekiel and Daniel speak of Babylon from the later viewpoint of those exiled. There are as many references to Babylon in the last half of Jeremiah as in all the rest of the Bible.</p>

<p class="fl">Phrase in <a href="?bref=Ps.84.6">Psalm 84:6</a> often translated “valley of weeping.” The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">baca</span> refers to some kind of tree in <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.23-24">2 Samuel 5:23-24</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.14-15">1 Chronicles 14:14-15</a>, where it is translated mulberry (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), aspen, or balsam.

<p>Some scholars think the valley was a specific place located near Jerusalem and the valley of Rephaim. If so, it could have been associated with weeping because (1) balsam or other trees in the valley exuded resinous gum, like tears; (2) the path was difficult to follow; or (3) it was a dreary place where waters seeped out of “weeping” rocks.</p>

  <title>Bacchides</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BACCHIDES</p>
<p class="fl">Syrian general, governor of the Seleucid territories west of the Euphrates River. The area included Judea, which brought him into contact with five famous men of the intertestamental period: Demetrius I, ruler of the Seleucid kingdom (c. 160–150 <span class="era">BC</span>); Alcimus (Hellenized name of Jakim or Eliakim), puppet high priest (c. 162–158 <span class="era">BC</span>); and Judas, Jonathan, and Simon, the three brothers who ruled Judea in 165–160, 160–143, and 143–135 <span class="era">BC</span>, respectively. Their stories are told in 1 Maccabees.</p>
<p>Bacchides was supported by Demetrius, with whom the story begins. When Antiochus IV Epiphanes died in 163 <span class="era">BC</span>, Demetrius, a hostage in Rome at the time, asked the Roman Senate for permission to claim the throne. When permission was denied, Demetrius fled from Rome, and in a series of successful campaigns (161–160 <span class="era">BC</span>) secured the throne. He then tried to crush the Maccabean secessionists in Judea also. Victorious, he styled himself Demetrius I Soter, meaning “savior.”</p>
<p>Alcimus, a descendant of the OT priest Aaron, suggested to Demetrius that the Jews could be united in opposition to Judas Maccabeus if Alcimus were appointed high priest in Jerusalem. Demetrius I agreed and sent his friend Bacchides to install Alcimus in that important office.</p>
<p>Bacchides made three campaigns into Judea in his efforts to carry out his charge. The first campaign (162–161 <span class="era">BC</span>) met with partial success. Some pious Jews, known as the Hasidim, supported a legitimate Aaronic priest until Bacchides and Alcimus treacherously broke their word and slaughtered 60 Hasidim leaders (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.18-20">1 Macc 7:18-20</a>). That act united Judea behind Judas Maccabeus. Not realizing this, however, Bacchides left Alcimus and an army behind and returned to Syria.</p>
<p>Two months later (161 <span class="era">BC</span>) Bacchides returned with 20,000 infantry soldiers and 2,000 cavalrymen, meeting the courageous Judas (who had only 800 men left) in a desperate battle near Elasa (160 <span class="era">BC</span>). In that battle Judas was killed (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.18">1 Macc 9:18</a>), and Jonathan and Simon, his brothers, fled into the southern mountains. Bacchides pursued Jonathan, met him in an indecisive battle, and then retreated to Jerusalem. Again, he returned to Syria, leaving an army, the Jewish Hellenists, and Alcimus in charge (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.52-57">1 Macc 9:52-57</a>).</p>
<p>That arrangement lasted two years. Bacchides undertook one final Judean campaign (158 <span class="era">BC</span>). This time disaster dogged him. Alcimus died of a stroke, and Bacchides began to suspect that further support of the Jewish Hellenists was unwise. Sensing his indecision, Jonathan offered a truce and exchange of prisoners. Bacchides accepted that as the most dignified way to withdraw, and returned to Syria, leaving Jonathan in effective control of Judea (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.72">1 Macc 9:72</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BACKSLIDING</p>
<p class="fl">To wane in religious commitment, to become less arduous in piety or less upright in morals. The principal Hebrew word for backsliding means “turning back” or “turning away.” The people of Israel repeatedly turned from God and engaged in the sin and idolatry of their pagan neighbors. In the language of the OT, backsliding Israel lusted after abominations and forsook the Lord and his commandments (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.10">Ezr 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.4">Is 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.21">Ez 11:21</a>). They violated the sacred covenant by worshiping idols and practicing harlotry (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.10">Ps 78:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.11">Jer 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.10">Hos 4:10</a>). The people forgot God’s mighty works on their behalf, ignored his counsel, and rejected his instruction (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.11">Pss 78:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.107.11">107:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.9">Is 30:9</a>). Hard-hearted and rebellious, they delighted themselves in all sorts of perversions (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.21">Jer 3:21</a>). Religious leaders entrusted with the spiritual care of the nation were instrumental in leading the people astray (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.16">Is 9:16</a>). The priests proved themselves faithless shepherds (<a href="?bref=Jer.50.6">Jer 50:6</a>).</p>
<p>Grieved by the spiritual defection of his chosen people, God declared that “backsliding Israel committed adultery” (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.8">Jer 3:8</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Through Hosea, the Lord lamented the fact that “Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer” (<a href="?bref=Hos.4.16">Hos 4:16</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Jeremiah confessed, “Our backslidings are many, we have sinned against thee” (<a href="?bref=Jer.14.7">Jer 14:7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

  <title>Balaam</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BALAAM</p>
<p class="fl">Beor’s son, a prophet or soothsayer from northern Mesopotamia who was hired by a Moabite king, Balak, to curse the Israelites who had arrived at the Jordan Valley opposite Jericho after 40 years of wandering in the wilderness. Israel’s defeat of the Amorites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-25">Nm 21:21-25</a>) had instilled fear in the heart of the Moabite king (<a href="?bref=Num.22.3">22:3</a>). Because curses and blessings were considered irrevocable (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.34-38">Gn 27:34-38</a>), Balak reasoned that if he could hire a prophet to curse the Israelites in the name of their own God, Yahweh, he could easily defeat them in battle and drive them away from his borders. Balak sent messengers to Pethor, where Balaam lived. The town is believed to be located near Haran along the Habur River, a tributary of the Euphrates. Balak offered Balaam an impressive sum to come down and curse the Israelites.</p>
<p>Balaam, however, was warned by the Lord that he should not go to Moab. The king of Moab would not accept Balaam’s refusal and sent his royal messengers back with offers of greater wealth and honor. Balaam revealed an inner lust for wealth and position by returning to the Lord to ask whether he should go. His words to the messengers, however, were very pious: “Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> my God, to do less or more” (<a href="?bref=Num.22.18">Nm 22:18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Although Balaam would do only what the Lord allowed, he became a prime example of someone who does the right thing for the wrong reason.</p>
<p>Balak had sent along with his messengers “the fees for divination” (<a href="?bref=Num.22.7">Nm 22:7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), which shows that he considered Balaam a diviner of the type pagan nations commonly used. The Israelites were forbidden by the Lord to consult diviners or practice divination (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.10-11">Dt 18:10-11</a>). A true prophet would not have even considered the possibility that serving Balak might be right. God’s final permission to let Balaam go, with the stipulation that he say only what God told him, was the Lord’s way of frustrating Balak’s cause and showing God’s care for his chosen people.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="KeyPlacesintheStoryofBalaam"/>
<p>Although he gave his permission, God was angry that Balaam went (<a href="?bref=Num.22.22">Nm 22:22</a>). So the Lord placed an angel with a drawn sword in Balaam’s path. His donkey could see the angel but Balaam could not. Not knowing why the donkey balked, Balaam beat her, and she was then miraculously given a voice to complain against his cruelty (vv <a href="?bref=Num.22.28-30">28-30</a>).</p>
<p>On the surface the story in <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-41">Numbers 22</a> presents Balaam as a man who simply did what the Lord allowed him to do. But <a href="?bref=Deut.23.5">Deuteronomy 23:5</a> states that the Lord would not listen to Balaam and turned his intended curse into a blessing. When the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, he saw the angel and fell flat on his face (<a href="?bref=Num.22.31">Nm 22:31</a>). Then he acknowledged his sin and proceeded to say only what the Lord put in his mouth. Balaam’s poems in <a href="?bref=Num.23.1-30">Numbers 23</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.24.1-25">24</a> are in an archaic form of Hebrew that witnesses to their authenticity. They sometimes describe God’s past blessing on his people, and at other points predict his future blessing of Israel in a unique way.</p>
<p>Only blessings on Israel and never a single word of a curse were spoken by Balaam. The infuriated Moabite king took Balaam from one vantage point to another where they could look out over the Jordan Valley and see the Israelite encampment. When Balaam still did not curse them, Balak slapped his hands together in anger and packed the prophet off without any reward at all. But that was by no means the end of Balak’s attempt to weaken Israel.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">Numbers 25</a> tells how the Moabite king almost succeeded in turning the Israelites against the Lord. It describes a scene at Peor where Israelite men engaged in debauchery with Moabite women. That may have meant participation in the common heathen practice of temple prostitution, for according to <a href="?bref=Num.31.14-16">Numbers 31:14-16</a>, that had been Balaam’s advice to Balak and the Moabites on how to weaken Israel. Later Balaam was killed by the Israelites in their campaign against Midian (<a href="?bref=Num.31.8">Nm 31:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.22">Jos 13:22</a>).</p>

  <title>Balance, Balances</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BALANCE, BALANCES</p>
<p class="fl">Devices used to weigh an object by opposing it with a known weight. Balances or scales have been used to measure weight since at least the middle of the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Pictures and inscriptions in Egyptian tombs give us an idea of the appearance of the earliest scales. A pair of such balances found in Ugarit dates from about 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Balances usually consisted of four main parts: (1) an upright center standard, (2) a crossbar suspended from it, (3) two pans suspended from each end of the crossbar by cords, and (4) on the more elaborate models, a rod or pointer attached to the center of the crossbar at right angles to it. The rod moved in front of the standard so that when the two pans held equal weights the exact vertical position of the rod would be evident.</p>
<p>Scales or balances were used in the ancient world primarily to measure precious metals such as silver or gold. The “Story of the Eloquent Peasant,” dating from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt, however, mentioned the figurative measuring of a person’s heart and tongue.</p>
<p>Balances are mentioned frequently in the OT, with much emphasis on the use of just weights in commerce (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.36">Lv 19:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.1">Prv 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.11">16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.23">20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.10">Ez 45:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.7">Hos 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.5">Am 8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.10-12">Mi 6:10-12</a>). The weighing of silver with a balance is described (<a href="?bref=Isa.46.6">Is 46:6</a>), as when Jeremiah weighed the money that he paid for his nephew’s field (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.8-10">Jer 32:8-10</a>). In an acted-out prophecy, Ezekiel was told to cut off all his hair and beard and weigh it in balances to separate it into three equal parts (<a href="?bref=Ezek.5.1-2">Ez 5:1-2</a>). Job asked to be “weighed in a just balance,” that God might know his integrity (<a href="?bref=Job.31.6">Jb 31:6</a>). Daniel said that Belshazzar had been weighed in the balances (judged) and found wanting (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.27">Dn 5:27</a>). One reference to scales or balances is found in the NT, in <a href="?bref=Rev.6.5">Revelation 6:5</a>, which speaks of a rider (on a black horse) having a balance in his hand. The prophecy is of severe famine, when some foods can no longer be obtained, when inflation has driven up food prices, and when people check the scales carefully to be sure they are not cheated when buying even the cheapest grains, such as barley (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.6">Rv 6:6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BALDNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Condition of having little or no hair on the scalp. Natural baldness due to age is referred to only indirectly in the Bible, where it is contrasted with baldness due to leprosy (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.40-42">Lv 13:40-42</a>). The Israelites were forbidden to shave their heads or shape their beard in ways that resembled pagan religious practices (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.1">Dt 14:1</a>). Such restrictions applied particularly to Israelite priests (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.5">Lv 21:5</a>). Shaving off the hair and offering it as a sacrifice to God was a special act prescribed for men or women taking a Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.1-5,18">Nm 6:1-5, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">Acts 18:18</a>).</p>
<p>The Egyptians and other peoples shaved off their hair (and eyebrows) as a sign of respect for the dead. There are many biblical references to the non-Israelite custom of shaving the head as a sign of mourning or anguish (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.6">Jer 16:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.37">48:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.31">Ez 27:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.1.16">Mi 1:16</a>). Most of these passages speak of God’s judgment against pagan cities or nations. Since baldness was associated primarily with leprosy, venereal disease, idolatry, or death, the prediction or threat of baldness sometimes accompanied prophetic warnings (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.16-24">Is 3:16-24</a>).</p>

It is a term designating hills or mountains overlooking the Arnon River (<a href="?bref=Num.21.28">Nm 21:28</a>). The plural form (Bamoth) alone or as the first part of a compound is used for the name of towns in Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.21.19-20">Nm 21:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.22.41">22:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.17">Jos 13:17</a>).</p>

Possession of an enemy’s “heights” was synonymous with subjection of that enemy (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.29">Dt 33:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.2">Ez 36:2</a>). The word seems to combine both literal and figurative connotations in several references to Jerusalem, a “high place” in ruin overgrown with scrub vegetation (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.12">Mi 3:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Jer.26.18">Jer 26:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.1-2">Ez 36:1-2</a>). “High place” was also a special, or technical, term in Canaanite religion, designating a local shrine on a hill near a town or village, in contrast to the large temples located throughout the land.</p>

<p>“Banishment” or a similar word is used in the Bible to describe God’s judgment on Adam and Eve (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.23-24">Gn 3:23-24</a>) and on Cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.9-14">4:9-14</a>), Absalom’s exile from his father David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.37-39">2 Sm 13:37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.14.13-14">14:13-14</a>), and Israel’s exile from the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.1">Dt 30:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.12">Is 11:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.15">Jer 16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.13">Ez 4:13</a>). During the exile, it was included in a list of punishments for those who disobeyed God or the Persian king Artaxerxes (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.26">Ezr 7:26</a>).</p>
<p>The Mosaic law specified that an Israelite should be “cut off” from the people of God for various offenses, such as failure to circumcise a male child (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.12,14">Gn 17:12, 14</a>), eating leavened bread during Passover (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.15">Ex 12:15</a>), making an unholy animal sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.1-4">Lv 17:1-4</a>), eating blood (v <a href="?bref=Lev.17.10">10</a>), sinning deliberately (<a href="?bref=Num.15.30-31">Nm 15:30-31</a>), or failing to undergo ceremonial cleansing after contact with a dead body (<a href="?bref=Num.19.11-20">19:11-20</a>). The term “cut off” probably meant exclusion from the social and religious life of the community (cf. <a href="?bref=John.9.18-23,34">Jn 9:18-23, 34</a>). After the exile, when the whole nation of Israel had been “banished,” disinheritance and permanent excommunication from God’s people were made official punishments (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.7-8">Ezr 10:7-8</a>). The Romans, like other conquerors before them, practiced deportation in various forms. Controversy among the Jews led to the banishment of Jews from Rome under Emperor Claudius (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). The author of Revelation was banished to the island of Patmos during Roman persecution (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rv 1:9</a>). More severe forms of banishment included permanent exclusion from an area, loss of citizenship, and confiscation of all goods and property.</p>

  <title>Banker, Banking</title>

<p class="h1">BANKER, BANKING</p>
<p class="fl">A person who engages in loaning, exchanging, and issuing money. The development of interstate and international trade made it imperative to devise a method of banking to facilitate the transfer of funds. The appearance of coinage in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span> brought the money changer into being. The royal monopoly in commerce (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.11">2 Sm 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.14-29">1 Kgs 10:14-29</a>) gave place to a system that resembled modern banking.</p>
<p>In NT times money changers represented one aspect of the banking system. They spent their time converting Roman money into orthodox coinage for the temple half-shekel (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.24">Mt 17:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.12">21:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.27">25:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.15">Mk 11:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.23">Lk 19:23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.14-15">Jn 2:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>Those who lent money (lenders) and those who gave credit in financial transactions (creditors) were protected by a system of guarantees such as pieces of movable property or a pledge of some kind. Interest was theoretically forbidden by Israelite law (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.25">Ex 22:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.1-18">Dt 15:1-18</a>), although the law was not always observed and exorbitant rates of interest were sometimes charged. Prophets and some national leaders deplored the practice (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.6-13">Neh 5:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.8,13,17">Ez 18:8, 13, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.12">22:12</a>). Often, the people of Israel were afraid of their creditors (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1">2 Kgs 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.109.11">Ps 109:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.2">Is 24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.1">50:1</a>), who might invade their homes to recover a debt, even carrying off children as slaves (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.1">2 Kgs 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.1">Is 50:1</a>). The parable of the creditor and the two debtors in <a href="?bref=Luke.7.41-42">Luke 7:41-42</a> represents a kindly creditor (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.25.14-30">Mt 25:14-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.11-27">Lk 19:11-27</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BANQUET</p>
<p class="fl">Lavish ceremonial meal, usually held in honor of some notable event or person; also a symbol of the feast to be given by Christ in the kingdom of God. Banqueting and feasting were major parts of the social and religious life of biblical times. In addition to the religious feasts prescribed by Mosaic law, banquets and feasts were celebrated on nearly any occasion of joy or solemnity: at the ratification of covenants (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.30">Gn 26:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.31.54">31:54</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.24.11">Ex 24:11</a>); at weddings (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.22">Gn 29:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.10">Jgs 14:10</a>); at harvest (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.27">Jgs 9:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.3.1-3">Ru 3:1-3</a>); at the shearing of sheep (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.11">1 Sm 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.13.23-29">2 Sm 13:23-29</a>); at the arrival of guests (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.3">Gn 19:3</a>); at the weaning of a child (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.8">21:8</a>); at coronations (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.9,19-25">1 Kgs 1:9, 19-25</a>); on various state occasions (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.3-9">Est 1:3-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.18">2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.5.4-8">5:4-8</a>); and for many other reasons.</p>
<p>Many customs associated with banquets in the ancient Near East are portrayed in the Bible and in extrabiblical literature; wall reliefs and carvings from some excavations also depict banquet scenes. The sequence of banquet preparation in <a href="?bref=Pr.9.2-5">Proverbs 9:2-5</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Matthew 22:1-14</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.14.15-24">Luke 14:15-24</a> is also known from the legend of King Keret in Ugaritic literature: (1) preparation of the foods, (2) sending messengers with the invitation and announcement that all is ready, and (3) the presentation of food and wine in order. The prophet Amos portrays a lavish feast and shows the main eating customs (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4-6">Am 6:4-6</a>). Meals were ordinarily taken while reclining on a couch before a table (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.41">Ez 23:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.10">Mt 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.49">Lk 7:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.10,15">14:10, 15</a>).</p>
<p>Banquet imagery is prominent in both Testaments with reference to the kingdom of God. Isaiah foresaw the judgment of the nations and the deliverance of Israel followed by the Lord’s reign over his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.23">Is 24:23</a>); inauguration of that reign is accompanied by a huge banquet to which all peoples are invited (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.6-8">Is 25:6-8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.13.29">Lk 13:29</a>). Meals shared following the sacrifice of animals in the OT prefigure that great feast when there will be no more death, tears, or reproach for the people of God (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.7">Is 25:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.21.4">Rv 21:4</a>). The banquet of the new covenant likewise directs attention to the future, when the redeemed will drink fine wine (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.6">Is 25:6</a>) with Christ in the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.14-20">Lk 22:14-20</a>). By participating in the Lord’s Supper (Communion), all Christians anticipate that great feast.</p>
<p>That future, final banquet in the kingdom of God is also pictured specifically as a wedding feast; all is in readiness, the invitation is issued to many, but few are chosen (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Mt 22:1-14</a>). The church looks forward to the marriage feast of the Lamb (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.7-9">Rv 19:7-9</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BAPTISM</p>
<p class="fl">Term generally meaning “to dip” or “immerse,” but representing a group of words employed to signify a religious rite for ritual cleansing. In the NT it became the rite of initiation into the Christian community, and it was interpreted theologically as a dying and rising with Christ.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheBaptismofJohn">The Baptism of John</p>
<p class="fl">John preached a “baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.3">Lk 3:3</a>). The origins of his rite are difficult to trace. Some have claimed that his baptism modeled that practiced by those at Qumran; others have urged that his baptism modeled that practiced by Jews when initiating proselytes to Judaism. The members of the Qumran community viewed themselves as the covenant community of the last days and so dwelt in the desert, living an ascetic life and immersing themselves daily in acts of ceremonial cleansing. At the same time they taught that internal repentance must accompany the external act (1 QS 2:3). Its sacramental nature is seen in the fact that only a full member of the community could practice it, and then only after two probationary years (1 QS 5:6). Converts from pagan religions were admitted to Judaism only after fulfilling certain obligations, which included the study of the Torah, circumcision, and a ritual bath to wash away the impurities of the Gentile background.</p>
<p>John’s baptism both parallels and differs with these forms of baptism. The genesis of his baptism may be found in the prophetic acted-out parable, which not only symbolized God’s message but also intended to bring it about. John’s practice had several theological ramifications: (1) It was intimately connected with radical repentance, not only of the Gentile but astoundingly (to his contemporaries) also of the Jew. (2) It was eschatological at the core, preparing for the Messiah, who would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>), and therefore looked to the final separation between God’s people and the wicked at the eschaton (i.e., “the End,” cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.3.12">Mt 3:12</a>). (3) It symbolized moral purification and so prepared the people for the coming kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.7-14">Lk 3:7-14</a>). In spite of the obvious connection between John’s ceremony and the early church, we cannot posit absolute dependence. In fact, it disappeared from Jesus’ ministry. At first, Jesus allowed his disciples to continue the rite (<a href="?bref=John.3.22">Jn 3:22</a>), but later he seemingly discontinued the practice (<a href="?bref=John.4.1-3">Jn 4:1-3</a>), probably for the following reasons: (1) John’s message was functional, while Jesus’ was personal/ontological. (2) John’s was forward-looking, expecting the coming kingdom, while Jesus’ was backward-looking, celebrating that event. (3) John’s was an interim practice, while Jesus’ was sacramental. Jesus’ ministry fulfilled John’s, so he severed himself from the latter’s modus operandi.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBaptismofJesus">The Baptism of Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">This event has its genesis in a complex interplay of motives, divine and human, within the messianic consciousness of Jesus (see <a href="?bref=Mark.1.9-11">Mk 1:9-11</a> and parallels). For John it was Jesus’ stamp of approval upon his message and ministry. Jesus was in continuity with John’s kingdom proclamation. For Jesus, it was also an anointing that signified the inauguration of his messianic ministry. As seen in God’s “heavenly voice” of <a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mark 1:11</a> and parallels, this has two aspects: (1) The voice alludes to <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Psalm 2:7</a>, establishing Jesus’ unique sonship. (2) It alludes to <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1">Isaiah 42:1</a>, establishing him as the messianic “servant of Yahweh.” (This is discussed at greater length in the article below.)</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusResurrectionCommandtoBaptize">Jesus’ Resurrection Command to Baptize</p>
<p class="fl">Here we find the true basis of the church’s practice (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">Mt 28:19</a>). As already stated, the disciples stopped employing it, so it is here that we see the institution reconstituted as an ordinance based on the death and resurrection of Christ. It was no longer a forward-looking phenomenon but had now become a realized activity centering on the gospel message, certified by the risen Christ who is exalted to universal lordship. It also is an essential aspect of the discipling activity, as seen in the use of the participle “baptizing” after the main verb “make disciples.” Finally we might note that the act signifies the entrance of the believer “into” union with (literally “into the name of”) the triune Godhead.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BaptismintheEarlyChurch">Baptism in the Early Church</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a> shows that baptism was a sacral institution from the very beginning. This takes it back to the earliest days of the church. In the primitive church it was an important part of the salvation process (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>, “repent and be baptized”) and was accomplished via confession and prayer “in the name of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.16">8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.48">10:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.5">19:5</a>). Probably there was a question-and-answer period in which the believer confessed his faith and dedicated himself to Christ. The result was reception into and identification with the messianic community of the new covenant, signifying both forgiveness of sins (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.31">5:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.43">10:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.38">13:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.18">26:18</a>) and the reception of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.38,41">Acts 2:38, 41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.17">9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.47-48">10:47-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.16-17">11:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.5-7">19:5-7</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BaptismofFire_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baptism of Fire</a>; <a href="?item=BaptismofJesus_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baptism of Jesus</a>; <a href="?item=BaptismoftheSpirit_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baptism of the Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheTheologyofBaptisminPaulsandPetersEpistles">The Theology of Baptism in Paul’s and Peter’s Epistles</p>
<p class="fl">Paul’s basic statement is found in <a href="?bref=Gal.3.27">Galatians 3:27</a>, “baptized into Christ.” The rite of baptism is christological at the heart, signifying union with Christ. This is clarified further by <a href="?bref=Rom.6.3-8">Romans 6:3-8</a>, which equates baptism with dying and rising (cf. <a href="?bref=Col.2.12-13">Col 2:12-13</a>). At the same time baptism is related to the Spirit; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Corinthians 12:13</a> connects “baptism by the one Spirit” with being “given that same Spirit.” Many see baptism as the outward confirmation of the inward “seal” by the Spirit (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.21-22">2 Cor 1:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13">Eph 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.30">4:30</a>). This leads us to the eschatological dimension of baptism. In its relation to the present work of Christ and the Spirit, it externalizes the outpouring of salvation in the age of fulfillment, because it is the initiatory rite signifying the believer’s entrance into the blessings of the new age (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.5">Ti 3:5</a>).</p>
<p>There is also a definite link between baptism and the OT covenants. The major connection is with the Abrahamic, especially with the circumcision that characterized it. Paul in <a href="?bref=Col.2.11-12">Colossians 2:11-12</a> combines Jewish circumcision with Christian baptism as pictures of the redemptive work of Christ. The debate today centers on the degree of continuity between them—does baptism perform the same function in the New Covenant, i.e., forensic and imputative? Whatever the theological ramifications, Paul at least cannot be made to say this. Rather, he borrows here the Judeo-Christian imagery of the “circumcision of the heart” (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.16">Dt 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.6">30:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.4">Jer 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.28-29">Rom 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.3">Phil 3:3</a>). Christians experience the fulfillment of that which circumcision merely prefigured, a spiritual, totally efficacious reality.</p>
<p>Baptism is also related to the Noahic covenant in <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19-21">1 Peter 3:19-21</a>. There Noah’s deliverance through the waters is considered a picture of the effects of baptism. The debate centers on the meaning of “baptism now saves you.” The answer is connected with the thrust of the ensuing clarification, “an appeal to God for a clear conscience” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, lit. “of a good conscience”). While the developed dialogue between the sacramental and baptist views is considered below, we will simply comment here that the interpretation “appeal <span class="ital">by</span> a good conscience” best fits the emphatic position of this phrase and the picture in this verse of a pledging convert. Baptism is the seal of the salvation covenant, which itself has been accomplished beforehand by the act of Christ and the faith decision of the individual.</p>

  <title>Baptism for the Dead*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD*</p>
<p class="fl">Custom of uncertain meaning, referred to once in the NT (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.29">1 Cor 15:29</a>). Many interpretations have been offered for that much-disputed verse. The important questions are the nature of the practice of baptism for the dead and whether or not the apostle Paul approved of it.</p>
<p>Most interpretations of the phrase “baptized for the dead” fall into one of three categories: metaphoric baptism, normal baptism, or baptism by proxy. In <a href="?bref=Mark.10.38">Mark 10:38</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.12.50">Luke 12:50</a>, baptism is used as a metaphor for suffering or martyrdom. Some scholars, interpreting “baptism for the dead” as a metaphor for martyrdom, would translate it “being baptized with a view to death.” </p>
<p>Many prefer to read the phrase in the normal sense of being baptized on one’s own behalf. Martin Luther thought it referred to the practice of baptizing over the tombs of the dead. John Calvin believed it had to do with Christians who called for baptism because they were in danger of dying. Others think it referred to converts who were baptized because of the testimony of Christian martyrs or departed loved ones.</p>
<p>The most natural meaning of the words points to a practice of baptism by proxy. The phrase seems to indicate that certain people in Corinth would have themselves baptized vicariously for dead people. The Corinthians may have had a magical view of baptism. That might explain why, to them, Paul belittled his ministry as a baptizer (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.14-17">1 Cor 1:14-17</a>). Comparing the Corinthians’ experience with that of Israel in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.1-13">10:1-13</a>), Paul described crossing the Red Sea and gathering manna in terms clearly suggesting baptism and the Lord’s Supper. Paul reminded his readers that neither of those dramatic experiences prevented the Israelites from falling into sin. Perhaps the Corinthians regarded the Christian sacraments as rites that guaranteed their salvation. If so, practitioners of baptism by proxy probably believed that the rite had some benefit for the departed.</p>
<p>Did Paul approve of the practice of baptism for the dead? Probably not. It should be noted that in the particular arguments for the resurrection of the dead in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.29-34">1 Corinthians 15:29-34</a>, Paul separated himself from the practitioners of such baptism. Without implying approval of the practice, Paul used vicarious baptism merely as an illustrative argument: unless <span class="ital">some</span> Corinthians believed in the actual resurrection of the dead, their practice of baptizing on behalf of the dead would obviously be meaningless.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="BaptismofFire">
  <title>Baptism of Fire*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BAPTISM OF FIRE*</p>
<p class="fl">Metaphor coined by John the Baptist. John was looking for the coming of One who would “baptize in Spirit and fire” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>). The context makes clear that fire in that phrase denotes judgment, a judgment that would presumably purify the penitent (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">Is 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.2-3">Mal 3:2-3</a>) as well as destroy the impenitent (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.1">Mal 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.3.10">Mt 3:10</a>,12).</p>
<p>The prophets and apocalyptic writers frequently spoke of a period of tribulation and suffering necessary before the new age could come: “the messianic woes,” “the birth pangs of the Messiah,” “a river of fire.” Parallels to John’s phraseology are found in <a href="?bref=Isa.30.27-28">Isaiah 30:27-28</a> and in the pseudepigraphal <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.13.10-11">2 Esdras 13:10-11</a>. John the Baptist probably adopted that usage and reexpressed it through a metaphor drawn from his own most characteristic act (baptism). His “baptize in fire” thus probably denoted the purifying judgment that would bring in the new age as well as bring individuals into the new age.</p>
<p>There is no further biblical reference specifically to baptism of fire. Mark and John abbreviate the Baptist’s preaching by omitting all mention of judgment. With Pentecost and beyond, John’s baptism in water is seen as fulfilled in baptism in the Spirit. But Jesus seemed to echo the Baptist’s conviction that a fiery purification was necessary (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.49">Mk 9:49</a>). And he clearly picked up the Baptist’s prediction, but referred the baptism and presumably the fire to his own death (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.49-50">Lk 12:49-50</a>). His death is understood as suffering the fiery baptism for others. That thought is matched by the apostle Paul in his understanding of baptism into Christ as a baptism into Christ’s death (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.3">Rom 6:3</a>). So it can be said that John’s expectation of a purgative baptism of fire for the penitent is most nearly fulfilled in the believer’s being united with Christ in his death and sharing in his sufferings; only in that way does one come to share fully in Christ’s risen glory (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.5">Rom 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.17-23">8:17-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.10-11">Phil 3:10-11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BAPTISM OF JESUS*</p>
<p class="fl">Major event in Jesus’ life, which marked the beginning of his ministry. The fact that John the Baptist baptized Jesus is disputed by very few scholars today, but the purpose and significance of Jesus’ baptism remain controversial.</p>
<p>The Gospel accounts agree that John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.6-10">Mt 3:6-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.4-5">Mk 1:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.3-14">Lk 3:3-14</a>). He proclaimed that the kingdom of heaven was at hand and that God’s people should prepare for the Lord’s coming by a renewal of faith toward God. For John, that meant repentance, confession of sins, and practicing righteousness. That being so, why was Jesus baptized? If Jesus was sinless, as the NT proclaims (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">Heb 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.22">1 Pt 2:22</a>), why did he submit to a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins? The Gospels provide the answers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelofMark">The Gospel of Mark</p>
<p class="fl">Mark presents the baptism of Jesus as a necessary preparation for his period of temptation and ministry. At his baptism Jesus received the Father’s approval and the bestowal of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.9-11">1:9-11</a>). Mark’s focus on Jesus’ special relation to the Father, “You are my beloved Son, and I am fully pleased with you” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">1:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), brings together two important OT references. Jesus’ messiahship is presented in a radically new way, in which the ruling Messiah (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Ps 2:7</a>) is also the Suffering Servant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.1">Is 42:1</a>). Popular Jewish belief expected a ruling Messiah who would establish the kingdom of God, not a Messiah who would suffer for the people. Mark intended to show that in Jesus alone had God’s appointed time for the fulfillment of his purpose come.</p>
<p>The statement that the heavens opened at the baptism of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.10">Mk 1:10</a>) may proclaim the arrival of the “end times” (the time of fulfillment and the establishment of God’s kingdom). A then-current Jewish interpretation of <a href="?bref=Isa.64.1">Isaiah 64:1</a> held that in the last days God would open the heavens and come down to his people. In Jewish thought the rending of the heavens was also associated with hearing God’s voice and the bestowal of God’s Spirit.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelofMatthew">The Gospel of Matthew</p>
<p class="fl">Matthew’s account of Jesus’ baptism has more detail than Mark’s. It begins by noting John’s reluctance to baptize Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.14">3:14</a>). John was persuaded only after Jesus explained to him that the act was “fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.15">3:15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Although the full meaning of those words is uncertain, they at least suggest that Jesus’ baptism was necessary to accomplish God’s will. In both the Old and New Testaments (<a href="?bref=Ps.98.2-3">Ps 98:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>) God’s righteousness is seen in his salvation for his people. That is why the Messiah can be called “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Is Our Righteousness” (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.6">Jer 23:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">Is 11:1-5</a>). Jesus told John that his baptism was necessary to do God’s will in bringing about salvation for his people. Thus the Father’s declaration at Jesus’ baptism is presented in the form of a public announcement, emphasizing that Jesus was God’s anointed Servant about to begin his ministry as the bringer of the Lord’s salvation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelofLuke">The Gospel of Luke</p>
<p class="fl">Luke passes over Jesus’ baptism quickly, placing it alongside the baptism of others who came to John (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.21-22">3:21-22</a>). The context in Luke also sheds some light on the purpose of Jesus’ baptism. Luke, unlike Matthew, places the genealogy of Jesus after his baptism and just before his ministry begins. The parallel to Moses, whose genealogy occurs just before his primary work begins (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.14-25">Ex 6:14-25</a>), seems more than coincidental. It is probably intended to illustrate Jesus’ role in bringing deliverance (salvation) to God’s people just as Moses did in the OT. At his baptism, by the descent of the Holy Spirit upon him, Jesus was equipped to do the mission God had called him to do. Following his temptation (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.1-13">Lk 4:1-13</a>), Jesus entered the synagogue and declared to the people that he had been anointed by the Spirit to proclaim good news (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-21">4:16-21</a>). That anointing came at Jesus’ baptism (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.10.37-38">Acts 10:37-38</a>).</p>
<p>In his Gospel account, Luke tried to identify Jesus with the common people—for example, in the birth story (with Jesus born in a stable and visited by lowly shepherds, <a href="?bref=Luke.2.8-20">Lk 2:8-20</a>) and through placing the genealogy (stressing Jesus’ relation to all of humanity, <a href="?bref=Luke.3.38">3:38</a>) right after the baptism. Thus, Luke saw the baptism as Jesus’ first step in identifying himself with those he had come to save.</p>
<p>In the OT the Messiah was always inseparable from the people he represented (see especially <a href="?bref=Jer.30.21">Jer 30:21</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.1-46.24">Ez 45–46</a>). Although the “servant” in Isaiah is sometimes viewed corporately (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.1">Is 44:1</a>) and sometimes individually (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.3">53:3</a>), he is always viewed as the representative <span class="ital">of the people</span> to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.5-26">49:5-26</a>), as well as the servant <span class="ital">of the Lord.</span></p>
<p>Evidently Luke, along with Mark and Matthew, was trying to show that Jesus, as the divine representative of the people, had identified himself with them in his baptism.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelofJohn">The Gospel of John</p>
<p class="fl">The fourth Gospel does not say that Jesus was baptized but does say that John the Baptist saw the Spirit descend upon Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.1.32-34">Jn 1:32-34</a>). The account emphasizes that Jesus went to John during John’s preaching and baptizing ministry; John recognized that Jesus was the Christ, that God’s Spirit was upon him, and that he was the Son of God. John also recognized that Jesus, unlike himself, baptized with the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.1.29-36">1:29-36</a>).</p>
<p>John the Baptist described Jesus as the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">1:29</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The closest OT parallel to that statement comes from a “servant of the Lord” passage (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.6-7">Is 53:6-7</a>). It is possible that “Lamb of God” could be an alternate translation of the Aramaic term “servant of God.”</p>
<p>The sense of Jesus as the one who bears the sins of the people is obviously in view in the fourth Gospel. That Jesus was the promised representative and deliverer of the people was understood by John the Baptist and conveyed by the Gospel writer.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">In the four Gospels it is clear that the Holy Spirit came upon Jesus at his baptism to enable him to do the work of God. All four Gospel writers saw that Jesus had been anointed by God to accomplish his mission of bringing salvation to the people. Those ideas provide a key to understanding why Jesus was baptized. On that occasion at the beginning of his ministry, God anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit to do his mediating work between God and the people. At his baptism Jesus was identified as the one who would bear the people’s sins; Jesus was baptized to identify himself with sinful people.</p>

  <title>Baptism of the Spirit*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BAPTISM OF THE SPIRIT*</p>
<p class="fl">A popularly used phrase, which never occurs as such in the Bible. The NT always uses the verbal phrase “baptize [or baptized] in the Spirit.” That gives it a dynamic character that the noun phrase cannot fully convey.</p>
<p>The phrase seems to have been coined by John the Baptist: “I baptize you with water; but he [the One who is to come] will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>; but <a href="?bref=Mark.1.8">Mk 1:8</a> and <a href="?bref=John.1.33">Jn 1:33</a> omit the words “and fire”). The phrase is clearly a metaphor: it stands in contrast to and as the fulfillment of John’s water baptism. It is a metaphor of <span class="ital">judgment,</span> as the context in Matthew and Luke makes clear. Purification or destruction in a river of fire, by a spirit of cleansing, in the fiery breath of God (“breath” and “spirit” are the same word in Hebrew), was familiar imagery in Jewish thought (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">Is 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.27-28">30:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.10">Dn 7:10</a>). It is also a metaphor of <span class="ital">mercy,</span> since the purification cleanses; after winnowing, the grain would be gathered into the barn (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11-12">Mt 3:11-12</a>). And, finally, it is a metaphor of <span class="ital">initiation</span>—John the Baptist’s variation on “the messianic woes,” the expectation that the messianic age would be introduced only through suffering and tribulation (e.g., <a href="?bref=Dan.7.19-22">Dn 7:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1">12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.12-15">Zec 14:12-15</a>; also the pseudepigraphal 1 Enoch 100:1-3).</p>
<p>In the book of Acts the metaphor retains the initiatory significance given it by John the Baptist. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.4">Acts 2:4</a> fulfills the promise of <a href="?bref=Acts.1.5">Acts 1:5</a>. Since the outpouring of the Spirit was seen as <span class="ital">the</span> mark of “the last days” (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.3">Is 44:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.29">Ez 39:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">Jl 2:28-29</a>), it was by being thus baptized in Spirit that the disciples <span class="ital">began</span> to experience the last days for themselves (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-7,18">Acts 2:1-7, 18</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.11.17">Acts 11:17</a> speaks of Pentecost as the occasion when they came to believe in Jesus Christ as Lord. Similarly the apostle Paul sees the gift of the Spirit as the beginning of Christian experience (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.3">Gal 3:3</a>), so that “having the Spirit of Christ” is the defining mark of the Christian (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.9">Rom 8:9</a>). By being baptized in the Spirit, Cornelius and his friends received the forgiveness and salvation that Peter promised them (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.43-45">Acts 10:43-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.13-18">11:13-18</a>). “Baptized in Spirit” is there synonymous with “granted repentance unto life” (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.18">11:18</a>) and “cleansed their hearts by faith” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.8-9">15:8-9</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Baptism_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baptism</a>; <a href="?item=BaptismofFire_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baptism of Fire</a>; <a href="?item=SpiritualGifts_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Spiritual Gifts</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">BARABBAS</p>
<p class="fl">Criminal who was released instead of Jesus. All four Gospel writers took note of that event (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.15-26">Mt 27:15-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.6-15">Mk 15:6-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.18-25">Lk 23:18-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.39-40">Jn 18:39-40</a>), as did the apostle Peter in his temple sermon (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.14">Acts 3:14</a>).</p>
<p>Barabbas was a bandit and/or revolutionary (<a href="?bref=John.18.40">Jn 18:40</a>) who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.7">Mk 15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.19">Lk 23:19</a>). (The word translated “robber” in <a href="?bref=John.18.40">John 18:40</a> can denote either a bandit or revolutionary.) He was regarded as a notorious prisoner (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.16">Mt 27:16</a>). His insurrection may have been an unusually violent act of robbery or an internal struggle among the Jews, but many scholars view it as a political insurrection against the Roman forces in Jerusalem. It is not unlikely that Barabbas was a member of the Zealots, a Jewish political group that sought to throw off the yoke of Rome by violence.</p>
<p>After examining Jesus, the vacillating Roman procurator, Pilate, recognized that Jesus was innocent and wanted to free him. Yet Pilate also had an interest in pleasing the Jewish leaders in order to protect his own political position. In the face of his dilemma he offered to release a prisoner to the Jews at their Passover feast (<a href="?bref=John.18.39">Jn 18:39</a>). Given the option of Jesus or Barabbas, Pilate thought that the Jewish crowd would choose to have Jesus set free. Pilate underestimated either the mood of the mob or the influence of the Jewish leaders, or both. Whatever the reason, the throng shouted for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be crucified (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.21-22">Mt 27:21-22</a>). Consequently, Jesus was crucified and Barabbas, after being released, disappeared from biblical and secular history.</p>

<p class="h1">BARBARIAN*</p>
<p class="fl">Foreigner, especially a person from a culture regarded as primitive or uncivilized. The Greek word <span class="greek">barbaros</span><span class="ital">,</span> translated “barbarian” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), originated as a repeated nonsense syllable, “<span class="ital">bar-bar</span><span class="ital">,</span>” in imitation of the strange sound of a foreign language. The Greeks, viewing themselves as the only truly cultured people in the world, tended to refer to everything non-Greek as barbarian. The Romans adopted Greek culture, considered themselves equals of the Greeks, and regarded other languages, customs, and people as barbarian.</p>
<p>The NT use of the word illustrates its several shades of meaning. The relationship to language is evident in a statement about speaking in tongues through the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.11">1 Cor 14:11</a>). The apostle Paul said that if a Christian’s spiritual language were not understood, the person speaking would be a barbarian to Paul and vice versa. Luke’s account of Paul’s shipwreck on Malta refers to barbarous people and barbarians (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <a href="?bref=Acts.28.2-4">Acts 28:2-4</a>). Obviously, nothing derogatory was intended, since the kindness of the natives was being described. Elsewhere, Paul used the word in the usual Greek-Roman manner, saying he was indebted both to the Greeks and to the barbarians (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.14">Rom 1:14</a>). In a profound statement that the gospel of Jesus Christ is for everyone Paul said, “Here there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all, and in all” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.11">Col 3:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p class="fl">Jewish sorcerer, a “false prophet” who worked with the governor of Paphos on the island of Cyprus (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.6">Acts 13:6</a>). When the governor, Sergius Paulus, took an interest in the message of Paul and Barnabas, Bar-Jesus tried to influence him against their teachings. Paul confronted Bar-Jesus, denounced him as a “son of the devil,” and predicted that a temporary blindness would come upon him as a punishment from God. Bar-Jesus was instantly blinded (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.7-12">Acts 13:7-12</a>), and the governor apparently became a Christian.</p>
<p>The many superstitious people of that day were easy prey for wonder-workers like Bar-Jesus (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.8.9-11">Acts 8:9-11</a>). The term “sorcerer” applied to him, however, connoted more than just a magician. It often referred to a wise man whose scientific understanding supposedly exceeded that of most others in that society.</p>
<p>Bar-Jesus was also called Elymas, which was his Greek name (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.8">Acts 13:8</a>). It was common practice for Jews with contacts in both cultures to adopt a Greek name. According to one view, Elymas is based on an Aramaic word for “strong” and an Arabic word for “wise,” which actually means “magician.”</p>

<p class="fl">Hero of the second Jewish revolt against Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 132-135) during the latter days of the emperor Hadrian’s rule. In Jewish sources he is referred to as Bar (or Ben) Koziba; his name means “son of a star.” Reasons for the rebellion are not fully known, but they include Hadrian’s construction of a pagan city on the site of Jerusalem (destroyed in <span class="era">AD</span> 70), erection of a temple to the Roman god Jupiter on the site of the Jewish temple, and Hadrian’s prohibition against circumcision.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Herodium"/>
<p>Even allowing for legendary additions to the story of Simeon Ben Koziba, president or prince of Israel, it is clear that he fought fiercely and courageously against the Romans and inspired his men to do likewise. The result was heavy casualties among the Romans and fearsome reprisals by them. Dio Cassius, third-century Roman historian, reported that the Romans destroyed 50 fortresses and 985 Jewish settlements during the war. They killed 580,000 in battle, and left multitudes to die of sickness and starvation. Judea was almost depopulated. Bar-Kochba himself was killed at the end of a long siege of Bethera (Bethar) near Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 135.</p>
<p>During the terrible struggle, Jews were forced to seek refuge in caves and other hiding places. As a result, discoveries have been made that have raised Bar-Kochba from the level of legend to that of historical certainty. The first Bar-Kochba letters turned up in 1951 in a cave in a canyon called Wadi Murabba’at, 11 miles (17.7 kilometers south of Qumran (site of the Dead Sea Scroll caves), on the Jordanian side of the border in the Judean wilderness. Israelis exploring caves south of En-gedi in the Nahal Hever in 1960–61 found the personal belongings of refugees, letters written by Bar-Kochba, and scores of documents related to his administration. Coins of the Bar-Kochba revolt have also been found at the Herodium near Bethlehem and at Masada, showing that Bar-Kochba’s forces used those places as forts.</p>

<p class="fl">Name given by the apostles to an early convert to Christianity in Jerusalem. Formerly called Joseph, Barnabas probably earned his new name through effective preaching and teaching.</p>
<p>Sources for the life of Barnabas are limited to passages in the book of Acts and Paul’s letters. The apocryphal Epistle of Barnabas is almost certainly a mid-second-century composition and therefore not from the hand of Barnabas. The apocryphal Acts of Barnabas is from the fifth century and not useful in establishing reliable information on the person of Barnabas. Tertullian assigned to him the authorship of Hebrews, but internal evidence speaks against this view.</p>
<p>A native of Cyprus, Barnabas was a Jew of the Diaspora. His priestly family background gave him a special interest in Jerusalem. He probably came to live in the Holy City. It is possible that he may even have become acquainted with Jesus in Jerusalem, but his conversion to Christianity probably resulted from the apostles’ preaching soon after the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Barnabas first appears as a property owner named Joseph (<span class="sc">kjv</span> Joses) in the book of Acts who sold a field and gave the money to the Christian community (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.36-37">Acts 4:36-37</a>). When persecution of Hellenistic Christians broke out in Jerusalem, Barnabas remained in the city though others of similar background fled (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-8">8:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-22">11:19-22</a>). His good reputation in Jerusalem may have influenced the apostles to select him as Paul’s companion for missionary work.</p>
<p>As many of the scattered Christians gravitated to Antioch of Syria, the Jerusalem church sent Barnabas to help in the growing work (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-26">Acts 11:19-26</a>). The writer of Acts said of Barnabas, “He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith” (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.24">11:24</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Barnabas recruited Paul, now a Christian, to help in Antioch, and the two men worked in the church for a year, teaching a large company of Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">11:26</a>). When famine hit Jerusalem, Barnabas and Paul were sent with relief funds. On their return to Antioch, John Mark went with them (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">12:25</a>).</p>
<p>Barnabas was commissioned with Paul to preach beyond the boundaries of Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.2-3">Acts 13:2-3</a>). The placing of Barnabas’s name before Saul (Paul) may indicate the priority of Barnabas at this time. They went to Cyprus and to several key centers in Asia Minor. At Lystra the citizens identified Barnabas with the mythical god Zeus, and Paul with Hermes (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.8-12">14:8-12</a>).</p>
<p>At a Jerusalem council, Barnabas and Paul reported on their mission to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>). Following that council, as the two men planned another mission, a serious disagreement arose that led to their separating (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.36-41">36-41</a>). Barnabas wanted to take his cousin John Mark (<a href="?bref=Col.4.10">Col 4:10</a>), but Paul refused on the grounds that Mark had deserted them on the earlier mission (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">Acts 13:13</a>). Barnabas left for Cyprus with John Mark, and Paul went to Syria and Cilicia with Silas. After that separation the focus shifted from Barnabas to Paul.</p>

  <title>Barrenness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BARRENNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Condition of being barren or childless. A closed womb was a personal tragedy in OT times. God’s command to people after the Flood was to be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.1">Gn 9:1</a>); later, Jeremiah offered the same advice (<a href="?bref=Jer.29.6">Jer 29:6</a>). A barren wife in a polygamous marriage was subject to ridicule (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.4">Gn 16:4</a>) or extreme jealousy (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.1">30:1</a>). The social pressure to bear children for her husband was so great that the barren wife sometimes offered her husband a surrogate mother (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-2">16:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.30.3">30:3</a>). If a husband died without children, it was the responsibility of his brother to have children by his wife for him (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.8">38:8</a>).</p>
<p>Barrenness could be a curse (<a href="?bref=Hos.9.11,14">Hos 9:11, 14</a>) or a divine punishment (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.17-18">Gn 20:17-18</a>). It could be removed after earnest prayers (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.21">Gn 25:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.16,20">1 Sm 1:16, 20</a>) or by God’s prophet (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.4.16">2 Kgs 4:16</a>) or messenger (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.14">Gn 18:14</a>). On one occasion, a wife who had stopped having children was able to trade some mandrakes in exchange for sleeping privileges with her husband and had three more children (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.14-21">Gn 30:14-21</a>). God promised Israel no infertility if they obeyed his laws (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.14">Dt 7:14</a>). Unique among ancient writings is the concept here that barrenness could be a result of male infertility. Finally, as bad as barrenness was, Jesus told the women of Jerusalem that barrenness and dry breasts would be better than what they were going to go through (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.29">Lk 23:29</a>). He was teaching that physical problems are never ultimate; spiritual ones are.</p>

<p class="h1">BARSABAS*, BARSABBAS</p>

<p class="h1">BARTHOLOMEW, T<span class="lc">he</span> A<span class="lc">postle</span></p>
<p class="fl">Disciple of Jesus included in all four lists of the 12 apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2-4">Mt 10:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.16-19">Mk 3:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.14-16">Lk 6:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>), though not otherwise mentioned in the NT. Nothing is told about him in any of the lists. Because the name means “son of Tolmai,” it has been speculated that he was known by another name in addition to his “patronymic” name. In the lists in Matthew, Mark, and Luke (the synoptic Gospels), Bartholomew is named immediately after Philip, suggesting the possibility that the Nathanael brought by Philip to Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.1.45-50">Jn 1:45-50</a>)—who seems to be linked with some of the disciples (<a href="?bref=John.21.2">Jn 21:2</a>)—was Bartholomew. It thus seems possible that the apostle Bartholomew is referred to in the fourth Gospel by another name; it is not certain, however, that John’s references to Nathanael were intended to identify him as one of the Twelve.</p>
<p>Eusebius, an early church historian, recorded an early tradition that Pantaenus, the first head of the catechetical school in Alexandria (<span class="era">AD</span> 180), went to India and there found Christians who knew of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew letters. According to Eusebius, Bartholomew had preached to them and had left the Gospel of Matthew with them. In other traditions, Bartholomew was an evangelistic partner of Philip and Thomas and suffered martyrdom in Armenia.</p>
<p>A number of spurious and apocryphal writings have been ascribed to Bartholomew; none of them is genuine. In the fourth century Jerome mentioned a Gospel of Bartholomew, which is also noted by a few other writers. There are also references to the so-called Questions of Bartholomew (extant in Greek, Latin, and Slavonic fragments) and to a Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ by Bartholomew (extant in Coptic). Other references were made to Acts of Bartholomew and Apocalypse of Bartholomew, both otherwise unknown.</p>

<p class="h1">BARUCH</p>
<p class="list">1. Neriah’s son, secretary of the prophet Jeremiah. In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim of Judah (605/604 <span class="era">BC</span>), Baruch wrote down Jeremiah’s prophecy of the evil that God was going to bring upon Judah unless the nation repented (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.4">Jer 36:4</a>). God also gave Baruch a special personal message through Jeremiah about humility in service (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.45.1-5">45</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Baruch read the words of Jeremiah’s prophecy to the people and to the princes (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.9-19">Jer 36:9-19</a>). The message finally reached Jehoiakim, who destroyed the scroll and called for Baruch’s and Jeremiah’s arrest (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.36.21-26">21-26</a>). In hiding, Baruch again wrote down Jeremiah’s prediction of Judah’s destruction (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.36.27-32">27-32</a>). Baruch was the brother of Seraiah, a close associate of the later King Zedekiah. Seraiah was eventually deported to Babylon with the king by Nebuchadnezzar. With Nebuchadnezzar laying siege to Jerusalem in 587 <span class="era">BC</span>, a year before its final destruction, the imprisoned Jeremiah purchased a field. His act symbolized the eventual restoration of Israel to the land. Baruch was ordered by Jeremiah to keep the evidence of the purchase safe (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.12-15">Jer 32:12-15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Two months after the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, rebellious Jews murdered Gedaliah, puppet governor of Judah under the Babylonians, and sought to flee to Egypt. Jeremiah advised them to remain in Jerusalem. The rebels blamed Baruch for influencing Jeremiah to give such advice and forced both Baruch and the prophet to accompany them into Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.1-7">43:1-7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Scripture does not refer to the final events in Baruch’s life. The Jewish historian Josephus recorded that when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt, Baruch was taken to Babylon. The apocryphal book of Baruch begins by noting that the author was in Babylon (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.1.1-3">1:1-3</a>). Both accounts, however, are historically questionable.</p>

<p class="h1">BARUCH, B<span class="lc">ook of</span></p>
<p class="fl">Deuterocanonical work named after Baruch, who was secretary to the prophet Jeremiah. In antiquity several books were ascribed to Baruch, whose well-known connection with Jeremiah undoubtedly increased their circulation and acceptance. This one emphasizes the righteousness and wisdom of God, at the same time implying that God in his mercy will listen to the supplications of the penitent. It acknowledges that the Jews deserve punishment for their sins from a righteous God. The final passages urge the people of Israel not to be downcast, because a compassionate God will restore them to glory.</p>
<p>The book of Baruch purports to be an account of Jewish exiles in Babylon who fast, weep, and pray over the difficulties of their present position as they remember their past disobedience to God. They formulate a plan to raise a sum of money and send it to the high priest in Jerusalem so that offerings can be made on their behalf. In addition, they send the book of Baruch, which has been read previously to the Jews in Babylon, asking that it be read, particularly on feast days and at “appointed seasons,” and be incorporated into the liturgy. They urge the high priest to pray for the well-being of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar and his son so that “the Lord will give us strength, and he will give light to our eyes, and we shall live under the protection of . . . Belshazzar his son, and we shall serve them many days and find favor in their sight” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.1.12">Bar 1:12</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>A confession that follows the introductory section is in the form of a prayer. The Jews acknowledge that the calamities befalling Israel since the time of Moses are a result of their own sin. They affirm that God is just and they beg his mercy and forgiveness. “Righteousness belongs to the Lord our God, but confusion of face to us and our fathers, as at this day” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.2.6">Bar 2:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Jews implore God not to punish them for their acts of disobedience and particularly for not having served the king of Babylon as the Lord had decreed. “Hear, O Lord, our prayer and our supplication, and for thy own sake deliver us, and grant us favor in the sight of those who have carried us into exile” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.2.14">14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The Jews are then exhorted to adhere strictly to God’s law and to rediscover the wisdom that they alone possess, as embodied in the Torah. They are instructed to walk in the ways of God and not to put their trust in gold, silver, or material possessions. The wisdom commended is not the speculative variety occurring in another apocryphal book, the Wisdom of Solomon, but the more practical wisdom found in the canonical OT writings. The intent was evidently to reinforce the conviction that the faithful remnant were still God’s special possession and had a future ministry.</p>
<p>The final section comprises a lamentation followed by a brief glimpse of the glory and deliverance that God has in store for a faithful, penitent Israel: “Take off the garment of your sorrow and affliction, O Jerusalem, and put on for ever the beauty of the glory from God. Put on the robe of righteousness from God; put on your head the diadem of the glory of the Everlasting” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.5.1-2">Bar 5:1-2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>After the fifth chapter, according to the Latin Vulgate, is appended “The Letter of Jeremiah.” This document, supposedly sent to the Judeans about to be taken captive in Babylonia, is actually a religious tract condemning idolatry.</p>
<p>The book of Baruch was probably the work of several authors and may have been put together by the writer of the introductory section. The confession borrows heavily from the ninth chapter of Daniel. The prayers for forgiveness show strong similarities to biblical prophetic writings. The section of wisdom poetry is quite different in style, resembling <a href="?bref=Job.28.1-28">Job 28</a> and <a href="?bref=Job.29.1-25">29</a>. The final paragraph suggests <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-45.25">Isaiah 40–45</a> as a source.</p>
<p>Considerable discussion has arisen over the date of the work. It is most likely that the book was originally written in Hebrew and translated into Greek. The translator was very likely the same person who translated the book of Jeremiah for the Septuagint (ancient Greek version of the Old Testament). A date of 582 <span class="era">BC</span> has been proposed on the basis of internal evidence from the first section. A considerably later date is much more likely, possibly in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Although the book circulated widely among dispersed Jews, its influence was greater and lasted longer in the early Christian church. It was highly esteemed and frequently quoted by early theologians. The work was accepted as canonical by the Roman Catholic Church at the Council of Trent (1545–63).</p>

<p class="h1">BASHAN</p>
<p class="fl">Region east and northeast of the Sea of Galilee. The exact boundaries of Bashan are difficult to determine, but it extended approximately 35 to 40 miles (55 to 64 kilometers) from the foot of Mt Hermon in the north to the Yarmuk River in the south, and stretched some 60 to 70 miles (97 to 113 kilometers) eastward from the Sea of Galilee.</p>
<p>The region (“Hauran,” <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.16,18">Ez 47:16, 18</a>) is mostly a fertile tableland 1,600 to 2,300 feet (488 to 701 meters) in altitude. Its rich volcanic alluvium is well watered because the low hills of southern Galilee to the west allow the rains to sweep farther inland than in most other places along the Palestinian coast. Today, as in ancient times, it is an agriculturally productive region. In NT times it was a grain-producing area of the Roman Empire. Bashan was known for the quality of its cattle and sheep (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.14">Dt 32:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.18">Ez 39:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.4.1">Am 4:1</a>).</p>
<p>In the patriarch Abraham’s day, Bashan’s inhabitants were giantlike people called Rephaim (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.5">Gn 14:5</a>). Og, the last of the Rephaim, was an enemy of the Israelites as they sought to enter Canaan after their Egyptian bondage and wilderness wandering (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.7">Dt 29:7</a>). Og was defeated and slain by the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Num.21.33-35">Nm 21:33-35</a>). Bashan’s prosperity at that time is indicated by the fact that one of its provinces, Argob, had 60 great walled cities (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.4-5">Dt 3:4-5</a>). The chief cities of Bashan were Edrei, Ashtaroth, Golan, and Salecah. After Israel conquered the territory east of the Jordan River, Bashan was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.29-30">Jos 13:29-30</a>). Golan and Ashtaroth, two cities in Bashan, were reserved for the Levites (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.71">1 Chr 6:71</a>). Ben-geber of Ramoth-gilead administered Argob (a region in Bashan) for King Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13">1 Kgs 4:13</a>). In the days of Jehu (841–814 <span class="era">BC</span>), King Hazael of Syria conquered the area (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.33">2 Kgs 10:33</a>). Tiglath-pileser III incorporated Bashan into the Assyrian Empire in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">15:29</a>). The Nabateans held it in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, and Herod the Great (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>) ruled over it at the time of Jesus’ birth.</p>

Exactly where Baskama is located is unknown. The most popular suggestion is Tell el-Jummeizeh (“sycamore tree”) near the northeast shore of the Sea of Galilee. That Arabic name is perhaps related to Baskama, which can mean “house of the sycamore.” Ancient ruins there might have been a shrine to Jonathan, a great hero. The Jewish historian Josephus calls the spot Basaca.</p>

  <title>Bathe, Bathing</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BATHE, BATHING</p>
<p class="fl">To cleanse as with water; to wash oneself. In the Bible the terms “bathing” and “washing” translate, often interchangeably, a number of different words. One OT passage uses one Hebrew word for cleaning clothes, another for washing other objects, including the body (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.8-12">Lv 15:8-12</a>).</p>
<p>Israel’s dry climate and scarcity of water discouraged bathing except where a stream or pool was available (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.10">2 Kgs 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.7">Jn 9:7</a>). Yet people still washed babies at birth (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.4">Ez 16:4</a>), dead bodies in preparation for burial (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.37">Acts 9:37</a>), and sheep for their shearing (<a href="?bref=Song.6.6">Sg 6:6</a>). Frequent bathing of the whole body was probably reserved for the rich (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.5">Ex 2:5</a>), but the prevalence of dust made frequent washing of the face, hands, and feet necessary (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.4">Gn 18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.19.2">19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.24.32">24:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.24">43:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.21">Jgs 19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.5.3">Sg 5:3</a>). Good grooming for the privileged demanded washing of one’s body before anointing with oil (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.3">Ru 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.12.20">2 Sm 12:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.41">Ez 23:41</a>). A good host provided water for a guest’s feet (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.4">Gn 18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.21">Jgs 19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.44">Lk 7:44</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.4-5">Jn 13:4-5</a>). To wash someone’s feet was the task of a servant. For anyone else to do so was a sign of humility (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.41">1 Sm 25:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.44-47">Lk 7:44-47</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.3-16">Jn 13:3-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.10">1 Tm 5:10</a>).</p>
<p>Most biblical references to washing or bathing deal with ritual cleansing. Priests and Levites were required to wash their clothes and faces, and sometimes bodies, before approaching the altar and on ceremonial occasions (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.4">Ex 29:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.30.19-21">30:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.40.7,12,30-32">40:7, 12, 30-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.8.21">Nm 8:21</a>). Before a slain animal was sacrificed, its legs and intestines were washed (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.9,13">Lv 1:9, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.21">8:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.9.14">9:14</a>). Anyone who was once unclean (e.g., a leper who was healed or someone who had experienced a genital discharge) had to wash his or her clothes and bathe to be ritually pure (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.8-10">Lv 14:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.15.5-11,21-27">15:5-11, 21-27</a>). Any garment that became polluted had to be ceremonially cleansed (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.27">Lv 6:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.13.54">13:54</a>).</p>
<p>“Washing” is also used figuratively for a cleansing from sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.2">Ps 51:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.16">Is 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.22">Jer 2:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.11">1 Cor 6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.22">Heb 10:22</a>).</p>

  <title>Bathsheba</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BATHSHEBA</p>
<p class="fl">Uriah’s wife, with whom David committed adultery and whom he later married. Bathsheba, also spelled Bathshua (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.5">1 Chr 3:5</a>), was the daughter of Ammiel or Eliam (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.3">2 Sm 11:3</a>) and possibly the granddaughter of Ahithophel, the king’s adviser (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.12">2 Sm 15:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.34">23:34</a>). Her Hittite husband was one of David’s top military heroes (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.39">2 Sm 23:39</a>).</p>
<p>While Uriah was off fighting under Joab, King David saw a beautiful woman taking her evening bath. Discovering her name and that her husband was away on duty, he sent for Bathsheba and had sexual intercourse with her (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-4">2 Sm 11:1-4</a>). When Bathsheba later informed him that she was pregnant, the king ordered Uriah back to Jerusalem, hoping that the husband’s return would make Bathsheba’s pregnancy appear legitimate. But Uriah considered himself still on active duty and slept with the palace guard, refusing to go home (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.5-13">5-13</a>). Frustrated, David sent him back to the front and ordered Joab to put Uriah in the front lines and then pull back. Consequently, Uriah was killed (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.14-25">14-25</a>).</p>
<p>After Bathsheba’s period of mourning, David installed her in the palace as his seventh wife, and she bore the child. The Lord sent the prophet Nathan to pronounce judgment on David’s sin through a parable. Nathan prophesied a series of tragedies in David’s household, beginning with the death of Bathsheba’s infant son (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.26-12.14">2 Sm 11:26–12:14</a>). David confessed his sin and repented, but the infant became sick and died. The prologue (or superscription) of <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a> describes it as the psalm of repentance David wrote when confronted by Nathan over his adultery with Bathsheba and his murder of Uriah. David comforted Bathsheba, and eventually they had other children (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.15-25">2 Sm 12:15-25</a>).</p>
<p>Of David’s 19 sons by his seven wives (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1-9">1 Chr 3:1-9</a>), the sons born to Bathsheba were Shimea (also spelled Shammua, <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.14">2 Sm 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.14.4">1 Chr 14:4</a>), Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. Nathan (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.31">Lk 3:31</a>) and Solomon (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.6">Mt 1:6</a>) appear in NT genealogies of Jesus Christ. Bathsheba also appears in Matthew’s genealogy under the description “she who had been the wife of Uriah.” At the very end of David’s life, the prophet Nathan told Bathsheba that David’s son Adonijah (by his wife Haggith) was conspiring to usurp the throne. Bathsheba and Nathan persuaded David to make Solomon king as he had promised (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-53">1 Kgs 1</a>).</p>

People celebrated on rooftops (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.1-2">Is 22:1-2</a>). Peter prayed on his roof (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.9">Acts 10:9</a>). With so much activity on rooftops, it is easy to understand the need for the law “When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you may not bring the guilt of blood upon your house, if any one fall from it” (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.8">Dt 22:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

That indignity and others led to war (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.1-8">2 Sm 10:1-8</a>). Removal of an Israelite’s beard, however, was considered appropriate under certain circumstances. Suspicion of leprosy on the head or face required shaving around the suspected spot to permit better diagnosis (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.29-37">Lv 13:29-37</a>). A shaven head, along with wailing and the wearing of sackcloth, was a way of proclaiming impending or prevailing doom (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.1-3">Is 15:1-3</a>).

  <title>Beast</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BEAST</p>
<p class="fl">Animal in both the OT and NT, having in some cases a figurative significance. The word has a variety of meanings in the OT. Some of the diversity is due to inconsistent translations of several Hebrew words that can signify “living creature” as well as “beast,” but which have sometimes been translated only as “beast.” In the OT, therefore, beast can refer to the following:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. In general, any animal (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.1.24">Gn 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.36.6">Ps 36:6</a>), but often distinguished from fish, birds, and insects (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.6.7">Gn 6:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.11.2">Lv 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.17">Dt 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.12.7">Jb 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.35.11">35:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.3">Zep 1:3</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. A domesticated animal (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.19.13">Ex 19:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.22.10">22:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.13">Nm 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.47">31:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.48">Jgs 20:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.12.10">Prv 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.21.6">Jer 21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.8.10">Zec 8:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. A wild and sometimes carnivorous animal (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.37.20">Gn 37:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.11">Ex 23:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.26">Dt 28:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.44">1 Sm 17:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.15">Ez 14:15</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. The figurative usage of the word “beast” is most apparent in the books of Daniel and Revelation. In Daniel (especially <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Dn 7</a>) the beast is a symbol of a world ruler who persecutes and oppresses the people of God. In Revelation the apostle John took over that concept with its vivid imagery to speak of the final persecution of God’s people at the end of history. John’s beast in its apostasy closely resembles the “antichrist” of his earlier epistles (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18,22">1 Jn 2:18, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.7">2 Jn 1:7</a>) and Paul’s “man of lawlessness” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3">2 Thes 2:3</a>). Many Bible commentators regard the three as designating the same individual. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Antichrist_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Antichrist</a>; <a href="?item=Armageddon_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Armageddon</a>; <a href="?item=MarkofGodMarkoftheBeast_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Mark of the Beast</a>; <a href="?item=RevelationBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Revelation, Book of</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">BEATITUDES*, T<span class="lc">he</span></p>
<p class="fl">Term derived from Latin <span class="ital">beatitudo</span><span class="ital">;</span> it is not used in the English Bible. Technically it means “blessedness” as described in the OT and NT. “Blessed” is translated from both Hebrew and Greek words to refer to divine favor conveyed to people.</p>
<p>The formal utterance “happy is,” or “blessed is,” is a common declaration in the book of Psalms (used 26 times) and Proverbs (8 times). It is used 10 times in the other books of the OT and 13 times in the apocryphal books. These beatitudes are pronounced upon the person who is righteous, having faith and hope in God. They are signs of a life lived in proximity to Yahweh, in the experience of forgiveness, and in the love and favor of God. Such life is a totality, so such blessings are expressive of holistic enrichment, harmony, and fecundity, whether in family life, in temple worship, in public life, or in the interior of one’s own being. The person so blessed is in touch with the fruitfulness of the Creator himself. Such a one lives a fulfilled life, life as God intended it to be lived before him.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheBeatitudesMatthew5112Nlt"/>
<p>In the NT, references to “blessing” occur seven times in the book of Revelation, three times in the Epistle to the Romans, and once in John’s Gospel. The prominence of “blessedness” in Matthew and Luke gives rise to the technical term “Beatitudes.” There are interesting contrasts between Luke’s “sermon on the plain” (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.20-23">Lk 6:20-23</a>) and Matthew’s “sermon on the mount” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">Mt 5:3-12</a>). The pronouncement of the blessings in Luke is done immediately after the selection of the 12 disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.12-16">Lk 6:12-16</a>). Yet the sermon is addressed to the crowd generally and speaks of the advent of God’s kingdom as the reversal of the social conditions of the human race. So Luke balances four blessings with four woes—changing from the present tense to the future tense—to heighten the contrast of the impending reversal of social conditions.</p>
<p>In Matthew’s account, the advent of the kingdom has already commenced, indicated by the use of the present tense. It is addressed to the disciples particularly and is not a general proclamation. The sermon is set within two statements of Jesus: he has not come to destroy but to fulfill the Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.17">Mt 5:17</a>); and it is necessary to have a kind of righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">Mt 5:20</a>). So these Beatitudes are more concerned with the interior life of the disciple, to activate here and now the kind of life Jesus communicates in those who follow him, for Jesus has already inaugurated the kingdom. These eight Beatitudes reflect on the traits of those who belong to that kingdom and who therefore reflect Christ’s own life. The people and situations described may seem pitiable by human standards, but because of God’s presence in their lives, they are actually blessed and should be congratulated and imitated. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=JesusChristTeachingsof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jesus Christ, Life and Teachings of</a>.</p>

The location of this gate is uncertain, but it was probably the gate leading from the Court of the Gentiles into the Women’s Court, called the Corinthian Gate (for its Corinthian bronze) by the Jewish historian Josephus. According to him, it measured 75 feet (22.9 meters) high by 60 feet (18.3 meters) wide. A burial inscription found on Mt Olivet attributes the building of the gate to an Alexandrian Jew named Nicanor.</p>

  <title>Beauty</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BEAUTY</p>
<p class="fl">Harmonious combination of qualities pleasant to see. Archaeological materials indicate that the ancient Hebrews were concerned more with usefulness than with beauty. Hebrew pottery, for example, was generally more bulky than Canaanite pottery. Yet such artifacts do not mean that the Hebrews had no aesthetic appreciation.</p>
<p>The OT speaks of God’s creation as beautiful (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.9">Gn 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.26.13">Jb 26:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-6">Ps 19:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.6.10">Sg 6:10</a>). The land of Canaan is a “pleasant land” (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.19">Jer 3:19</a>). Jerusalem is called “beautiful” (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.1">Is 52:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.2.15">Lam 2:15</a>), as is one of its temple gates (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.2,10">Acts 3:2, 10</a>). The Hebrews admired the wild grandeur of the Lebanon mountain range (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.16">Ps 104:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">Is 60:13</a>). The Canaanite city of Tirzah (“beauty”), King Baasha’s capital in the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.33">1 Kgs 15:33</a>), was so named for its attractive location.</p>
<p>Although the Hebrews did not exalt the human form as did the ancient Greeks, the OT does idealize physical attractiveness. A bride’s beauty is described eloquently by her bridegroom in love lyrics in <a href="?bref=Song.4.1-15">Song of Songs 4:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.6.4">6:4</a>. Such praise of the bride may have been a traditional feature of Israelite weddings. Several women prominent in the OT are described as beautiful (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.17">Gn 29:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.2">2 Sm 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.7">Est 2:7</a>). But sensual beauty was secondary to industry, resourcefulness, and traditional piety in a woman (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.10-31">Prv 31:10-31</a>). A number of men also were known for their physical attractiveness—for example, David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.12">1 Sm 16:12</a>) and Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.14.25">2 Sm 14:25</a>). Cosmetics, jewelry, and other accessories were used as female beauty aids in OT times. The prophet Isaiah listed such items (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.18-24">Is 3:18-24</a>), and Ezekiel mentioned cosmetic practices current in his day (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.10-13">Ez 16:10-13</a>). Israelite worship was beautiful, too, with the high priest’s elaborate ceremonial robes designed for glory and beauty (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.2,40">Ex 28:2, 40</a>).</p>
<p>The concept of beauty is applied also to God in the OT. The Lord’s favor is called his “beauty” (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.17">Ps 90:17</a>). Isaiah recorded God’s promise to give his people “beauty for ashes” (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.3">Is 61:3</a>). The psalmist expressed a desire to spend time in the temple enjoying the Lord’s beauty, his “incomparable perfections” (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.4">Ps 27:4</a>). Isaiah described God as a “diadem of beauty” to the faithful Israelite remnant (<a href="?bref=Isa.28.5">Is 28:5</a>), and the Messiah was spoken of as a beautiful king (<a href="?bref=Isa.33.17">33:17</a>). Thus in the OT the concept of beauty had a deeper meaning than simply physical attractiveness. It became a theological concept affirming God’s essential glory.</p>
<p>The NT urges Christ’s followers to live lives that will “adorn” the teaching of the Savior, making it attractive to nonbelievers (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.10">Ti 2:10</a>). Those who preach the gospel of Christ are spoken of as beautiful (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.15">Rom 10:15</a>). The apostles Paul and Peter warned women against being satisfied with outward beauty (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.9-10">1 Tm 2:9-10</a>), reminding them that beautiful character is the true adornment of godliness (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.3-5">1 Pt 3:3-5</a>). The beauty of the believer’s final home in heaven is reflected in the description of the “new Jerusalem” as a bride and in the symbolism of treasured precious stones of antiquity (see <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">Rv 21–22</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Scriptural designation for the southern extremity of the Promised Land, located 28 miles (45.1 kilometers) southwest of Hebron. It was an important Negev site at an early time. Hagar wandered with Ishmael in this area, as did Abraham. Later Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.23">Gn 26:23</a>) and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.1">46:1</a>) both had significant spiritual experiences there, and later yet it was important in the lives of numerous other Hebrews.</p>
<p>Beersheba of the Hebrew monarchy period was located at Tell Beersheba, two miles (3.2 kilometers) northeast of the modern city. Recent excavations reveal that the city was founded by the Hebrews in the 12th or 11th century <span class="era">BC</span> and probably was the place where the sons of Samuel judged the people (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.2">1 Sm 8:2</a>).</p>
<p>This city was only about two and a half acres (one hectare) in size. In its ruins there were the remains of a horned altar, which when reassembled stood to a height of about five feet (1.5 meters). This is the same height as the altar found at Arad, and the two are the only Hebrew altars yet found that date to the period of the first temple. These altars were the same height as the one in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.1">Ex 27:1</a>) and probably the same as the original altar in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.13">2 Chr 6:13</a>).

<p>Earliest legislation (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.11">Dt 15:11</a>) mandated the care of those who were poor. There were regulations such as the Sabbath year, the year of remission to those indebted (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-55">Lv 25</a>). In that year the produce of the land was left to the poor and destitute (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.11">Ex 23:11</a>), and all debts were canceled (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.1">Dt 15:1</a>). The duty of lending liberally to the poor was promoted (vv <a href="?bref=Deut.15.7-11">7-11</a>), and hired laborers were protected (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.14-15">24:14-15</a>). The purpose was that “there should be no more poor among you” (<a href="?bref=Deut.15.4">15:4</a>). Indeed, in the early days of Israelite settlement, all Israelites enjoyed a comparable standard of living.</p>
<p>In excavations at Tirsah near Nablus, the size and arrangements of houses of the tenth century <span class="era">BC</span> are all about the same. By the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, there is a striking contrast, with houses on the same site clearly divided into the town’s richer and poorer quarters. The social revolution between those two centuries was associated with the rise of the Israelite monarchy and growth of a class of officials who gained private profits from their positions. The prophets condemned the fact that wealth was ill-gotten and badly distributed in their day (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.5.8">Is 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.8">Hos 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.4-7">Am 8:4-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.2.2">Mi 2:2</a>). The prophet Amos denounced creditors who felt no pity for the poor (<a href="?bref=Amos.2.6-8">Am 2:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.6">8:6</a>). Yet, throughout the OT, there is essentially no reference to beggars. During the intertestamental period, however, almsgiving became an important religious duty.</p>
<p>In the NT, begging seems to be prevalent. In the ministry of Jesus, references are made to a blind beggar (<a href="?bref=John.9.8-9">Jn 9:8-9</a>), to blind Bartimaeus (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-52">Mk 10:46-52</a>), and to Lazarus, a godly beggar who is contrasted with a rich man (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>). The apostles Peter and John encountered a crippled beggar by the “Beautiful,” or Nicanor, Gate in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-11">Acts 3:1-11</a>). Jesus rebuked an ostentatious show of almsgiving (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.1-4">Mt 6:1-4</a>) but stressed the importance of giving to the poor from right motives (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.42-48">Mt 5:42-48</a>). By the time of Jesus, Jerusalem had become a center for beggars, probably because almsgiving in the Holy City was then regarded as particularly meritorious. Begging in Jerusalem was concentrated around the holy places. The pool of Beth-zatha was a place of healing, and the sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed lay there to beg as well as to get into the waters for healing (<a href="?bref=John.5.2-9">Jn 5:2-9</a>).</p>
<p>In the early Christian community, the first organization of officers was made to provide for a fair distribution of funds to the poor (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.32-35">Acts 4:32-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">6:1-6</a>). On the first day of each week, some portion of each Christian’s income was to be allotted to the needy (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-30">11:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.25-27">Rom 15:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1-4">1 Cor 16:1-4</a>). Possibly the poverty of Palestine was made worse by heavy Roman taxation; tax gatherers as well as beggars are prominent in the Gospel narratives. It has also been suggested that the rise of the Zealots was closely associated with the social factor of poverty; the revolutionary Zealots were largely comprised of society’s “dregs,” according to the Jewish historian Josephus. In <span class="era">AD</span> 66 the Zealots burned the Jerusalem archives, no doubt intending to destroy the records of their debts kept there. Josephus reports that before the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, gangs of beggars were terrorizing the whole city. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Alms_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Alms</a>; <a href="?item=Poorthe_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Poor, The</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">BELIAL*, BELIAR*</p>
<p class="fl">Common Hebrew noun meaning “baseness,” “worthlessness,” “wickedness,” or “lawlessness.” Belial, however, is often rendered as a proper noun. Thus, such translations as “sons of Belial” appear (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.22">Jgs 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12">1 Sm 2:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), “daughter of Belial” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.16">1 Sm 1:16</a>), or “children of Belial” (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.13">Dt 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.13">Jgs 20:13</a>). Newer translations generally prefer the common noun form and give such readings as “worthless rabble” or simply “worthless” and the like (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.13">Dt 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.22">Jgs 19:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.13">20:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.16">1 Sm 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.12">2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.27">10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.12">Prv 6:12</a>). One possible exception to this rule is found in <a href="?bref=Nah.1.15">Nahum 1:15</a>, which some scholars think should be rendered as “Belial,” a personalized designation of the Assyrian conqueror who had been a threat to the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
<p>Intertestamental literature often used “Belial” as a proper noun and thus prepared the way for its NT usage. In the NT the term appears once as “Belial” (or Beliar in <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.15">2 Cor 6:15</a>) and is identified with Satan, the personification of all that is evil. Noncanonical writings of the NT period commonly used it as a name for Satan or the Antichrist.</p>

One would expect the term “believers” (sometimes translated “faithful”) to be a title for Christians, since the NT stresses belief in Jesus. Although NT authors emphasized believing, they rarely used the term “believer” as a name for Christians. There are a few clear examples (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.32">Acts 4:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.45">10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.12">1 Tm 4:12</a>), but in other places the term is a description, not a name (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.44">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">15:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.27">18:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.3">1 Tm 4:3</a>).

<p class="h1">BELOVED DISCIPLE*</p>
<p class="fl">Designation of one disciple, evidently the author of the Gospel of John (<a href="?bref=John.21.20-24">Jn 21:20-24</a>). Five passages in John’s Gospel mention the disciple whom Jesus loved: (1) The disciple whom Jesus loved lay close to Jesus’ chest during the Last Supper and was beckoned by Peter to ask Jesus who the betrayer would be (<a href="?bref=John.13.21-26">13:21-26</a>). (2) The disciple whom Jesus loved stood near the cross, and Mary the mother of Jesus was given to his care (<a href="?bref=John.19.25-27">19:25-27</a>). (3) Mary Magdalene came to Peter and the disciple whom Jesus loved, reporting that Jesus’ body was missing from the tomb (<a href="?bref=John.20.2">20:2</a>). (4) The disciple whom Jesus loved was in a fishing boat with Peter and the other disciples and recognized Jesus standing on the shore (<a href="?bref=John.21.7">21:7</a>). (5) The disciple whom Jesus loved was following Jesus by the lakeshore, and the author reminded his readers that this was the same disciple spoken of at the Last Supper (<a href="?bref=John.21.20-23">21:20-23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.13.21-26">13:21-26</a>).</p>
<p>Because the phrase is found only in John’s Gospel, could it be the author’s way of referring to himself? Several passages make that seem very likely.</p>
<p>A list of names given in <a href="?bref=John.21.2">John 21:2</a> indicates that the disciples present at the lakeshore were Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee (James and John), and two others. Evidently the beloved disciple was one of the sons of Zebedee or else one of the two unnamed disciples.</p>
<p>The beloved disciple was almost certainly one of the Twelve, since he was present at the Last Supper, and evidently only the 12 disciples were there with Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.20">Mt 26:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.17-20">Mk 14:17-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.14,30">Lk 22:14, 30</a>). That eliminates Lazarus and John Mark, who have sometimes been suggested as possibilities for the beloved disciple.</p>
<p>The beloved disciple appeared to be close to Peter (<a href="?bref=John.13.23-24">Jn 13:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.2">20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.7">21:7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-26">Acts 3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.14">8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>). Matthew, Mark, and Luke record that Peter, James, and John were constantly selected by Jesus to be with him. Since Peter was mentioned in connection with the disciple whom Jesus loved, and since James was martyred early (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.2">Acts 12:2</a>), only John is left as a reasonable possibility—if, as is generally regarded, John’s Gospel was written long after James’s death.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">BELSHAZZAR</p>
<p class="fl">Babylonian king who was co-regent with Nabonidus in the final days of the Babylonian Empire. His name means “Bel protect the king.” Daniel identifies him as the son of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.2,11,13,18">Dn 5:2, 11, 13, 18</a>), though in fact he was the natural son of Nabunaid (Nabonidus). The seeming discrepancy arises from the fact that in Hebrew literature “father” may signify “ancestor” or “predecessor,” and “son” may designate “descendant” or “successor in office.” Some have concluded that Belshazzar’s mother was a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and that Belshazzar was therefore the grandson of the great Babylonian. Clearly his father, Nabunaid, was the son of a nobleman and the high priestess of the moon god at Haran. Nabunaid had usurped the throne in 555 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>A greater difficulty in the biblical text is the fact that Daniel presents Belshazzar as the king of Babylon when it fell to the Persians, whereas secular historical records picture Nabunaid as the last king of the Babylonian Empire. Critical scholars have therefore questioned Daniel’s accuracy. Inscriptions have now been found, however, which make it clear that Belshazzar’s father entrusted the rule of the capital to him and was out of the city for over 10 years campaigning in Arabia. Religious concerns also took Nabunaid out of Babylon during part of his reign. When Cyrus invaded the Babylonian Empire, Nabunaid marched east to meet him but fled before Cyrus’s advancing armies. Later he returned to Babylon and surrendered to the Persians after the city had already fallen to Cyrus. Thus he was out of the city when the Persians overcame the royal forces there under the command of Belshazzar, the crown prince and co-regent.</p>
<p>While Nabunaid’s armies were being routed by the Persians, Belshazzar was giving a sensual feast for the leaders of Babylonian society. Half drunk, he called for the gold and silver vessels from the Jerusalem temple to be brought in for use in a deliberate act of sacrilege. Immediately handwriting appeared on the wall, his doom was announced, and Persian armies entered the city without a fight (October 12, 539 <span class="era">BC</span>). They did so by diverting the waters of the Euphrates so the river would no longer serve as a moat around the city and its defenses could be easily breached. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=DanielBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Daniel, Book of</a>; <a href="?item=BabylonBabylonia_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Babylon, Babylonia</a>.</p>

<p>In the NT, Jesus was questioned before the judgment seat of Pilate (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.19">Mt 27:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.13">Jn 19:13</a>).

<p>In two passages, Paul used the term to refer to God’s judgment seat.

<p class="h1">BENAIAH</p>
<p class="fl">Popular name meaning “the Lord has built,” used primarily by Levites.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Son of Jehoiada the priest, from the south Judean town of Kabzeel. Benaiah was engaged in military service, and his loyalty gained for him the rank of commander in chief of the army during the reign of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.35">1 Kgs 2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.4">4:4</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Before David became king, Benaiah distinguished himself in a number of daring military and protective feats to become one of the mighty men (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.20-22">2 Sm 23:20-22</a>) during David’s flight from King Saul. He attained command of “the thirty” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.6">1 Chr 27:6</a>), a group second only to “the three” of highest valor (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.23">2 Sm 23:23</a>).

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="BenHadad">
  <title>Ben-Hadad</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BEN-HADAD</p>
<p class="fl">Title of two or possibly three kings of Syria, meaning “son of Hadad.” Hadad was the Syrian storm god probably identical with Rimmon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.18">2 Kgs 5:18</a>).</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Ben-hadad I, son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion. In spite of a history of Syrian hostility to Israel, Ben-hadad I entered into an alliance with King Baasha (908–886 <span class="era">BC</span>) of the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.18-20">1 Kgs 15:18-20</a>). The pact was broken, however, when continuing hostilities between Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah erupted into a major encounter. Baasha conducted a major campaign against King Asa (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>) of Judah. In order to cut off infiltration into his kingdom and defection to the southern kingdom, Baasha fortified the city of Ramah, situated north of Jerusalem but uncomfortably close to it. His action extended Israel’s territory into Judah.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the face of that threat, Asa sent his remaining wealth to Ben-hadad I, asking him to break his pact with Baasha (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.18-19">18-19</a>). The Syrian king took advantage of the offer and sent his armies against Israel. He conquered the cities of Ijon, Dan, and Abel-beth-maacah plus the territory of Naphtali (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.20">20</a>), thus ensuring Syrian control of the main caravan routes through Galilee. Baasha was forced to abandon Ramah and move to Tirzah. Asa then conscripted the population of Judah to dismantle and carry off the fortifications erected by Baasha. Materials taken from Ramah were used to help build Geba in the territory of Benjamin. Asa’s victory became the subject of a prophetic protest by Hanani, who berated Asa for his reliance on the king of Syria (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.7">16:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Ben-hadad II. The biblical accounts in 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles do not make a clear differentiation between Ben-hadad I and II. Some scholars have therefore identified them as a single person. This view finds apparent support in the “Melqart Stele,” which mentions Ben-hadad and to which a date of about 850 <span class="era">BC</span> has been assigned. It seems better, however, to posit a Ben-hadad II who was the son of Ben-hadad I. If one does not distinguish between the two, Ben-hadad’s activity must overlap both the reign of Ahab (874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>) and that of Baasha. In each, a military encounter with Ben-hadad was recorded; one must posit an interval of up to four decades between the encounters if no distinction is made.</p>
<p class="list-text">Ben-hadad II led a coalition of armies against Samaria during the reign of King Ahab of Israel. In the course of the siege, Ben-hadad demanded that Ahab surrender his wealth, wives, and children to him. Ahab agreed to that demand, but when Ben-hadad added the condition that he be given anything that his aides laid their hands on, Ahab refused on advice of his counselors. His refusal enraged Ben-hadad.</p>
<p class="list-text">An anonymous prophet predicted that Ahab would defeat the armies of Ben-hadad (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.13">1 Kgs 20:13</a>). Ahab’s victory came when aides of the district governors killed the soldiers who had come out of the Syrian camp to take them captive. The Syrian forces fled. Ben-hadad was again defeated by the Israelites the next year when he attempted to engage them in battle on the plain rather than in the hill country. His reason was his belief that the “gods” of the Israelites were gods of the hills (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.23">23</a>). That Syrian defeat was also predicted by a prophet, who declared its cause to be Ben-hadad’s misconception of the nature of Israel’s God (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.28">28</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Ben-hadad pleaded for his life, promising to restore all the cities his father had taken from Israel. Ahab agreed, but his action met with prophetic protest (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.35-43">35-43</a>). The pact established by the two kings brought about a cessation of hostilities that lasted only three years. The peace was broken by Ahab, who, at the instigation of King Jehoshaphat of Judah, sought to regain the city of Ramoth-gilead. Guidance was first sought from a group of prophets who predicted victory. Micaiah, however, a true prophet, predicted defeat (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.5-28">22:5-28</a>). Ahab’s forces were defeated, and Ahab died in battle (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.29-36">29-36</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Ben-hadad also figured in the life of the prophet Elisha, whom he sought to capture (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.11-19">2 Kgs 6:11-19</a>). The attempt was thwarted when the Syrian army was stricken with blindness.</p>
<p class="list">3. Ben-hadad III, son of King Hazael of Syria. This Ben-hadad was not related to Ben-hadad I or II but adopted the name. Because Jehoahaz (814–798 <span class="era">BC</span>), king of Israel, did not follow the Lord, God allowed Israel to come under the control of Ben-hadad III. Release from the oppression of Ben-hadad III was accomplished by a “savior” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.5">2 Kgs 13:5</a>), probably a reference to Assyrian incursions into Syria.</p>

  <title>Benjamin, Tribe of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BENJAMIN, T<span class="lc">ribe of</span></p>
<p class="fl">One of the smallest of the 12 tribes of Israel, made up of descendants of Jacob’s youngest son (<a href="?bref=Num.1.36">Nm 1:36</a>). In the OT the tribe is often referred to as simply “Benjamin.” Though small, the tribe of Benjamin played an important role in Israelite history, particularly in their conduct as great warriors (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.13-16">Jgs 20:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.1-2">1 Chr 12:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>At the Israelite conquest of Canaan, after the tribes of Judah and Ephraim had received their territory, the first lot came to Benjamin. The tribe was allotted territory between Judah and Ephraim, a strip of land between Mt Ephraim and the Judean hills. The southern boundary with Judah was clearly defined: through the valley of Hinnom immediately south of Jerusalem to a point north of the Dead Sea. Its eastern limit was the Jordan, and its northern boundary with Ephraim ran from the Jordan to Bethel to Ataroth-addar south of Lower Beth-horon (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.11-20">Jos 18:11-20</a>).</p>
<p>Benjamin’s territory extended about 28 miles (45.1 kilometers) from west to east and 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) north to south. It was hilly country, strategically located to control key passes, but with fertile hill basins. Among its hill settlements were the important towns of Jerusalem, Jericho, Bethel, Gibeon, Gibeah, and Mizpeh (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.21-28">Jos 18:21-28</a>). Not all of its towns were immediately taken from their previous possessors; Jerusalem, for example, was in the hands of the Jebusites until David’s time. The environment bred a hardy race of highlanders, well described in Jacob’s blessing of Benjamin as “a wolf that prowls” (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.27">Gn 49:27</a>).</p>
<p>Ehud of Benjamin was one of the early judges in Canaan, a “deliverer” of the Israelites who killed Eglon, king of Moab (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.15">Jgs 3:15</a>). Members of the tribe later helped Deborah and Barak defeat Sisera (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.14">5:14</a>). The tribe continued to produce great men: political leaders (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.21">1 Chr 27:21</a>), captains in Saul’s army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.2">2 Sm 4:2</a>) and David’s army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.29">23:29</a>), skilled archers (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.40">1 Chr 8:40</a>), and overseers in Solomon’s labor force (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.18">1 Kgs 4:18</a>).</p>
<p>Less noble traits were also shown by Benjamin’s descendants. Palti, a Benjaminite, was one of the scouts making a bad report when the 12 spies returned from the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.1-2,9,31-33">Nm 13:1-2, 9, 31-33</a>). The tribe as a whole displayed disobedience and lack of consistent courage by failing to clear their inheritance of Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.21">Jgs 1:21</a>). Following the custom of the day, the whole tribe defended the lewd treatment and murder of a concubine from another tribe by a few of their members (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-20.48">19–20</a>). That act of gross immorality united the other tribes against them, and the tribe of Benjamin was almost decimated. To keep the tribe from dying out, the other tribes allowed the Benjaminites to take captive several hundred women who then became their wives (<a href="?bref=Judg.21.1-25">Jgs 21</a>).</p>
<p>Benjamin’s tribe proved to be dependable in various ways. During the exodus from Egypt, it took its place in the organization (<a href="?bref=Num.1.11">Nm 1:11</a>) and the army (<a href="?bref=Num.2.22">2:22</a>) and made its tribal offerings (<a href="?bref=Num.7.60">7:60</a>). It demonstrated remarkable loyalty to the throne, initially to Saul and his family (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-31">2 Sm 2:8-31</a>). Later David received its faithful support, as did his descendants, for Benjamin remained with Judah, loyal to Solomon’s son Rehoboam when Jeroboam led a secession (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.21-24">1 Kgs 12:21-24</a>).</p>
<p>Other men of Benjamin (often called Benjaminites) spoken of in the OT include Cush, of whom David sang (<a href="?bref=Ps.7.1-17">Ps 7</a> superscription); Jeremiah the prophet, who, though a Levite, lived within Benjamin’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.1">Jer 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.8">32:8</a>); and Mordecai, uncle and adviser to Queen Esther (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.5">Est 2:5</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the apostle Paul made no apologies for his ancestry, twice referring to himself as a Hebrew of Benjamin’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.1">Rom 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>). In his sermon at Antioch of Pisidia, Paul also mentioned Benjamin as the tribe of King Saul, in his brief account of Israel’s history (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.21">Acts 13:21</a>). In one other NT reference Benjamin is named with the other 11 tribes in John’s apocalyptic vision (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.8">Rv 7:8</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=BenjaminPerson_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Benjamin (Person) #1</a>.</p>

<p class="list">1. Important OT city located about 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) north of Jerusalem on the north-south ridge road at the tribal borders of Benjamin and Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.1-2">Jos 16:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.13">18:13</a>). Hiel, a resident of the city, is referred to as a Bethelite in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kings 16:34</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). As a trading center, Bethel attracted merchandise both from the Mediterranean coast and from Transjordan via Jericho. Although the site was located in dry hill country, several springs supplied ample water for its inhabitants (the oldest artifact recovered from the site is a water jar dating from about 3500 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The name of Bethel, meaning “house of El (god),” may have been used as early as the fourth millennium <span class="era">BC</span> by Canaanites in the area. Archaeological excavations at Chalcolithic levels (i.e., between the Stone Age and the Bronze Age) indicate that pagan worship of the Canaanite deity El took place on top of the hill at that early period. The patriarch Jacob named the place Bethel, or gave the old name new significance, after having a dream from God there (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.10-22">Gn 28:10-22</a>). The site was said to be known as Bethel to the patriarch Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.8">12:8</a>); that designation, however, could be a scribal updating of a more ancient local name, since Bethel had earlier been known as Luz (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.19">28:19</a>). Possibly the sanctuary was known as Bethel, the nearby settlement as Luz. No doubt the name Bethel was firmly established by the beginning of the intermediate Bronze Age (c. 2200 <span class="era">BC</span>) and remained throughout its history. An OT passage mentioning both names records that a man from Luz founded another city of that name in Hittite territory (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.26">Jgs 1:26</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Although Bethel was assigned to Benjamin’s tribe, Ephraim’s tribe actually captured Bethel from its Canaanite fortress in their own territory (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.22-26">Jgs 1:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.28">1 Chr 7:28</a>). Under the judges, the ark of the covenant was located at Bethel, where the normal functions of Israelite worship were carried out; the ark was superintended by the high priest Phinehas, son of Eleazar (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.18-28">Jgs 20:18-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.21.2-4">21:2-4</a>). There is no archaeological evidence of Philistine occupation of Bethel in the time of the judges; in the days of King Saul it was bypassed when other Israelite centers were being attacked (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.1-14.52">1 Sm 12–14</a>). Archaeological discoveries indicate that Bethel flourished in the early reign of Saul but declined when he made Gibeah his capital city.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Israel and Judah became separate entities in the time of Jeroboam I (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>), Bethel returned to prominence as the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, thus becoming the counterpart of Judah’s capital, Jerusalem. Bethel was one of two northern cities where golden calves were worshiped (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.28-33">1 Kgs 12:28-33</a>); the sanctuary area for that cultic practice has not been discovered. The city was the home of an elderly prophet (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.11">13:11</a>) who may have been connected with the prophetic colony existing there in the time of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.2-3">2 Kgs 2:2-3</a>). During the reign of Judah’s King Abijah (913–910 <span class="era">BC</span>), Bethel fell under Judah’s control (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.19">2 Chr 13:19</a>) but later was returned to Israel. The prophet Amos went to Bethel to deliver scathing denunciations about contemporary social and religious life in Israel, for which the priest Amaziah had him expelled (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.10-13">Am 7:10-13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is no archaeological evidence that Bethel was destroyed during the Assyrian conquest of Israel (722 <span class="era">BC</span>). In fact, one of its deported priests was returned to Bethel to instruct Mesopotamian colonists in the ways of the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.28">2 Kgs 17:28</a>). Under Judah’s King Josiah, the pagan shrine was demolished (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.15-20">23:15-20</a>), but no damage was done to the city itself. Under either Nabonidus (555–539 <span class="era">BC</span>) or Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>), however, the city was burned, so that by Ezra’s time Bethel had reverted to a small village settlement (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.28">Ezr 2:28</a>).</p>

Occurrence of the phrase “mountains of spices” in an almost identical verse (<a href="?bref=Song.8.14">8:14</a>) suggests “spices” or a particular spice (such as cinnamon) as an appropriate translation of <span class="hebrew">bether</span><span class="ital">.</span> Bether also occurs as the name of the city Beth-anoth in the hill country of Judah in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.59">Joshua 15:59</a> (but only in the Septuagint). In <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.59">1 Chronicles 6:59</a> the Septuagint reads “Bether” instead of “Beth-shemesh.” Some scholars identify this Bether with Khir-bet el-Jehudiyeh, southwest of Bittir, which may preserve the ancient name. It is unlikely that Bether is related to the phrase “mountains of Bether.”</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 135, Bether became the site of the last Jewish stronghold against the Romans in the Second Revolt (<span class="era">AD</span> 132–135). There Simon Bar-Kochba, the designated “messiah,” and the Jewish forces were massacred.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">BETHESDA</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a pool in Jerusalem to which many sick and infirm people came (<a href="?bref=John.5.2">Jn 5:2</a>). Bethesda is an Aramaic word transliterated into Greek and is the name of a pool in Jerusalem in Jesus’ day that was surrounded by five porches or colonnades that gave an arcadelike walkway around the pool. Located near the Sheep Gate, it was the place where the handicapped and ill came with the hope they would be miraculously healed if they could get into the pool at the proper time.</p>
<p>A number of other forms of the name of this pool occur in different manuscripts. These are Bethsaida (“house of fish”), Belzetha, and Bezatha, the latter two apparently variants of Bethzaitha. Another form is Beth-zatha, meaning “house of olives.” Recent studies, especially of the Copper Scroll of Qumran Cave Three, suggest that Bethesda is the correct form among the several variations. Further, it is a dual form, which indicates that the site of Bethesda was characterized by two pools. This understanding shows that the older theory that Bethesda meant “house of mercy” is incorrect.</p>
<p>The archaeological activity of the Franciscan Fathers of the Church of St Anne near St Stephen’s Gate in the Old City has been a corrective of older views as well as the means of clarifying where the pool actually was. Their research has shown that the pool of Bethesda is not to be identified with Birket Israel, a pool about 360 feet (109.7 meters) by 126 feet (38.4 meters), located between St Anne’s and the temple area to the south; or with the large cisterns under the convent of the Sisters of Zion several hundred yards west of St Anne’s on the Via Dolorosa; or with the pool adjacent to the Gihon, still farther south than Birket Israel on the slope of Ophel. Rather, the pool of Bethesda is to be identified with the excavated ruin in the St Anne Courtyard, a ruin with two pools of considerable size. Arched pillars originally bordering the two reservoirs were covered intact with 25 to 30 feet (7.5 to 9 meters) of debris. Excavated, these now stand impressively as witness to an astounding architectural achievement.</p>
<p>Architectural style and inscription point to Herodian times, making it one of the many magnificent building projects of Herod the Great. The debris and ruins of several centuries were dumped into the pool area, filling the space around the still-standing colonnades. This debris was later leveled and a Byzantine church constructed on top of it in the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>. Thus through various literary and archaeological studies, Bethesda is now correctly understood to mean “a place of two pools” located near the Sheep Market of St Stephen’s Gate. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Bethsaida_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Bethsaida</a>; <a href="?item=BethZatha_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Beth-zatha</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">BETH-HORON</p>
<p class="fl">Canaanite place-name perhaps meaning “the house of Hauron,” the god of the underworld. Beth-horon was a dual settlement 10 and 12 miles (16.1 and 19.3 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem. Located on the boundary between the tribal territories of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.3,5">Jos 16:3, 5</a>), the twin settlements controlled the valley of Aijalon, one of the most important ancient routes between the Mediterranean coast and the interior hill country. The upper town controlled a strategic pass. Ephraim’s “Beth-horon with its pasture lands” was assigned to the Levite family of Kohath (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.22">Jos 21:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.68">1 Chr 6:68</a>).</p>
<p>Many armies marched through the Aijalon Valley. Amorites pursued by Joshua’s army fled past Beth-horon after being defeated at Gibeon on “the day the sun stood still” (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-14">Jos 10:1-14</a>). A band of Philistines approached it to make war with Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.18">1 Sm 13:18</a>). The Egyptian army of Shishak passed by Beth-horon (according to his Karnak inscription). Syrian armies under Seron (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.13-24">1 Macc 3:13-24</a>) and Nicanor (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.39-43">7:39-43</a>) were defeated by Judas Maccabeus at Beth-horon. The Romans under Cestius were nearly annihilated there by the Jews, according to Jewish historian Josephus.</p>
<p>Beth-horon was probably destroyed and rebuilt more than once. Sheerah, Beriah’s daughter and Ephraim’s granddaughter, is credited with building both lower and upper Beth-horon (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.24">1 Chr 7:24</a>). King Solomon fortified both Beth-horons after raids in the vicinity by an Egyptian pharaoh (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15-17">1 Kgs 9:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.8.5">2 Chr 8:5</a>).

<p class="h1">BETHLEHEM</p>
<p class="list">1. “City of David” and the birthplace of Jesus Christ, five miles (8 kilometers) south of Jerusalem. This city is sometimes called Bethlehem-judah (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or Ephrath (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.19">Gn 35:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Mi 5:2</a>) to distinguish it from the Bethlehem of Zebulun.</p>
<p class="list-text">As an early Canaanite settlement, it was associated with the patriarchs, for Rachel died and was buried in its vicinity (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.16,19">Gn 35:16, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.48.7">48:7</a>). The earliest known historical reference to Bethlehem occurs in the Amarna texts (14th century <span class="era">BC</span>) in which battle reports refer to <span class="ital">bitil u-lahama</span> south of Jerusalem. The name may have meant “house of (the goddess) Lahama.” A branch of Caleb’s family settled there, and Caleb’s son Salma was known as “the father of Bethlehem” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.51">1 Chr 2:51</a>). Bethlehem was the home of a young Levite who served as priest to Micah (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.7-8">Jgs 17:7-8</a>), and of Boaz, Ruth, Obed, and Jesse, the Bethlehemite, David’s father (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.11,17">Ru 4:11, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.18">1 Sm 16:18</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Bethlehem was the birthplace of David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.12">1 Sm 17:12</a>) and the home of one of David’s mighty men, Elhanan (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.24">2 Sm 23:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.26">1 Chr 11:26</a>). It was the scene of a daring exploit by three of David’s warriors; they broke through the cordon of Philistine marauders occupying Bethlehem to bring David water from the well (or cistern) near the city gate of his hometown (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.14-17">2 Sm 23:14-17</a>). Much later, Bethlehem is mentioned as being adjacent to the village of Geruth-kimham, where Jews fleeing from the Babylonians stayed en route to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.17">Jer 41:17</a>). People from Bethlehem were among those returning from the Babylonian exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.21">Ezr 2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.26">Neh 7:26</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.5.17">1 Esd 5:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Jesus was born there, Bethlehem was only a village (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-16">Mt 2:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.4-6,15">Lk 2:4-6, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.42">Jn 7:42</a>). Under the census decree of Caesar Augustus, Joseph had to go to Bethlehem “because he was of the house and lineage of David” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.4">Lk 2:4</a>). The family may still have had property there. The birth of Jesus possibly took place in a cave in the rocks outside the town. The early Christian writer Justin Martyr thought so, as did Origen some years later. Origen frequently resided in the Holy Land and wrote, “In Bethlehem you are shown the cave where he was born, and within the cave the manger where he was wrapped in swaddling clothes.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Jerome later described the grotto over which the Emperor Constantine had built a basilica. In excavations in 1934–35, evidence indicated a second period of building in the reign of Justinian (<span class="era">AD</span> 527–565), when Constantine’s basilica was extended beyond its original proportions. Steps lead down to the grotto, the rectangular shape of which suggests that Constantine’s builders reshaped the original. But there is no description of the grotto prior to the construction of Constantine’s basilica.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in Zebulun (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.15">Jos 19:15</a>), probably the home of the judge Ibzan (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.8-10">Jgs 12:8-10</a>), an early ruler of Israel. It is identified today with the village of Beit Lahm, some seven miles (11.3 kilometers) northwest of Nazareth.</p>

  <title>Bethsaida</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BETHSAIDA</p>
<p class="list">1. Town northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Bethsaida was the home of three of Jesus’ disciples: Andrew, Peter, and Philip (<a href="?bref=John.1.44">Jn 1:44</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.21">12:21</a>). Jesus announced that calamity would come upon Bethsaida because of its unbelief in spite of the mighty works he had done there (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.21-22">Mt 11:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.13">Lk 10:13</a>). A blind man was healed in Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">Mk 8:22-26</a>), and nearby over 5,000 people were fed by the miracle of the loaves and fish (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.34-45">Mk 6:34-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.10-17">Lk 9:10-17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Bethsaida is mentioned in several ancient sources, chiefly the writings of Josephus, a first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Jewish historian. Two Bethsaidas, one on each side of the Sea of Galilee, were once postulated because the reference in Mark mentions the feeding of the 5,000 as happening across the lake from Bethsaida, whereas in Luke it seems to have taken place near Bethsaida. One solution is that the miracle occurred in the district surrounding Bethsaida, but that the quickest way to reach the city itself was to cross part of the lake. Such an interpretation questions the traditional location of the miracle (et-Tabgha on the west shore, nearer to Capernaum) but is preferable to the proposal of two Bethsaidas so close to each other.</p>
<p class="list-text">Bethsaida was merely a fishing village until it was enlarged and beautified by Philip the tetrarch (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 34), son of Herod the Great, after the death of Caesar Augustus. Philip was later buried there, according to Josephus. Bethsaida’s name was changed to Julias in honor of Julia, daughter of Augustus. That city was defended by Josephus when he was its military commander during the first Jewish revolt against Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70).</p>
<p class="list-text">Josephus wrote that Bethsaida was “at the lake of Gennesareth” but “near to the Jordan River.” He also said that it was in lower Gaulanitis, a district that touched the northeast quarter of the Sea of Galilee. There is, however, no ancient “tell” or ruin fitting the size or description of the city near either the lake or the river. A suggestion that the small harbor of el-’Araj is the site of Bethsaida has little archaeological support, but et-Tell, located about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from the lake, shows evidence of extensive Roman occupation and building activity. At present, et-Tell seems to be the most satisfactory candidate for identification of Bethsaida.</p>

  <title>Beth-Shan, Beth-Shean*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BETH-SHAN, BETH-SHEAN*</p>
<p class="fl">Strategic Palestinian town located in the subtropical Jordan Valley 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) south of the Sea of Galilee and 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) west of the Jordan River. Beth-shan (alternately Beth-shean) stood at the eastern end of the valley of Jezreel, guarding an important Jordan River crossing. It lay at the junction of two trade routes, one leading north toward Galilee and Damascus, the other leading from the mountains of Gilead west through the Jezreel Valley and the hills of Samaria.</p>
<p>When the Philistines defeated Israel under King Saul at the battle on Mt Gilboa, Beth-shan was a Philistine city. The slain bodies of Saul and his sons were hung in disgrace on the city wall, and Saul’s head was displayed in the temple of Dagon, a Philistine deity (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.10-13">1 Sm 31:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.12-14">2 Sm 21:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.10.8-10">1 Chr 10:8-10</a>). The city later became a part of David’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Identification of Beth-shan with Tell el-Husn is confirmed by two Egyptian texts found there that mention its name. The tell, or mound, is 213 feet (64.9 meters) high and about one-half mile (804.5 meters) in circumference at its base. At the time of Israel’s conquest of Canaan, the area that included Beth-shan was allotted to Issachar’s tribe, but Manasseh’s tribe evidently took it over (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.11">Jos 17:11</a>). Under King Solomon it was incorporated into the administrative district of Baanah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). The city is thought to have been destroyed by Shishak (Sheshonk I), pharaoh of Egypt in the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>. It was insignificant during the remainder of the OT period; occupation during the Babylonian exile and the postexilic Persian period seems to have been sporadic.</p>
<p>In the Hellenistic period Beth-shan received the name Scythopolis, presumably because it was settled by a colony of Scythian mercenaries serving the Egyptian king Ptolemy II. Temples to the Greek deities Dionysus and Zeus were built. Under the Hasmonean dynasty, Beth-shan became an important administrative center. It prospered as a member of the league of Greco-Roman commercial cities called Decapolis (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.25">Mt 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.31">Mk 7:31</a>) and was the only league member west of the Jordan.</p>

Beth-shemesh was one of the towns of Judah granted to the Levites (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.16">Jos 21:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.59">1 Chr 6:59</a>).

When the Philistines decided to dispose of the captured ark of the covenant because plagues were breaking out in their cities, they took it to Beth-shemesh. The area was also the scene of a great victory of King Joash (Jehoash) of Israel over King Amaziah of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.21-23">2 Chr 25:21-23</a>). About a century later, Beth-shemesh was captured from King Ahaz of Judah by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.16-20">28:16-20</a>).

<p class="h1">BIBLE*</p>
<p class="fl">Derived from the Greek <span class="greek">biblia</span> (“books”), which, though plural, came to be used as a singular noun and to stand for the collection of books known as the Scriptures. The idea of a collection of holy writings developed early in Hebrew-Christian thought. Daniel in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> spoke of a prophetic writing as “the books” (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.2">Dn 9:2</a>). The writer of 1 Maccabees (second century <span class="era">BC</span>) referred to the OT as “the holy books” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.9">12:9</a>). Jesus referred to the OT books as “the scriptures” (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.42">Mt 21:42</a>), and Paul spoke of them as “the holy scriptures” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.2">Rom 1:2</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible is divided into the Old Testament and the New Testament. Of course, there was no OT and NT before the coming of Christ, only one collection of sacred writings. But after the apostles and their associates produced another body of sacred literature, the church began to refer to the OT and the NT. Actually “testament” is the translation of a Greek word that might better be rendered “covenant.” It denotes an arrangement made by God for the spiritual guidance and benefit of human beings. The covenant is unalterable: humankind may accept it or reject it but cannot change it. “Covenant” is a common OT word; of several covenants described in the OT, the most prominent was the law given to Moses. While Israel was chafing and failing under the Mosaic covenant, God promised them a “new covenant” (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31">Jer 31:31</a>).</p>
<p>The term “new covenant” appears several times in the NT. Jesus used it when he instituted the Lord’s Supper; by it he sought to call attention to the new basis of communion with God he intended to establish by his death (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>). The apostle Paul also spoke of that new covenant (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6,14">2 Cor 3:6, 14</a>), as did the writer to the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.8">Heb 8:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.11-15">9:11-15</a>). The detailed description of God’s new method of dealing with people (on the basis of the finished work of Christ on the cross) is the subject of the 27 books of the NT. God’s dealing with people in anticipation of the coming of Messiah (Hebrew equivalent of “Christ,” meaning “anointed one”) is certainly the major theme of the 39 books of the OT, though they deal with much more than that. Latin church writers used <span class="ital">testamentum</span> to translate “covenant,” and from them the use passed into English; so old and new covenants became OT and NT.</p>
<p>At least the first half of the OT follows a logical and easily understood arrangement. In Genesis through Esther the history of Israel from Abraham to the restoration under Persian auspices appears largely in chronological order. Then follows a group of poetic books and the Major and Minor Prophets (“Major” meaning the books that are relatively long; “Minor” meaning the books that are relatively short).</p>
<p>The NT also follows a generally logical arrangement. It begins with the four Gospels, which describe the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Christ and his training of disciples to carry on his work after his ascension. The book of Acts continues the narrative where the Gospels end and details the founding of the church and its spread through Mediterranean lands. In the latter part of the book the spotlight focuses on the apostle Paul and his church planting activities. Next come letters Paul addressed to churches he founded or to young ministers he tried to encourage. Following the Pauline Epistles come a group commonly called the General Epistles. The last book, Revelation, is an apocalyptic work.</p>
<p>The OT was written almost entirely in Hebrew with a few isolated passages in Aramaic in the latter books. If one accepts the view that Moses wrote the first five books of the OT (the position the Scripture itself takes), the earliest books of the OT were written by about 1400 <span class="era">BC</span> (provided one accepts the early date proposed for the exodus). If the last book written was Malachi (before 400 <span class="era">BC</span>), composition took place during 1,000 years of time. All the writers (some 30 in number) were Jews: prophets, judges, kings, and other leaders in Israel.</p>
<p>The NT was probably written entirely in Greek. If James was the first to write a NT book before the middle of the first century, and if John was the last (composing Revelation about <span class="era">AD</span> 90), the NT was written during a 50-year period in the latter half of the first century. All the writers (probably nine) were Jews, with the exception of Luke (writer of Luke and Acts), and they came from a variety of walks of life: fishermen, doctor, tax collector, and religious leaders.</p>
<p>In spite of great diversity of authorship in the OT and NT, and composition spanning over 1,500 years, there is remarkable unity in the total thrust. Christians believe that God must have been superintending the production of a divine-human book that would properly present his message to humankind.</p>
<p>The OT and NT are component parts of one divine revelation. The OT describes man and woman in the first paradise on the old earth; the NT concludes with a vision of the new heaven and new earth. The OT sees humankind as fallen from a sinless condition and separated from God; the NT views believers as restored to favor through the sacrifice of Christ. The OT predicts a coming Redeemer who will rescue men and women from eternal condemnation; the NT reveals the Christ who brought salvation. In most of the OT the spotlight focuses on a sacrificial system in which the blood of animals provided a temporary handling of the sin problem; in the New, Christ appeared as the one who came to put an end to all sacrifice—to be himself the supreme sacrifice. In the OT, numerous predictions foretold a coming Messiah who would save his people; in the New, scores of passages detail how those prophecies were minutely fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ: the “son of Abraham” and the “son of David” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>). As Augustine said more than 1,500 years ago, “The New is in the Old contained; the Old is in the New explained.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheAuthorityoftheBible">The Authority of the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">Judge of men and nations, the self-revealed God wields unlimited authority and power. All creaturely authority and power is derived from that of God. As the sovereign Creator of all, the God of the Bible wills and has the right to be obeyed. The power God bestows is a divine trust, a stewardship. God’s creatures are morally accountable for their use or misuse of it. In fallen human society God wills civil government for the promotion of justice and order. He approves an ordering of authoritative and creative relationships in the home by stipulating certain responsibilities of husbands, wives, and children. He wills a pattern of priorities for the church as well: Jesus Christ the head, prophets and apostles through whom redemptive revelation came, and so on. The inspired Scriptures, revealing God’s transcendent will in objective written form, are the rule of faith and conduct through which Christ exercises his divine authority in the lives of Christians.</p>
<p>Revolt against particular authorities has in our time widened into a revolt against all transcendent and external authority. The widespread questioning of authority is condoned and promoted in many academic circles. Philosophers with a radically secular outlook have affirmed that God and the supernatural are mythical conceptions, that natural processes and events comprise the only ultimate reality. All existence is said to be temporal and changing, all beliefs and ideals are declared to be relative to the age and culture in which they appear. Biblical religion, therefore, like all other, is asserted to be merely a cultural phenomenon. The Bible’s claim to divine authority is dismissed by such thinkers; transcendent revelation, fixed truths, and unchanging commandments are set aside as pious fictions.</p>
<p>In the name of man’s supposed “coming of age,” radical secularism champions human autonomy and creative individuality. Man is his own lord and the inventor of his own ideals and values, it is said. He lives in a supposedly purposeless universe that has itself presumably been engendered by a cosmic accident. Therefore, human beings are declared to be wholly free to impose upon nature and history whatever moral criteria they prefer. In such a view, to insist on divinely given truths and values, on transcendent principles, would be to repress self-fulfillment and retard creative personal development. Hence, the radically secular view goes beyond opposing particular external authorities whose claims are considered arbitrary or immoral; radical secularism is aggressively hostile to all external and objective authority, viewing it as intrinsically restrictive of the autonomous human spirit.</p>
<p>Any reader of the Bible recognizes rejection of divine authority and of a definitive revelation of what is right and good as an age-old phenomenon. It is not at all peculiar to contemporary man to “come of age”; it was found already in Eden. Adam and Eve revolted against the will of God in pursuit of individual preference and self-interest. But their revolt was recognized to be sin, not rationalized as philosophical <span class="greek">gnosis</span> at the frontiers of evolutionary advance.</p>
<p>If one takes a strictly developmental view, which considers all reality contingent and changing, what basis remains for humanity’s decisively creative role in the universe? How could a purposeless cosmos cater to individual self-fulfillment? Only the biblical alternative of the Creator-Redeemer God, who fashioned human beings for moral obedience and a high spiritual destiny, truly preserves the permanent, universal dignity of the human species. The Bible does so, however, by a demanding call for personal spiritual decision. The Bible sets forth man’s superiority to the animals, his high dignity (“a little lower than God,” <a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Ps 8:5</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>) because of the divine rational and moral image that he bears by creation. In the context of universal human involvement in Adamic sin, the Bible utters a merciful divine call to redemptive renewal through the mediatorial person and work of Christ. Fallen humanity is invited to experience the Holy Spirit’s renewing work, to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ, and to anticipate a final destiny in the eternal presence of the God of justice and justification.</p>
<p>Contemporary rejection of biblical tenets does not rest on any logical demonstration that the case for biblical theism is false; it turns rather on a subjective preference for alternative views of “the good life.”</p>
<p>The Bible is not the only significant reminder that human beings stand daily in responsible relationship to the sovereign God. The Creator reveals his authority in the cosmos, in history, and in inner conscience, a disclosure of the living God that penetrates into the mind of every human being (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-20">Rom 1:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.12-15">2:12-15</a>). Rebellious suppression of that “general divine revelation” does not succeed in wholly suspending a fearsome sense of final divine accountability (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.32">1:32</a>). Yet it is the Bible as “special revelation” that most clearly confronts our spiritually rebellious race with the reality and authority of God. In the Scriptures, the character and will of God, the meaning of human existence, the nature of the spiritual realm, and the purposes of God for human beings in all ages are stated in propositionally intelligible form that all can understand. The Bible publishes in objective form the criteria by which God judges individuals and nations, and the means of moral recovery and restoration to personal fellowship with him.</p>
<p>Regard for the Bible is therefore decisive for the course of Western culture and in the long run for human civilization generally. Intelligible divine revelation, the basis for belief in the sovereign authority of the Creator-Redeemer God over all human life, rests on the reliability of what Scripture says about God and his purposes. Modern naturalism impugns the authority of the Bible and assails the claim that the Bible is the Word of God written, that is, a transcendently given revelation of the mind and will of God in objective literary form. Scriptural authority is the storm center both in the controversy over revealed religion and in the modern conflict over civilizational values.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBiblesViewofItself">The Bible’s View of Itself</p>
<p class="fl">The intelligible nature of divine revelation—the presupposition that God’s will is made known in the form of valid truths—is the central presupposition of the authority of the Bible. Much recent neo-Protestant theology demeaned the traditional evangelical emphasis as doctrinaire and static. It insisted instead that the authority of Scripture is to be experienced internally as a witness to divine grace engendering faith and obedience, thus disowning its objective character as universally valid truth. Somewhat inconsistently, almost all neo-Protestant theologians have appealed to the record to support cognitively whatever fragments of the whole seem to coincide with their divergent views, even though they disavow the Bible as a specially revealed corpus of authoritative divine teaching. If God’s revelational disclosure to chosen prophets and apostles is to be considered meaningful and true, it must be given not merely in isolated concepts capable of diverse meanings but in sentences or propositions. A proposition—that is, a subject, predicate, and connecting verb (or “copula”)—constitutes the minimal logical unit of intelligible communication. The OT prophetic formula “Thus saith the Lord” characteristically introduced propositionally disclosed truth. Jesus Christ employed the distinctive formula “But I say unto you” to introduce logically formed sentences that he represented as the veritable word or doctrine of God.</p>
<p>The Bible is authoritative because it is divinely authorized; in its own terms, “all Scripture is God-breathed” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.16">2 Tm 3:16</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). According to this passage, the whole OT (or any element of it) is divinely inspired. Extension of the same claim to the NT is not expressly stated, but it is not merely implied. The New Testament contains indications that its content was to be viewed, and was in fact viewed, as no less authoritative than the Old. The apostle Paul’s writings are catalogued with “other Scriptures” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.15-16">2 Pt 3:15-16</a>). Under the heading of “Scripture,” <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.18">1 Timothy 5:18</a> cites <a href="?bref=Luke.10.7">Luke 10:7</a> alongside <a href="?bref=Deut.25.4">Deuteronomy 25:4</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.9">1 Cor 9:9</a>). The book of Revelation, moreover, claims divine origin (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1-3">1:1-3</a>) and employs the term “prophecy” in the OT sense (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.9-10,18">22:9-10, 18</a>). The apostles did not distinguish their spoken and written teaching but expressly declared their inspired proclamation to be the word of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.1">1 Cor 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.20">2 Cor 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.13">1 Thes 2:13</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible remains the most extensively printed, most widely translated, and most frequently read book in the world. Its words have been treasured in the hearts of multitudes like none other’s. All who have received its gifts of wisdom and promises of new life and power were at first strangers to its redemptive message, and many were hostile to its teaching and spiritual demands. In all generations its power to challenge persons of all races and lands has been demonstrated. Those who cherish the Book because it sustains future hope, brings meaning and power to the present, and correlates a misused past with the forgiving grace of God would not long experience such inner rewards if Scripture were not known to them as the authoritative, divinely revealed truth. To the Christian, Scripture is the Word of God given in the objective form of propositional truths through divinely inspired prophets and apostles, and the Holy Spirit is the giver of faith through that word.</p>

<p class="fl">Those books in the Jewish and Christian Bible considered to be Scripture and therefore authoritative in matters of faith and doctrine. The term translates both a Greek and a Hebrew word that mean “a rule,” or “measuring rod.” It is a list to which other books are compared and by which they are measured. After the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>, the Christian church found itself with only 66 books that constituted its Scripture; 27 of these were the NT and 39 were the OT. Just as Plato, Aristotle, and Homer form a canon of Greek literature, so the NT books became the canon of Christian literature. The criteria for selecting the books in the Jewish canon (the OT) are not known but clearly had to do with their worth in the ongoing life and religion of the worshiping nation. The criteria of the selection of NT books revolved around their “apostolicity,” according to early church writers. Like those of the OT, these books were collected and preserved by local churches in the continuing process of their worship and need for authoritative guidance for Christian living. The formation of the canon was a process, rather than an event, that took several hundred years to reach finality in all parts of the Roman Empire. Local canons were the basis for comparison, and out of them eventually emerged the general canon that exists in Christendom today, although some of the Eastern churches have a NT that is slightly smaller than that accepted in the West. Judaism, as well as Christianity as a whole, believes that the Spirit of God was operative in some providential way in the production and preservation of his Word.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CanonoftheOldTestament">Canon of the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The Old Testament is a name that does not appear in Jewish literature. Jews prefer to call their collection of Scriptures the TANAK—an acronym formed from the first letters of <span class="ital">Torah</span> (Law), <span class="ital">Nevi</span><span class="ital">’</span><span class="ital">im</span> (Prophets), and <span class="ital">Kethubim</span> (Writings). In <a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">Luke 24:44</a> (<span class="sc">niv</span>), these are called the “Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms” (the first book of the Writings in the Hebrew Bible). Christians called their collection of writings the New Testament, or covenant, the latter term being a designation earlier used of the agreement God made with Abraham and the patriarchs, which was repeated by Christ to his apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>). Christians in the first century considered their new covenant from Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>) to be a continuation of the one made earlier with the patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.12">Eph 2:12</a>), spoken of by the prophets (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>), and which was therefore called a former covenant (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.7-13">Heb 8:7-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1,15-22">9:1, 15-22</a>) or in later centuries the OT. The terms “Old” and “New” do not appear in the apostolic fathers of the first and second century or in the apologists of the early- to mid-second century, but they do appear in the latter half of the second century in Justin Martyr (<span class="ital">Dialogues</span> 11:2), Irenaeus (<span class="ital">Against Heresies</span> 4.9.1), and Clement of Alexandria (<span class="ital">Stromata</span> 1:5). In these authors the expression referred more to the covenant itself than to the books containing it, though the transfer was eventually made. The term “canon” was not used in the OT or NT to refer to the Jewish Scriptures. The idea of limitation inherent in the word was not appropriate to the nature of religious authority in Jewish religion during the thousand years when the OT books were being written. Only the Torah was conceived as incapable of being added to or taken from (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.2">Dt 4:2</a>). Jewish religion existed for a millennium, from Moses to Malachi, without a closed canon, i.e., an exclusive list of authoritative books. Never in their history did the people of the OT have the entire 39 books of the OT. When their canon was closed is not known. Although some questions were being asked about religious authority by rabbis at Jamnia 20 years after the fall of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, we have our first list of 39 books produced by Melito of Sardis around <span class="era">AD</span> 170. That list included no books written after the time of Malachi, unless one is disposed to date Daniel to the second century. The Prophets and the Writings were always considered secondary to the Law. Their composition and collection was a process rather than an event in the life of the people of Israel and functioned largely as a record of the nation’s response to the Law, which was so sacred that it was kept (according to rabbinical tradition: Babylonian Talmud, <span class="ital">Baba Bathra</span> 14a; cf. also <span class="ital">Cairo Damascus Document</span> 5.2) in the ark of the covenant that stood in the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle. In <a href="?bref=Deut.31.26">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>, however, the Levites were commanded by Moses merely to put the Book of the Law beside the ark. Nevertheless, its very presence in the Holy of Holies establishes its uniqueness in relation to other OT books.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TheOldTestamentCanon"/>
<p>The 39 books of the modern OT were originally divided into only 24, according to the uniform testimony of early Hebrew tradition. The Talmud, rabbinic literature, and probably 4 Esdras testify to this arrangement that included five books of the Law, eight Prophets, and eleven Writings (Greek—Hagiographa). Modern Hebrew Bibles reflect this tripartite arrangement that was used in the first three printed editions (Soncino, 1488; Naples, 1491–1493; Brescia, 1492–1494). The Law contained the Pentateuch in our familiar order, Genesis to Deuteronomy. The eight Prophets were Joshua, Judges, Samuel (1 and 2), Kings (1 and 2), Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Minor Prophets (all 12), which were considered as one book and arranged in the same order as our English Bibles. The eleven books of Writings contained three of poetry (Ps, Prv, Jb), the Five Scrolls (Sg, Ru, Lam, Eccl, Est), which were read at the important feasts and arranged in the chronological order of their observance, and three of narrative or historical (Dn, Ezr-Neh, 1 and 2 Chr).</p>
<p>Apart from authentic Jewish tradition, efforts were made to divide the books into 21, combining Ruth with Judges, and Lamentations with Jeremiah. Josephus was the first to do so, in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, but he was influenced by the Greek OT, the Septuagint. Origen observed in the early third century that this arrangement also corresponded to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, as did Athanasius in the fourth, and others, including Jerome. It was dubiously concluded that the number of books in the Hebrew Bible had been divinely ordained to agree with the number of letters of the Hebrew alphabet! Church fathers added their support to this coincidence, which became providence to them. All such efforts, however, are of Greek origin and have no support in Hebrew tradition.</p>
<p>The oldest extant manuscripts of the complete OT in Hebrew are the Masoretic Texts, which are no earlier than the eighth century <span class="era">AD</span>. Only manuscripts of individual books have been found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Masoretic scribes apparently laid down no rules about arrangement of books because there is no uniform order of the Latter Prophets or the Writings in early Hebrew manuscripts. Nor is the situation any different in ancient Greek translations of the Hebrew. Great diversity exists in the order of books in all three of our oldest manuscripts—Codex Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, and Sinaiticus. All the early Christian authors who profess to give the order and contents of the Hebrew Bible but who do not reflect the Hebrew tripartite division are clearly dependent on the Alexandrian order reflected in these Greek editions, rather than on the Hebrew Bible. Modern Protestant Bibles follow the order of the Latin Vulgate and the content of the Hebrew. Both the Vulgate and the Septuagint (Greek translation) contained the Apocrypha, which was never accepted by the Jews. The Roman Catholic Church includes the Apocrypha in its English translations because of the influence of the Vulgate on Catholic tradition. It is considered deuterocanonical.</p>
<p>Even though no uniformity of order was maintained, the Alexandrian order, reflected in the Greek manuscripts, generally arranged books according to their subject matter—narrative, history, poetry, and prophecy, with the apocryphal books appropriately interspersed into these categories. The Hebrew division was totally ignored.</p>
<p>Early Hebrew Bibles divided the text into small paragraphs and larger sections somewhat akin to our paragraphs. These were indicated by spaces left between them—three letters between the small sections and nine letters between the larger ones. The number of sections is not the same in all manuscripts. Jesus probably referred to such sections in his comment concerning the “passage about the bush” (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.26">Mk 12:26</a>). Later, liturgical needs led to further divisions of the text for the complete reading of the Law in Babylonian synagogues in one year (54 sections) and in Palestinian synagogues in three years (154 sections). These are reflected in the lectionary cycles marked in some early Hebrew Bibles.</p>
<p>The division of the text into modern chapters, done in the 13th century (c. 1228) for the Latin Vulgate by Stephen Langton, was applied to the Hebrew Bible in 1518 (Bomberg Edition), but the numbers were not given to the chapters until 1571 in the text of Montanus, a Hebrew Bible with Latin interlinear translation. The verses were introduced in Bomberg’s Great Bible of 1547–48 in which every fifth verse was designated by a Hebrew numeral 1, 5, 10, and so on. Verses were inserted into the Latin Vulgate in 1555 in the small octavo edition of Stephanus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CanonoftheNewTestament">Canon of the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT was written within the period of half a century, several hundred years after the completion of the OT. Both halves of that statement would be questioned by modern critics, who would extend the time span for completion of both Testaments. The writer of this survey is confident of its truthfulness to historic fact, however, and the approach taken to canonization of both OT and NT is based solidly upon that twofold premise.</p>
<p>In a sense, we possess far higher certification of the OT canon than of the NT canon. We refer to the fact of our Lord’s own imprimatur by way of his use of the Hebrew Scriptures as the authoritative Word of God. Yet there is a sense in which Jesus Christ did establish the NT content or canon as well, by way of anticipation. It was he who promised, “The Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you” and “he will guide you into all truth” (<a href="?bref=John.14.26">Jn 14:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.13">16:13</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TheNewTestamentCanon"/>
<p>From this we can derive, in turn, the basic principle of canonicity for the NT. It is identical to that of the OT, since it narrows down to a matter of divine inspiration. Whether we think of the prophets of OT times or the apostles and their God-given associates of the New, the recognition at the very time of their writing that they were authentic spokesmen for God is what determines the intrinsic canonicity of their writing. It is altogether God’s Word only if it is God-breathed. We can be assured that the books under question were received by the church of the apostolic age precisely when they had been certified by an apostle as being thus inspired. The apparent variation, relative to geographic area, in acknowledgment of some of the NT epistles may well reflect the simple fact that this attestation was by its very nature localized at first. Conversely, that all 27 books of the now universally received NT were ultimately agreed upon is evidence that proper attestation was indeed confirmed after rigorous investigation.</p>
<p>Tertullian, an outstanding Christian writer in the first two decades of the third century, was one of the first to call the Christian Scriptures the “New Testament.” That title had appeared earlier (c. 190) in a composition against Montanism, the author of which is unknown. This is significant. Its use placed the NT Scripture on a level of inspiration and authority with the OT.</p>
<p>From available information, the gradual process that led to full and formal public recognition of a fixed canon of the 27 books comprising the NT takes us down into the fourth century of our era. This does not necessarily mean that these Scriptures were lacking recognition in their entirety before that time, but that a need for officially defining the canon was not pressing until then.</p>
<p>Though a much shorter period of time was involved in the writing of the NT than the OT, the geographic range of its origin is far wider. This circumstance alone is sufficient to account for a lack of spontaneous or simultaneous recognition of the precise extent of the NT canon. Because of the geographic isolation of the various recipients of portions of the NT, there was bound to be some lag and uncertainty from one region to another in the acknowledgment of some of the books.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate just what did transpire in the process of canonization of the NT books, we must review the facts available to us. This will enable us to analyze <span class="ital">how</span> and <span class="ital">why</span> our early Christian forebears settled upon the 27 books in our NT.</p>
<p>The historic process was a gradual and continuous one, but it will help us understand it if we subdivide the nearly three and a half centuries involved into shorter periods of time. Some speak of three major stages toward canonization. This implies, without justification, that there are readily discernible steps along the way. Others simply present a long list of the names of persons and documents involved. Such a list makes it difficult to sense any motion at all. A somewhat arbitrary breakdown into five periods will be made here, with the reminder that the spreading of the knowledge of sacred literature and the deepening consensus as to its authenticity as inspired Scripture continued uninterruptedly. The periods are:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. First Century</p>
<p class="list">2. First Half of Second Century</p>
<p class="list">3. Second Half of Second Century</p>
<p class="list">4. Third Century</p>
<p class="list">5. Fourth Century</p>
<p class="sp">Again, without meaning to imply that these are clear-cut stages, it will be helpful to notice the major trends observable in each of the periods just identified. In the first period, of course, the various books were written, but they also began to be copied and disseminated among the churches. In the second, as they became more widely known and cherished for their contents, they began to be cited as authoritative. By the end of the third period, they held a recognized place alongside the OT as “Scripture,” and they began to be both translated into regional languages and made the subject of commentaries. During the third century <span class="era">AD</span>, our fourth period, the collecting of books into a whole “New Testament” was underway, together with a sifting process that was separating them from other Christian literature. The final, or fifth, period finds the church fathers of the fourth century stating that conclusions regarding the canon have been reached that indicate acceptance by the whole church. Thus, in the most strict and formal sense of the word, the canon had become fixed. It remains to list in greater detail the forces and individuals that produced the written sources witnessing to this remarkable process through which, by God’s providence, we have inherited our NT.</p>
<p class="h3">Period One: First Century</p>
<p class="fl">The principle determining recognition of the authority of the canonical NT writings was established within the content of those writings themselves. There are repeated exhortations for public reading of the apostolic communications. At the close of his First Letter to the Thessalonians, possibly the first book of the NT to be written, Paul says, “I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.27">1 Thes 5:27</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Earlier in the same letter Paul commends their ready acceptance of his spoken word as “the word of God” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.2.13">2:13</a>), and in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.37">1 Corinthians 14:37</a> he speaks similarly of his “writings,” insisting that his message be recognized as a commandment from the Lord himself. (See also <a href="?bref=Col.4.16">Col 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.3">Rv 1:3</a>.) In <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.15-16">2 Peter 3:15-16</a> Paul’s letters are included with “the other Scriptures.” Since Peter’s is a general letter, widespread knowledge of Paul’s letters is thereby implied. Highly indicative also is Paul’s usage in <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.18">1 Timothy 5:18</a>. He follows up the formula “the Scriptures say” by a combined quotation about not muzzling an ox (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.4">Dt 25:4</a>) and “the worker deserves his wages” (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.10.7">Lk 10:7</a>). Thus, an equivalence is implied between OT Scripture and a NT Gospel.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 95, Clement of Rome wrote to the Christians in Corinth using a free rendering of material from Matthew and Luke. He seems to be strongly influenced by Hebrews and is obviously familiar with Romans and Corinthians. There are also reflections of Ephesians, 1 Timothy, Titus, and 1 Peter.</p>
<p class="h3">Period Two: First Half of Second Century</p>
<p class="fl">One of the earliest NT manuscripts yet discovered, a fragment of John from Egypt known as the John Rylands papyrus, demonstrates how the writings of the apostle John were revered and copied by about <span class="era">AD</span> 125, within 30 to 35 years of his death. There is evidence that within 30 years of the apostle’s death all the Gospels and Pauline letters were known and used in all those centers from which any evidence has come down to us. It is true that some of the smaller letters were being questioned as to their authority in some quarters for perhaps another 50 years, but this was due only to uncertainty about their authorship in those particular locales. This demonstrates that acceptance was not being imposed by the actions of councils but was rather happening spontaneously through a normal response on the part of those who had learned the facts about authorship. In those places where the churches were uncertain about the authorship or apostolic approval of certain books, acceptance was slower.</p>
<p>The first three outstanding church fathers, Clement, Polycarp, and Ignatius, used the bulk of the material of the NT in a revealingly casual manner—authenticated Scriptures were being accepted as authoritative without argument. In the writings of these men only Mark (which closely parallels the material of Matthew), 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude are not clearly attested.</p>
<p>The Epistles of Ignatius (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 115) have correspondences in several places with the Gospels and seem to incorporate language from a number of the Pauline letters. The Didache (or Teaching of the Twelve), perhaps even earlier, makes references to a written Gospel. Most important is the fact that Clement, Barnabas, and Ignatius all draw a clear distinction between their own and the inspired, authoritative apostolic writings.</p>
<p>It is in the Epistle of Barnabas (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 130) that we first find the formula “it is written” (4:14) used in reference to a NT book (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.14">Mt 22:14</a>). But even before this, Polycarp, who had personal acquaintance with eyewitnesses of our Lord’s ministry, used a combined OT and NT quotation. Citing Paul’s admonition in <a href="?bref=Eph.4.26">Ephesians 4:26</a>, where the apostle quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.4.4">Psalm 4:4</a> and makes an addition, Polycarp in his Epistle to the Philippians introduces the reference by “as it is said in these Scriptures” (12:4). Then Papias, bishop of Hierapolis (c. 130–140), in a work preserved for us by Eusebius, mentions by name the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, and his use of them as the basis of exposition indicates his acceptance of them as canonical. Also around <span class="era">AD</span> 140, the recently discovered Gospel of Truth (a Gnostic-oriented work probably authored by Valentinius) makes an important contribution. Its use of canonical NT sources, treating them as authoritative, is comprehensive enough to warrant the conclusion that in Rome at this period there was a NT compilation in existence corresponding very closely to our own. Citations are made from the Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul, Hebrews, and the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>The heretic Marcion, by defining a limited canon of his own (c. 140), in effect hastened the day when the orthodox believers needed to declare themselves on this issue. Rejecting the entire OT, Marcion settled for Luke’s Gospel (eliminating chapters <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-80">1</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-52">2</a> as too Jewish) and Paul’s letters (except for the pastoral ones). Interestingly, especially in the light of <a href="?bref=Col.4.16">Colossians 4:16</a>, he substitutes the name “Laodiceans” for Ephesians.</p>
<p>Near the end of this period, Justin Martyr, in describing the worship services of the early church, puts the apostolic writings on a par with those of the OT prophets. He states that the voice which spoke through the apostles of Christ in the NT was the same as that which spoke through the prophets—the voice of God—and the same voice that Abraham heard, responding in faith and obedience. Justin was also free in his use of “it is written” with quotations from NT Scriptures.</p>
<p class="h3">Period Three: Second Half of Second Century</p>
<p class="fl">Irenaeus had been privileged to begin his Christian training under Polycarp, a disciple of apostles. Then, as a presbyter in Lyons, he had association with Bishop Pothinus, whose own background also included contact with firstgeneration Christians. Irenaeus quotes from almost all the NT on the basis of its authority and asserts that the apostles were endowed with power from on high. They were, he says, “fully informed concerning all things, and had a perfect knowledge . . . having indeed all in equal measure and each one singly the Gospel of God” (<span class="ital">Against Heresies</span> 3.3). Irenaeus gives reasons why there should be four Gospels. “The word,” he says, “gave us the Gospel in a fourfold shape, but held together by one Spirit.” In addition to the Gospels, he makes reference also to Acts, all the letters of Paul except Philemon, 1 Peter, 1 John, and the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>Tatian, pupil of Justin Martyr, made a harmony of the four Gospels, the <span class="ital">Diatessaron,</span> attesting to the equal status they had in the church by <span class="era">AD</span> 170. Other “gospels” had come into existence by then, but he recognized only the four. Also dating from about 170 was the <span class="ital">Muratorian Canon.</span> An eighth-century copy of this document was discovered and published in 1740 by librarian L. A. Muratori. The manuscript is mutilated at both ends, but the remaining text makes it evident that Matthew and Mark were included in the now missing part. The fragment begins with Luke and John, cites Acts, 13 Pauline letters, 1 and 2 John, Jude, and Revelation. There follows a statement, “We accept only the Apocalypse of John and Peter, although some of us do not want it [Apocalypse of Peter is 2 Peter?] to be read in the Church.” The list goes on to reject by name various heretical leaders and their writings.</p>
<p>Translated versions existed by this period. In the form of Syriac and Old Latin translations we secure, by <span class="era">AD</span> 170, adequate witness from the extreme eastern and western branches of the church, as we might well expect from the other evidence in hand. The NT canon is represented with no additions and the omission of only one book, 2 Peter.</p>
<p class="h3">Period Four: Third Century</p>
<p class="fl">The outstanding Christian name of the third century is that of Origen (<span class="era">AD</span> 185– 254). A prodigious scholar and interpreter, he made critical studies of the NT text (alongside his work on the <span class="ital">Hexapla</span>) and wrote commentaries and homilies on most of the books of the NT, emphasizing their inspiration by God.</p>
<p>Dionysius of Alexandria, pupil of Origen, indicates that while the Western church accepted the book of Revelation from the first, its position in the East was variable. In the case of the Letter to the Hebrews, the situation was reversed. It proved to be more insecure in the West than in the East. When it comes to other contested books (note, incidently, that all in that category have the hindmost position in our present Bibles—Hebrews to Revelation), among the so-called “Catholic Epistles” Dionysius supports James and 2 and 3 John but not 2 Peter or Jude. In other words, even at the end of the third century there was the same lack of finality about certain books as at its beginning.</p>
<p class="h3">Period Five: Fourth Century</p>
<p class="fl">Early in this period, the picture begins to clarify. Eusebius (<span class="era">AD</span> 270–340, bishop of Caesarea before 315), the great church historian, sets forth his estimate of the canon in his <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span> (3.3–25). Herein he makes a straightforward statement on the status of the canon in the early part of the fourth century: (1) Universally agreed upon as canonical were the four Gospels, Acts, letters of Paul (including Hebrews, with question about his authorship), 1 Peter, 1 John, and Revelation. (2) Admitted by a majority, including Eusebius himself, but disputed by some were James, 2 Peter (the most strongly contested), 2 and 3 John, and Jude. (3) The Acts of Paul, the Didache, and Shepherd of Hermas were classified “spurious,” and still other writings were listed as “heretical and absurd.”</p>
<p>It is in the latter half of the fourth century, however, that the NT canon finds full and final declaration. In his <span class="ital">Festal Letter</span> for Easter, 367, Bishop Athanasius of Alexandria included information designed to eliminate once and for all the use of certain apocryphal books. This letter, with its admonition, “Let no one add to these; let nothing be taken away,” gives us the earliest extant document that specifies our 27 books without qualification. At the close of the century, the Council of Carthage (<span class="era">AD</span> 397) decreed that “aside from the canonical Scriptures nothing is to be read in church under the Name of Divine Scriptures.” This, too, lists the 27 books of the NT.</p>
<p>The sudden advance of Christianity under Emperor Constantine (Edict of Milan, 313) had a great deal to do with the reception of all the NT books in the East. When he assigned Eusebius the task of preparing “fifty copies of the Divine Scriptures,” the historian, fully aware of which were the sacred books for which many believers had been willing to lay down their very lives, in effect established the standard that gave recognition to all of the once-doubtful books. In the West, of course, Jerome and Augustine were the leaders who exercised a determinitive influence. Publication of the 27 books in the Vulgate version virtually settled the matter.</p>
<p class="h3">Principles and Factors Determining the Canon</p>
<p class="fl">By its very nature, Holy Scripture, whether OT or NT, is a production given of God, not the work of human creation. The key to canonicity is divine inspiration. Therefore, the method of determination is not one of selection from a number of possible candidates (there are no other candidates, in actuality) but one of reception of authentic material and its consequent recognition by an ever-widening circle as the facts of its origin become known.</p>
<p>In a sense, the movement of Montanus, which was declared heretical by the church of his day (mid-second century), was an impetus toward the recognition of a closed canon of the written Word of God. He taught that the prophetic gift was permanently granted to the church and that he himself was a prophet. The pressure to deal with Montanism, therefore, intensified the search for a basic authority, and apostolic authorship or approval became recognized as the only sure standard for identifying God’s revelation. Even within the Scripture record, first-century prophets were subordinate and subject to apostolic authority (see, for example, <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.29-30">1 Cor 14:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>).</p>
<p>When all things were being reexamined in the Protestant Reformation, some of the Reformers sought means of reassuring themselves and their followers about the canon of Scripture. This was in some ways an unfortunate aspect of Reformation thinking, because once God in his providence had determined for his people the fixed content of Scripture, that became a fact of history and was not a repeatable process. Nevertheless, Luther established a theological test for the books of the Bible (and questioned some of them)—“Do they teach Christ?” Equally subjective, it would seem, was Calvin’s insistence that the Spirit of God bears witness to each individual Christian in any age of church history as to what is his Word and what is not.</p>
<p>Actually, even for the initial acceptance of the written Word, it is neither safe nor sound (as far as Scripture or history teaches us) to say that recognition and reception was an intuitive matter. It was rather a matter of simple obedience to the known commands of Christ and his apostles. As we saw at the outset, our Lord promised (<a href="?bref=John.14.26">Jn 14:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.13">16:13</a>) to communicate all things necessary through his agents. The apostles were conscious of this responsibility and agency as they wrote. Paul’s explanation in <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.13">1 Corinthians 2:13</a> is apropos: “In telling you about these gifts we have even used the very words given to us by the Holy Spirit, not words that we as men might choose. So we use the Holy Spirit’s words to explain the Holy Spirit’s facts” (<span class="sc">tlb</span>).</p>
<p>Hence, the early church, with closer ties and greater information than is available to us today, examined the testimony of the ancients. They were able to discern which were the authentic and authoritative books by their apostolic origin. Mark’s association with Peter, and Luke’s with Paul, gave them such apostolic approval, and epistles like Hebrews and Jude were also tied in with the apostolic message and ministry. Incontrovertible consistency of doctrine in all the books, including the sometime contested ones, was perhaps a subordinate test. But historically the procedure was essentially one of acceptance and approval of those books that were vouched for by knowledgeable church leaders. Full acceptance by the original recipients followed by a continued acknowledgment and use is an essential factor in the development of the canon.</p>
<p>The church’s concept of canon, derived first of all from the reverence given the OT Scriptures, rested in the conviction that the apostles were uniquely authorized to speak in the name of the one who possessed all authority—the Lord Jesus Christ. The development from there is logical and straightforward. Those who heard Jesus in person were immediately subject to his authority. He personally authenticated his words to the believers. These same believers knew that Jesus authorized his apostles to speak in his name, both during and (more significantly) after his earthly ministry. Apostolic speaking on behalf of Christ was recognized in the church, whether in personal utterance or in written form. Both the spoken word of an apostle and the letter of an apostle constituted the word of Christ.</p>
<p>The generation that followed that of the apostles themselves received the witness of those who knew that the apostles had the right to speak and write in the name of Christ. Consequently, the second and third generation of Christians looked back to apostolic words (writings) as the very words of Christ. This is what is really meant by canonization—recognition of the divinely authenticated Word. Hence, the believers (the church) did not establish the canon but simply bore witness to its extent by recognizing the authority of the word of Christ.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">BIBLE*, I<span class="lc">nspiration of the</span></p>
<p class="fl">Theological term for the influence God exerted on the writers of Scripture, enabling them to transmit his revelations in writing.</p>
<p>The Bible itself tells us that it is an inspired text. It says, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.16">2 Tm 3:16</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). A translation closer to the original language (Greek) would be, “All Scripture is God-breathed” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). This tells us that every word of the Bible was breathed out from God. The words of the Bible came from God and were written by men. The apostle Peter affirmed this when he said that “no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation. For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.20-21">2 Pt 1:20-21</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>“Men spoke from God.” This short sentence is the key to understanding how the Bible came into being. Thousands of years ago, God chose certain men—such as Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel—to receive his words and write them down. What they wrote became books, or sections, of the OT. Nearly 2,000 years ago, God chose other men—such as Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul—to communicate his new message, the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. What they wrote became books, or sections, of the NT.</p>
<p>God gave his words to these men in many different ways. Certain writers of the OT received messages directly from God. Moses was given the Ten Commandments inscribed on a stone when he was in God’s presence on Mt Sinai. When David was composing his psalms to God, he received divine inspiration to foretell certain events that would occur 1,000 years later in Jesus Christ’s life. God told his prophets—such as Isaiah and Jeremiah—exactly what to say; therefore, when they gave a message, it was God’s word, not their own. This is why many OT prophets often said, “Thus says the Lord.” (This statement appears over 2,000 times in the OT.) To other prophets, such as Ezekiel and Daniel, God communicated his message through visions and dreams. They recorded exactly what they saw, whether they understood it or not. And other OT writers, such as Samuel and Ezra, were directed by God to record events in the history of Israel.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="AntilegomenaTheBooksThatDidnTMakeIt"/>
<p>Four hundred years after the last book of the OT (Malachi) was written, God’s Son, Jesus Christ, came to earth. In his talks, he affirmed the divine authorship of the OT writings (see <a href="?bref=Matt.5.17-19">Mt 5:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.17">Lk 16:17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.35">Jn 10:35</a>). Furthermore, he often pointed to certain passages in the OT as having predicted certain events in his life (see <a href="?bref=Luke.24.27,44">Lk 24:27, 44</a>). The NT writers also affirmed the divine inspiration of the OT text. It was the apostle Paul who was directed by God to write, “All Scripture is God-inspired.” Quite specifically, he was speaking of the OT. And, as was already noted, Peter said that the OT prophets were motivated by the Holy Spirit to speak from God.</p>
<p>The NT is also a God-inspired book. Before Jesus left this earth and returned to his Father, he told the disciples that he would send the Holy Spirit to them. He told them that one of the functions of the Holy Spirit would be to remind them of all the things that Jesus had said and then to guide them into more truth (see <a href="?bref=John.14.26">Jn 14:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.13-15">16:13-15</a>). Those who wrote the Gospels were helped by the Holy Spirit to remember Jesus’ exact words, and those who wrote other parts of the NT were guided by the Spirit as they wrote.</p>
<p>The inspiration for writing the Gospels didn’t begin when the authors set pen to papyrus; the inspiration began when the disciples Matthew, Peter (for whom Mark wrote), and John were enlightened by their encounters with Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The apostles’ experiences with him altered their lives forever, imprinting on their souls unforgettable images of the revealed God-man, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This is what John was speaking of in the prologue to his Gospel when he declared, “The Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory” (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">1:14</a>, paraphrased). The “we” refers to those eyewitnesses of Jesus’ glory—the apostles who lived with Jesus for over three years. This reminiscence is expanded upon in John’s prologue to his first epistle, where he says “we have heard him, touched him, seen him, and looked upon him” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1-2">1 Jn 1:1-2</a>, paraphrased). In both the Gospel and the Epistle, the verbs are in the perfect tense, denoting a past action with a present, abiding effect. Those past encounters with Jesus were never forgotten by John; they lived with him and stayed with him as an inspiring spirit until the day—many years later—he wrote of them in his Gospel. The same could be said for Matthew, who wrote an important Gospel, and Peter, who was really the author behind Mark’s composition. Luke was not an eyewitness, but he based his Gospel on the accounts of those who were (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-4">Lk 1:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>The inspiration for the writing of the Epistles can also be traced to the writers’ encounters with the living Christ. The most prominent epistle writer, Paul, repeatedly claims that his inspiration and subsequent commission came from his encounter with the risen Christ (see, for example, <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8-10">1 Cor 15:8-10</a>). Peter also claims that his writings were based upon his experiences with the living Christ (see <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.1">1 Pt 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.16-18">2 Pt 1:16-18</a>). And so does John, who claims to have experienced the God-man visibly, audibly, and palpably (see <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1-4">1 Jn 1:1-4</a>). James and Jude make no such claim directly, but since they were the brothers of Jesus who became converts when they saw the risen Christ (this is certain for James—see <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.7">1 Cor 15:7</a>—and presumed for Jude—see <a href="?bref=Acts.1.14">Acts 1:14</a>), they too drew their inspiration from their encounters with the living Christ. Thus, all the epistle writers (with the possible exception of the one who wrote Hebrews, who is unknown) knew the living Christ. This is the relationship that qualified them to write those books that became part of the NT canon. This made them distinct from all others, no matter how good their writings were.</p>
<p>The writers of the NT epistles were inspired by the Spirit when they wrote. Speaking for all the apostles, Paul indicated that the NT apostles were taught by the Holy Spirit what to say. The writers of the NT did not speak with words “taught by human wisdom,” but with “words taught by the Holy Spirit” (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.10-13">1 Cor 2:10-13</a>). What they wrote was Spirit-taught. For example, when the apostle John saw that Jesus Christ had come to give eternal life to men, the Spirit helped him express this truth in many different ways. Thus, the reader of John’s Gospel sees different phrases about Jesus giving life: “in him was life,” “a well of living water springing up into eternal life,” “the bread of life,” “the light of life,” “the resurrection and the life,” etc. (see <a href="?bref=John.1.4">Jn 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.14">4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.48">6:48</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>). When the apostle Paul contemplated the fullness of Christ’s deity, he was inspired by the Spirit to use such phrasing as “in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,” “in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,” and “the unsearchable riches of Christ” (see <a href="?bref=Col.2.3,9">Col 2:3, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.8">Eph 3:8</a>).</p>
<p>As the Spirit taught the writers, they used their own vocabulary and writing style to express the thought of the Spirit. As such, the Scriptures came as the result of divine and human cooperation. The Scriptures were not mechanically inspired—as if God used the men as machines through whom he dictated the divine utterance. Rather, the Scriptures were inspired by God, then written by men. The Bible, therefore, is both fully divine and fully human.</p>

<p class="h1">BIBLE*, M<span class="lc">anuscripts and Text of the (Old Testament)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Copies of the OT books produced by scribes and editions made from these copies. The ancient manuscripts of the OT are the basic working material used to seek out the original text of the Bible with as great a degree of accuracy as possible. This process is called textual criticism, sometimes designated “lower criticism” to distinguish it from “higher criticism,” which is analysis of the date, unity, and authorship of the biblical writings.</p>

<p class="h2" id="ImportantOldTestamentManuscripts">Important Old Testament Manuscripts</p>
<p class="fl">Most medieval manuscripts of the OT exhibit a fairly standardized form of the Hebrew text. This standardization reflects the work of the medieval scribes known as Masoretes (<span class="era">AD</span> 500–900); the text that resulted from their work is called the Masoretic Text. Most of the important manuscripts dated from the 11th century <span class="era">AD</span> or later all reflect this same basic textual tradition. But since the Masoretic Text did not stabilize until well after <span class="era">AD</span> 500, many questions about its development in the preceding centuries could not be answered. So the primary task for OT textual critics has been to compare earlier witnesses in order to discover how the Masoretic Text came to be, and how it and earlier witnesses of the Hebrew Bible are related. This leads us to the initial task of textual criticism: the collection of all possible records of the biblical writings.</p>
<p>All the primary sources of the Hebrew Scriptures are handwritten manuscripts, usually written on animal skins, papyrus, or sometimes metal. The fact that they are handwritten is the source of many difficulties for the textual critic. Human error and editorial tampering are often to blame for the many variant readings in OT and NT manuscripts. The fact that the ancient manuscripts are written on skins or papyrus is another source of difficulty. Due to natural decay, most of the surviving ancient manuscripts are fragmentary and difficult to read.</p>
<p>There are many secondary witnesses to the ancient OT text, including translations into other languages, quotations used by both friends and enemies of biblical religion, and evidence from early printed texts. Most of the secondary witnesses have suffered in ways similar to the primary ones. They, too, contain numerous variants due to both intentional and accidental scribal errors and are fragmentary as a result of natural decay. Since variant readings do exist in the surviving ancient manuscripts, these must be collected and compared. The task of comparing and listing the variant readings is known as collation.</p>
<p class="h3">Manuscripts with the Masoretic Text</p>
<p class="fl">The textual history of the Masoretic Text is a significant story in its own right. This text of the Hebrew Bible is the most complete in existence. It forms the basis for our modern Hebrew Bibles and is the prototype against which all comparisons are made in OT textual studies. It is called Masoretic because in its present form it is based on the <span class="ital">Masora,</span> the textual tradition of the Jewish scholars known as the Masoretes of Tiberias. (Tiberias was the location of their community on the Sea of Galilee.) The Masoretes, whose school flourished between <span class="era">AD</span> 500 and 1000, standardized the traditional consonantal text by adding vowel pointing and marginal notes. (The ancient Hebrew alphabet had no vowels.)</p>
<p>The Masoretic Text, as it exists today, owes much to the Ben Asher family. For five or six generations, from the second half of the eighth century to the middle of the tenth century <span class="era">AD</span>, this family played a leading role in the Masoretic work at Tiberias. A faithful record of their work can be found in the oldest existing Masoretic manuscripts, which go back to the final two members of that family. The oldest dated Masoretic manuscript is Codex Cairensis (<span class="era">AD</span> 895), which is attributed to Moses ben Asher. This manuscript contained both the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the 12 Minor Prophets). The rest of the OT is missing from this manuscript.</p>
<p>The other major surviving manuscript attributed to the Ben Asher family is the Aleppo Codex. According to the manuscript’s concluding note, Aaron ben Moses ben Asher was responsible for writing the Masoretic notes and pointing the text. This manuscript contained the entire OT and dates from the first half of the 10th century <span class="era">AD</span>. It was reportedly destroyed in anti-Jewish riots in 1947, but this proved to be only partly true. A majority of the manuscript survived and will be used as the base for a new critical edition of the Hebrew Bible to be published by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The manuscript known as Codex Leningradensis, presently stored in the Leningrad Public Library, is of special importance as a witness to the Ben Asher text. According to a note on the manuscript, it was copied in <span class="era">AD</span> 1008 from texts written by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher. Since the oldest complete Hebrew text of the OT (the Aleppo Codex) was not available to scholars earlier in this century, Codex Leningradensis was used as the textual base for the popular Hebrew texts of today: <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica,</span> edited by R. Kittel, and its revision, <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia,</span> edited by K. Elliger and W. Rudolf.</p>
<p>There are quite a number of less important manuscript codices that reflect the Masoretic tradition: the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets and the Erfurt Codices. There are also a number of manuscripts that no longer exist but which were used by scholars in the Masoretic period. One of the most prominent is Codex Hillel, traditionally attributed to Rabbi Hillel ben Moses ben Hillel about <span class="era">AD</span> 600. This codex was said to be very accurate and was used for the revision of other manuscripts. Readings of this codex are cited repeatedly by the early medieval Masoretes. Codex Muga, Codex Jericho, and Codex Jerushalmi, also no longer extant, were also cited by the Masoretes. These manuscripts were likely prominent examples of unpointed texts that had become part of a standardizing consensus in the first centuries <span class="era">AD</span>. These laid the groundwork for the work of the Masoretes of Tiberias.</p>
<p>Despite the completeness of the Masoretic manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, a major problem still remains for OT textual critics. The Masoretic manuscripts, as old as they are, were written between 1,000 and 2,000 years after the original autographs. Earlier witnesses to the ancient Hebrew text were needed to testify to the accuracy of the Masoretic Text.</p>
<p class="h3">The Dead Sea Scrolls</p>
<p class="fl">The most important ancient witnesses to the Hebrew Bible are the texts discovered at Wadi Qumran in the 1940s and 1950s. (<span class="ital">Wadi</span> is an Arabic word for a riverbed that is dry except in the rainy season.) Before the Qumran discoveries, the oldest existing Hebrew manuscripts of the OT dated from about <span class="era">AD</span> 900. The greatest importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls, therefore, lies in the discovery of biblical manuscripts dating back to only about 300 years after the close of the OT canon. That makes them 1,000 years earlier than the oldest manuscripts previously known to biblical scholars. The texts found at Wadi Qumran were all completed before the Roman conquest of Palestine in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, and many predate this event by quite some time. Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Isaiah Scroll has received the most publicity, although the collection contains fragments of all the books in the Hebrew Bible with the exception of Esther.</p>
<p>Because the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls is so important for OT textual criticism, a short history and description of these recent discoveries is appropriate. The manuscripts now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of biblical and extrabiblical manuscripts from Qumran, an ancient Jewish religious community near the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>Before the Qumran find, few manuscripts had been discovered in the Holy Land. The early church father Origen (third century <span class="era">AD</span>) mentioned using Hebrew and Greek manuscripts that had been stored in jars in caves near Jericho. In the ninth century <span class="era">AD</span> a patriarch of the eastern church, Timothy I, wrote a letter to Sergius, metropolitan (archbishop) of Elam, in which he, too, referred to a large number of Hebrew manuscripts found in a cave near Jericho. For more than 1,000 years since then, however, no other significant manuscript discoveries were forthcoming from caves in that region near the Dead Sea.</p>
<p class="h3">Scroll Discoveries at Wadi Qumran</p>
<p class="fl">The history of the Dead Sea manuscripts, both of their hiding and of their finding, reads like a mystery adventure story. It began with a telephone call on Wednesday afternoon, February 18, 1948, in the troubled city of Jerusalem. Butrus Sowmy, librarian and monk of St Mark’s Monastery in the Armenian quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, was calling John C. Trever, acting director of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR). Sowmy had been preparing a catalog of the monastery’s collection of rare books. Among them he found some scrolls in ancient Hebrew that, he said, had been in the monastery for about 40 years. Could ASOR supply him with some information for the catalog?</p>
<p>The following day Sowmy and his brother brought a suitcase containing five scrolls or parts of scrolls wrapped in an Arabic newspaper. Pulling back the end of one of the scrolls Trever discovered that it was written in a clear, square Hebrew script. He copied several lines from that scroll, carefully examined three others, but was unable to unroll the fifth because it was too brittle. After the Syrians left, Trever told the story of the scrolls to William H. Brownlee, an ASOR fellow. Trever further noted in the lines he had copied from the first scroll the double occurrence of an unusual negative construction in Hebrew. In addition, the Hebrew script of the scrolls was more archaic than anything he had ever seen.</p>
<p>Trever then visited St Mark’s Monastery. There he was introduced to the Syrian archbishop Athanasius Samuel, who gave him permission to photograph the scrolls. Trever and Brownlee compared the style of handwriting on the scrolls with a photograph of the Nash Papyrus, a scroll inscribed with the Ten Commandments and <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a> and dated by scholars in the first or second century <span class="era">BC</span>. The two ASOR scholars concluded that the script on the newly found manuscripts belonged to the same period. When ASOR director Millar Burrows returned to Jerusalem from Baghdad a few days later, he was shown the scrolls, and the three men continued their investigation. Only then did the Syrians reveal that the scrolls had been purchased the year before, in 1947, and had not been in the monastery for 40 years as was first reported.</p>
<p>How had the Syrians come to possess the scrolls? Before that question could be answered, many fragmentary accounts had to be pieced together. Sometime during the winter of 1946–47 three Bedouin were tending their sheep and goats near a spring in the vicinity of Wadi Qumran. One of the herdsmen, throwing a rock through a small opening in the cliff, heard the sound of the rock evidently shattering an earthenware jar inside. Another Bedouin later lowered himself into the cave and found ten tall jars lining the walls. Three manuscripts (one of them in four pieces) stored in two of the jars were removed from the cave and offered to an antiquities dealer in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Several months later the Bedouin secured four more scrolls (one of them in two pieces) from the cave and sold them to another dealer in Bethlehem. During Holy Week in 1947, St Mark’s Syrian Orthodox Monastery in Jerusalem was informed of the four scrolls, and Metropolitan Athanasius Samuel offered to buy them. The sale was not completed, however, until July 1947, when the four scrolls were bought by the monastery. They included a complete Isaiah scroll, a commentary on Habakkuk, a scroll containing a Manual of Discipline of the religious community at Qumran, and the Genesis Apocryphon (originally thought to be the aprocryphal book of Lamech but actually an Aramaic paraphrase of Genesis).</p>
<p>In November and December of 1947 an Armenian antiquities dealer in Jerusalem informed the late E. L. Sukenik, professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of the first three scrolls found in the cave by the Bedouin. Sukenik then secured the three scrolls and two jars from the antiquities dealer in Bethlehem. They included an incomplete scroll of Isaiah, the Hymns of Thanksgiving (containing 12 columns of original psalms), and the War Scroll. (That scroll describes a war, actual or spiritual, of the tribes of Levi, Judah, and Benjamin against the Moabites and Edomites. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=WaroftheSonsofLightagainsttheSonsofDarkness_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">War of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness</a>.)</p>
<p>On April 1, 1948, the first news release appeared in newspapers around the world, followed by another news release on April 26 by Sukenik about the manuscripts he had already acquired at Hebrew University. In 1949 Athanasius Samuel brought the four scrolls from St Mark’s Monastery to the United States. They were exhibited in various places and finally were purchased on July 1, 1954, in New York for $250,000 by Sukenik’s son for the nation of Israel and sent to Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Today they are on display in the Shrine of the Book museum in West Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the initial discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, both archaeologists and Bedouin continued their search for more manuscripts. Early in 1949, G. Lankester Harding, director of antiquities for the kingdom of Jordan, and Roland G. de Vaux, of the Dominic Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem, excavated the cave (designated Cave One, or 1Q) where the initial discovery was made. Several hundred caves were explored the same year. So far, 11 caves in the Wadi Qumran have yielded treasures. Almost 600 manuscripts have been recovered, about 200 of which are biblical material. The fragments number between 50,000 and 60,000 pieces. About 85 percent of the fragments are leather; the other 15 percent are papyrus. The fact that most of the manuscripts are leather contributed to the problem of their preservation.</p>
<p>Probably the cave next most important to Cave One is Cave Four (4Q), which has yielded about 40,000 fragments of 400 different manuscripts, 100 of which are biblical. Every book of the OT except Esther is represented.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="MapOfDeadSeaAndQumranArea"/>
<p>In addition to the biblical manuscripts the discoveries have included apocryphal works such as Hebrew and Aramaic fragments of Tobit, Ecclesiasticus, and the Letter of Jeremiah. Fragments were also found of pseudepigraphal books such as 1 Enoch, the book of Jubilees, and the Testament of Levi.</p>
<p>Many sectarian scrolls peculiar to the religious community that lived at Qumran were also found. They furnish historical background on the nature of pre-Christian Judaism and help fill in the gaps of intertestamental history. One of the scrolls, the Damascus Document, had originally turned up in Cairo, but manuscripts of it have now been found at Qumran. The Manual of Discipline was one of the seven scrolls from Cave One. Fragmentary manuscripts of it have been found in other caves. The document gives the group’s entrance requirements, plus regulations governing life in the Qumran community. The Thanksgiving Hymns include some 30 hymns, probably composed by one individual.</p>
<p>There were also many commentaries on different books of the OT. The Habakkuk Commentary was a copy of the first two chapters of Habakkuk in Hebrew accompanied by a verse-by-verse commentary. The commentary gives many details about an apocalyptic figure called the “Teacher of Righteousness” who is persecuted by a wicked priest.</p>
<p>A unique discovery was made in Cave Three (3Q) in 1952. It was a scroll of copper, measuring about eight feet (2.4 meters) long and a foot (30.5 centimeters) wide. Because it was brittle, it was not opened until 1966, and then only by cutting it into strips. It contained an inventory of some 60 locations where treasures of gold, silver, and incense were hidden. Archaeologists have not been able to find any of it. That list of treasures, perhaps from the Jerusalem temple, may have been stored in the cave by Zealots (a revolutionary Jewish political party) during their struggle with the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 66–70.</p>
<p>During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Sukenik’s son, Yigael Yadin of the Hebrew University, acquired a Qumran document called the Temple Scroll. That tightly rolled scroll measures 28 feet (8.5 meters) and is the longest scroll found so far in the Qumran area. A major portion of it is devoted to statutes of the kings and matters of defense. It also describes sacrificial feasts and rules of cleanliness. Almost half of the scroll gives detailed instructions for building a future temple, supposedly revealed by God to the scroll’s author.</p>
<p class="h3">Important Dead Sea Scroll Manuscripts</p>
<p class="fl">Among the hundreds of biblical manuscripts discovered in the 11 caves around the Dead Sea, there are some very significant ones—especially for textual studies. These are listed below. (The first number signifies the cave, Q indicates Qumran, the abbreviation for the biblical book follows, often followed by a superscipt letter for successive manuscripts containing the same book.)</p>
<p class="h4">1QIsa<span class="sup">a</span></p>
<p class="fl">This is the first Dead Sea Scroll to receive widespread attention. It is dated to c. 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. The text, which includes most of Isaiah, is proto-Masoretic with some significant variants.</p>
<p class="h4">1QIsa<span class="sup">b</span></p>
<p class="fl">The text, which includes most of Isaiah, is proto-Masoretic. It is dated to a period from 25 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 50.</p>
<p class="h4">2QJer</p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript is dated to a period from 25 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 50 and has portions of Jeremiah chapters <a href="?bref=Jer.42.1-49.39">42–49</a>. It has some readings that follow the Septuagint (LXX), while it follows the order of chapters found in proto-Masoretic texts. For the book of Jeremiah, the Septuagint and Masoretic Text are quite different: the Septuagint is one-eighth shorter and has a different arrangement of chapters.</p>
<p class="h4">4QPaleoExod<span class="sup">m</span></p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, containing most of Exodus, is dated quite early: 200–175 <span class="era">BC</span>. As such, it has provided scholars with some interesting insights into the early history of textual transmission of Exodus and the Pentateuch. The manuscript shows many similarities with the Samaritan Pentateuch.</p>
<p class="h4">4QNum<span class="sup">b</span></p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, dated 30 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 20, contains most of Numbers. The book of Numbers existed in three distinguishable textual traditions: the Masoretic Text, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Septuagint. This manuscript, 4QNum<span class="sup">b</span>, shows similarities with the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Septuagint, while having its own unique readings.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="FamousIsaiahManuscriptFromQumran"/>
<p class="h4">4QSam<span class="sup">a</span></p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, containing about one tenth of 1 and 2 Samuel, is dated c. 50–25 <span class="era">BC</span>. This manuscript, showing some similarities with the Septuagint, is believed to have several readings that are superior to the Masoretic Text.</p>
<p class="h4">4QJer<span class="sup">a</span></p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, containing portions of <a href="?bref=Jer.7.1-22.30">Jeremiah 7–22</a>, dates c. 200 <span class="era">BC</span>. It generally concurs with the Masoretic Text.</p>
<p class="h4">4QJer<span class="sup">b</span></p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, dated c. 150–125 <span class="era">BC</span>, follows the arrangement of the Septuagint, as well as its brevity. The significance of this is that two different texts of Jeremiah were used in the pre-Christian era—one that was proto-Masoretic (as with 4QJer<span class="sup">a</span>) and one that was like the Septuagint.</p>
<p class="h4">11QPs<span class="sup">a</span></p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, dated c. <span class="era">AD</span> 25–50, preserves many psalms. However, these are not in the traditional sequence found in the Hebrew Bible. Furthermore, the manuscript has several other psalms, some of which were known from other ancient versions and others that were unknown until they surfaced in this manuscript.</p>
<p class="h3">Scroll Discoveries at Wadi Murabba’at</p>
<p class="fl">In 1951 Bedouin discovered more manuscripts in caves in the Wadi Murabba’at, which extends southeast from Bethlehem toward the Dead Sea, about 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) south of Qumran. Four caves were excavated there in 1952 under Harding and de Vaux. They yielded biblical documents and important materials, such as letters and coins, from the time of the second Jewish revolt under Bar-Kochba in <span class="era">AD</span> 132–135. Among the biblical manuscripts was a scroll containing a Hebrew text of the Minor Prophets, dating from the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. This manuscript corresponds almost perfectly to the Masoretic Text, hinting that by the second century a standard consonantal text was already taking shape. Also found in Wadi Murabba’at were fragments of the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) and Isaiah.</p>
<p>Apart from the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient witnesses to the Hebrew OT that are actually written in the Hebrew language are almost nonexistent. Because of this, the Dead Sea Scrolls may easily be one of the greatest archaeological finds of all time. They take us 1,000 years deeper into the history of the Hebrew OT, giving us the ability to assess all the other ancient witnesses with greater understanding.</p>
<p>The most frequently represented OT books among the Dead Sea Scrolls are Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, and Isaiah. The oldest text is a fragment of Exodus dating from about 250 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Isaiah Scroll dates from about 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. These ancient witnesses only confirm the accuracy of the Masoretic Text and the care with which the Jewish scribes handled the Scriptures. Except for a few instances where spelling and grammar differ between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Masoretic Text, the two are amazingly similar. The differences do not warrant any major changes in the substance of the OT. Yet these discoveries are helping biblical scholars gain a clearer understanding of the text at an earlier time in its history and development.</p>
<p>Early conclusions about the antiquity of the first Dead Sea Scrolls were not accepted by everyone. Some scholars were convinced that the scrolls were of medieval origin. A series of questions relate to the dating problem. When were the texts at Qumran composed? When were they deposited in the caves? Most scholars believe the manuscripts were placed in the caves by members of the Qumran community when Roman legions were besieging Jewish strongholds. That was shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="ManuscriptFromMurabbaAt"/>
<p>Careful study of the contents of a document sometimes reveals its authorship and the date when it was written. An example of using such internal evidence for dating a nonbiblical work is found in the Habakkuk Commentary. It gives hints about the people and events in the days of the commentary’s author, not in the days of the prophet Habakkuk. The commentator described the enemies of God’s people as the <span class="hebrew">Kittim</span><span class="ital">.</span> Originally that word denoted Cyprus but later came to be more generally the Greek islands and the coasts of the eastern Mediterranean. In <a href="?bref=Dan.11.30">Daniel 11:30</a> the term is used prophetically, and most scholars identify the <span class="hebrew">Kittim</span> with the Romans. Thus, the Habakkuk Commentary was probably written about the time of the Roman capture of Palestine under Pompey in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheSignificanceOfTheDeadSeaScrolls"/>
<p>Another important item to consider when dating a manuscript is its copy date. Although the vast majority of manuscripts are undated, it is often possible to determine when a manuscript was written by paleography, the study of ancient handwriting. That was the method initially employed by Trever when he compared the script of the Isaiah Scroll with the Nash Papyrus, thus dating it to the pre-Christian era. His conclusions were confirmed by the late William F. Albright, then the foremost American archaeologist. During the time of the Babylonian captivity, the square script became the normal style of writing in Hebrew (as well as in Aramaic, a cousin of Hebrew). The evidence of paleography clearly dates the majority of the Qumran scrolls in the period between 200 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 200.</p>
<p>Archaeology provides another kind of external evidence. The pottery discovered at Qumran dates from the late Hellenistic and early Roman periods (200 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 100). Earthenware articles and ornaments point to the same period. Several hundred coins were found in jars dating from the Graeco-Roman period. A crack in one of the buildings is attributed to an earthquake that, according to Josephus (a Jewish historian who wrote during the first century <span class="era">AD</span>), occurred in 31 <span class="era">BC</span>. The excavations at Khirbet Qumran indicate that the general period of their occupation was from about 135 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 68, the year the Zealot revolt was crushed by Rome.</p>
<p>Finally, radiocarbon analysis has contributed to dating the finds. Radiocarbon analysis is a method of dating material from the amount of radioactive carbon remaining in it. The process is also known as carbon-14 dating. Applied to the linen cloth in which the scrolls were wrapped, the analysis gave a date of <span class="era">AD</span> 33 plus or minus 200 years. A later test bracketed the date between 250 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 50. Although there may be questions concerning the relation of the linen wrappings to the date of the scrolls themselves, the carbon-14 test agrees with the conclusions of both paleography and archaeology. The general period, then, in which the Dead Sea Scrolls can be safely dated is between about 150 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 68.</p>
<p class="h3">The Nash Papyrus</p>
<p class="fl">Prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest Hebrew witness to the OT was the Nash Papyrus. This manuscript was acquired in Egypt by W. L. Nash in 1902 and was donated to the Cambridge University Library. This manuscript contains a damaged copy of the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-17">Ex 20:2-17</a>), part of <a href="?bref=Deut.5.6-21">Deuteronomy 5:6-21</a>, and also the <span class="hebrew">Shema</span> (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-25">Dt 6:4ff</a>.). This is clearly a collection of devotional and liturgical passages, and has been dated to the same period as the Dead Sea Scrolls, between 150 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 68.</p>
<p class="h3">The Cairo Geniza Fragments</p>
<p class="fl">Near the end of the 19th century, many fragments from the 6th to the 8th centuries were found in an old synagogue in Cairo, Egypt, which had been St Michael’s Church until <span class="era">AD</span> 882. They were found there in a geniza, a storage room where worn or faulty manuscripts were hidden until they could be disposed of properly. This geniza had apparently been walled off and forgotten until its recent discovery. In this small room, as many as 200,000 fragments were preserved, including biblical texts in Hebrew and Aramaic. The fact that the biblical fragments date from the 5th century <span class="era">AD</span> makes them invaluable for shedding light on the development of the Masoretic work prior to the standardization instituted by the great Masoretes of Tiberias.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SignificantOldTestamentVersions">Significant Old Testament Versions</p>
<p class="h3">The Samaritan Pentateuch</p>
<p class="fl">Exactly when the Samaritan community separated from the larger Jewish community is a matter of dispute. But at some point during the postexilic period (c. 540–100 <span class="era">BC</span>), a clear division between Samaritans and Jews was marked off. At this point, the Samaritans, who accepted only the Pentateuch as canonical, apparently canonized their own particular version of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>A copy of the Samaritan Pentateuch came to the attention of scholars in 1616. Initially, it caused a great deal of excitement, but most of the early assessments of its value to textual criticism were negative. It differed from the Masoretic Text in some 6,000 instances, and many judged this to be the result of sectarian differences between Samaritans and Jews. By some, it was simply viewed as a sectarian revision of the Masoretic Text.</p>
<p>After further assessment, however, it became clear that the Samaritan Pentateuch represented a text of much earlier origin than the Masoretic Text. And although a few of the distinctions of the Samaritan Pentateuch were clearly the result of sectarian concerns, most of the differences were neutral in this respect. Many of them had more to do with popularizing the text, rather than altering its meaning in any way. The fact that the Samaritan Pentateuch had much in common with the Septuagint, some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the NT, revealed that most of its differences with the Masoretic Text were not due to sectarian differences. More likely, they were due to the use of a different textual base, which was probably in wide use in the ancient Near East until well after the time of Christ. This realization, though not solving any real problems, did much to illustrate the complexity of the OT textual tradition that existed before the Masoretic standard was completed.</p>
<p class="h3">The Septuagint (LXX)</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="SeptuagintTextOfGenesis"/>
<p class="fl">The Septuagint is the oldest Greek translation of the OT, its witness being significantly older than that of the Masoretic Text. According to tradition, the Septuagint Pentateuch was translated by a team of 70 scholars in Alexandria, Egypt. (Hence its common designation LXX, the Roman numerals for 70.) The Jewish community in Egypt spoke Greek, not Hebrew, so a Greek translation of the OT was sincerely needed by that community of Jews. The exact date of translation is not known, but evidence indicates that the Septuagint Pentateuch was completed in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>. The rest of the OT was probably translated over a long period of time, as it clearly represents the work of many different scholars.</p>
<p>The value of the Septuagint to textual criticism varies widely from book to book. It might be said that the Septuagint is not a single version but a collection of versions made by various authors, who differed greatly in their methods and their knowledge of Hebrew. The translations of the individual books are in no way uniform. Many books are translated almost literally, while others like Job and Daniel are quite dynamic. So the value of each book for textual criticism must be assessed on a book-by-book basis. The books translated literally are clearly more helpful in making comparisons with the Masoretic Text than the more dynamic ones.</p>
<p>The content of some books is significantly different when comparing the Septuagint and the Masoretic Text. For example, the Septuagint’s Jeremiah is missing significant portions found in the Masoretic Text, and the order of the text is significantly different as well. What these differences actually mean is difficult to know with certainty. It has been conjectured that the Septuagint is simply a poor translation and is therefore missing portions of the original Hebrew. But these same differences could also indicate that editorial additions and changes worked their way into the Masoretic Text during its long history of development. It is also possible that there were a number of valid textual traditions at that time, one followed by the Septuagint, and another followed by the Masoretic Text. This illustrates some of the difficulties that arise while doing OT textual criticism.</p>
<p>The Septuagint was the standard OT text used by the early Christian church. The expanding Gentile church needed a translation in the common language of the time—Greek. By the time of Christ, even among the Jews, a majority of the people spoke Aramaic and Greek, not Hebrew. The NT writers evidence their inclination to the Septuagint by using it when quoting the OT.</p>
<p class="h3">Other Greek Versions</p>
<p class="fl">Because of the broad acceptance and use of the Septuagint among Christians, the Jews renounced it in favor of a number of other Greek versions. Aquila, a proselyte and disciple of Rabbi Akiba, produced a new translation around <span class="era">AD</span> 130. In the spirit of his teacher, Aquila wrote an extremely literal translation, often to the point of communicating poorly in Greek. This literal approach, however, gained this version wide acceptance among Jews. Only fragments of this version have survived, but its literal nature reveals much about its Hebrew textual base.</p>
<p>Symmachus produced a new version around <span class="era">AD</span> 170 designed not only for accuracy but also to communicate well in the Greek language. His version has survived only in a few <span class="ital">Hexapla</span> fragments. A third Greek version came from Theodotion, a Jewish proselyte from the end of the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. His version was apparently a revision of an earlier Greek version, possibly the Septuagint. This version has survived only in a few early Christian quotations, though it was once widely used.</p>
<p>The Christian theologian Origen (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 185–255) arranged the OT with six parallel versions for comparison in his <span class="ital">Hexapla.</span> In his effort to find the best text of the Septuagint, Origen wrote out six parallel columns containing first the Hebrew, second the Hebrew transliterated into Greek characters, third the text of Aquila, fourth the text of Symmachus, fifth his own corrected Septuagint text, sixth the text of Theodotion. Jerome used this great Bible at Caesarea in his work on the Vulgate (after 382—see below). Almost four centuries after Origen’s death, a Mesopotamian bishop, Paul of Tella, also used the <span class="ital">Hexapla</span> in the library at Caesarea (616–17) to make a translation into Syriac of Origen’s fifth column, the corrected Septuagint. Then in 638 the Islamic hordes swept through Caesarea and the <span class="ital">Hexapla</span> disappeared. Other than a few fragments, only Bishop Paul’s Syriac translation of Origen’s fifth column remains.</p>
<p>An eighth-century copy of Bishop Paul’s Syriac <span class="ital">Hexapla</span> Septuagint is extant in a Milan museum. Other famous uncial manuscripts of the Septuagint are the codices: Vaticanus, early fourth century, now in the Vatican Library; Sinaiticus, mid-fourth century; and Alexandrinus, probably from the fifth century—both of the latter are in London’s British Museum. These copies are intensely studied because they bear a Greek witness to Hebrew texts far earlier than the Masoretic or “received text.”</p>
<p class="h3">The Aramaic Targums</p>
<p class="fl">The Aramaic Targums were Aramaic translations of the Hebrew OT. Since the common language of the Jews during the postexilic period was Aramaic and not Hebrew, a need for Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible arose. Hebrew remained the language of scholarly religious circles, and translations for the common people were often spurned by the religious leadership. But over time, the reading of the Scriptures and commentaries in Aramaic became an accepted practice in the synagogues.</p>
<p>The purpose of these translations was to get the message across and to edify the people. Thus, the translations were extremely interpretive. The translators paraphrased, added explanatory glosses, and often boldly reinterpreted the text according to the theological biases of their time. They sought to relate the Bible text to contemporary life and political circumstances. Because of the dynamic approach evident in these translations, their use in textual criticism is limited, but they do add to the welter of evidence to be collected and collated in order to reconstruct the text of the OT.</p>
<p class="h3">The Syriac Version</p>
<p class="fl">Another version worthy of note is the Syriac version. This version was in common use in the Syriac (eastern Aramaic) church, which designated it the <span class="ital">Peshitta,</span> meaning “the simple or plain.” What they intended by this designation is difficult to discern. It may indicate that it was intended for popular consumption, or that it avoided adding explanatory glosses and other additions, or perhaps that it was not an annotated text, as was the annotated <span class="ital">Syro-Hexapla</span> then in use by the same community.</p>
<p>The literary history of the Syriac version is not known, though it is clearly complex. Some have identified it as the recasting of an Aramaic Targum in Syriac, while others claim it has a more independent origin. Some connect it to the conversion of the leaders of Adiabene (east of the Tigris River) to the Jewish faith during the first century <span class="era">AD</span>. Their need for an OT could have brought about the development of a version in their common tongue—Syriac. Still others connect it to Christian origins. Obvious later revisions to the <span class="ital">Peshitta</span> complicate matters even more. More study needs to be done to assess the nature of this version before it can lend much insight into the history of the Hebrew text.</p>
<p class="h3">The Latin Versions</p>
<p class="fl">Latin was a dominant language in western regions of the Roman Empire from well before the time of Christ. It was in the western regions of southern Gaul and North Africa that the first Latin translations of the Bible appeared. Around <span class="era">AD</span> 160 Tertullian apparently used a Latin version of the Scriptures. Not long after this, the Old Latin text seems to have been in circulation, evidenced by Cyprian’s use of it before his death in <span class="era">AD</span> 258. The Old Latin version was translated from the Septuagint. Due to its early date, it is valuable as a witness to the early Septuagint text, before later editors obscured the nature of the original. It also indirectly gives clues to the nature of the Hebrew text at the time of the Septuagint’s translation. Complete manuscripts of the Old Latin text have not survived. After the completion of Jerome’s Latin version, the Vulgate, the older text fell into disuse. Enough fragmentary manuscripts of this version do exist, however, to lend significant information to the early OT text.</p>
<p>Around the third century <span class="era">AD</span>, Latin began to replace Greek as the language of learning in the larger Roman world. A uniform, reliable text was badly needed for theological and liturgical uses. To fill this need, Pope Damasus I (<span class="era">AD</span> 336–84) commissioned Jerome, an eminent scholar in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, to undertake the translation. Jerome began this work as a translation from the Greek Septuagint, considered inspired by many church authorities, including Augustine. But later, and at the risk of great criticism, he turned to the Hebrew text being used in Palestine at that time as the base text for his translation. During the years between <span class="era">AD</span> 390 and 405 Jerome wrote his Latin translation of the Hebrew OT. Yet, despite Jerome’s return to the original Hebrew, he was heavily dependent on the various Greek versions as aids in translation. As a result the Vulgate reflects the other Greek and Latin translations as much as the underlying Hebrew text. The value of the Vulgate for textual criticism is its pre-Masoretic witness to the Hebrew Bible, though this was compromised to a great extent by the influence of already existing Greek translations.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTextoftheOldTestament">The Text of the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The task of the textual critic can be divided into a number of general stages: (1) the collection and collation of existing manuscripts, translations, and quotations; (2) the development of theory and methodology that will enable the critic to use the gathered information to reconstruct the most accurate text of the biblical materials; (3) the reconstruction of the history of the transmission of the text in order to identify the various influences affecting the text; (4) the evaluation of specific variant readings in light of textual evidence, theology, and history.</p>
<p>Both OT and NT textual critics undertake a similar task and face similar obstacles. They both seek to unearth a hypothetical “original” text with limited resources that are at varying degrees of deterioration. But the OT textual critic faces a more complex textual history than does his NT counterpart. The NT was written primarily in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, and complete NT manuscripts exist that were written only a few hundred years later. The OT, however, is made up of literature written over a 1,000-year period, the oldest parts dating to the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span>, or possibly even earlier. To make matters even more difficult, until recently, the earliest known Hebrew manuscripts of the OT were medieval. This left scholars with little witness as to the OT’s textual development from ancient times to the Middle Ages, a period of over 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the 1940s and 1950s, secondary Aramaic, Greek, and Latin translations served as the earliest significant witnesses to the early Hebrew Scriptures. Since these are translations, and subject to sectarian and contextual alterations and interpolations, their value to the textual critic, though significant, is limited. The recent discoveries of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other early manuscripts, however, have provided primary witnesses to the Hebrew OT in earlier times. The scholarly assessment of these discoveries is, at present, far from complete, and the discipline of OT textual criticism anxiously awaits a more complete assessment of their significance. In a general sense, however, the Dead Sea Scrolls have affirmed the accuracy of the Masoretic Text that we use today.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the history of the transmission of the text is an important element in evaluating variant readings. Material from a wide variety of sources must be combined in order to arrive at even a tentative reconstruction of the text. A brief sketch of scholarly opinion follows.</p>
<p>The early history of the OT text as reflected in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint, and the ancient Hebrew text shows a remarkable fluidity and diversity. Evidently the standardizing process did not begin at the earliest stages. For example, the materials from the Qumran community, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found, do not reflect any frustration with varying texts within that community.</p>
<p>Some scholars have attempted to account for such diversity by theories of local texts. They theorize that various localities in the Near East (e.g., Babylon, Palestine, Egypt) had differing text types that are reflected in the various surviving Hebrew texts and versions. Other scholars account for the diversity by recognizing a precanonical fluidity. They feel that until the process of canonization was complete, accurate reproduction of the manuscripts was not viewed as very important. It should be noted, however, that the basic text that modern scholarship has identified as closest to the original was among the Dead Sea texts (for example, the large Isaiah Scroll).</p>
<p>Destruction of the temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 provided an impetus for standardization of the consonantal text. The texts found at Wadi Murabba’at, copied during the first centuries <span class="era">AD</span>, reflect the new stage. The scholars initially reporting on the discovery were disappointed to find in these texts so few variations from the standard Masoretic Text. To scholars, the very early texts from the Dead Sea Scroll discoveries had become the standard consonantal text to the exclusion of other variants. Scholars have now gone so far as to identify the only slightly later Wadi Murabba’at texts as a “proto-Masoretic” standard. This seems to indicate that the Hebrew consonantal text was already approaching a standard in Palestine by the first centuries <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>Standardization as practiced by the Masoretes meant identifying one text as normative and copying carefully from that text. It also meant correcting existing texts by the normative text. The Hebrew text, of course, was written with consonants alone, not with consonants <span class="ital">and</span> vowels, as we write English.</p>
<p>The next stage in the transmission of the OT text was standardization of punctuation and vowel patterns. That process, which began fairly early in the NT period, extended over a period of 1,000 years. A long series of Masoretes provided annotations known as <span class="ital">Masora,</span> which, in Hebrew, means “tradition.” Two different motivations are evident in their work. One was their concern for accurate reproduction of the consonantal text. For that purpose a collection of annotations (on irregular forms, abnormal patterns, the number of times a form or word was used, and other matters) was gathered and inserted in the margins or at the end of the text.</p>
<p>A second concern of the Masoretes was to record and standardize the vocalization of the consonantal text for reading purposes. Up until this point, scribes had been prohibited against inserting vowels to make the vocalization of the text clear. Because of this, a proper reading of the text depended on the oral tradition passed down from generation to generation. The origins of vocalization reflect differences between Babylon and Palestine. The Tiberian Masoretes (scholars working in Tiberias in Palestine) provided the most complete and exact system of vocalization. The earliest dated manuscript from that tradition is a codex of the Prophets from the Karaite synagogue of Cairo dated <span class="era">AD</span> 896. Today the standard Hebrew text of the OT, <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia,</span> an updated version of Kittel’s <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica,</span> is constructed on the basis of the Tiberian Masoretic tradition.</p>
<p>Standardization of both the consonantal text and vocalization succeeded so well that the manuscripts that have survived display a remarkable agreement. Most of the variants, being minor and attributable to scribal error, do not affect interpretation.</p>
<p class="h3">Methodology of Old Testament Textual Criticism</p>
<p class="fl">The search for an adequate methodology to handle the many variant readings found in manuscripts is inseparably intertwined with our understanding of the history of transmission. The basic issue in textual criticism is the method used to decide the relative value of those variant readings. Many factors must be evaluated in order to arrive at a valid decision.</p>
<p>Modern science has provided a number of aids for deciphering a manuscript. Scientific dating procedures help to determine the age of the writing material. Chemical techniques help clarify writing that has deteriorated. Ultraviolet light enables a scholar to see traces of ink (carbon) in a manuscript even after the surface writing has been effaced.</p>
<p>Each manuscript must be studied as a whole, for each has a “personality.” It is important to identify the characteristic errors, characteristic carelessness or carefulness, and other peculiarities of the scribe(s) who copied the material. Then the manuscript must be compared with other manuscripts to identify the “family” tradition with which it agrees. Preservation of common errors or insertions in the text is a clue to relationships. All possible details of date, place of origin, and authorship must be ascertained.</p>
<p>Scribal errors fall into several distinct categories. The first large category is that of <span class="ital">unintentional errors:</span> (1) Confusion of similar consonants and the transposition of two consonants are frequent errors. (2) Corruptions also resulted from an incorrect division of words (many early manuscripts omitted spaces between words in order to save space). (3) Confusion of sounds occurred particularly when one scribe read to a group of scribes making multiple copies. (4) In the OT, the method of vocalization (addition of vowels to the consonantal text) created some errors. (5) Omissions of a letter, word, or phrase created new readings. (6) Repetition of a letter, word, or even a whole phrase was also common. (7) Omission (called haplography) or repetition (called dittography) could be caused by the eye of a scribe slipping from one word to a similar word or ending. (8) Omissions by <span class="ital">homoioteleuton</span> (Greek meaning “similar endings”) were also quite common. This occurred when two words that were identical, similar, or had identical endings were found close to each other, and the eye of the copyist moved from the first to the second, omitting the words between them. (9) In the OT, errors were at times caused by the use of consonants as vowel letters in some ancient texts. Copyists unaware of this usage of vowel letters would copy them in as aberrant consonants. Normally unintentional errors are fairly easy to identify because they create nonsense readings.</p>
<p><span class="ital">Intentional errors</span> are much more difficult to identify and evaluate. Harmonizations from similar materials occurred with regularity. Difficult readings were subject to “improvement” by a thinking scribe. Objectionable expressions were sometimes eliminated or smoothed out. Occasionally synonyms were employed. Conflation (resolving a discrepancy between two variant readings by including both of them) often appears.</p>
<p>Awareness of these common problems is the first step in detecting and eliminating the more obvious errors and identifying and eliminating the peculiarities of a particular scribe. Then more subtle criteria for identifying the reading most likely to be the original must be employed. Procedures for applying such criteria are similar in both OT and NT work.</p>
<p class="h3">General Methodological Principles</p>
<p class="fl">Through the work of textual critics in the last several centuries, certain basic principles have evolved. The primary principles for the OT can be briefly summarized.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The basic text for primary consideration is the Masoretic Text because of the careful standardization it represents. That text is compared with the testimony of the ancient versions. The Septuagint, by reason of age and basic faithfulness to the Hebrew text, carries significant weight in all decisions. The Targums (Aramaic translations) also reflect the Hebrew base but exhibit a tendency to expansion and paraphrase. The Syriac (<span class="ital">Peshitta</span>), Vulgate (Latin), Old Latin, and Coptic versions add indirect evidence, although translations are not always clear witnesses in technical details. Use of such versions does enable scholars to use comparative philology in textual decisions and thus expose early errors for which the original reading probably has not survived.</p>
<p class="list">2. The reading that best explains the origin of other variants is preferable. Information from reconstruction of the history of transmission often provides additional insight. Knowledge of typical scribal errors enables the critic to make an educated decision on the sequence of variants.</p>
<p class="list">3. The shorter reading is preferable. The scribes frequently added material in order to solve style or syntax problems and seldom abridged or condensed material.</p>
<p class="list">4. The more difficult reading is more likely to be the original one. This principle is closely related to the third. Scribes did not intentionally create more complex readings. Unintentional errors are usually easy to identify. Thus the easier reading is normally suspect as a scribal alteration.</p>
<p class="list">5. Readings that are not harmonized or assimilated to similar passages are preferable. Copyists had a tendency to correct material on the basis of similar material elsewhere (sometimes even unconsciously).</p>
<p class="list">6. When all else fails, the textual critic must resort to conjectural emendation. To make an “educated guess” requires intimate acquaintance with the Hebrew language, familiarity with the author’s style, and an understanding of culture, customs, and theology that might color the passage. Use of conjecture must be limited to those passages in which the original reading has definitely not been transmitted to us.</p>
<p class="h3">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">It should be remembered that textual criticism operates only when two or more readings are possible for a specific word or phrase. For most of the biblical text, a single reading has been transmitted. Elimination of scribal errors and intentional changes leaves only a small percentage of the text about which any questions occur.</p>
<p>The field of textual criticism is complex, requiring the gathering and skillful use of a wide variety of information. Because it deals with the authoritative source of revelation for all Christians, textual argumentation has often been accompanied by emotion. Yet in spite of controversy, great progress has been made, particularly in the last century. Refinement of methodology has greatly aided our understanding of the accumulated materials. Additional aid has come from accumulations of information in related fields of study such as church history, biblical theology, and the history of Christian thought.</p>
<p>Collection and organization of all variant readings have enabled modern textual critics to give strong assurance that the Word of God has been transmitted in accurate and dependable form. Although variant readings have become obvious through the publication of so many manuscripts, inadequate, inferior, and secondary readings have been largely eliminated. In relatively few places is conjectural emendation necessary. In matters pertaining to the Christian’s salvation, clear and unmistakable transmission provides authoritative answers. Christians are thus in debt to the textual critics who have worked, and are working, to provide a dependable biblical text.</p>

<p class="h1">BIBLE*, M<span class="lc">anuscripts and Text of the (New Testament)</span></p>
<p class="fl">Copies of the NT books produced by scribes and editions made from these copies. In the centuries prior to the simultaneous-multiple production of copies via dictation (wherein many scribes in a scriptorium transcribed a text dictated to them by one reader), all manuscript copies were made singly—each scribe producing a copy from an exemplar.</p>
<p>Prior to the 15th century, when Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type for the printing press, all copies of any work of literature were made by hand (hence, the name “manuscript”). According to a current tabulation, there are 99 papyrus manuscripts, 257 uncial manuscripts, and 2,795 minuscule manuscripts. We can add 2,209 Greek lectionaries to this list. Therefore, we have over 5,350 manuscript copies of the Greek NT or portions thereof. No other work of Greek literature can boast of such numbers.</p>

<p class="h2" id="ImportantPapyrusManuscripts">Important Papyrus Manuscripts</p>
<p class="fl">Papyrus is a tall, aquatic reed, the pith of which is cut into strips, laid in a crosswork pattern and glued together to make a page for writing. The papyrus rolls of Egypt have been used as a writing surface since the early third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. The Greeks adopted papyrus around 900 <span class="era">BC</span>, and later the Romans adopted its use. However, the oldest extant Greek rolls of papyrus date from the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Unfortunately, papyrus is perishable, requiring a dry climate for its preservation. That is why so many papyri have been discovered in the desert sands of Egypt.</p>
<p>The NT papyrus manuscripts (abbreviated as “P”) are generally the earliest manuscripts of the NT. Broadly speaking, the most important ones can be categorized in three groups: the Oxyrhynchus Papyri (from Oxyrhynchus, Egypt), (2) the Beatty Papyri (named after the owner); and (3) the Bodmer Papyri (named after the owner).</p>
<p class="h3">The Oxyrhynchus Papyri</p>
<p class="fl">Beginning in 1898 B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt discovered thousands of papyrus fragments in the ancient rubbish heaps of Oxyrhynchus, Egypt. This site yielded volumes of papyrus fragments containing all sorts of written material (literature, business and legal contracts, letters, etc.) as well as over 40 manuscripts containing portions of the NT. Some of the more noteworthy papyrus manuscripts from Oxyrhynchus are as follows:</p>
<p class="h4">P1 (P. Oxy. 2)</p>
<p class="fl">This late second-century manuscript contains <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-9,12,14-20">Matthew 1:1-9, 12, 14-20</a>. Grenfell and Hunt in the winter of 1896–97 went to Oxyrhynchus (now called El Bahnasa) in search of ancient Christian documents. P1 was discovered on the second day of the dig. At the time of this discovery, this was the earliest extant copy of any NT portion—at least 100 years earlier than Codex Vaticanus. The copyist of P1 seems to have faithfully followed a very reliable exemplar. Where there are major variants, P1 agrees with the best Alexandrian witnesses, especially B (Codex Vaticanus), from which it rarely varies.</p>
<p class="h4">P5 (P. Oxy. 208 and 1781)</p>
<p class="fl">Two separate portions of this third-century manuscript were unearthed from Oxyrhynchus by Grenfell and Hunt, both from the same papyrus manuscript. The first portion contains <a href="?bref=John.1.23-31,33-40">John 1:23-31, 33-40</a> on one fragment and <a href="?bref=John.20.11-17">John 20:11-17</a> on another—probably on the first and last quires of a manuscript containing only the Gospel of John. This portion was published in volume II of <span class="ital">Oxyrhynchus Papyri</span> in 1899; the second portion—containing <a href="?bref=John.16.14-30">John 16:14-30</a>—was not published until 1922 in volume XV of <span class="ital">Oxyrhynchus Papyri.</span></p>
<p>After examining the first portion, Grenfell and Hunt said, “The text is a good one, and appears to have affinities with that of Codex Sinaiticus, with which the papyrus agrees in several readings not found elsewhere.” The papyrus, written in a documentary hand, is marked for its brevity.</p>
<p class="h4">P13 (P. Oxy. 657 and PSI 1292)</p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, dated between 175 and 225, contains 12 columns from a roll preserving the text of <a href="?bref=Heb.2.14-5.5">Hebrews 2:14–5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.8-22">10:8-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.29-11.13">10:29–11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.28-12.7">11:28–12:7</a>. The text of Hebrews was written in a reformed documentary hand on the back of the papyrus containing the new epitome of Livy. For this reason, some scholars think the manuscript was possibly brought to Egpyt by a Roman official and left behind when he left his post. P13 very often agrees with B, and it supplements B where it is lacking—namely, from <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14">Hebrews 9:14</a> to the end of Hebrews. P13 and P46 display nearly the same text. Out of a total of 88 variation-units, there are 71 agreements and only 17 disagreements.</p>
<p class="h4">P77 (P. Oxy. 2683 + 4405)</p>
<p class="fl">Dated c. 150–75, this is the earliest manuscript of Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.30-39">23:30-39</a>). The manuscript is clearly a literary production. It was written in an elegant hand and has what was or became a standard system of chapter division, as well as punctuation and breathing marks. P77 has close textual affinities with Codex Sinaiticus.</p>
<p class="h4">P90 (P. Oxy. 3523)</p>
<p class="fl">This second-century manuscript (c. 150–75) contains <a href="?bref=John.18.36-19.7">John 18:36–19:7</a>. The handwriting (an upright, rounded, elegant script) is much like that found in P66. Furthermore, P90 has more affinity with P66 than with any other single manuscript, though it does not concur with P66 in its entirety.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="PapyrusManuscriptOfJohn"/>
<p class="h4">P. Oxy. 4404</p>
<p class="fl">Containing <a href="?bref=Matt.21.34-37,43,45">Matthew 21:34-37, 43, 45</a>, this manuscript could be the earliest extant manuscript of the NT in that the script is early Roman and therefore could be dated to the early second century.</p>
<p class="h3">The Chester Beatty Papyri</p>
<p class="fl">These manuscripts were purchased from a dealer in Egypt during the 1930s by Chester Beatty and by the University of Michigan. The three manuscripts in this collection are very early and contain a large portion of the NT text. P45 (c. 200) contains portions of all four Gospels and Acts; P46 (c. 125) has almost all of Paul’s epistles and Hebrews; and P47 (third century) contains <a href="?bref=Rev.9.1-17.18">Revelation 9–17</a>.</p>
<p class="h4">P45 (Chester Beatty Papyrus I)</p>
<p class="fl">This codex has the four Gospels and Acts (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.24-32">Mt 20:24-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.13-19">21:13-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41-26.39">25:41–26:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.36-9.31">Mk 4:36–9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.27-12.28">11:27–12:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.31-7.7">Lk 6:31–7:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.26-14.33">9:26–14:33</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.51-5.2">Jn 4:51–5:2</a>, <a href="?bref=John.5.21-25">21-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.7-25">10:7-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.30-11.10">10:30–11:10</a>, <a href="?bref=John.11.18-36,42-57">18-36, 42-57</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.4.27-17.17">Acts 4:27–17:17</a>). The order of books in the original intact manuscript was probably as follows: Matthew, John, Luke, Mark, Acts (the so-called Western order). This manuscript was dated by Kenyon to the early third century, a date that was confirmed by the papyrologists W. Schubart and H. I. Bell. This continues to be the date assigned to this manuscript in modern handbooks on textual criticism and critical editions of the Greek NT, but the consistent formation of certain letters suggests an earlier date—maybe sometime in the late second century.</p>
<p>The scribe of P45 worked without any intention of exactly reproducing his source. He wrote with a great amount of freedom—harmonizing, smoothing out, substituting at will. In short, the scribe did not actually copy words. He saw through the language to its idea-content, and copied that in words of his own choosing, or in rearranged order. Thus, in the scribe of P45 we see an exegete and a paraphraser.</p>
<p class="h4">P46 (Chester Beatty Papyrus II)</p>
<p class="fl">This codex has most of Paul’s epistles (excluding the Pastorals) in this order: <a href="?bref=Rom.5.17-6.14">Romans 5:17–6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.15-15.9">8:15–15:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.11-16.27">15:11–16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-13.25">Hebrews 1:1–13:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-16.22">1 Corinthians 1:1–16:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-13.13">2 Corinthians 1:1–13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.1-6.24">Ephesians 1:1–6:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.1-6.18">Galatians 1:1–6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1-4.23">Philippians 1:1–4:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.1-4.18">Colossians 1:1–4:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.9-2.3">1:9–2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.5-9,23-28">5:5-9, 23-28</a> (with minor lacunae in each of the books).</p>
<p>The manuscript was originally dated to the early third century. But others, since, have dated the manuscript earlier in the second century. The scribe who produced this manuscript used an early, excellent exemplar. He was a professional scribe because there are stichoi notations at the end of several books (see the conclusion of Romans, 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians). The stichoi were used by professionals to note how many lines had been copied for commensurate pay. Most likely, the ex officio of the scriptorium (perhaps connected with a church library) paginated the codex and indicated the stichoi. The scribe himself made a few corrections as he went, and then several other readers made corrections here and there.</p>
<p>The text of P46 shows a strong affinity with B (especially in Ephesians, Colossians, and Hebrews) and next with א (Codex Sinaiticus). P46 agrees much less with the later representatives of the Alexandrian text. In short, P46 is proto-Alexandrian. In Hebrews, P46 and P13 display nearly the same text. Out of a total of 88 variation-units, there are 71 agreements and only 17 disagreements.</p>
<p class="h4">P47 (Chester Beatty Papyrus III)</p>
<p class="fl">This third-century codex contains <a href="?bref=Rev.9.10-17.2">Revelation 9:10–17:2</a>. The text of P47 agrees more often with that of Codex Sinaiticus than with any other manuscript (including Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus), though it often shows independence.</p>
<p class="h3">The Bodmer Papyri</p>
<p class="fl">These manuscripts were purchased by M. Martin Bodmer from a dealer in Egypt during the 1950s and 1960s. The three important papyri in this collection are P66 (c. 175, containing almost all of John), P72 (third century, having all of 1 and 2 Peter and Jude), and P75 (c. 200, containing large parts of <a href="?bref=Luke.3.1-38">Luke 3</a>—<a href="?bref=John.15.1-27">John 15</a>).</p>
<p class="h4" id="P66">P66 (Papyrus Bodmer II)</p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript contains most of John’s Gospel (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-6.11">1:1–6:11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.35-14.26">6:35–14:26</a>, <a href="?bref=John.14.29-30">29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.2-26">15:2-26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.2-4,6-7">16:2-4, 6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.10-20.20">16:10–20:20</a>, <a href="?bref=John.20.22-23">22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.25-21.9">20:25–21:9</a>). The manuscript does not include the pericope of the adulteress (<a href="?bref=John.7.53-8.11">7:53–8:11</a>), making it the earliest witness to not include this spurious passage. The manuscript is usually dated as c. 200, but the renowned paleographer Herbert Hunger has argued that P66 should be dated to the first half, if not the first quarter, of the second century.</p>
<p>According to recent studies, it seems evident that P66 has preserved the work of three individuals: the original scribe, a thoroughgoing corrector, and a minor corrector. With a practiced calligraphic hand, the original scribe of P66 wrote in larger print as he went along in order to fill out the codex. The large print throughout indicates that it was written to be read aloud to a Christian congregation. The text exhibits the scribe’s knowledge of other portions of Scripture (inasmuch as he harmonized <a href="?bref=John.6.69">John 6:69</a> to <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Matthew 16:16</a> and <a href="?bref=John.21.6">John 21:6</a> to <a href="?bref=Luke.5.5">Luke 5:5</a>), his use of standard <span class="ital">nomina sacra</span> (a way of writing divine names), and his special use of <span class="ital">nomina sacra</span> for the words “cross” and “crucify.”</p>
<p>The original scribe was quite free in his interaction with the text; he produced several singular readings that reveal his independent interpretation of the text. While the numerous scribal mistakes would seem to indicate that the scribe was inattentive, many of the singular readings—prior to correction—reveal that he was not detached from the narrative of the text. Rather, he became so absorbed in his reading that he often forgot the exact words he was copying. His task as a copyist was to duplicate the exemplar word for word, but this was frustrated by the fact that he was reading the text in logical semantic chunks and often became a coproducer of a new text. As a result, he continually had to stop his reading and make many in-process corrections. But he left several places uncorrected, which were later fixed by the <span class="ital">diorthotes</span> (official corrector). The finished product is quite good, presenting a text that is very close to the Alexandrian witnesses.</p>
<p class="h4">P72 (Papyrus Bodmer VII–VIII)</p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, dated late third century, has an interesting collection of writings in one codex: <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1-5.14">1 Peter 1:1–5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.1-3.18">2 Peter 1:1–3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.1-25">Jude 1:1-25</a>; the Nativity of Mary, the apocryphal correspondence of Paul to the Corinthians, the eleventh ode of Solomon, Melito’s Homily on the Passover, a fragment of a hymn, the Apology of Phileas, and <a href="?bref=Ps.33.1-22">Psalms 33</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>.</p>
<p>Scholars think that four scribes took part in producing the entire manuscript. First Peter has clear Alexandrian affinities—especially with B. Second Peter and (especially) Jude display more of an uncontrolled type text (usually associated with the “Western” text), with several independent readings.</p>
<p class="h4">P75 (Papyrus Bodmer XIV–XV)</p>
<p class="fl">This codex contains most of Luke and John (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.18-4.2">Lk 3:18–4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.34-5.10">4:34–5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.37-18.18">5:37–18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.4-24.53">22:4–24:53</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.1-11.45">Jn 1:1–11:45</a>, <a href="?bref=John.11.48-57">48-57</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.3-13.1">12:3–13:1</a>, <a href="?bref=John.13.8-9">8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.8-30">14:8-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.7-8">15:7-8</a>.) The manuscript does not include the pericope of the adulteress (<a href="?bref=John.7.53-8.11">7:53–8:11</a>). The manuscript can be dated to the late second or early third century.</p>
<p>The copyist of P75 was a literate scribe trained in making books. His craftsmanship shows through in his tight calligraphy and controlled copying. The handwriting displayed in this manuscript is typically called by paleographers the common angular type of the late second to early third century. The scribe’s Christianity shows in his abbreviations of the <span class="ital">nomina sacra</span><span class="ital">,</span> as well as in his abbreviation of the word “cross.” These are telltale signs of a scribe who belonged to the Christian community. Furthermore, the large typeface indicates that the manuscript was composed to be read aloud to a Christian congregation. The scribe even added a system of sectional divisions to aid any would-be lector. Thus, we have a manuscript written by a Christian for other Christians.</p>
<p>There are several indications of the scribe’s Alexandrian orientation. First and foremost is his scriptoral acumen. He is the best of all the early Christian scribes, and his manuscript is an extremely accurate copy. P75 is the work of an extremely disciplined scribe who copied with the intention of being careful and accurate. Scholars generally agree that P75 displays the kind of text that was used in making Codex Vaticanus (there is 87 percent agreement between P75 and B). As such, textual scholars have a high regard for P75’s textual fidelity.</p>

<p class="h3">Other Papyrus Manuscripts</p>
<p class="h4">P4 + P64 + P67</p>
<p class="fl">These three papyrus manuscripts are part of one codex dated <span class="era">AD</span> 150–175. The manuscript was the work of a professional scribe, and the text is extremely accurate.</p>
<p class="h4">P32 (Rylands Papyrus 5)</p>
<p class="fl">This manuscript, preserving <a href="?bref=Titus.1.11-15">Titus 1:11-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.3-8">2:3-8</a>, is dated c. 175, making it the earliest extant copy of any of the Pastoral Epistles. P32 shows agreement with א and with F and G. Since F and G (nearly identical manuscripts) go back to the same archetype, it is possible that P32 could be linked to the same source.</p>
<p class="h4">P52 (Rylands Papyrus 457)</p>
<p class="fl">This fragment, containing <a href="?bref=John.18.31-34,37-38">John 18:31-34, 37-38</a>, is noteworthy because of its date: c. 110–125. Many scholars (F. Kenyon, H. I. Bell, A. Deissmann, and W. H. P. Hatch) have confirmed this dating. The manuscript came from the Fayum or Oxyrhynchus site. It was acquired in 1920 by Grenfell, but it remained unnoticed among hundreds of papyri until 1934, when C. H. Roberts recognized that this fragment preserves a few verses from John’s Gospel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ImportantUncialManuscripts">Important Uncial Manuscripts</p>
<p class="fl">The manuscripts typically classified as “uncial” are so designated to differentiate them from papyrus manuscripts. In a sense, this is a misnomer because the real difference has to do with the material they are written on—vellum (treated animal hide) as compared to papyrus—not the kind of letters used. Indeed, the papyri are also written in uncials (capital letters), but the term “uncial” typically describes the majuscule lettering that was prominent in fourth-century biblical texts, such as in א, A, B, C.</p>
<p class="h3">Codex Sinaiticus (or א)</p>
<p class="fl">This codex contains the entire OT and the NT in this order: the four Gospels, the Pauline Epistles (including Hebrews), Acts, the General Epistles, Revelation. It also includes the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The codex cannot be earlier than 340 (the year Eusebius died) because the Eusebian sections of the text are indicated in the margins of the Gospels by a contemporary hand. Most scholars date it 350–375.</p>
<p>This codex was discovered by Constantin von Tischendorf in St Catherine’s Monastery (situated at the foot of Mt Sinai). On a visit to the monastery in 1844 he noticed in a wastebasket some parchment leaves that were being used to light the lamps. He was allowed to take this waste paper, which proved to be 43 leaves from various parts of the Greek translation of the OT. </p>
<p>In 1853 he made a second trip to the monastery and found nothing. In 1859, however, on his third trip, he found not only other parts of the OT but also the complete NT. He was finally able to persuade the monastery authorities to present the manuscript to the czar, the great patron of the Greek Catholic Church, who placed it in the Imperial Library in St Petersburg. The czar gave great honors to the monastery and its authorities, and everybody seemed well pleased. Later Tischendorf was charged with having stolen the manuscript from its lawful owners, but the better textual scholars do not accept that story.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="CodexSinaiticus"/>
<p>The manuscript remained in the Imperial Library until 1933, when it was purchased by the British Museum for the huge sum of £100,000 (about $500,000). Textual criticism made the headlines because one manuscript was bought for this much money, raised largely by public subscription during the Great Depression. The manuscript is now on display in the manuscript room of the museum, where it is considered one of its most prized possessions.</p>
<p>The text of Sinaiticus is very closely related to that of Codex Vaticanus. They agree in presenting the purest type of text, usually called the Alexandrian text type. Tischendorf greatly used the textual evidence of Codex Sinaiticus in preparing his critical editions of the Greek NT. Tischendorf thought four scribes had originally produced the codex, whom he named scribes A, B, C, D. After reinvestigation, H. J. Milne and T. C. Skeat identified only three scribes: A (who wrote the historical and poetical books of the OT, as well as most of the NT), B (who wrote the Prophets and the Shepherd of Hermas), and D (who wrote some Psalms, Tobit, Judith, and 4 Maccabees, and redid small sections of the NT). Milne and Skeat demonstrated that scribe A of Codex Vaticanus was likely the same scribe as scribe D of Codex Sinaiticus. If this true, then א is contemporary with B—perhaps produced in the same scriptorium in Alexandria. Codex Sinaiticus provides a fairly reliable witness to the NT; however, the scribe was not as careful as the scribe of B.</p>
<p class="h3">Codex Alexandrinus (A)</p>
<p class="fl">This is one of the three most important codices containing early copies of the whole Bible in Greek (the other two being the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus codexes). The name Alexandrinus comes from ancient records suggesting that it was copied in Egypt during the early part of the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>. The early history of this manuscript and its Egyptian provenance is partially revealed by its flyleaves. A note by Cyril of Lucar (patriarch of Alexandria and then of Constantinople in the 1620s) states that, according to tradition, it was written by Thecla, a noble lady of Egypt shortly after the Council of Nicaea (325) and that her name was originally inscribed at the end of the volume but the last page was lost due to mutilation. An Arabic note of the 13th or 14th century also says that the manuscript was written by “Thecla the martyr.” Another Arabic note says that is was presented to the patriarchal cell of Alexandria (c. 1098). Cyril of Lucar took the manuscript from Alexandria to Constantinople in 1621 and then gave it to Charles I of England in 1627, where it became part of the Royal Library, then later the British Museum.</p>
<p>Only 773 of the original 820 or so pages still exist. The rest were lost as the book was passed down through the centuries. The surviving parts of Alexandrinus contain a Greek translation of the whole OT, the Apocrypha (including four books of Maccabees and Psalm 151), most of the NT, and some early Christian writings (of which the First and Second Epistles of Clement to the Corinthians are the most important).</p>
<p>Frederick Kenyon thought the codex was the work of five scribes, to each of whom he designated a Roman numeral. According to Kenyon, scribes I and II copied the OT; scribe III did Matthew, Mark, <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.8">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>—<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.25">Philemon 1:25</a>; scribe IV did Luke—Acts, General Epistles, <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1--1Cor.10.8">Romans 1:1—1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; and scribe V did Revelation. Milne and Skeat, however, argued that the whole codex was the work of two copyists (I and II). W. H. P. Hatch noted that many corrections have been made in the manuscript, most of them at an early date. Some of these corrections were introduced by the scribe himself, and others came from later hands.</p>
<p>Evidently, the scribes of this codex used exemplars of varying quality for various sections of the NT. The exemplar used for the Gospels was of poor quality, reflecting a Byzantine text type. Its testimony in the Epistles is much better, and in Revelation it provides the best witness to the original text.</p>

<p class="h3">Codex Vaticanus (B)</p>
<p class="fl">Codex Vaticanus is the Vatican Manuscript, so named because it is the most famous manuscript in the Vatican Library in Rome. This manuscript has been in the Vatican’s library since at least 1475, but it was not made available to scholars, such as Constantin von Tischendorf and Samuel Tregelles, until the middle of the 19th century.</p>
<p>At one time, the codex contained the whole Greek Bible, including most of the books of the Apocrypha, but it has lost many of its leaves. Originally it must have had about 820 leaves (1,640 pp), but now it has 759—617 in the OT and 142 in the NT. The major gaps of the manuscript are <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-46.28">Genesis 1:1–46:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.5-7,10-13">2 Samuel 2:5-7, 10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.27-138.6">Psalms 106:27–138:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14-13.25">Hebrews 9:14–13:25</a>; the Pastoral Epistles; and Revelation. Each leaf measures ten and a half by ten inches (26.7 by 25.4 centimeters). Each page has three columns (two for the poetical books) with 40 to 44 lines to the column. The manuscript was written by two different scribes. It is dated in the early to middle part of the fourth century. It is not known where the manuscript originated, but it has been in the Vatican Library from the time of its earliest catalog in 1475.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="CodexVaticanus"/>
<p>When Napoleon conquered Rome, he brought its treasures to Paris, including this manuscript. The scholar Hug identified it and called the attention of other scholars to it. After the downfall of Napoleon, the manuscript was returned to the Vatican Library. Competent textual scholars were not allowed to do careful work on it until a photographic edition was published in 1890. It is now on exhibit in the Vatican Library.</p>
<p>The text of the Vatican Manuscript is much like that of Codex Sinaiticus. These are generally recognized as the two finest examples of the Alexandrian type of Greek text of the NT. The Greek text of the OT is very fine too, but it is not quite so important, as the original language of the OT was Hebrew. Virtually all the textual scholars since the days of Brooke Westcott and Fenton Hort (who brought out their Greek Testament, including their theory of textual criticism, in 1881), recognize this neutral type of text as a very early text and a very pure text, an extremely accurate reproduction of what the original text must have been. Westcott and Hort called it a second-century text accurate in 999 out of 1,000 words so far as any matter of translatable difference was concerned. א and B are the finest examples of this type of text, but it is also found in a few other Greek uncial manuscripts, a few of the early translations, and in the writings of a few of the early church fathers. Since the days of Westcott and Hort, their theory has been confirmed by the discovery of some papyrus manuscripts, notably the Bodmer Papyri, discovered in the 1950s.</p>
<p class="h3">Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C)</p>
<p class="fl">This codex is a palimpsest (the original writing was erased and different words written on the same material). It originally contained the entire Bible but now has only parts of six OT books and portions of all NT books except 2 Thessalonians and 2 John. The single-column Bible text, written in the 5th century <span class="era">AD</span>, was erased in the 12th century and replaced by a two-column text of a Greek translation of sermons or treatises by a certain Ephraem, a 4th-century Syrian church leader. Such a practice was common in periods of economic depression or when parchment was scarce. The original writing was scraped from the writing surface and the surface smoothed. Then new compositions could be written on the prepared surface. Using chemicals Tischendorf was able to read much of the erased document.</p>
<p>The manuscript may have been brought from the east to Florence by a learned Greek named Andrew John Lascar in the time of Lorenzo de’Medici. Since Lascar was known as Rhyndacenus (from the river Rhyndacus), he probably came from the region of Phrygia (site of ancient Laodicea). Where the manuscript was prior to this is not known. The Ephraemi manuscript was brought to Italy in the early sixth century, where it became the property of the Medici family. Catherine de’Medici took it to France, where it remains today.</p>
<p>The text of this manuscript is mixed—it is compounded from all the major text types, agreeing frequently with the later koine of Byzantine type, which most scholars regard as the least valuable type of NT text.</p>
<p class="h3">Codex Bezae (D)</p>
<p class="fl">This is a Greek-Latin diglot containing Matthew—Acts, 3 John, with lacunae. Most scholars date it late fourth or early fifth century (c. 400). Some scholars think the codex was produced in either Egypt or North Africa by a scribe whose mother tongue was Latin. Another scholar (D. C. Parker) has argued that it was copied in Beirut, a center of Latin legal studies during the fifth century, where both Latin and Greek were used. Evidently, it was produced by a scribe who knew Latin better than Greek, and then was corrected by several scribes. In any event, the codex somehow came into the hands of Theodore Beza, French scholar and successor to Calvin. Beza gave it to the Cambridge University Library in 1581.</p>
<p>This codex is probably the most controversial of the NT uncials because of its marked independence. Its many additions, omissions, and alterations (especially in Luke and Acts) are the work of a significant theologian. A few earlier manuscripts (P29, P38, P48, and 0171) appear to be precursors to the type of text found in D, which is considered the principal witness of the Western text-type. Thus, Codex Bezae could be a copy of an earlier revised edition. This reviser must have been a scholar who had a propensity for adding historical, biographical, and geographical details. More than anything, he was intent on filling in gaps in the narrative by adding circumstantial details.</p>
<p class="h3">Codex Washingtonianus, or The Freer Gospels (W)</p>
<p class="fl">This codex, dated around 400, has the four Gospels and Acts. It is often referred to as the Freer Gospels—named after its owner, Charles Freer. The codex likely came from the ruins of a monastery near Giza. The handwriting is quite similar to that found in a fifth-century fragment of the book of Enoch found at Akhmim in 1886.</p>
<p>Codex W was copied from a parent manuscript (exemplar) that had been pieced together from several different manuscripts. This is obvious because the textual presentation of W is noticeably variegated and even the stratification of the text is matched by similar variations in paragraphing. The scribe who collated the parent manuscript drew upon various sources to put together his Gospel codex. It is likely that the scribe of the parent manuscript used a text that came from North Africa (the “Western” text) for the first part of Mark, and the scribe of W used manuscripts from Antioch for Matthew and the second part of Luke to fill the gaps in the more ancient manuscript he was copying. Detailed textual analysis reveals the variegated textual stratifications of W, as follows: in Matthew the text is Byzantine; in Mark the text is first Western (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1-5.30">1:1–5:30</a>), then Caesarean in <a href="?bref=Mark.5.31-16.20">Mark 5:31–16:20</a> (akin to P45); in Luke the text is first Alexandrian (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-8.12">1:1–8:12</a>), then Byzantine. John is more complicated because the first part of John (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-5.11">1:1–5:11</a>), which fills a quire, was the work of a seventh-century scribe who must have replaced a damaged quire. (W<span class="sup">s</span> designates the work of this scribe.) This first section has a mixture of Alexandrian and Western readings, as does the rest of John.</p>
<p class="h3">Codex 1739</p>
<p class="fl">This tenth-century codex has Acts and the Epistles. The manuscript was discovered at Mt Athos in 1879 by E. von der Goltz. The manuscript has strong textual affinities with P46, B, 1739, Coptic Sahidic, Coptic Boharic, Clement, and Origen. The relationship between P46, B, and 1739 is remarkable because 1739 is a tenth-century manuscript that was copied from a fourth-century manuscript of excellent quality. According to a colophon, the scribe of 1739 for the Pauline Epistles followed a manuscript that came from Caesarea in the library of Pamphilus and that contained an Origenian text. The three manuscripts, P46, B, and 1739, form a clear textual line: from P46 (early second century) to B (early fourth century) to 1739 (tenth century based on fourth century).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTextoftheNewTestament">The Text of the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The original text of the NT is the “published” text—that is, the text as it was in its final edited form and released for circulation in the Christian community. For some books of the NT, there is little difference between the original composition and the published text. After the author wrote or dictated his work, he (or an associate) made the final editorial corrections and then released it for distribution. As is the case for books published in modern times, so in ancient times, the original writing of the author is not always the same as what is published—due to the editorial process. Nonetheless, the author is credited with the final edited text, and the published book is attributed to the author and considered the autograph. This autograph is the original published text. Of course, in this case the autographs do not exist, so scholars have to rely on copies to recover or reconstruct the original wording.</p>
<p>Some scholars think it is impossible to recover the original text of the Greek NT because they have not been able to reconstruct the early history of textual transmission. Other modern scholars are less pessimistic but still quite guarded in affirming the possiblity. And yet others are optimistic because we possess many early manuscripts of excellent quality and because our view of the early period of textual transmission has been getting clearer and clearer.</p>
<p>When we speak of recovering the text of the NT, we are referring to individual books of the NT, not to the entire volume per se, because each book (or group of books—such as the Pauline Epistles) had its own unique history of textual transmission. The earliest extant copy of an entire NT text is the one preserved in Codex Sinaiticus (written about <span class="era">AD</span> 375). (Codex Vaticanus lacks the Pastoral Epistles and Revelation.) Prior to the fourth century, the NT was circulated in its various parts: as a single book or a group of books (such as the four Gospels or the Pauline Epistles). Manuscripts from the late first century to the third century have been found with individual books such as Matthew (P1, P77), Mark (P88), Luke (P69), John (P5, 22, 52, 66), Acts (P91), Revelation (P18, 47), or containing groups of books, such as the four Gospels with Acts (P45), the Pauline Epistles (P30, P46, P92), the Petrine Epistles and Jude (P72). Each of the books of the NT has had its own textual history and has been preserved with varying degrees of accuracy. Nonetheless, all of the books were altered from the original state due to the process of manual copying decade after decade and century after century. And the text of each of the books needs to be recovered.</p>
<p>The NT text was affected with many variations in its early history. In the late first and early second century, the oral traditions and the written word existed side by side with equal status—especially with respect to the material of the Gospels. Often, the text was changed by scribes attempting to conform the written message to the oral tradition or attempting to conform one Gospel account to another. By the end of the second century and into the third century, many of the significant variant readings entered into the textual stream.</p>
<p>The early period of textual transmission, however, was not completely marred by textual infidelity and scribal liberty. There were those scribes who copied the text faithfully and reverently—that is, they recognized that they were copying a sacred text written by an apostle. The formalization of canonization did not ascribe this sacredness to the text. Canonization came about as the result of common, historical recognition of the sacredness of various NT books. Certain NT books, such as the four Gospels, Acts, and Paul’s epistles were considered inspired literature from the onset. As such, certain scribes copied them with reverential fidelity.</p>
<p>Other scribes, however, felt free to make “improvements” in the text—either in the interest of doctrine and harmonization or due to the influence of a competitive oral tradition. The manuscripts produced in such a manner created a kind of “popular text”—i.e., an uncontrolled text. (This text type used to be called the “Western text,” but scholars now recognize this as a misnomer.)</p>
<p>During the second century, there were a few men who produced recensions of the NT text. According to Eusebius, Theodotus (and his followers) altered the text for their own purposes. In the middle of the second century, Marcion expunged his copies of the Gospel according to Luke of all references to the Jewish background of Jesus, and Tatian’s harmony of the Gospels contains several textual alterations that gave support to ascetic views. And yet another recendor created the D-type text for the Gospels and Acts. This theologically minded redactor, living in the late second or third century, created a text that had short-lived popularity. Three third-century papyri, P29, P38, P48, each containing a portion from the book of Acts, may be precursors to the D-type text in Acts. But there are other papyri containing portions of Acts that provide even earlier testimony to a purer form of Acts—namely, P45 (c. 150) and P91 (c. 200), thereby showing that the D-type text of Acts did not necessarily antedate the purer form.</p>
<p>Besides these endeavors—which are all noted for creating textual impurities—there was no recension of the NT text in the second century. Rather, it was a period in which there were scribes who exercised freedom in copying and those who demonstrated acumen. The manuscripts produced by the latter are those that come closest to preserving the original text. A prime example of an accurate late-second-century manuscript is P75.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that the text produced by the scribe of P75 is a very accurate manuscript. It is also well-known that P75 was the kind of manuscript used in formulating Codex Vaticanus—the readings of P75 and B are remarkably similar. Prior to the discovery of P75, certain scholars thought Codex Vaticanus was the work of a fourth-century recension; others (chiefly Hort) thought it must trace back to a very early and accurate copy. Hort said that Codex Vaticanus preserves “not only a very ancient text, but a very pure line of a very ancient text” (Westcott and Hort, <span class="ital">The</span> <span class="ital">Introduction to the New Testament in the Original Greek,</span> pp 250–51). P75 appears to have shown that Hort was right.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of P75, many textual scholars were convinced that the second- and third-century papyri displayed a text in flux, a text characterized only by individual independence. The Chester Beatty Papyrus, P45, and the Bodmer Papyri, P66 and P72 (in 2 Peter and Jude), show this kind of independence. Scholars thought that scribes at Alexandria must have used several such texts to produce a good recension—as is exhibited in Codex Vaticanus. But we now know that Codex Vaticanus was not the result of a scholarly recension, resulting from editorial selection across the various textual histories. Rather, it is now quite clear that Codex Vaticanus was simply a copy (with some modifications) of a manuscript much like P75, not a fourth-century recension.</p>
<p>Some scholars may point out that this does not automatically mean that P75 and B represent the original text. What it does mean, they say, is that we have a second-century manuscript showing great affinity with a fourth-century manuscript whose quality has been highly esteemed. But various scholars have demonstrated that there was no Alexandrian recension before the time of P75 (late second century) and B (early fourth) and that both these manuscripts represent a relatively pure form of preservation of a relatively pure line of descent from the original text.</p>
<p>The current view about the early text is that certain scribes in Alexandria and/or scribes familiar with Alexandrian scriptoral practices (perhaps those in Oxyrhynchus) were probably responsible for maintaining a relatively pure text throughout the second, third, and fourth centuries. The Alexandrian scribes, associated with or actually employed by the scriptorium of the great Alexandrian library and/or members of the scriptorium associated with the catechetical school at Alexandria (called the <span class="ital">Didaskelion</span>), were trained philologists, grammarians, and textual critics. Their work on the NT was not recensional—that is, it was not an organized emendation of the text. Rather, the work of purification and preservation was probably done here and there by various individuals trained in text criticism. This is apparent in the production of P66, which contains the Gospel of John. This manuscript was probably produced in an Egyptian scriptorium by a novice scribe who made many blunders, which were subsequently corrected by another scribe working in the same scriptorium. The first text produced by the novice could be classified as being very “free,” but the corrected text is far more accurate. (See <a href="#P66">the discussion on this manuscript above</a>.)</p>
<p>What appears to have happened with the copying of the NT text in the early period in Egypt has been poignantly characterized by Zuntz. He said that when a book was immensely popular (such as Homer’s <span class="ital">Iliad</span> and <span class="ital">Odyssey,</span> or Plato’s writings), it was copied with wild enthusiasm by novice and scholar alike. But when grammarians and scribes got ahold of it, they tried to rid it of textual corruption. In the process, however, they may have obliterated some authentic readings, but not many. Thus, the popular text (also known as the “Western text”) could have preserved the original wording in some cases. The popular or free kind of text is displayed in several third-century manuscripts: P9, P37, P40, P45, P72, and P78.</p>
<p>In brief, this popular text is usually displayed in any kind of manuscript that was not produced by Alexandrian influences. This text, given to independence, is not as trustworthy as the Alexandrian text type. But because the Alexandrian text is known as a polished text, the popular text sometimes preserved the original wording. When a variant reading has the support of “Western” and Alexandrian texts, it is very likely original; but when the two are divided, the Alexandrian witnesses more often preserve the original wording.</p>
<p>One dilemma still remains for some textual critics. They cannot explain how a P75/B-type text coexisted with a Western-type text in the second century. All that can be said is that the Western text generally appears to be inferior to the P75/B-type text. Of course, this kind of judgment troubles certain scholars, who point out that the esteem given to B and P75 is based on a subjective appreciation of the kind of text they contain (as over against the Western text) rather than on any kind of theoretical reconstruction of the early transmission of the text. This same subjective estimation was at work when Westcott and Hort decided that B was intrinsically superior to D (see their <span class="ital">Introduction,</span> pp 32–42). Yet the praxis of textual criticism time and again demonstrates that the P75/B-type text is intrinsically superior to the Western text.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the manuscripts that represent a pure preservation of the original text are usually those called “Alexandrian.” Some scholars, such as Bruce Metzger, have called the earlier manuscripts “protoAlexandrian,” for they (or manuscripts like them) are thought of as being used to compose an Alexandrian-type text. However, this is looking at things from the perspective of the fourth century. We should look at things from the second century onward and then compare fourth-century manuscripts to those of the second. The second-century manuscripts could still be called “Alexandrian” in the sense that they were produced under Alexandrian influences. Perhaps a distinguishing terminology could be “early Alexandrian” (pre-Constantine) and “later Alexandrian” (post-Constantine). Manuscripts designated as “early Alexandrian” would generally be purer, less editorialized. Manuscripts designated “later Alexandrian” would display editorialization, as well as the influence of other textual traditions.</p>
<p>The “early Alexandrian” text is reflected in many second- and third-century manuscripts. On the top of the list is P75 (c. 175), the work of a competent and careful scribe. Not far behind in quality is P4+P64+P67 (c. 150), the work of an excellent copyist. Other extremely good copies are P1 (c. 200), P20 (early third century), P23 (c. 200), P27 (third century), P28 (third century), P32 (c. 150), P39 (third century), P46 (c. 125), P65 (third century), P66 (in its corrected form—P66<span class="sup">c</span>; c. 150), P70 (third century), P77 (c. 150), P87 (c. 125), P90 (c. 175), and P91 (c. 200). Several of these manuscripts have been placed in the “strict” category by textual critics Kurt and Barbara Aland—that is, they exhibit “strict” scribal control and therefore are accurate copies of an exemplar, if not the original. These manuscripts are P1, P23, P35, P37, P39, P64/67, P65, P70, and P75.</p>
<p>The “later Alexandrian” text, which displays editorial polishing, is exhibited in a few manuscripts, such as א (fourth century), T (fifth century), ע (seventh century), L (eighth century), 33 (ninth century), 1739 (a tenth-century manuscript copied from a fourth-century Alexandrian manuscript much like P46), and 579 (13th century). Beginning in the fifth century, Byzantine-type manuscripts began to make their influence in Egypt. Some manuscripts dated around 400 that came from Egypt clearly reflect this influence; Codex Alexandrinus (A) is probably the best example. Other Egyptian manuscripts of this era, such as Codex Sinaiticus (א) and Codex Washingtonianus (W) display large-scale harmonization, which cannot be directly linked to any kind of recension.</p>
<p>At the end of the third century, another kind of Greek text came into being and then grew in popularity until it became the dominant text-type throughout Christendom. This is the text-type first instigated by Lucian of Antioch, according to Jerome (in his introduction to his Latin translation of the Gospels). Lucian’s text was a definite recension (i.e., a purposely created edition)—as opposed to the Alexandrian text-type that came about as the result of a process wherein the Alexandrian scribes, upon comparing many manuscripts, attempted to preserve the best text—thereby serving more as textual critics than editors. Of course, the Alexandrians did do some editing—such as we would call copy-editing. The Lucianic text is the outgrowth and culmination of the popular text; it is characterized by smoothness of language, which is achieved by the removal of obscurities and awkward grammatical constructions and by the conflation of variant readings. Lucian (and/or his associates) must have used many different kinds of manuscripts of varying qualities to produce a harmonized, edited NT text. The kind of editorial work that went into the Lucianic text is what we would call substantive editing.</p>
<p>Lucian’s text was produced prior to the Diocletian persecution (c. 303), during which time many copies of the NT were confiscated and destroyed. Not long after this period of devastation, Constantine came to power and then recognized Christianity as the state religion. There was, of course, a great need for copies of the NT to be made and distributed to churches throughout the Mediterranean world. It was at this time that Lucian’s text began to be propagated by bishops going out from the Antiochan school to churches throughout the East, taking the text with them. Lucian’s text soon became the standard text of the Eastern church and formed the basis for the Byzantine text—and is thus the ultimate authority for the Textus Receptus.</p>
<p>While Lucian was forming his recension of the NT text, the Alexandrian text was taking on its final shape. As was mentioned earlier, the formation of the Alexandrian text-type was the result of a process (as opposed to a single editorial recension). The formation of the Alexandrian text involved minor textual criticism (i.e., selecting variant readings among various manuscripts) and copyediting (i.e., producing a readable text). There was far less tampering with the text in the Alexandrian text-type than in the Lucian, and the underlying manuscripts for the Alexandrian text-type were superior to those used by Lucian. Perhaps Hesychius was responsible for giving the Alexandrian text its final shape, and Athanasius of Alexandria may have been the one who made this text the archetypal text for Egypt.</p>
<p>As the years went by, there were fewer and fewer Alexandrian manuscripts produced, and more and more Byzantine manuscripts manufactured. Very few Egyptians continued to read Greek (with the exception of those in St Catherine’s Monastery, the site of the discovery of Codex Sinaiticus), and the rest of the Mediterranean world turned to Latin. It was only those in the Greek-speaking churches in Greece and Byzantium that continued to make copies of the Greek text. For century after century—from the 6th to the 14th—the great majority of NT manuscripts were produced in Byzantium, all bearing the same kind of text. When the first Greek NT was printed (c. 1525), it was based on a Greek text that Erasmus had compiled, using a few late Byzantine manuscripts. This printed text, with minor revisions, became the Textus Receptus.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 17th century, earlier manuscripts began to be discovered—manuscripts with a text that differed from that found in the Textus Receptus. Around 1630, Codex Alexandrinus was brought to England. An early fifth-century manuscript, containing the entire NT, it provided a good, early witness to the NT text (it is an especially good witness to the original text of Revelation). Two hundred years later, a German scholar named Constantin von Tischendorf discovered Codex Sinaiticus in St Catherine’s Monastery (located near Mt Sinai). The manuscript, dated around <span class="era">AD</span> 360, is one of the two oldest vellum (treated animal hide) manuscripts of the Greek NT. The earliest vellum manuscript, Codex Vaticanus, had been in the Vatican’s library since at least 1481, but it had not been made available to scholars until the middle of the 19th century. This manuscript, dated slightly earlier (<span class="era">AD</span> 350) than Codex Sinaiticus, had both the OT and NT in Greek, excluding the last part of the NT (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.15">Hebrews 9:15</a> to <a href="?bref=Rev.22.21">Revelation 22:21</a> and the Pastoral Epistles). A hundred years of textual criticism has determined that this manuscript is one of the most accurate and reliable witnesses to the original text.</p>
<p>Other early and important manuscripts were discovered in the 19th century. Through the tireless labors of men like Constantin von Tischendorf, Samuel Tregelles, and F. H. A. Scrivener, manuscripts such as Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, Codex Zacynthius, and Codex Augiensis were deciphered, collated, and published.</p>
<p>As the various manuscripts were discovered and made public, certain scholars labored to compile a Greek text that would more closely represent the original text than did the Textus Receptus. Around 1700 John Mill produced an improved Textus Receptus, and in the 1730s Johannes Albert Bengel (known as the father of modern textual and philological studies in the NT) published a text that deviated from the Textus Receptus according to the evidence of earlier manuscripts.</p>
<p>In the 1800s certain scholars began to abandon the Textus Receptus. Karl Lachman, a classical philologist, produced a fresh text (in 1831) that represented the fourth-century manuscripts. Samuel Tregelles (self-taught in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek), laboring throughout his entire lifetime, concentrated all of his efforts in publishing one Greek text (which came out in six parts, from 1857 to 1872). As is stated in the introduction to this work, Tregelles’s goal was “to exhibit the text of the NT in the very words in which it has been transmitted on the evidence of ancient authority.” Henry Alford also compiled a Greek text based upon the best and earliest manuscripts. In his preface to <span class="ital">The Greek New Testament</span> (a multivolume commentary on the Greek NT, published in 1849), Alford said he labored for the “demolition of the unworthy and pedantic reverence for the received text, which stood in the way of all chance of discovering the genuine word of God.”</p>
<p>During this same era, Tischendorf was devoting a lifetime of labor to discovering manuscripts and producing accurate editions of the Greek NT. In a letter to his fiancé he wrote, “I am confronted with a sacred task, the struggle to regain the original form of the NT.” In fulfillment of his desire, he discovered Codex Sinaiticus, deciphered the palimpsest Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, collated countless manuscripts, and produced several editions of the Greek NT (the eighth edition is considered the best).</p>
<p>Aided by the work of the previous scholars, two British men, Brooke Westcott and Fenton Hort, worked together for 28 years to produce a volume entitled <span class="ital">The New Testament in the Original Greek</span> (1881). Along with this publication, they made known their theory (which was chiefly Hort’s) that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus (along with a few other early manuscripts) represented a text that most closely replicated the original writing. They called this text the Neutral Text. (According to their studies, the Neutral Text described certain manuscripts that had the least amount of textual corruption.) This is the text that Westcott and Hort relied upon for compiling their volume.</p>
<p>The 19th century was a fruitful era for the recovery of the Greek NT; the 20th century, no less so. Those living in the 20th century have witnessed the discovery of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the Chester Beatty Papyri, and the Bodmer Papyri. To date, there are nearly 100 papyri containing portions of the NT—several of which date from the late first century to the early fourth century. These significant discoveries, providing scholars with many ancient manuscripts, have greatly enhanced the effort to recover the original wording of the NT.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, Eberhard Nestle used the best editions of the Greek NT produced in the 19th century to compile a text that represented the majority consensus. The work of making new editions was carried on by his son for several years, and then came under the care of Kurt Aland. The latest edition (the 27th) of Nestle-Aland’s <span class="ital">Novum Testamentum Graece</span> appeared in 1993. The same Greek text appears in another popular volume published by the United Bible Societies, called the <span class="ital">Greek New Testament</span> (fourth edition). Aland has argued that the Nestle-Aland text, 27th edition (NA<span class="sup">27</span>), comes closer to the original text of the NT than did Tischendorf or Westcott and Hort. And in several writings he intimates that NA<span class="sup">27</span> may very well be the original text. Though few, if any, scholars would agree with this, the 27th edition of the Nestle-Aland text is regarded by many as representing the latest and best in textual scholarship.</p>
<p class="h3">New Testament Textual Criticism</p>
<p class="fl">Textual critics working with ancient literature universally acknowledge the supremacy of earlier manuscripts over later ones. Textual critics not working with the NT would love to have the same kind of early witnesses that biblical scholars possess. In fact, many of them work with manuscripts written 1,000 years after the autographs were composed! We all marvel that the Dead Sea Scrolls have provided a text that is nearly 800 years closer to the originals than the Masoretic manuscripts, and yet many of the Dead Sea manuscripts are still over 600 to 800 years removed from the time of original composition. NT textual critics have a great advantage!</p>
<p>The 19th-century NT textual scholars—such as Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort—worked on the basis that the earliest witnesses are the best witnesses. Some textual scholars have continued this line of recovery using the testimony of the earlier witnesses. But many textual scholars since the time of Westcott and Hort have been less inclined to produce editions based on the theory that the earliest reading is the best. Most present-day textual critics are more inclined to endorse the maxim: the reading that is most likely original is the one that best explains the variants.</p>
<p>This maxim (or “canon” as it is sometimes called), as good as it is, produces conflicting results. For example, two scholars, using this same principle to examine the same variant unit, will not agree. One will argue that one variant was produced by a copyist attempting to emulate the author’s style; the other will claim the same variant has to be original because it accords with the author’s style. One will argue that one variant was produced by an orthodox scribe attempting to rid the text of a reading that could be used to promote heterodoxy or heresy; another will claim that the same variant has to be original because it is orthodox and accords with Christian doctrine (thus a heterodox or heretical scribe must have changed it). Furthermore, this principle allows for the possibility that the reading selected for the text can be taken from any manuscript of any date. This can lead to subjective eclecticism.</p>
<p>Modern textual scholars have attempted to temper the subjectivism by employing a method called “reasoned eclecticism.” This kind of eclecticism applies a combination of internal and external considerations, whereby the character of the variants is evaluated in light of the manuscripts’ evidence and vice versa. This is supposed to produce a balanced view and serve as a check against purely subjective tendencies.</p>
<p>The Alands favor the same kind of approach, calling it the local-genealogical method, which is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="extract">It is impossible to proceed from the assumption of a manuscript stemma, and on the basis of a full review and analysis of the relationships obtaining among the variety of interrelated branches in the manuscript tradition, to undertake a recension of the data as one would do with other Greek texts. Decisions must be made one by one, instance by instance. This method has been characterized as eclecticism, but wrongly so. After carefully establishing the variety of readings offered in a passage and the possibilities of their interpretation, it must always then be determined afresh on the basis of external and internal criteria which of these readings (and frequently they are quite numerous) is the original, from which the others may be regarded as derivative. From the perspective of our present knowledge, this “local-genealogical” method (if it must be given a name) is the only one which meets the requirements of the NT textual tradition. (Introduction to <span class="ital">Novum Testamentum Graece,</span> 26th edition)</p>
<p class="sp">The “local-genealogical” method assumes that for any given variation unit any manuscript (or manuscripts) may have preserved the original text. Applying this method produces an extremely uneven documentary presentation of the text. Anyone studying the critical apparatus of NA<span class="sup">27</span> will detect that there is not an even documentary presentation. The eclecticism is dispersed throughout the text.</p>
<p>“Reasoned eclecticism” and/or the “local-genealogical” method tend to give priority to internal evidence over external evidence. But it has to be the other way around if we are going to recover the original text. This was Westcott and Hort’s opinion. With respect to their compilation of <span class="ital">The New Testament in the Original Greek,</span> Hort wrote, “Documentary evidence has been in most cases allowed to confer the place of honour against internal evidence” (<span class="ital">The Introduction to the New Testament in the Original Greek,</span> p 17).</p>
<p>In this respect, Westcott and Hort need to be revived. Earnest Colwell was of the same mind when he wrote “Hort Redivivus: A Plea and a Program.” Colwell decried the growing tendency to rely entirely on the internal evidence of readings, without serious consideration of documentary evidence. He called upon scholars to make an attempt to reconstruct a history of the manuscript tradition. The abundance of manuscripts—several of which are very early—will aid scholars in this ongoing task.</p>

<p class="h1">BIBLE*, Q<span class="lc">uotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament</span></p>
<p class="fl">OT passages cited or alluded to in the NT writings.</p>
<p>One of the most complex problems in interpreting the Bible is in understanding how NT writers quoted the OT. Obviously nothing is so formative and authoritative for the NT writers as Scripture. However, the way that they used OT passages often seems strange to modern readers.</p>
<p>The OT has provided the words and ideas for much of the NT. Unless one has a Bible that prints OT quotations in distinctive print, this may not be easily seen, for the NT writers often weave the OT words into their own without indicating they are borrowing from the OT. There are over 400 passages of the OT that are explicitly cited in the NT. Almost half of these are introduced by a statement like “Scripture says” to draw attention to the fact that the authority and thought of the OT is being implemented. For the others, however, the OT words are woven into the fabric of the author’s own statement.</p>
<p>In addition to the over 400 passages cited explicitly, there are well over 1,000 places where there is an allusion to an OT text, event, or person. The difference between a quotation and an allusion is sometimes debated for particular texts, but usually the distinction is that in a quotation the author consciously uses the words of an OT passage, whereas with an allusion he has the texts in mind but is not consciously trying to use the words.</p>
<p>Quotations are easy to identify if there is an introductory formula such as “the Scripture says” (as in <a href="?bref=Rom.10.11">Rom 10:11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.28.16">Is 28:16</a>). Where there is no introductory formula, it is easy to overlook explicit quotations (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.13">Rom 10:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Joel.2.32">Jl 2:32</a>). The allusions are, of course, harder still to recognize, but they often provide the key to interpretation. For example, <a href="?bref=John.1.14-18">John 1:14-18</a>—with its mention of glory, grace and truth, Moses, and the fact that no one has seen God—is much more easily and profoundly understood when read in connection with <a href="?bref=Exod.33.17-34.8">Exodus 33:17–34:8</a>. In the Exodus passage the glory of God and his grace and truth are revealed to Moses. The author was showing that a much more complete revelation of God was given in Jesus than was given Moses in the account recorded in Exodus.</p>
<p>In addition, significant light is shed on many NT passages from OT passages with similar ideas and words even where the NT author may not have been consciously alluding to those texts (e.g. <a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">Mt 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.22.22">Is 22:22</a>). What was behind the author’s thinking is not certain, but in such cases the NT reflects the thinking, the culture, and language of the OT period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DistributionofOldTestamentQuotations">Distribution of Old Testament Quotations</p>
<p class="fl">The books of the NT that show the most dependence on the OT are Matthew, John, Romans, Hebrews, 1 Peter, and Revelation. Such a statement can be misleading, however, because the writers have different methods.</p>
<p>Matthew quotes or consciously reflects the wording of OT passages about 62 times, almost half of which have an introductory formula. The book of Revelation, on the other hand, never quotes the OT and never has an introductory formula but is probably more dependent on the OT than any other NT book. The book of Hebrews quotes or consciously reflects the OT about 59 times, again half of which have an introductory formula, but the Gospel of John does so only 18 times, nearly always with an introductory formula. However, the allusions to the OT are present on virtually every page of John’s Gospel, so much so that some scholars have argued that he has modeled his account on the exodus narrative, the Jewish feasts, or OT persons and images. Paul’s Letter to the Romans uses the OT 54 times (about three-fourths of which have introductory formulas), but nowhere else so frequently (e.g., 1 Cor 16 times, Gal 11 times, Phil one time, 1 Thes one time).</p>
<p>In addition to the indication that Philippians and 1 Thessalonians use the OT only once each, some other books make explicit use of the OT rarely or never. Colossians, Titus, Philemon, and the Johannine letters do not use the OT at all; 2 Timothy and Jude use the OT only once; while 2 Peter and 1 Timothy make use of it twice.</p>
<p>The important point is to realize that the OT is used most frequently in circumstances where the audience is familiar with the OT or where the OT is essential for describing the events relating to Christ and the church. The books using the OT most frequently (Mt, Jn, Rom, Heb, 1 Pt, Rv) either stem from or are addressed to a Jewish context or, as in the case of Romans and John, deal specifically with the relation of Jews and Christians. The Gospels make rather extensive use of the OT because the language of the OT is necessary to convey the identity and importance of Jesus in the purposes of God. Similarly 1 Peter uses the OT frequently because the author is trying to convey to his persecuted audience that they are the people of God and the inheritors of the promises of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DifficultiesinInterpretation">Difficulties in Interpretation</p>
<p class="fl">Often when people think of quotations of the OT in the NT they think only in terms of prophecy. Some have been guilty of counting up the OT statements that the NT applies to Christ and the church and then claiming these OT texts as predictions that prove Jesus is the Messiah. Such a procedure is filled with problems because it is too simplistic and does not do justice to either the OT or to the way the NT uses it. Of course, the early church used the OT to show that Jesus fulfilled the promises of God and did God’s work, but the use the church made of the OT was quite varied and much of it cannot be classified as predictive prophecy. Prophecy itself is too complex to be limited to predictive thinking.</p>
<p>Some of the most obvious examples of the difficulties appear in Matthew’s Gospel, although they are by no means confined there. <a href="?bref=Matt.2.15">Matthew 2:15</a>—“Out of Egypt I called my son”—is a quotation of <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1">Hosea 11:1</a>, but in Hosea these words do not refer to the Messiah. They refer to the nation of Israel. Similarly <a href="?bref=Matt.2.18">Matthew 2:18</a> quotes <a href="?bref=Jer.31.15">Jeremiah 31:15</a> (“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more,” <span class="sc">niv</span>) as fulfilled in the slaughter of the innocent babies in Bethlehem, but in Jeremiah the weeping is over the destruction of Jerusalem. <a href="?bref=John.12.40">John 12:40</a> views <a href="?bref=Isa.6.10">Isaiah 6:10</a> as fulfilled in Jesus’ ministry, but this verse deals with the call of Isaiah and is not a prediction concerning the ministry of the Messiah. The examples could be multiplied but these should be sufficient to illustrate the problem. For this reason the NT writers have often been accused of twisting the Scriptures, but this charge is as simplistic as the thought that all prophecy is predictive and in fact springs from the same error. Therefore, any attempt to understand the use of the OT in the NT will have to deal with the variety of ways in which the OT is used and with the methods employed by the NT writers.</p>
<p>There are other difficulties that are encountered as well. Sometimes the NT writer will indicate that some fact related to Christ is a fulfillment of the OT but the explicit text that he had in mind cannot be identified. For example, <a href="?bref=John.7.38">John 7:38</a> introduces the words “Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water” with the statement “as Scripture has said.” No OT text reads this way. Possibly the allusion is to the rock that provided water in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1">Ex 17:1</a>), or to the waters that flowed from the new temple (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.8">Zec 14:8</a>) or, more generally, it may be a reference to <a href="?bref=Isa.58.11">Isaiah 58:11</a>. Similarly, the difficulty in determining the OT text behind the prophecy that Christ will be called a Nazarene (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.23">Mt 2:23</a>) is notorious. Probably the reference is to <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Isaiah 11:1</a> and the Hebrew word there translated as “branch,” but the connection is not easily made and is not certain. A third example of this kind of difficulty is in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.34">1 Corinthians 14:34</a>, where Paul indicates that women should be in submission just as the Law says, but there is no OT text expressing this idea. His statement in probably to be understood as a summary rather than a quotation or allusion. Similarly on a few occasions an OT text is seemingly attributed to the wrong OT book. In <a href="?bref=Mark.1.2-3">Mark 1:2-3</a> an OT quotation is attributed to Isaiah but the quotation is really a conflation (or mixing) of <a href="?bref=Exod.23.20">Exodus 23:20</a>, <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</a>, and <a href="?bref=Isa.40.3">Isaiah 40:3</a>. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.9-10">Matthew 27:9-10</a> quotes a passage that is said to be from Jeremiah, when really it is dependent on <a href="?bref=Zech.11.13">Zechariah 11:13</a> and might best be described as a summary of <a href="?bref=Zech.11.12-13">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, with certain words included from <a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-9">Jeremiah 32:6-9</a>. These two examples do not create a major problem, however, for the determination of the origin of the words may be due to their use in collections of quotations from various prophets, in which case the more prominent prophets would be used to designate origin.</p>
<p>The wording of the quotations of the OT text does not always conform to the modern form of the OT. Just as today there are numerous translations of the Bible, when the NT was being written there were various forms of the OT text. With regard to the Hebrew text (for the OT was written mostly in Hebrew), there were different traditions. Such differences in the Hebrew traditions would have been relatively small. Because of the increasing importance of Aramaic after the Babylonian captivity and of Greek after the conquests of Alexander the Great, the OT was also known and used in both these languages when the NT was being written. In fact, the Jews found it necessary in their synagogue services after reading the Hebrew OT to paraphrase the reading in Aramaic so that all could understand. These paraphrases were later written down and are known as Targums. The Greek translation of the OT that stems from the third century <span class="era">BC</span> is known as the Septuagint, but there were also other Greek translations in use. This being the case, the wording of a NT quotation is not identical in every detail to the text of the Hebrew OT.</p>
<p>Added to the fact that there were various forms of the text known in first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Palestine is the complicating factor that NT writers often did not intend to quote the OT exactly. The use of formal quotation marks is a modern device, and ancient writers were not so taken by technical precision. They were more concerned with the intention of a text and consequently might copy or quote it verbatim, quote it from memory, use or adapt part of a verse, or even change certain words as they borrowed the verse to express their points. (The NT writers often use the OT words describing God’s actions in the past to explain what he has done in their time.) The importance of any differences between the NT quotation and the OT depends on the use to which the quotation is put and the degree to which the use is dependent on textual differences.</p>
<p>Some examples should illustrate the nature of these difficulties. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.8">Ephesians 4:8</a> quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.68.18">Psalm 68:18</a>. Whereas the Hebrew and Septuagint read, “You ascended to the heights, you lead captivity captive, you received gifts among mankind,” Ephesians records the verse as “After he ascended into the heights, <span class="ital">he</span> led captivity captive; he <span class="ital">gave</span> gifts to men.” Paul is stressing that Christ has given grace to people for ministry. He has either adapted the wording of the OT to make his point or he quoted a variant reading, <span class="ital">“he gave</span> gifts.” Some versions do have this reading. In fact, the Targum understands this verse as Moses giving the words of the law to the children of men, and Paul may well be adapting this understanding to the new revelation that has come in Christ.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">Matthew 1:23</a> quotes <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a>, but there are distinct differences between the Hebrew text and the wording in Matthew. The Hebrew reads, “Behold the young woman will become pregnant and will bear a son and you will call his name Immanuel,” whereas Matthew’s text records “Behold, the <span class="ital">virgin</span> will become pregnant and will bear a son, and <span class="ital">they</span> will call his name Immanuel.” The Septuagint does have the specific word “virgin,” like Matthew, but is not the source of Matthew’s quotation since other differences exist. Some have argued that the change from “you will call” to “they will call” was made by Matthew when he applied the words to Jesus. However, there are several traditions known for this part of the quotation and partial support for the reading in Matthew is provided by the text of Isaiah found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rom.11.26-27">Romans 11:26-27</a> is a conflation of <a href="?bref=Isa.59.20-21">Isaiah 59:20-21</a> and part of <a href="?bref=Isa.27.9">Isaiah 27:9</a>, but there are important differences. One of these is that the OT has “the redeemer will come to Zion,” whereas Romans has “the deliverer will come <span class="ital">from</span> Zion.” The change to “from Zion” could indicate that Paul had a different textual tradition, could be the result of an intentional change by Paul, or more probably, could reflect the wording of <a href="?bref=Ps.14.7">Psalm 14:7</a>.</p>
<p>An awareness of the difficulties involved in the quotations of the OT by the NT writers will prohibit a simplistic approach and will prevent hasty conclusions. Care to ask not only which text was used but also which form of the text was used and how is obviously essential in any serious study. In addition it is necessary to allow for the possibility that the NT writers knew forms of a text that are now lost.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMethodsoftheNewTestamentWriters">The Methods of the New Testament Writers</p>
<p class="fl">The methods used by the NT writers were not unique to them. Many of these methods were also employed in first-century Judaism. In fact, both the technique used in quoting and the understanding of the OT text itself in many cases are paralleled in Judaism. For example, from the standpoint of technique used in quoting, the same kinds of formula introductions are used in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the rabbinic writings, and elsewhere. The rabbinic technique of “pearl stringing,” that is, of applying verses from various parts of the OT (the Law, the Prophets, the Writings) to a subject, can be seen especially in Paul’s writings (note <a href="?bref=Rom.9.12-19">Rom 9:12-19</a> or <a href="?bref=Rom.11.8-10">11:8-10</a>). Somewhat related is the practice of using quotations that all contain a key word or key words (note <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.6-8">1 Pt 2:6-8</a>, which draws together quotations using the word “stone,” or <a href="?bref=Rom.15.9-12">Rom 15:9-12</a>, which joins OT verses referring to the “nations”).</p>
<p>The methods used in the NT to interpret an OT text are also displayed in Judaism. Some passages interpret the OT “literally,” such as Jesus’ replies during temptation (see the quotations of <a href="?bref=Deut.8.3">Dt 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.16">6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.13">6:13</a>; in <a href="?bref=Matt.4.3-10">Mt 4:3-10</a>), his teachings on marriage based on <a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Genesis 2:24</a> (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.5">Mt 19:5</a>), or Paul’s use of <a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Habakkuk 2:4</a> (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>) or <a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Genesis 15:6</a> (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.3-9">Rom 4:3-9</a>). Many such examples could be given. With regard to prophecy, some of these statements are fulfilled in a “literal” or “direct” way in keeping with the intention of the OT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Mi 5:2</a>, Bethlehem as the birthplace of the Messiah; <a href="?bref=Matt.2.4-6">Mt 2:4-6</a>). <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, the promise of the new covenant, is viewed as directly fulfilled in Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.7-13">Heb 8:7-13</a>). The prophecy of <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Joel 2:28-32</a> concerning the pouring out of the Spirit of the Lord is directly fulfilled in the Pentecost event (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.17-21">Acts 2:17-21</a>), but the changing of the sun to darkness and the moon to blood are certainly not understood literally in connection with this event.</p>
<p>A different method of interpretation is based on the concept of <span class="ital">corporate solidarity.</span> This technical expression is an attempt to convey the idea that the individuals among God’s people are not merely individuals; they are part of a larger whole. Consequently, what is said about the individual can apply to the whole and vice versa. This is the reason the Servant of the Lord in Isaiah is seen both as the nation (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.1">44:1</a>) and as an individual (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>). Also the king is sometimes viewed as representative of the nation. The easiest places to see the concept of corporate solidarity are in the effect of the sin of Achan on all the people (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Jos 7</a>) or the sin of David in numbering the people (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.3-8">1 Chr 21:3-8</a>).</p>
<p><span class="ital">Correspondence in history</span> is not so much a method of interpretation as it is a way of thinking about God. It assumes that the things that happen to God’s people are the things that have happened to previous generations and that God is faithful and operates in the present as he has in the past. Consequently, the trials and deliverance of God’s people are often expressed with words borrowed from the previous accounts of God’s people. Isaiah describes the anticipated deliverance in terms of a second exodus (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.15-16">11:15-16</a>). Ezekiel describes the king set up over the people in terms of a second David (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.25">Ez 37:25</a>). In the NT, <a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-21">Revelation 22</a> describes the new heavens and the new earth in terms of the Garden of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-3.24">Gn 2–3</a>). Sometimes this technique is described as “typology,” but this term has been used for so many questionable interpretations that it is misleading. The most important thing about this concept is that it is a view of God and his working among his people.</p>
<p>With these two concepts, the way that the OT is quoted in the NT can be understood. The conviction that Jesus was the promised deliverer and that the last days had dawned in his ministry are evident everywhere. The quotation of <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1">Hosea 11:1</a> can be used in <a href="?bref=Matt.2.15">Matthew 2:15</a> because of corporate solidarity and correspondence in history. What was said of the nation is true of the one who is its representative, and there is correspondence in their respective histories. <a href="?bref=Jer.31.15">Jeremiah 31:15</a> can be used in <a href="?bref=Matt.2.18">Matthew 2:18</a> because of correspondence in history and especially because Jeremiah looked forward to God’s intention for Israel and prophesied a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.17,31-34">31:17, 31-34</a>). Matthew saw not only the correspondence in history but believed that in Jesus this promised salvation had been granted. <a href="?bref=John.12.40">John 12:40</a> can quote <a href="?bref=Isa.6.10">Isaiah 6:10</a> of Jesus’ ministry, not because he twists the meaning of the OT text, but because he saw that what had happened with God’s messenger before happened again and even <span class="ital">ultimately</span> in Jesus’ ministry. The instances of such correspondences in history are numerous.</p>
<p>There are other texts where there seems to be an <span class="ital">actualization</span> of the OT text. Some quotations seem to be “lived out” in the ministry of Jesus. Because of their conviction about Jesus and his kingdom, the NT writers often saw certain OT texts as appropriated and made alive by Jesus. <a href="?bref=Ps.118.22">Psalm 118:22</a> was not intended as a prophecy of the Messiah, but Jesus saw it as descriptive of his ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.42">Mt 21:42</a>), and the early church saw this verse as actualized in his death and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.11">Acts 4:11</a>). <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> is another text that the NT views as actualized in Jesus’ ministry (see <a href="?bref=Acts.8.32-35">Acts 8:32-35</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.22-25">1 Pt 2:22-25</a>). Some Christians would view <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a> as a prophecy of the crucifixion of Jesus, but it seems instead to be the lament of a righteous OT sufferer. Through correspondence in history, and because Christians saw so much of the psalmist’s plight actualized in Jesus’ crucifixion, the psalm became the easiest way to describe what once again had happened to God’s righteous sufferer. The words of <a href="?bref=Isa.40.3">Isaiah 40:3</a> describe the ministry of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.3">Mt 3:3</a>). Jews had come to see this verse as a prophecy of God’s end-time salvation, and the early church saw John the Baptist fulfilling this forerunner’s task. Luke made this identification (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.4-6">Lk 3:4-6</a>), but he applied the same role to Jesus’ disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.52">9:52</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.1">10:1</a>). This seems to be a further example of actualization and correspondence in history. In other places the church has applied to Christians ideas that were previously understood of Christ (e.g., the stone in <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4-5">1 Pt 2:4-5</a>; the ministry of the Suffering Servant in <a href="?bref=Acts.13.46-47">Acts 13:46-47</a>).</p>
<p>The most convenient term to describe the way the OT is “fulfilled” in Christ is to say that the OT finds its climax in Jesus. Even where actual quotations are not involved, the OT ideas such as prophet, priest, or king are climaxed in him as the ideal and embodiment of all the OT models. He could tell religious authorities that “one greater than Solomon is here” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.42">Mt 12:42</a>) or “one greater than the temple is here” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.6">Mt 12:6</a>). Those passages involving correspondence in history or actualization also lead to the conviction that he is the climax of the OT Scriptures.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePurposesoftheUseoftheOldTestament">The Purposes of the Use of the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The variety of methods of interpretation and application of the OT parallels the fact that the OT was used for a variety of purposes. People tend to think only in terms of the use of the OT to show that Jesus was the Messiah, but there are a number of other uses with a variety of goals. Many OT texts are used to show Jesus is the Messiah, the fulfillment of the OT promises (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-21">Lk 4:16-21</a>). Without lessening the fulfillment emphasis, however, other verses are applied to Jesus for other purposes: to evangelize (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.32-25">Acts 8:32-25</a>); to demonstrate or convince (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.33-35">Acts 13:33-35</a>); to rebuke (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.6-7">Mk 7:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.7-10">Rom 11:7-10</a>); and to describe (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.12-15">Rv 1:12-15</a>). On the other hand, many quotations of the OT in the NT are not directly related to the Messiah. OT passages are adapted to provide a word from God on some aspect of life or ethics. For example, Jesus used <a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Genesis 2:24</a> to substantiate his teaching on divorce as he attempted to deal with the issues raised by the civil regulation of divorce (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.1">Dt 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.1-12">Mt 19:1-12</a>). The stress on the OT commandments shows their importance for Christians (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.16-22">Mt 19:16-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>). Often OT statements deal with specific problems. The problem of pride at Corinth is solved by the quotation of <a href="?bref=Jer.9.24">Jeremiah 9:24</a> (“Let the one boasting, boast in the Lord,” <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.31">1 Cor 1:31</a>). <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.10-12">First Peter 3:10-12</a> incorporates <a href="?bref=Ps.34.12-16">Psalm 34:12-16</a> as ethical instructions, and <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.14-15">3:14-15</a> borrows from <a href="?bref=Isa.8.12-13">Isaiah 8:12-13</a> to address the fear of suffering. The spiritual armor in <a href="?bref=Eph.6.14-17">Ephesians 6:14-17</a> is derived largely from OT passages. Such examples are so numerous that there can be no doubt that the OT is used to describe Christian existence. In fact, nearly every subject discussed in the NT is presented somewhere via OT terms and quotations. Frequently OT passages are used to describe the church as God’s end-time community. <a href="?bref=Hos.2.23">Hosea 2:23</a> is used to show that those who formerly were not God’s people now are (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.25-26">Rom 9:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.10">1 Pt 2:10</a>). Several OT texts contribute to the description of the church in <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Peter 2:9</a>. OT texts that speak of the word of God describe the apostles’ preaching (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.8">Rom 10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.24-25">1 Pt 1:24-25</a>). OT quotations describe the sinful condition of humanity (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.10-20">Rom 3:10-20</a>). Salvation is explained through OT concepts and symbols and is based on OT statements (<a href="?bref=John.6.31-33">Jn 6:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-13">Gal 3:6-13</a>). The words of Daniel describe the Second Coming (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">7:13-14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Mt 24:30</a>). Even the worship of early Christians was expressed through use of the OT (see <a href="?bref=Acts.4.24">Acts 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.34-35">Rom 11:34-35</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BIBLE*, V<span class="lc">ersions of the (Ancient</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">To get a picture of how the Bible has come to different peoples in the world, spread out a map of the eastern hemisphere and imagine Palestine as the center of a pool. Think of God’s revelation of himself through the prophets, the Christ, and the apostles as a pebble dropped into the center of that body of water. In your mind’s eye watch the advance of the concentric circles out across that world pool from Palestine and call out the languages covered by the fast-spreading ripple: to the south, Coptic, Arabic, Ethiopic; to the west, Greek, Latin, Gothic, English; to the north, Armenian, Georgian, Slavonic; and eastward toward the rising sun, Syriac. The farther the Bible moved from its Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek center in Palestine, the later the date of its translation into yet another language.</p>
<p>That pebble of God’s revelation, the Bible, was produced in the Middle East predominantly in two of Palestine’s languages. The OT was written in Hebrew with the exception of portions of the books of Daniel and Ezra, which may have been written in Aramaic, the language of the Captivity. Probably the entire NT was written in common Greek (koine), which was the dominant language of the eastern half of Caesar’s domain and understood almost everywhere else in the Roman Empire. Therefore every person who did not speak Hebrew or Greek was apt to remain untouched by God’s written revelation until someone translated the Bible into his language.</p>
<p>The process of Bible translation began even before the birth of Christ, with translations of the OT being made into Greek and Aramaic. Many of the dispersed Jews who lived prior to the coming of Christ did not know Hebrew and therefore required a translation in Greek or Aramaic. The most popular Greek translation of the OT was the Septuagint. It was used by many Jews, and then by many Christians. In fact, the Septuagint was the “Bible” for all the first-generation Christians, including those who wrote various books of the NT.</p>
<p>The early Christian missionaries carrying a text of the Septuagint (or Hebrew Bible) and the Greek NT (or portions thereof), which they themselves could read, moved ever outward from those early churches at Jerusalem and Antioch about which we read in the book of Acts. They moved out among peoples whose language they learned to speak. Such missionaries orally translated or paraphrased Bible passages necessary for instruction, preaching, and liturgy. Converts were made. New churches sprang up. Feeling an urgent need for the Bible to be put in the language of the new believers, missionaries would soon set about translating the whole Bible into their language. The impulse behind our modern Wycliffe Bible Translators has always been at the heart of missions, and in that way the major Bible versions were born.</p>
<p>Bible translation was thus spontaneous, invariably informal and oral at first, and sharply evangelistic in its motivation. The early church enthusiastically encouraged and undertook translating efforts. Even as late as the birth of the Slavonic version in the mid-ninth century, popes Adrian II (867–72) and John VIII (872–82) endorsed the project. But an amazing change came in the Western church in regard to Bible translation. Latin took over as the dominant language—such that no one read Greek anymore. Then, as learning became the province of only the wealthy nobility and prelates (churchmen of high rank, such as bishops), as the splendors of classical civilization were lost in the ferment of feudalism in Europe, and as the Roman Catholic hierarchy—headed by the pope—claimed a firm grip on Western Christendom, the Bible was removed from the hands of the laity. Therefore, as long as the priests could read the Latin texts and speak the liturgy in Latin (at least at a minimal level), there was no longer significant motivation for translations into the vernacular.</p>
<p>Latin came to be considered almost a sacred language, and translations of the Bible into the vernacular were viewed with suspicion. Pope Gregory VII (1073–85) gave voice to such suspicions when, only 200 years after Adrian II and John VIII had called for a Slavonic translation, Gregory attempted to stop its circulation. He wrote to King Vratislaus of Bohemia in 1079:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">For it is clear to those who reflect upon it that not without reason has it pleased Almighty God that holy scripture should be a secret in certain places lest, if it were plainly apparent to all men, perchance it would be little esteemed and be subject to disrespect; or it might be falsely understood by those of mediocre learning, and lead to error.</p>
<p class="sp">Meanwhile in Palestine and northern Africa, the inexorable march of Islam changed the religious texture of the Mediterranean’s eastern and southern littorals. Within 100 years of Muhammad’s death (570–632), over 900 churches had been destroyed and the Koran became the “bible” in the great circle from the walls of embattled Byzantium round to the west—to the Spanish end of Europe.</p>
<p>Cramped by official opposition in the West and hindered by Islamic conquest in the Middle East, Bible translations slowed to a trickle for half a millennium. Translation efforts did not regain vitality until the Protestant Reformation of the early 16th century, at which time missionaries took advantage of movable-type printing (invented by Johannes Gutenberg) to produce multiple translations of the Bible. Erasmus expressed the desire of all Bible translators in the preface of his freshly published Greek NT (1516):</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">I wish that even the weakest woman should read the Gospel—should read the Epistles of Paul. And I wish these were translated into all languages, so that they might be read and understood, not only by Scots and Irishmen, but also by Turks and Saracens. To make them understood is surely the first step. It may be that they might be ridiculed by many, but some would take them to heart. I long that the husbandman should sing portions of them to himself as he follows the plough, that the weaver should hum them to the tune of his shuttle, that the traveller should beguile with their stories the tedium of his journey.</p>
<p class="sp">But what materials were used by the early translators and copyists who worked so painstakingly over their Bible translations? At the time of Christ and through the first two centuries of the church, the most popular writing materials were ink on papyrus. Until the first century, “books” were actually scrolls with long sheets of papyrus paper glued end to end and rolled up on paired spindles. Then, later in the first century, another form of a book was created—called the codex (the precursor to the modern form of a book with folded sheets and stitched spine). Christians were among the first to use this form for books. In <span class="era">AD</span> 332 the first Christian emperor, Constantine I, ordered 50 Bibles for the churches of his new capital city, Constantinople. He ordered those from Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, and specified that they were not to be scrolls, but codexes (or codices). They were also to be not of papyrus but of vellum, carefully prepared sheep or antelope skins, for it was right about this time, in the late third and early fourth centuries, that codexes and vellum almost universally replaced scrolls and papyrus.</p>
<p>For centuries scribes laboriously copied Bibles all in capital letters; the earliest surviving manuscripts of Bible versions are of that type, called “uncials.” In the ninth and tenth centuries it became the fashion to write in lowercase letters; surviving manuscripts of that type are called “minuscules” or “cursives.” (There were, however, occasional cursive manuscripts as far back as the second century before Christ.) Minuscules dominate the surviving biblical manuscripts from the 10th through the 16th centuries.</p>
<p>It was in 1454 that Johannes Gutenberg made manuscript writing obsolete by using movable type for the first time. His first printed book appeared in 1456, a splendid Latin Bible.</p>
<p>Our printed Bibles today contain chapter and verse divisions that were a relatively late development. Chapter divisions began in the Latin Vulgate and are variously credited to Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1089), to Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1228), or to Hugo de Sancto Caro of the 13th century. Verse numbers first appeared in the fourth edition of the Greek NT issued at Geneva in 1551 by Robert Estienne (Stephanus) and in the Athias Hebrew OT of 1559–61.</p>

<p class="h2" id="EarliestVersionsoftheOldTestament">Earliest Versions of the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The first version to be considered, the Samaritan Pentateuch, cannot rightly be termed a translation because it is a Hebrew version of the first five books of the OT, the books of the Law. These books comprise the total canon of Scripture for the Samaritan community, which still survives and is now centered in modern Nablus in Palestine.</p>
<p>The Samaritan Pentateuch reflects a textual tradition different from that of traditional Judaism, whose Hebrew text goes back through the centuries to the work of the Masoretes. The Masoretes were a body of scribes charged with OT text preservation, beginning about <span class="era">AD</span> 600 and extending to the first half of the 10th century. It was they who devised a pointing system to indicate the vowels missing from consonantal Hebrew. It is this so-called Masoretic Text that forms (as the “received text”) the basis for the King James Version OT.</p>
<p>The Samaritan Pentateuch, on the other hand, goes back to the fourth century before Christ. According to textual scholars, the Samaritan Pentateuch differs from the “received” or Masoretic Hebrew text in about 6,000 places. About 1,000 of those differences need to be taken seriously. Where the text of the Samaritan Pentateuch agrees with the Septuagint or one of the other ancient versions against the Hebrew of the Masoretic Text, its witness must be regarded as important. The two oldest manuscripts of the Samaritan Pentateuch outside of Nablus are both codexes. One copy in the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England, bears a date corresponding to <span class="era">AD</span> 1211 or 1212; the other is somewhat older than 1149 and is presently in the University Library at Cambridge, England. Two minor translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch also exist; one is the Aramaic Samaritan Targum from early Christian times, the other an Arabic translation from about the 11th century.</p>
<p>The second OT version, the Septuagint, is an actual translation from the Hebrew into the Greek. It is the first translation of the OT known. It was the Bible used by the apostles, the version from which most OT quotations in the NT come, and the Bible of the early church as far as the OT was concerned.</p>
<p>The story of its production, from which it draws its name, is told in “The Letter of Aristeas” (written around 150–100 <span class="era">BC</span>). Aristeas purportedly was an official of Egypt’s Ptolemy Philadelphus (285–247 <span class="era">BC</span>). Ptolemy was attempting to gather all of the world’s books into his great Alexandrian library. The OT was not on hand in translation, the letter says, so Ptolemy sent to the high priest in Jerusalem for texts and scholars to translate. Texts and six elders of each tribe were sent. After being royally entertained by Ptolemy, these 72 elders were cloistered and in exactly 72 days produced the full Greek translation of the OT, called Septuagint (“Seventy”) and usually abbreviated LXX in Roman numerals.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is probably more prosaic. The Septuagint is a translation done for Hellenized Jews of the Diaspora who, no longer understanding Hebrew, wished to hear and teach the Bible in their language. Scholars argue over the date of the translation, placing portions as early as 250 <span class="era">BC</span> and other parts as late as 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. Most concur that it was translated in segments by many translators over a couple of centuries and then was gathered together into one library of scrolls or one codex. The Septuagint follows a different order from English Bibles and usually includes up to 15 apocryphal or noncanonical books.</p>
<p>The third OT version is the Aramaic. Biblical Aramaic, called Chaldee up through the 19th century, was the language of the conquerors that gradually became the household speech of the conquered. When the Jewish exiles began to return to Palestine from Babylon in 536 <span class="era">BC</span>, they brought Aramaic with them. Many scholars believe that when Ezra and the Levites “explained the meaning of the passage” as the Book of the Law was read (<a href="?bref=Neh.8.8">Neh 8:8</a>), they were paraphrasing the Hebrew into Aramaic so all could understand. Aramaic remained as the living language in Palestine up to the Bar-Kochba revolt against the Romans (<span class="era">AD</span> 132–135), and Hebrew became increasingly a religious language for synagogue and temple specialists. As priests and scribes read the Law and Prophets, the custom of following the reading with an Aramaic translation spread. Such translations were called targums.</p>
<p>Rabbinical leadership was very loathe to formalize and write down the targums, but inevitably they were collected and standardized. The earliest standardized Targum was that of the Law done by someone known as Onkelos, sometime in the second or third century <span class="era">AD</span>. Targums on the historical and prophetic books were crystallized in the third and fourth centuries <span class="era">AD</span>, with the most important one called the Targum Jonathan ben Uzziel. Evidently no Targums of the Wisdom Literature (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Job, some Psalms) were completed earlier than the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>. Finally rabbinical Aramaic Targums included all of the OT except Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. Meanwhile, the Islamic conquest of the entire Middle East gave people a new common language, Arabic. Rabbis were apt to find themselves beginning to produce informal oral Arabic targums, and Aramaic faded from the synagogue into religious history.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CompleteBibleVersionsofChristendom">Complete Bible Versions of Christendom</p>
<p class="fl">As the church gathered the NT together and added it to the Old, there began the process of Bible translation that has marked the growth of Christianity from Jerusalem through Judea to Samaria and on toward the “uttermost part” of the world.</p>
<p class="h3" id="LatinVersions">Latin Versions</p>
<p class="fl">Like the Aramaic Targums of Jewish worshipers, the Old Latin Bible was an informal growth. In the early days of the Roman Empire and of the church, Greek was the language of Christians. Even the first bishops of Rome wrote and preached in Greek. As empire and church aged, Latin began to win out, especially in the West. It was natural that priests and bishops began informally to translate the Greek NT and Septuagint into Latin. The initial Latin version is called the Old Latin Bible. No complete manuscript of it survives. Much of the OT and most of the New, however, can be reconstructed from quotations of the early church fathers. Scholars believe that an Old Latin Bible was in circulation in Carthage in North Africa as early as <span class="era">AD</span> 250. From the surviving fragments and quotations there seem to have been two types of Old Latin text, the African and the European. The European existed in an Italian revision also. In textual study the major importance of the Old Latin is in comparative study of the Septuagint because the Old Latin was translated from the Septuagint before Origen made his <span class="ital">Hexapla.</span></p>
<p>From every quarter, church leaders voiced the need for an authoritative and uniform Latin translation of the whole Bible. Pope Damascus I (366–384) had an exceptionally able and scholarly secretary named Jerome (c. 340–420), whom he commissioned to make a new Latin translation of the Gospels in 382. Jerome completed the Gospels in 383; Acts and the rest of the NT evidently followed. The Gospels were a thorough and painstaking retranslation based on the European Old Latin and an Alexandrian Greek text. The rest of the NT, however, was a much more limited effort with the Old Latin remaining dominant unless the Greek text demanded change. In all probability it was not the work of Jerome himself.</p>
<p>Jerome left Rome in 385, and in 389 he and a follower, Paula, founded two religious houses near Bethlehem. At one of these Jerome presided. There he turned his attention to the OT. He realized that what was needed was a retranslation from the Hebrew, not a revision of the Greek Septuagint. He used Jewish rabbis as consultants and completed work through the books of Kings by 390. Jerome reworked an earlier translation he had made of the Psalms and completed the prophets, Job, Ezra, and Chronicles in 390–96. After a two-year illness, he picked up the task again and translated Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. In 404 he worked through Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and Esther. Soon afterward he did the apocryphal parts of Daniel and Esther and translated the apocryphal Tobit and Judith from Aramaic. He did not touch the Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, or the Maccabean literature, so those apocryphal books passed into the official Latin Bible in their Old Latin form. Jerome’s work was not uniform in quality, nor did he gather it all together into a unified Bible.</p>
<p>Jerome’s work was fiercely criticized, and though he defended it with facile pen and ready temper, he did not live long enough to see it win universal respect. Yet his life’s work passed into what is now known as the Vulgate Bible (<span class="ital">vulga</span> meaning the “vulgar,” or everyday, speech of the people). Evidence seems to indicate that the compiling of all of Jerome’s work into one book may have been done by Cassiodorus (died c. 580) in his monastery at Scylacium in Italy. The earliest extant manuscript containing Jerome’s Bible in its entirety is the Codex Amiatinus written in the monastery at Jarrow, Northumbria, England, around 715. The old texts of the Vulgate are second only to the Septuagint in importance for Hebrew textual study, for Jerome was working from Hebrew texts that antedated the work of the Jewish Masoretes.</p>
<p>Only very gradually did the Vulgate supplant the Old Latin Bible. It took 1,000 years before the Vulgate was made the official Roman Catholic Bible (by the Council of Trent in 1546). That council also authorized an official, corrected edition, which was first issued by Pope Sixtus V (1585–90) in 1590 in three volumes. It proved unpopular, however, and Pope Clement VIII (1592–1605) recalled it and issued a new official Vulgate in 1592, which has been the standard edition to recent times.</p>
<p class="h3" id="CopticVersions">Coptic Versions</p>
<p class="fl">Coptic was the last stage of the Egyptian language and thus the language of the native populations who lived along the length of the Nile River. It was never supplanted by the Greek of Alexander and his generals or even threatened by the Latin of the Caesars. Its script was composed of 25 Greek uncials and 7 cursives taken over from Egyptian writing to express sounds not in the Greek. Through the centuries it developed at least five main dialects: Akhmimic, sub-Akhmimic (Memphitic), Sahidic, Fayumic, and Bohairic. Fragments of biblical material have been found in the Akhmimic, sub-Akhmimic, and Fayumic. No one knows whether or not the whole Bible ever existed in these dialects. They gradually faded out of use until—by the 11th century—only Bohairic, the language of the Delta, and Sahidic, the language of Upper Egypt, remained. They too, however, had become largely forgotten or strictly religious languages used only in Coptic churches by the 17th century because of the long dominance of Arabic that began with the Islamic conquest of Egypt in 641.</p>
<p>The earliest translation was in Sahidic in Upper Egypt, where Greek was less universally understood. The Sahidic Old and New Testaments were probably completed by around <span class="era">AD</span> 200. Greek was so much more dominant in the Delta that the translation of the Scriptures into Bohairic probably was not completed until somewhat later. Since Bohairic was the language of the Delta, however, it was also the language of the Coptic Patriarch in Alexandria. When the patriarchate moved from Alexandria to Cairo in the 11th century, the Bohairic texts went along. Bohairic gradually became the major religious language of the Coptic church. The Copts had separated from the Roman Empire, or the so-called Great Catholic Church, over doctrinal issues after the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and had then been isolated from Western Christendom by centuries of Islamic rule.</p>
<p class="h3" id="GothicVersion">Gothic Version</p>
<p class="fl">The Gothic language was an East Germanic language. The earliest literary remains known in any Germanic tongue are the fragments of the Bible done by Ulfilas (or Wulfila), who made the translation to bring the gospel to his own people. Ulfilas (c. 311–83), one of the early church’s most famous missionaries, was born in Dacia of Roman Christian parents who had been captured by the raiding Goths. He traveled to Constantinople from his tribal area, and he may have been converted there. While in the East, he was ordained as bishop around 340 by the Arian bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia. Ulfilas himself was of the Arian persuasion (believing that Christ was Savior and Lord by divine appointment and by his obedience, but that he was less than God or was subservient to God).</p>
<p>Ulfilas returned to preach to his people, evidently invented an alphabet for them in order to reduce their language to writing, and then translated the Scriptures into that written language. Records from that time say Ulfilas translated all of the Bible except the books of the Kings, which he excluded because he felt they would have an adverse influence on the Goths, who were already too warlike. Scattered fragments of his OT translation survive and only about half of the Gospels are preserved in the Codex Argenteus, a manuscript of Bohemian origin of the fifth or sixth century now at Uppsala in Sweden.</p>
<p class="h3" id="SyriacVersions">Syriac Versions</p>
<p class="fl">One of the family of Semitic languages, Syriac was the predominant tongue of the region of Edessa and western Mesopotamia. The version known today as the <span class="ital">Peshitta</span> Bible (still the official Bible of Christians of the old Assyrian area churches and often lacking 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation) developed through several stages. One of the most famous and widely used translations in the early church was the Syriac <span class="ital">Diatessaron,</span> done by Tatian, a man who had been a disciple of Justin Martyr at Rome. The <span class="ital">Diatessaron,</span> Tatian’s harmony of the Gospels translated from the Greek about <span class="era">AD</span> 170, was very popular among Syriac-speaking Christians. Syrian bishops had an uphill battle getting Christians to use “The Gospel of the Separated Ones” (meaning the manuscript in which the four Gospels were separated from one another rather than blended) in their churches.</p>
<p>Other portions of the Bible were also put into Old Syriac. Quotations from the church fathers indicate that some type of second-century Old Syriac text existed along with the <span class="ital">Diatessaron.</span> In fact, the OT may have been a Jewish translation into Syriac that Syrian Christians made their own, just as Greek Christians had done with the Septuagint. It then underwent a more or less official revision around the end of the fourth century, emerging as the <span class="ital">Peshitta</span> (meaning “basic” or “simple”) text. Tradition indicates that at least the NT portion of that version may have been made at the instigation of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa (411–35).</p>
<p>In the meantime, Syrian-speaking Christians underwent a schism in <span class="era">AD</span> 431 when the Monophysite (or Jacobite) groups split off from the Nestorian believers (the battle was over the view of the Person of Christ). For a time both groups used the <span class="ital">Peshitta</span>, but the Jacobite groups began to desire a new translation. Working from the Septuagint and Greek NT manuscripts, Bishop Philoxemus (or Mar Zenaia) of Mabbug (485–519) on the Euphrates River did a new Syriac translation that was completed in 508. The importance of that version was that it included for the first time 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, which then made their way into the standard <span class="ital">Peshitta</span> text.</p>
<p>Though the <span class="ital">Peshitta</span> has been in continuous use since the fifth century, and reached as far as India and China in its distribution, it has not been nearly so important a source for textual scholars as the Septuagint. That is because it had undergone constant revision through comparison with various Greek texts at Constantinople, Hebrew texts, Origen’s <span class="ital">Hexapla</span> Septuagint, and the Aramaic Targums; therefore, its witness to an early textual source is very difficult to trace. One of the most valuable <span class="ital">Peshitta</span> manuscripts extant is the Codex Ambrosianus of Milan, which dates from the sixth century and contains the entire OT.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ArmenianVersion">Armenian Version</p>
<p class="fl">Syrian Christians carried their faith to their Armenian neighbors in eastern Asia Minor. As early as the third century, with the conversion of Tiridates III (reigned 259–314), Armenia became a Christian kingdom—the first such in history. Sometime during the fifth century, an Armenian alphabet was created so that the Bible could be translated into the language of these new believers. The Armenian translation is considered one of the most beautiful and accurate of the ancient versions of the Greek, even though textual evidence indicates it may have been done from the Syriac first and then modified to the Greek. (The Armenian language is allied closely with the Greek in grammar, syntax, and idiom.) An old tradition says that the NT was the work of Mesrop (a bishop in Armenia, 390–439) who is credited with inventing both the Armenian and Georgian alphabets. The book of Revelation was not accepted as part of the canon in Armenian churches until as late as the 12th century.</p>

<p class="h3" id="GeorgianVersion">Georgian Version</p>
<p class="fl">The same tradition that credits Mesrop with translating the Bible into Armenian also credits an Armenian slave woman with being the missionary through whom Georgian-speaking people became Christian. The earliest manuscripts for the Georgian Scriptures go back only to the eighth century, but behind them is a Georgian translation with Syriac and Armenian traces. Evidently the Gospels first came in the form of the <span class="ital">Diatessaron;</span> therefore, Georgian fragments are important in the study of that text. There is a whole manuscript copy of the Georgian Bible in two volumes in the Iberian Monastery on Mt Athos.</p>
<p>Along with the Armenians and Georgians, a third Caucasian people, the Albanians, apparently received an alphabet from Mesrop for the purpose of scriptural translation. Their church, however, was wiped out by the Islamic wars and no remains of that version have ever been found.</p>
<p class="h3" id="EthiopicVersion">Ethiopic Version</p>
<p class="fl">By the middle of the fifth century, a Christian king ruled in Ethiopia (Abyssinia), and until the Islamic conquests close ties were maintained with Egyptian Christianity. The OT was probably translated into Old Ethiopic (called Ge’ez) by the fourth century. That version is of special interest for two reasons. It is the Bible of the Falashas, that remarkable community of African Jews who claim to be descendants of Jews who migrated to Ethiopia in the time of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Further, the Old Ethiopic version of the OT contains several books not in the Hebrew Apocrypha. Most interesting of these is the book of Enoch, which is quoted in <a href="?bref=Jude.1.14">Jude 1:14</a> and was unknown to Bible scholars until James Bruce brought a copy to Europe in 1773. The apocryphal 3 Baruch is known only from the Ethiopic also.</p>
<p>The NT was translated into Old Ethiopic somewhat later than the OT and contains a collection of writings mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, including the Apocalypse of Peter. Both Testaments are extant in Ethiopic manuscripts. None, however, is earlier than the 13th century, and these manuscripts seem to rest rather heavily on the Coptic and the Arabic. Nothing survived the total chaos that reigned in Ethiopia from the 7th to the 13th centuries. Because they are so late, the Ethiopic manuscripts have had little value for textual study.</p>
<p class="h3" id="ArabicVersions">Arabic Versions</p>
<p class="fl">Around <span class="era">AD</span> 570 Muhammad was born in Mecca. At the age of 25 he married a wealthy widow, Khadijah. His “call” came at the age of 40. In 622 the “Hegira” to Medina took place. In 632 he died, the undisputed master prophet of Arabia. Within a hundred years, Islamic domains stretched from the Pyrenees through Spain, jumped the Gibraltar Strait, embraced all of North Africa, and captured Egypt and the Bible lands. Thus began a relentless pressure on Byzantium that culminated in the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Eventually, the Islamic conquest extended to lands as far east as India. Arabic became the most universal language the world had seen since Alexander had spread Greek over nine centuries earlier.</p>
<p>There were a number of strong Jewish communities in Arabia in the time of Muhammad, and the vast conquests engulfed hundreds of Christian communities, a few of which stubbornly survived. Yet the Bible in Arabic evidently did not come into existence until the work of Saadya Gaon. Saadya was born in the Fayum in Upper Egypt in 892 and died in Babylon in 942. He translated the Pentateuch from the Hebrew. Other parts of the OT followed—Joshua from the Hebrew; Judges, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Job from the <span class="ital">Peshitta</span><span class="ital">;</span> and the Prophets, Psalms, and Proverbs from the Septuagint—not necessarily the work of Saadya. The resulting version has been used by Arabic-speaking Jews down to this century. The Qara’ites, disapproving of Saadya’s rather free work, made rival translations, the most notable that of Japheth ben-Eli-ha-Levi in the tenth century. NT translations into Arabic sprang up from Syriac, Greek, and Coptic sources in the seventh to the ninth centuries. Arab writers say that John I, a Jacobite patriarch of Antioch (631–48), translated the Gospels from Syriac into Arabic. Another John, Bishop of Seville in Spain, is said to have produced Arabic Gospels from the Vulgate around 724. The final form of the Arabic NT rested most heavily on the Coptic Bohairic. Because of their late date and mixed background, Arabic texts have had little importance in textual studies.</p>
<p class="h3" id="SlavonicVersion">Slavonic Version</p>
<p class="fl">Though the Slavs were one of the great ethnic groups contiguous to the centers of early Christianity, Bible translations into Slavonic cannot be traced earlier than the ninth century. Two brothers, Constantine and Methodius, sons of a Greek nobleman, began by putting church liturgy into Slavonic. With the approval of popes Adrian II and John VIII (as noted above), they translated the Bible. Constantine (who later changed his name to Cyril, 827–69) and Methodius (826–85) worked among the Slavs and Moravians. Constantine (Cyril) invented the alphabet that bears his saint name—Cyrillic—to facilitate the translation. Manuscript portions from the 10th or 11th centuries survive, but the oldest manuscript of the whole Bible is the Codex Gennadius in Moscow, which is dated 1499 and is too late to be of much value for textual study.</p>

<p class="h2" id="EarlyTranslationsCaedmonsBedesAlfredtheGreats">Early Translations: Caedmon’s, Bede’s, Alfred the Great’s</p>
<p class="fl">As the gospel spread and churches multiplied in the early centuries of the Christian era, Christians in various countries wanted to read the Bible in their own language. As a result, many translations were made in several different languages—as early as the second century. For example, there were translations done in Coptic for the Egyptians, in Syriac for those whose language was Aramaic, in Gothic for the Germanic people called the Goths, and in Latin for the Romans and Carthaginians. The most famous Latin translation was done by Jerome around 400. This translation, known as the Latin Vulgate (<span class="ital">vulgate</span> meaning “common”—hence, the Latin text for the common man), was used extensively in the Roman Catholic Church for centuries and centuries.</p>
<p>The gospel was brought to England by missionaries from Rome in the sixth century. The Bible they carried with them was the Latin Vulgate. The Christians living in England at that time depended on monks for any kind of instruction from the Bible. The monks read and taught the Latin Bible. After a few centuries, when more monasteries were founded, the need arose for translations of the Bible in English. The earliest English translation, as far as we know, is one done by a seventh-century monk named Caedmon, who made a metrical version of parts of the Old and New Testaments. Another English churchman, named Bede, is said to have translated the Gospels into English. Tradition has it that he was translating the Gospel of John on his deathbed in 735. Another translator was Alfred the Great (reigned 871–99), who was regarded as a very literate king. He included in his laws parts of the Ten Commandments translated into English, and he also translated the Psalms.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OtherEarlyVersionsLindisfarneGospelsShorehamsPsalmsRollesPsalms">Other Early Versions: Lindisfarne Gospels, Shoreham’s Psalms, Rolle’s Psalms</p>
<p class="fl">All translations of the English Bible prior to the work of Tyndale (discussed later) were done from the Latin text. Some Latin versions of the Gospels with word-for-word English translations written between the lines, which are called interlinear translations, survive from the 10th century. The most famous translation of this period is called the Lindisfarne Gospels (950). In the late 10th century, Aelfric (c. 955–1020), abbot of Eynsham, made idiomatic translations of various parts of the Bible. Two of these translations still exist. Later, in the 1300s, William of Shoreham translated the Psalms into English and so did Richard Rolle, whose editions of the Psalms included a verse-by-verse commentary. Both of these translations, which were metrical and therefore called Psalters, were popular when John Wycliffe was a young man.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TyndaleSVersion"/>
<p class="h2" id="WycliffesVersion">Wycliffe’s Version</p>
<p class="fl">John Wycliffe (c. 1329–84), the most eminent Oxford theologian of his day, and his associates were the first to translate the entire Bible from Latin into English. Wycliffe has been called the “Morning Star of the Reformation” because he boldly questioned papal authority, criticized the sale of indulgences (which were supposed to release a person from punishment in purgatory), denied the reality of transubstantiation (the doctrine that the bread and wine are changed into Jesus Christ’s body and blood during Communion), and spoke out against church hierarchies. The pope reproved Wycliffe for his “heretical” teachings and asked that Oxford University dismiss him. But Oxford and many government leaders stood with Wycliffe, so he was able to survive the pope’s assaults.</p>
<p>Wycliffe believed that the way to prevail in his struggle with the church’s abusive authority was to make the Bible available to the people in their own language. Then they could read for themselves about how each one of them could have a personal relationship with God through Christ Jesus—apart from any ecclesiastical authority. Wycliffe, with his associates, completed the NT around 1380 and the OT in 1382. Wycliffe concentrated his labors on the NT, while an associate, Nicholas of Hereford, did a major part of the OT. Wycliffe and his coworkers, unfamiliar with the original Hebrew and Greek, translated the Latin text into English.</p>
<p>After Wycliffe finished the translation work, he organized a group of poor parishioners, known as Lollards, to go throughout England preaching Christian truths and reading the Scriptures in their mother tongue to all who would hear God’s Word. As a result the Word of God, through Wycliffe’s translation, became available to many Englishmen. He was loved and yet hated. His ecclesiastical enemies did not forget his opposition to their power or his successful efforts in making the Scriptures available to all. Several decades after he died, they condemned him for heresy, dug up his body, burned it, and threw his ashes into the Swift River.</p>
<p>One of Wycliffe’s close associates, John Purvey (c. 1353–1428), continued Wycliffe’s work by producing a revision of his translation in 1388. Purvey was an excellent scholar; his work was very well received by his generation and following generations. Within less than a century, Purvey’s revision had replaced the original Wycliffe Bible.</p>
<p>As was stated before, Wycliffe and his associates were the first Englishmen to translate the entire Bible into English from Latin. Therefore, their Bible was a translation of a translation, not a translation of the original languages. With the coming of the Renaissance came the resurgence of the study of the classics—and with it the resurgence of the study of Greek as well as Hebrew. Thus, for the first time in nearly 1,000 years (500–1500—the approximate time when Latin was the dominant language for scholarship, except in the Greek church) scholars began to read the NT in its original language, Greek. By 1500, Greek was being taught at Oxford.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TyndalesTranslation">Tyndale’s Translation</p>
<p class="fl">William Tyndale was born in the age of the Renaissance. He graduated in 1515 from Oxford, where he had studied the Scriptures in Greek and in Hebrew. By the time he was 30, Tyndale had committed his life to translating the Bible from the original languages into English. His heart’s desire is exemplified in a statement he made to a clergyman when refuting the view that only the clergy were qualified to read and correctly interpret the Scriptures. Tyndale said, “If God spare my life, ere many years, I will cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more of the Scripture than thou dost.”</p>
<p>In 1523 Tyndale went to London seeking a place to work on his translation. When the bishop of London would not give him hospitality, he was provided a place by Humphrey Monmouth, a cloth merchant. Then, in 1524, Tyndale left England for Germany because the English church, which was still under the papal authority of Rome, strongly opposed putting the Bible into the hands of the laity. Tyndale first settled in Hamburg, Germany. Quite possibly, he met Luther in Wittenberg soon thereafter. Even if he didn’t meet Luther, he was well acquainted with Luther’s writings and Luther’s German translation of the NT (published in 1522). Throughout his lifetime, Tyndale was harassed for propagating Luther’s ideas. Both Luther and Tyndale used the same Greek text (one compiled by Erasmus in 1516) in making their translations.</p>
<p>Tyndale completed his translation of the NT in 1525. Fifteen thousand copies, in six editions, were smuggled into England between the years 1525 and 1530. Church authorities did their best to confiscate copies of Tyndale’s translation and burn them, but they couldn’t stop the flow of Bibles from Germany into England. Tyndale himself could not return to England because his life was in danger since his translation had been banned. However, he continued to work abroad—correcting, revising, and reissuing his translation until his final revision appeared in 1535. Shortly thereafter, in May of 1535, Tyndale was arrested and carried off to a castle near Brussels. After being in prison for over a year, he was tried and condemned to death. He was strangled and burned at the stake on October 6, 1536. His final words were so very poignant: “Lord, open the king of England’s eyes.”</p>
<p>After finishing the NT, Tyndale had begun work on a translation of the Hebrew OT, but he did not live long enough to complete his task. He had, however, translated the Pentateuch (the first five books of the OT), Jonah, and some historical books. While Tyndale was in prison, an associate of his named Miles Coverdale (1488–1569) brought to completion an entire Bible in English—based largely on Tyndale’s translation of the NT and other OT books. In other words, Coverdale finished what Tyndale had begun.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CoverdalesVersion">Coverdale’s Version</p>
<p class="fl">Miles Coverdale was a Cambridge graduate who, like Tyndale, was forced to flee England because he had been strongly influenced by Luther to the extent that he was boldly preaching against Roman Catholic doctrine. While he was abroad, Coverdale met Tyndale and then served as an assistant—especially helping Tyndale translate the Pentateuch. By the time Coverdale produced a complete translation (1537), the king of England, Henry VIII, had broken all ties with the pope and was ready to see the appearance of an English Bible. Perhaps Tyndale’s prayer had been answered—with a very ironic twist. The king gave his royal approval to Coverdale’s translation, which was based on the work done by Tyndale, the man Henry VIII had earlier condemned.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThomasMatthewsVersionTheGreatBible">Thomas Matthew’s Version: The Great Bible</p>
<p class="fl">In the same year that Coverdale’s Bible was endorsed by the king (1537), another Bible was published in England. This was the work of one called Thomas Matthew, a pseudonym for John Rogers (c. 1500–55), a friend of Tyndale. Evidently, Rogers used Tyndale’s unpublished translation of the OT historical books, other parts of Tyndale’s translation, and still other parts of Coverdale’s translation, to form an entire Bible. This Bible also received the king’s approval. Matthew’s Bible was revised in 1538 and printed for distribution in the churches throughout England. This Bible, called the Great Bible because of its size and costliness, became the first English Bible authorized for public use.</p>
<p>Many editions of the Great Bible were printed in the early 1540s. However, its distribution was limited. Furthermore, King Henry’s attitude about the new translation changed. As a result, the English Parliament passed a law in 1543 restricting the use of any English translation. It was a crime for any unlicensed person to read or explain the Scriptures in public. Many copies of Tyndale’s NT and Coverdale’s Bible were burned in London.</p>
<p>Greater repression was to follow. After a short period of leniency (during the reign of Edward VI, 1547–53), severe persecution came from the hands of Queen Mary. She was a Roman Catholic who was determined to restore Catholicism to England and repress Protestantism. Many Protestants were executed, including John Rogers, the Bible translator. Coverdale was arrested, then released. He fled to Geneva, a sanctuary for English Protestants.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGenevaBibleandtheBishopsBible">The Geneva Bible and the Bishops’ Bible</p>
<p class="fl">The English exiles in Geneva chose William Whittingham (c. 1524–79) to make an English translation of the NT for them. He used Theodore Beza’s Latin translation and consulted the Greek text. This Bible became very popular because it was small and moderately priced. The preface to the Bible and its many annotations were affected by a strong evangelical influence, as well as by the teachings of John Calvin. Calvin was one of the greatest thinkers of the Reformation, a renowned biblical commentator, and the principal leader in Geneva during those days.</p>
<p>While the Geneva Bible was popular among many English men and women, it was not acceptable among many leaders in the Church of England because of its Calvinistic notes. These leaders, recognizing that the Great Bible was inferior to the Geneva Bible in style and scholarship, initiated a revision of the Great Bible. This revised Bible, published in 1568, became known as the Bishops’ Bible; it continued in use until it was superseded by the King James Version of 1611.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="FrontispieceOfTheAuthorizedKingJamesVersion1611"/>
<p class="h2" id="TheKingJamesVersion">The King James Version</p>
<p class="fl">After James VI of Scotland became the king of England (known as James I), he invited several clergymen from Puritan and Anglican factions to meet together with the hope that differences could be reconciled. The meeting did not achieve this. However, during the meeting one of the Puritan leaders, John Reynolds, president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, asked the king to authorize a new translation because he wanted to see a translation that was more accurate than previous translations. King James liked this idea because the Bishops’ Bible had not been successful and because he considered the notes in the Geneva Bible to be seditious. The king initiated the work and took an active part in planning the new translation. He suggested that university professors work on the translation to assure the best scholarship, and he strongly urged that they should not have any marginal notes besides those pertaining to literal renderings from the Hebrew and Greek. The absence of interpretive notes would help the translation be accepted by all the churches in England.</p>
<p>More than 50 scholars, trained in Hebrew and Greek, began the work in 1607. The translation went through several committees before it was finalized. The scholars were instructed to follow the Bishops’ Bible as the basic version, as long as it adhered to the original text, and to consult the translations of Tyndale, Matthew, and Coverdale, as well as the Great Bible and the Geneva Bible when they appeared to contain more accurate renderings of the original languages. This dependence on other versions is expressed in the preface to the King James Version: “Truly, good Christian reader, we never thought from the beginning that we should need to make a new translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one . . . but to make a good one better, or out of many good ones one principal good one.”</p>
<p>The King James Version, known in England as the Authorized Version because it was authorized by the king, captured the best of all the preceding English translations and far exceeded all of them. It was the culmination of all the previous English Bible translations; it united high scholarship with Christian devotion and piety. It came into being at a time when the English language was vigorous and beautiful—the age of Elizabethan English and Shakesperean English. This version has justifiably been called “the noblest monument of English prose.” Indeed, the King James Version has become an enduring monument of English prose because of its gracious style, majestic language, and poetic rhythms. No other book has had such a tremendous influence on English literature, and no other translation has touched the lives of so many English-speaking people for centuries and centuries, even until the present day.</p>
<p class="h2" id="The18thand19thCenturiesNewDiscoveriesofEarlierManuscriptsandIncreasedKnowledgeoftheOriginalLanguages">The 18th and 19th Centuries: New Discoveries of Earlier Manuscripts and Increased Knowledge of the Original Languages</p>
<p class="fl">The King James Version became the most popular English translation in the 17th and 18th centuries. It acquired the stature of becoming the standard English Bible. But the King James Version had deficiencies that did not go unnoticed by certain scholars. First, knowledge of Hebrew was inadequate in the early 17th century. The Hebrew text they used (i.e., the Masoretic Text) was adequate, but their understanding of the Hebrew vocabulary was insufficient. It would take many more years of linguistic studies to enrich and sharpen understanding of the Hebrew vocabulary. Second, the Greek text underlying the NT of the King James Version was an inferior text. The King James translators basically used a Greek text known as the Textus Receptus (or, the “Received Text”), which came from the work of Erasmus, who compiled the first Greek text to be produced on a printing press. When Erasmus compiled this text, he used five or six very late manuscripts dating from the 10th to the 13th centuries. These manuscripts were far inferior to earlier manuscripts.</p>
<p>The King James translators had done well with the resources that were available to them, but those resources were insufficient, especially with respect to the NT text. After the King James Version was published, earlier and better manuscripts were discovered. Around 1630, Codex Alexandrinus was brought to England. A fifth-century manuscript containing the entire NT, it provided a fairly good witness to the NT text, especially the original text of Revelation. Two hundred years later, a German scholar named Constantin von Tischendorf discovered Codex Sinaiticus in St Catherine’s Monastery. The manuscript, dated around <span class="era">AD</span> 350, is one of the two oldest manuscripts of the Greek NT. The earliest manuscript, Codex Vaticanus, had been in the Vatican’s library since at least 1475, but it was not made available to scholars until the middle of the 19th century. This manuscript, dated slightly earlier (<span class="era">AD</span> 325) than Codex Sinaiticus, is one of the most reliable copies of the Greek NT.</p>
<p>As these manuscripts (and others) were discovered and made public, certain scholars labored to compile a Greek text that would more closely represent the original text than did the Textus Receptus. Around 1700 John Mill produced an improved Textus Receptus, and in the 1730s Johannes Albert Bengel, known as the father of modern textual and philological studies in the NT, published a text that deviated from the Textus Receptus according to the evidence of earlier manuscripts.</p>
<p>In the 1800s certain scholars began to abandon the Textus Receptus. Karl Lachman, a classical philologist, produced a fresh text in 1831 that represented the fourth-century manuscripts. Samuel Tregelles, self-taught in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek, laboring throughout his entire lifetime, concentrated all of his efforts in publishing one Greek text, which came out in six parts, from 1857 to 1872. Tischendorf devoted a lifetime of labor to discovering manuscripts and producing accurate editions of the Greek NT. He not only discovered Codex Sinaiticus, he also deciphered the palimpsest Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, collated countless manuscripts, and produced several editions of the Greek NT (the eighth edition is considered the best). Aided by the work of these scholars, two British men, Brooke Westcott and Fenton Hort, worked together for 28 years to produce a volume entitled <span class="ital">The New Testament in the Original Greek</span> (1881). This edition of the Greek NT, based largely on Codex Vaticanus, became the standard text that was responsible for dethroning the Textus Receptus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheEnglishRevisedVersionandtheAmericanStandardVersion">The English Revised Version and the American Standard Version</p>
<p class="fl">By the latter part of the 19th century, the Christian community had been given three very good Greek NT texts: Tregelles’s, Tischendorf’s, and Westcott and Hort’s. These texts were very different from the Textus Receptus. And as was mentioned earlier, the scholarly community had accumulated more knowledge about the meaning of various Hebrew words and Greek words. Therefore, there was a great need for a new English translation based upon a better text—and with more accurate renderings of the original languages.</p>
<p>A few individuals attempted to meet this need. In 1871 John Nelson Darby, leader of the Plymouth Brethren movement, produced a translation called the <span class="ital">New Translation,</span> which was largely based on Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. In 1872 J. B. Rotherham published a translation of Tregelles’s text, in which he attempted to reflect the emphasis inherent in the Greek text. This translation is still being published under the title <span class="ital">The Emphasized Bible.</span> And in 1875 Samuel Davidson produced a NT translation of Tischendorf’s text.</p>
<p>The first major corporate effort was initiated in 1870 by the Convocation of Canterbury, which decided to sponsor a major revision of the King James Version. Sixty-five British scholars, working in various committees, made significant changes in the King James Version. The OT scholars corrected mistranslations of Hebrew words and reformatted poetic passages into poetic form. The NT scholars made thousands of changes based upon better textual evidence. Their goal was to make the NT revision reflect not the Textus Receptus but the texts of Tregelles, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort. When the complete Revised Version appeared in 1885, it was received with great enthusiasm. Over three million copies sold in the first year of its publication. Unfortunately, its popularity was not long lasting because most people continued to prefer the King James Version over all other translations.</p>
<p>Several American scholars had been invited to join the revision work, with the understanding that any of their suggestions not accepted by the British scholars would appear in an appendix. Furthermore, the American scholars had to agree not to publish their own American revision until after 14 years. When the time came (1901), the American Standard Version was published by several surviving members of the original American committee. This translation, generally regarded as superior to the English Revised Version, is an accurate, literal rendering of very trustworthy texts both in the OT and the New.</p>
<p class="h2" id="The20thCenturyNewDiscoveriesandNewTranslations">The 20th Century: New Discoveries and New Translations</p>
<p class="fl">The 19th century was a fruitful era for the Greek NT and subsequent English translations; it was also a century in which Hebrew studies were greatly advanced. The 20th century has also been fruitful—especially for textual studies. Those living in the 20th century have witnessed the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, the Chester Beatty Papyri, and the Bodmer Papyri. These amazing discoveries, providing scholars with hundreds of ancient manuscripts, have greatly enhanced the effort to recover the original wording of the Old and New Testaments. At the same time, other archaeological discoveries have validated the historical accuracy of the Bible and helped Bible scholars understand the meaning of certain ancient words. For example, the Greek word <span class="greek">parousia</span> (usually translated “coming”) was found in many ancient documents dated around the time of Christ; very often the word indicated the visitation of royalty. When this word was used in the NT concerning Christ’s second coming, the readers would think of his coming as being the visitation of a king. Another example is that in koine Greek, the expression <span class="greek">entos humon</span> (literally, “inside of you”) often meant “within reach.” Thus, Jesus’ statement in <a href="?bref=Luke.17.21">Luke 17:21</a> could mean “The kingdom is within reach.”</p>
<p>As earlier and better manuscripts of the Bible have emerged, scholars have been engaged in updating the Bible texts. OT scholars have still used the Masoretic Text but have noted significant differences found in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The current edition used by OT scholars is called <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia.</span> NT scholars, for the most part, have come to rely upon an edition of the Greek NT known as the Nestle-Aland text. Eberhard Nestle used the best editions of the Greek NT produced in the 19th century to compile a text that represented the majority consensus. The work of making new editions was carried on by his son for several years and then came under the care of Kurt Aland. The latest edition (the 27th) of Nestle-Aland’s <span class="ital">Novum Testamentum Graece</span> appeared in 1993. The same Greek text appears in another popular volume published by the United Bible Societies, called the <span class="ital">Greek New Testament</span> (fourth edition—1983).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Early20th-CenturyTranslationsintheLanguageofthePeople">Early 20th-Century Translations in the Language of the People</p>
<p class="fl">The thousands and thousands of papyri that were discovered in Egypt around the turn of the century displayed a form of Greek called koine Greek. Koine (meaning “common”) Greek was everyman’s Greek; it was the common language of almost everybody living in the Graeco-Roman world from the second century <span class="era">BC</span> to the third century <span class="era">AD</span>. In other words, it was the <span class="ital">lingua franca</span> of the Mediterranean world. Every educated person back then could speak, read, and write in Greek just like every educated person in modern times can speak a little English, read some English, and perhaps write in English. Koine Greek was not literary Greek (i.e., the kind of Greek written by the Greek poets and tragedians); it was the kind of Greek used in personal letters, legal documents, and other nonliterary texts.</p>
<p>NT scholars began to discover that most of the NT was written in koine Greek—the language of the people. As a result, there was a strong prompting to translate the NT into the language of the people. Various translators chose to divorce themselves from the traditional Elizabethan English as found in the King James Version (and even in the English Revised Version and American Standard Version) and produce fresh renderings in the common idiom.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTwentiethCenturyNewTestament">The Twentieth Century New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The first of these new translations was <span class="ital">The Twentieth Century New Testament</span> (1902). The preface to a new edition of this translation provides an excellent description of the work:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space"><span class="ital">The Twentieth Century New Testament</span> is a smooth-flowing, accurate, easy-to-read translation that captivates its readers from start to finish. Born out of a desire to make the Bible readable and understandable, it is the product of the labors of a committee of twenty men and women who worked together over many years to construct, we believe under divine surveillance, this beautifully simple rendition of the word of God. (Preface to the new edition—1961—published by Moody Press)</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewTestamentinModernSpeech"><span class="ital">The New Testament in Modern Speech</span></p>
<p class="fl">A year after the publication of <span class="ital">The Twentieth Century New Testament,</span> Richard Weymouth published <span class="ital">The New Testament in Modern Speech</span> (1903). Weymouth, who had received the first doctor of literature degree from the University of London, was headmaster of a private school in London. During his life, he spent time producing an edition of the Greek text (published in 1862) that was more accurate than the Textus Receptus, and then he labored to produce an English translation of this Greek text (called <span class="ital">The Resultant Greek Testament</span>) in a modern speech version. His translation was very well received; it has gone through several editions and many printings.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewTestamentANewTranslation"><span class="ital">The New Testament: A New Translation</span></p>
<p class="fl">Another new and fresh translation to appear in the early years of this century was one written by James Moffatt, a brilliant Scottish scholar. In 1913 he published his first edition of <span class="ital">The New Testament: A New Translation.</span> This was actually his second translation of the NT; his first was done in 1901, called <span class="ital">The Historical New Testament.</span> In his <span class="ital">New Translation</span> Moffatt’s goal was “to translate the NT exactly as one would render any piece of contemporary Hellenistic prose.” His work displays brilliance and marked independence from other versions; unfortunately it was based on Hermann von Soden’s Greek NT, which, as all scholars now know, is quite defective.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheCompleteBibleAnAmericanTranslation"><span class="ital">The Complete Bible: An American Translation</span></p>
<p class="fl">The earliest American modern speech translation was produced by Edgar J. Goodspeed, a professor of NT at the University of Chicago. He had criticized <span class="ital">The Twentieth Century New Testament,</span> Weymouth’s version, and Moffatt’s translation. As a consequence, he was challenged by some other scholars to do better. He took up the challenge and in 1923 published <span class="ital">The New Testament: An American Translation.</span> When he made this translation, he said that he wanted to give his “version something of the force and freshness that reside in the original Greek.” He said, “I wanted my translation to make on the reader something of the impression the NT must have made on its earliest readers, and to invite the continuous reading of the whole book at a time.” His translation was a success. An OT translation followed, produced by J. M. Powis Smith and three other scholars. <span class="ital">The Complete Bible: An American Translation</span> was published in 1935.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRevisedStandardVersion">The Revised Standard Version</p>
<p class="fl">The English Revised Version and the American Standard Version had gained a reputation of being accurate study texts but very “wooden” in their construction. The translators who worked on the Revised Versions attempted to translate words consistently from the original language regardless of their context and sometimes even followed the word order of the Greek. This created a very unidiomatic version and called for a new revision.</p>
<p>The demand for revision was strengthened by the fact that several important biblical manuscripts had been discovered in the 1930s and 1940s—namely, the Dead Sea Scrolls for the OT and the Chester Beatty Papyri for the NT. It was felt that the fresh evidence displayed in these documents should be reflected in a revision. The revision showed some textual changes in the book of Isaiah due to the Isaiah Scroll and several changes in the Pauline Epistles based on the Chester Beatty Papyrus, P46. There were other significant revisions. The story of the woman caught in adultery (<a href="?bref=John.7.52-8.11">John 7:52–8:11</a>) was not included in the text but in the margin because none of the early manuscripts contain this story, and the ending to Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.9-20">16:9-20</a>) was not included in the text because it is not found in the two earliest manuscripts, Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus.</p>
<p>The organization that held the copyright to the American Standard Version, called the International Council of Religious Education, authorized a new revision in 1937. The NT translators generally followed the 17th edition of the Nestle Text (1941), while the OT translators followed the Masoretic Text. Both groups, however, adopted readings from other ancient sources when they were considered to be more accurate. The NT was published in 1946, and the entire Bible with the OT in 1952.</p>
<p>The principles of the revision were specified in the preface to the Revised Standard Version:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">The Revised Standard Version is not a new translation in the language of today. It is not a paraphrase which aims at striking idioms. It is a revision which seeks to preserve all that is best in the English Bible as it has been known and used throughout the years.</p>
<p class="fl">This revision was well received by many Protestant churches and soon became their “standard” text. The Revised Standard Version was later published with the Apocrypha of the OT (1957), in a Catholic Edition (1965), and in what is called the <span class="ital">Common Bible,</span> which includes the OT, the NT, the Apocrypha, and the deuterocanonical books, with international endorsements by Protestants, Greek Orthodox, and Roman Catholics. Evangelical and fundamental Christians, however, did not receive the Revised Standard Version very well—primarily because of one verse, <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which reads, “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Look, the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and shall name him Immanuel.” Evangelicals and fundamentalists contend that the text should read “virgin,” not “young woman.” As a result, the Revised Standard Version was panned, if not banned, by many evangelical and fundamental Christians.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewEnglishBible">The <span class="ital">New English Bible</span></p>
<p class="fl">In the year that the NT of the Revised Standard Version was published (1946), the Church of Scotland proposed to other churches in Great Britain that it was time for a completely new translation of the Bible to be done. Those who initiated this work asked the translators to produce a fresh translation in modern idiom of the original languages; this was not to be a revision of any foregoing translation, nor was it to be a literal translation. The translators, under the direction of C. H. Dodd, were called upon to translate the meaning of the text into modern English. The preface to the NT (published in 1961), written by C. H. Dodd, explains this more fully:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">The older translators, on the whole, considered that fidelity to the original demanded that they should reproduce, as far as possible, characteristic features of the language in which it was written, such as the syntactical order of words, the structure and division of sentences, and even such irregularities of grammar as were indeed natural enough to authors writing in the easy idiom of popular Hellenistic Greek, but less natural when turned into English. The present translators were enjoined to replace Greek constructions and idioms by those of contemporary English.</p>
<p class="extract">This meant a different theory and practice of translation, and one which laid a heavier burden on the translators. Fidelity in translation was not to mean keeping the general framework of the original intact while replacing Greek words by English words more or less equivalent. . . . Thus we have not felt obliged (as did the Revisers of 1881) to make an effort to render the same Greek word everywhere by the same English word. We have in this respect returned to the wholesome practice of King James’s men, who (as they expressly state in their preface) recognized no such obligation. We have conceived our task to be that of understanding the original as precisely as we could (using all available aids), and then saying again in our own native idiom what we believed the author to be saying in his.</p>
<p class="sp">The entire <span class="ital">New English Bible</span> was published in 1970; it was well received in Great Britain and in the United States (even though its idiom is extremely British) and was especially praised for its good literary style. The translators were very experimental, producing renderings never before printed in an English version and adopting certain readings from various Hebrew and Greek manuscripts never before adopted. As a result, <span class="ital">The New English Bible</span> was both highly praised for its ingenuity and severely criticized for its liberty.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGoodNewsBibleTodaysEnglishVersion">The <span class="ital">Good News Bible:</span> Today’s English Version</p>
<p class="fl">The NT in Today’s English Version, also known as <span class="ital">Good News for Modern Man</span><span class="ital">,</span> was published by the American Bible Society in 1966. The translation was originally done by Robert Bratcher, a research associate of the translations department of the American Bible Society, and then further refined by the American Bible Society. The translation, heavily promoted by several Bible societies and very affordable, sold more than 35 million copies within six years of the time of printing. The NT translation, based upon the first edition of the <span class="ital">Greek New Testament</span> (the United Bible Societies, 1966), is an idiomatic version in modern and simple English. The translation was greatly influenced by the linguistic theory of dynamic equivalence and was quite successful in providing English readers with a translation that, for the most part, accurately reflects the meaning of the original texts. This is explained in the preface to the NT:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">This translation of the NT has been prepared by the American Bible Society for people who speak English as their mother tongue or as an acquired language. As a distinctly new translation, it does not conform to traditional vocabulary or style, but seeks to express the meaning of the Greek text in words and forms accepted as standard by people everywhere who employ English as a means of communication. Today’s English Version of the NT attempts to follow, in this century, the example set by the authors of the NT books, who, for the most part, wrote in the standard, or common, form of the Greek language used throughout the Roman Empire.</p>
<p class="sp">Because of the success of the NT, the American Bible Society was asked by other Bible societies to make an OT translation following the same principles used in the NT. The entire Bible was published in 1976, and is known as the <span class="ital">Good News Bible:</span> Today’s English Version.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLivingBible"><span class="ital">The Living Bible</span></p>
<p class="fl">In 1962 Kenneth Taylor published a paraphrase of the NT epistles in a volume called <span class="ital">Living Letters.</span> This new dynamic paraphrase, written in common vernacular, became well received and widely acclaimed—especially for its ability to communicate the message of God’s Word to the common man. In the beginning its circulation was greatly enhanced by the endorsement of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, which did much to publicize the book and distributed thousands of free copies. Taylor continued to paraphrase other portions of the Bible and publish successive volumes: <span class="ital">Living Prophecies</span> (1965), <span class="ital">Living Gospels</span> (1966), <span class="ital">Living Psalms</span> (1967), <span class="ital">Living Lessons of Life and Love</span> (1968), <span class="ital">Living Books of Moses</span> (1969), and <span class="ital">Living History of Moses</span> (1970). The entire Living Bible was published in 1971 (the <span class="ital">Living New Testament</span> was printed in 1966).</p>
<p>Using the American Standard Version as his working text, Taylor rephrased the Bible into modern speech—such that anyone, even a child, could understand the message of the original writers. In the preface to <span class="ital">The Living Bible</span><span class="ital">,</span> Taylor explains his view of paraphrasing:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">To paraphrase is to say something in different words than the author used. It is a restatement of the author’s thoughts, using different words than he did. This book is a paraphrase of the Old and New Testaments. Its purpose is to say as exactly as possible what the writers of the Scriptures meant, and to say it simply, expanding where necessary for a clear understanding by the modern reader.</p>
<p class="fl">Even though many modern readers have greatly appreciated the fact that <span class="ital">The Living Bible</span> made God’s Word clear to them, Taylor’s paraphrase has been criticized for being too interpretive. But that is the nature of paraphrases—and the danger as well. Taylor was aware of this when he made the paraphrase. Again, the preface clarifies:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">There are dangers in paraphrases, as well as values. For whenever the author’s exact words are not translated from the original languages, there is a possibility that the translator, however honest, may be giving the English reader something that the original writer did not mean to say.</p>
<p class="sp"><span class="ital">The Living Bible</span> has been very popular among English readers worldwide. More than 40 million copies have been sold by the publishing house Taylor specifically created to publish <span class="ital">The Living Bible.</span> The company is called Tyndale House Publishers—named after William Tyndale, the father of modern English translations of the Bible.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="OriginalManuscriptOfLivingGospels"/>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewAmericanStandardBible">The <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span></p>
<p class="fl">There are two modern translations that are both revisions of (or based on) the American Standard Version (1901): the Revised Standard Version (1952) and the <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span> (1971). The Lockman Foundation, a nonprofit Christian corporation committed to evangelism, promoted this revision of the American Standard Version because “the producers of this translation were imbued with the conviction that interest in the American Standard Version 1901 should be renewed and increased” (from the preface). Indeed, the American Standard Version was a monumental work of scholarship and a very accurate translation. However, its popularity was waning, and it was fast disappearing from the scene. Therefore, the Lockman Foundation organized a team of 32 scholars to prepare a new revision. These scholars, all committed to the inspiration of Scripture, strove to produce a literal translation of the Bible in the belief that such a translation “brings the contemporary reader as close as possible to the actual wording and grammatical structure of the original writers” (ibid.).</p>
<p>The translators of the <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span> were instructed by the Lockman Foundation to adhere to the original languages of the Holy Scriptures as closely as possible and at the same time to obtain a fluent and readable style according to current English usage. After the <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span> was published (1963 for the NT and 1971 for the entire Bible), it received a mixed response. Some critics applauded its literal accuracy, while others sharply criticized its language for hardly being contemporary or modern.</p>
<p>On the whole, the <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span> became respected as a good study Bible that accurately reflects the wording of the original languages yet is not a good translation for Bible reading. Furthermore, it must be said that this translation which was originally supposed to follow the 23d edition of the Nestle text, tends to follow the Textus Receptus, especially in its inclusion of passages considered spurious by most modern scholars.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewInternationalVersion">The New International Version</p>
<p class="fl">The New International Version is a completely new rendering of the original languages done by an international group of more than 100 scholars. These scholars worked many years and in several committees to produce an excellent thought-for-thought translation in contemporary English for private and public use. The New International Version is called “international” because it was prepared by distinguished scholars from English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, and because the translators sought to use vocabulary common to the major English-speaking nations of the world.</p>
<p>The translators of the New International Version sought to make a version that was midway between a literal rendering (as in the <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span>) and a free paraphrase (as in <span class="ital">The Living Bible</span>). Their goal was to convey in English the thought of the original writers. This is succinctly explained in the original preface to the NT:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">Certain convictions and aims guided the translators. They are all committed to the full authority and complete trustworthiness of the Scriptures. Therefore, their first concern was the accuracy of the translation and its fidelity to the thought of the New Testament writers. While they weighed the significance of the lexical and grammatical details of the Greek text, they have striven for more than a word-for-word translation. Because thought patterns and syntax differ from language to language, faithful communication of the meaning of the writers of the New Testament demanded frequent modifications in sentence structure and constant regard for the contextual meanings of words.</p>
<p class="sp">Concern for clarity of style—that it should be idiomatic without being idiosyncratic, contemporary without being dated—also motivated the translators and their consultants. They have consistently aimed at simplicity of expression, with sensitive attention to the connotation and sound of the chosen word. At the same time, they endeavored to avoid a sameness of style in order to reflect the varied styles and moods of the NT writers.</p>
<p>The NT of the New International Version was published in 1973, and the entire Bible in 1978. This version has been phenomenally successful. Millions and millions of readers have adopted the New International Version as their “Bible.” Since 1987 it has outsold the King James Version, the best-seller for centuries—a remarkable indication of its popularity and acceptance in the Christian community. The New International Version, sponsored by the New York Bible Society (now the International Bible Society) and published by Zondervan Publishing House, has become a standard version used for private reading and pulpit reading in many English-speaking countries.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheJerusalemBibleandTheNewAmericanBible">Two Modern Catholic Translations: <span class="ital">The Jerusalem Bible</span> and <span class="ital">The New American Bible</span></p>
<p class="fl">In 1943 Pope Pius XII issued the famous encyclical encouraging Roman Catholics to read and study the Scriptures. At the same time, the pope recommended that the Scriptures should be translated from the original languages. Previously, all Catholic translations were based on the Latin Vulgate. This includes Knox’s translation, which was begun in 1939 and published in 1944 (the NT) and in 1955 (the whole Bible).</p>
<p>The first complete Catholic Bible to be translated from the original languages is <span class="ital">The Jerusalem Bible,</span> published in England in 1966. <span class="ital">The Jerusalem Bible</span> is the English counterpart to a French translation entitled <span class="ital">La Bible de Jerusalem.</span> The French translation was “the culmination of decades of research and biblical scholarship” (from the preface to <span class="ital">The Jerusalem Bible</span>), published by the scholars of the Dominican Biblical School of Jerusalem. This Bible, which includes the Apocrypha and deuterocanonical books, contains many study helps—such as introductions to each book of the Bible, extensive notes on various passages, and maps. The study helps are an intricate part of the whole translation because it is the belief of Roman Catholic leadership that laypeople should be given interpretive helps in their reading of the sacred text. The study helps in <span class="ital">The Jerusalem Bible</span> were translated from the French, whereas the Bible text itself was translated from the original languages with the help of the French translation. The translation of the text produced under the editorship of Alexander Jones is considerably freer than other translations, such as the Revised Standard Version, because the translators sought to capture the meaning of the original writings in a “vigorous, contemporary literary style” (from the preface to <span class="ital">The Jerusalem Bible</span>).</p>
<p>The first American Catholic Bible to be translated from the original languages is <span class="ital">The New American Bible</span> (not to be confused with the <span class="ital">New American Standard Bible</span>). Although this translation was published in 1970, work had begun on this version several decades before. Prior to Pope Pius’s encyclical, an American translation of the NT based on the Latin Vulgate was published—known as the Confraternity Version. After the encyclical, the OT was translated from the Hebrew Masoretic Text and the NT redone, based on the 25th edition of the Greek Nestle-Aland text. <span class="ital">The New American Bible</span> has short introductions to each book of the Bible and textual notes. Kubo and Specht provide a just description of the translation itself:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">The translation itself is simple, clear, and straightforward and reads very smoothly. It is good American English, not as pungent and colorful as the N.E.B. [New English Bible]. Its translations are not striking but neither are they clumsy. They seem to be more conservative in the sense that they tend not to stray from the original. That is not to say that this is a literal translation, but it is more faithful. (<span class="ital">So Many Versions?</span> p 165)</p>
<p class="h2" id="JewishTranslations">Jewish Translations</p>
<p class="fl">In the 20th century some very important Jewish translations of the Bible were published. The Jewish Publication Society created a translation of the Hebrew Scriptures called <span class="ital">The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic Text, A New Translation</span> (published in 1917). The preface to this translation explains its purpose:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">It aims to combine the spirit of Jewish tradition with the results of biblical scholarship, ancient, medieval and modern. It gives to the Jewish world a translation of the Scriptures done by men imbued with the Jewish consciousness, while the non-Jewish world, it is hoped, will welcome a translation that presents many passages from the Jewish traditional point of view.</p>
<p class="fl">In 1955 the Jewish Publication Society appointed a new committee of seven eminent Jewish scholars to make a new Jewish translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. The translation called the New Jewish Version was published in 1962. A second, improved edition was published in 1973. This work is not a revision of <span class="ital">The Holy Scriptures according to the Masoretic Text;</span> it is a completely new translation in modern English. The translators attempted to produce a version that would carry the same message to modern man as the original did to the world of ancient times.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RevisionsoftheLate20thCentury">Revisions of the Late 20th Century</p>
<p class="fl">In the 1980s several significant revisions appeared: The New King James Version (1982); <span class="ital">The New Jerusalem Bible</span> (1986); <span class="ital">The New American Bible,</span> revised NT (1986); and The Revised English Bible (1989), which is a radical revision of <span class="ital">The New English Bible.</span> Other translations, such as the New International Version and Today’s English Version, were also revised in the 1980s but not publicized as such. Two other important revisions in the late 1980s and1990s are the New Revised Standard Version and the New Living Translation.</p>
<p>One reason for this continual influx of new revisions and translations is the ever-changing consensus regarding the original text of the Bible. Most contemporary translators of the OT use the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible because it is generally considered the most authoritative standard text of the OT. At the same time, they make use of the findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls and a few other important versions, including the Septuagint. The Masoretic Text, with up-to-date textual notes, is published in an edition called <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</span> (1967, 1977).</p>
<p>Most translators of the NT use two standard editions of the Greek NT, which are the <span class="ital">Greek New Testament</span> published by the United Bible Societies (fourth revised edition, 1993) and <span class="ital">Novum Testamentum Graece,</span> edited by Nestle and Aland (27th edition, 1993). These two volumes, which have the same text but differ in punctuation and textual notes, represent the latest in modern textual scholarship.</p>
<p>Most contemporary translators and revisers also make it their goal to reflect the changes that have occurred in the English language. One of the most obvious recent changes has been in the area of gender-inclusive language. Today’s English readers have come to expect that translations will not employ unnecessarily male-dominant language. This creates problems for modern translators of the ancient biblical text, which was originally written in a male-oriented culture. Modern translators must respect both the ancient milieu and the modern audience. Often the original language itself allows a rendering that is gender-inclusive. For example, the Greek word <span class="greek">anthropos</span><span class="ital">,</span> traditionally rendered “man,” really means “human being” or “person.” (A different Greek word, <span class="greek">aner</span><span class="ital">,</span> specifically refers to a male.) Likewise, in Hebrew the word <span class="hebrew">’adam</span><span class="ital">,</span> traditionally translated “man,” usually means “human being,” while <span class="hebrew">’ish</span> specifically designates an adult male. There are other occasions where the original language is male-oriented primarily because there is no neutral gender to be used. In these cases, the biblical writers defaulted to the masculine gender. For example, in the Pentateuch most of the laws are stated in language that is replete with masculine pronouns. Since it is clear that the recipients of these laws were both males and females, however, many translators generally use gender-neutral language.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewKingJamesVersion">The New King James Version</p>
<p class="fl">The New King James Version (<span class="sc">nkjv</span>), published in 1982, is a revision of the King James Version, which is itself a literal translation. As such, the New King James Version follows the historic precedent of the Authorized Version in maintaining a literal approach to translation. The revisers have called this method of translation “complete equivalence.” This means that the revisers sought to provide a complete representation of all the information in the original text with respect to the history of usage and etymology of words in their contexts.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of the <span class="sc">nkjv</span> is its underlying original text. The revisers of the <span class="sc">nkjv</span> NT have chosen to use the Textus Receptus rather than modern critical editions, including the Majority Text and the Nestle-Aland text. By way of concession, they have footnoted any significant textual variation from the Majority Text and modern critical editions. The Majority Text, which is the text supported by the majority of all known NT manuscripts, hardly differs from the Textus Receptus; thus, there are few significant differences noted. There are well over a thousand differences footnoted regarding the Nestle-Aland/United Bible Societies’ text. This means that there are at least that many significant differences between the Textus Receptus and these modern critical editions.</p>
<p>Though exhibiting an antiquated text, the language of the <span class="sc">nkjv</span> is modern. All the Elizabethan English of the original King James Version has been replaced with contemporary American English. Though much of the sentence structure of the <span class="sc">nkjv</span> is still dated and stilted, contemporary readers who favor the spirit of the King James Version but can’t understand much of its archaic language will appreciate this revision.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRevisedEnglishBible">The Revised English Bible</p>
<p class="fl">The Revised English Bible (1989) is a revision of <span class="ital">The New English Bible</span> (<span class="sc">neb</span>), which was published in 1971. Because the <span class="sc">neb</span> gained such popularity in British churches and was being regularly used for public reading, several British churches decided there should be a revision of the <span class="sc">neb</span> to keep the language current and the text up-to-date with modern biblical scholarship.</p>
<p>For the OT, the revisers used the Masoretic Text as it appears in <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</span> (1967, 1977). They also made use of the Dead Sea Scrolls and a few other important versions, including the Septuagint. The revisers of the NT used Nestle-Aland’s <span class="ital">Novum Testamentum Graece</span> (27th edition, 1993) as their base text. This choice resulted in several textual changes from <span class="ital">The New English Bible</span> text, which followed a very eclectic text. The Greek text used by the <span class="sc">neb</span> was produced by R. V. G. Tasker <span class="ital">after</span> the English translation had been published. This Greek text was decided upon by the translation committee on a verse-by-verse basis. The resulting Greek text was very uneven and yet very interesting. The translators of the <span class="sc">neb</span> adopted readings never before put into print by English translators. The scholars working on The Revised English Bible eliminated many of these readings, however, in the interest of providing a more balanced text.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewRevisedStandardVersion">New Revised Standard Version</p>
<p class="fl">The New Revised Standard Version (<span class="sc">nrsv</span>), published in 1989, is an excellent example of the current trend to publish revisions rather than new translations. In the preface to this revision, Bruce Metzger, chair of the original revision committee, wrote:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">The New Revised Standard Version of the Bible is an authorized revision of the Revised Standard Version, published in 1952, which was a revision of the American Standard Version, published in 1901, which, in turn, embodied earlier revisions of the King James Version, published in 1611.</p>
<p class="extract">The need for issuing a revision of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible arises from three circumstances: (a) the acquisition of still older Biblical manuscripts, (b) further investigation of linguistic features of the text, and (c) changes in preferred English usage.</p>
<p class="fl">Metzger’s three reasons for producing the New Revised Standard Version are essentially the same reasons behind all revisions of Bible translations.</p>
<p>Of all the translations, the <span class="sc">nrsv</span> most closely follows the text of NA<span class="sup">26</span>/UBS<span class="sup">3</span>. No doubt this is due to Bruce Metzger’s involvement in both editorial committees—a leading member of the NA<span class="sup">26</span>/UBS<span class="sup">3</span> committee and the chair for the <span class="sc">nrsv</span> committee.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable feature of the <span class="sc">nrsv</span> is its attention to gender-inclusive language. While respecting the historicity of the ancient texts, the <span class="sc">nrsv</span> translators attempted to make this new revision more palpable to readers who prefer gender-inclusive language. They did this by avoiding unnecessarily masculine renderings wherever possible. For example, in the NT epistles, the believers are referred to with a word that is traditionally rendered “brothers” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">adelphoi</span><span class="ital">),</span> yet it is clear that these epistles were addressed to all the believers—both male and female. Thus, the <span class="sc">nrsv</span> translators have used such phrases as “brothers and sisters” or “friends” (always with a footnote saying “Greek, brothers”) in order to represent the historical situation while remaining sensitive to modern readers.</p>
<p>Metzger and the other translators were careful, however, not to overemphasize the gender-inclusiveness principle. Some readers had been hoping for a more radical revision regarding gender-inclusiveness. Many of these readers were hoping that the revision would incorporate this principle with language about God, changing phrases such as “God our father” to “God our parent.” But the <span class="sc">nrsv</span> revisers, under the leadership of Metzger, decided against this approach, considering it an inaccurate reflection of the original text’s intended meaning.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewLivingTranslation">New Living Translation</p>
<p class="fl">With over 40 million copies in print, <span class="ital">The Living Bible</span> has been a very popular version of the Bible for more than 30 years. But various criticisms spurred the translator of <span class="ital">The Living Bible,</span> Kenneth Taylor, to produce a revision of his paraphrase. Under the sponsorship of Tyndale House Publishers, Taylor’s company, <span class="ital">The Living Bible</span> underwent a thorough revision. More than 90 evangelical scholars from various theological backgrounds and denominations worked for seven years to produce the New Living Translation (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). As a result, the <span class="sc">nlt</span> is a version that is exegetically accurate and idiomatically powerful.</p>
<p>The scholars carefully revised the text of <span class="ital">The Living Bible</span> according to the most reliable editions of the Hebrew and Greek texts. For the OT, the revisers used the Masoretic Text as it appears in <span class="ital">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</span> (1967, 1977). They also made use of the Dead Sea Scrolls and a few other important versions, including the Septuagint. The revisers of the NT used the text of NA<span class="sup">27</span>/UBS<span class="sup">4</span> as their base text.</p>
<p>The translation method behind the <span class="sc">nlt</span> has been described as “dynamic equivalence” or “functional equivalence.” The goal of this kind of translation is to produce in English the closest natural equivalent of the message of the Hebrew and Greek texts—both in meaning and in style. Such a translation should attempt to have the same impact upon modern readers as the original had upon its audience. To translate the Bible in this manner requires that the text be interpreted accurately and then rendered in understandable, current English. In doing this, the translators attempted to enter into the same thought pattern as the author and present the same idea, connotation, and effect in the receptor language. To guard against personal subjectivism and insure accuracy of message, the <span class="sc">nlt</span> was produced by a large group of scholars who were each well studied in his or her particular area. To ensure that the translation would be extremely readable and understandable, a group of stylists adjusted the wording to make it clear and fluent.</p>
<p>A thought-for-thought translation created by a group of capable scholars has the potential to represent the intended meaning of the original text even more accurately than a word-for-word translation. This is illustrated by the various renderings of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">hesed</span><span class="ital">.</span> This term cannot be adequately translated by any single English word because it can connote love, mercy, grace, kindness, faithfulness, and loyalty. The context—not the lexicon—must determine which English term is selected for translation.</p>
<p>The value of a thought-for-thought translation can be illustrated by comparing <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.10">1 Kings 2:10</a> in the King James Version, the New International Version, and the New Living Translation. “So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). “Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). “Then David died and was buried in the City of David” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Only the New Living Translation clearly translates the intended meaning of the Hebrew idiom “slept with his fathers” into contemporary English (from the introduction to the New Living Translation).</p>

<p class="h1">BINDING AND LOOSING*</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical concept much discussed and debated throughout Christian history. Jesus referred to binding and loosing on two different occasions. After Peter’s confession that Jesus was the Messiah, Jesus said to him: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">Mt 16:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Later, Jesus gave the same authority to bind and loose to all of the disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.18">18:18</a>).</p>
<p>Matthew is the only Gospel writer to record those specific words of Jesus. According to the Gospel of John, Jesus addressed similar but not identical words to the disciples after the resurrection: “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained” (<a href="?bref=John.20.23">Jn 20:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). A problem arises in identifying both the nature and the extent of the authority Jesus gave.</p>
<p>“Bind” and “loose” translate two Greek words, themselves translations of words in Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus. Among Jesus’ Jewish contemporaries, the two Aramaic words were often used as technical rabbinic terms. They referred to the verdict of a teacher of the Law who, on the basis of his authority as an expert in the interpretation of the Mosaic law, could declare some action “bound” (forbidden) or “loosed” (permitted). (Compare <a href="?bref=Matt.23.2-3">Mt 23:2-3</a>, where Jesus said: “The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses’ seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>.) Among the greatest Jewish rabbis, Shammai “bound” many actions that the more liberal teacher Hillel “loosed.”</p>
<p>Alongside that scribal use of the terms was their use in judicial contexts. They referred to the imposition or the removal of a ban or judgment. In that context the words meant “to condemn; imprison” and “to absolve; set free.” Both sets of meanings have been used to interpret the two texts in Matthew.</p>
<p>The precise meaning of the words in Matthew must be understood on the basis of their use in specific situations and in the light of the general NT understanding of apostolic authority. In <a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">Matthew 16:19</a> Peter’s authority to bind and loose is connected with his receiving “the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” In the Gospels the “kingdom of heaven” (that is, kingdom of God) is the sphere of God’s rule, the “community” of people whom he rules as Lord. In a figurative sense, Peter was entrusted with the keys to that kingdom, that “building.” (See <a href="?bref=1Cor.3.9,16-17">1 Cor 3:9, 16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.20-22">Eph 2:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4-5">1 Pt 2:4-5</a> for the idea of the people of God as his building.) The keys symbolize the authority entrusted to Peter as the one who confessed Jesus as Lord (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>), and as the one who represents all those disciples who utter the same confession.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Matt.23.13">Matthew 23:13</a>, the scribes were understood as guardians of the kingdom, since the knowledge of God had been entrusted to them (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.52">Lk 11:52</a>). But they did not fulfill their trust; they shut the doors of the kingdom. Therefore, their task was transferred to Peter, spokesman for the 12 disciples, who were representatives of a new Israel (see <a href="?bref=Matt.21.43">Mt 21:43</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">BIRDS</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Birds"/>
<p class="fl">Feathered vertebrates of the class Aves. Over 8,000 species of birds are known. Approximately 400 species are found in the Holy Land and about 40 are mentioned in Scripture.</p>
<p>Modern scientists classify organisms on the basis of internal and external structure, but the biblical writers generally classified organisms according to habitat. Thus, in the Bible, bats are listed with birds as creatures of the air (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.19">Lv 11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.18">Dt 14:18</a>).</p>
<p>Precise identification of biblical birds is often difficult or impossible. The biblical languages were not highly specialized scientific languages. People in biblical times generally knew the difference between similar animals now categorized as separate species. For birds, however, they frequently used poetic, descriptive terms. Biblical scholars attempt to overcome the difficulties in identification by comparing the Hebrew words with similar words in related languages and by attention to the habitat, habits, and characteristics attributed to the birds in Scripture. Nevertheless, different scholars sometimes arrive at different identifications.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalReferencestoBirds">Biblical References to Birds</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible refers to birds both in literal and figurative senses. The biblical writers were keen observers of nature, their awareness of birds and bird life being reflected in many passages. They asserted that God knows all the birds (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.11">Ps 50:11</a>) and cares for them (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.29">Mt 10:29</a>). They saw God’s covenant with Noah after the flood, his promise never to destroy life again by flood, as extending even to the birds and animals (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.10">Gn 9:10</a>).</p>
<p>The Mosaic law declared many birds “unclean,” mostly species that were scavengers or predators, or inhabited waste places. Centuries later the early Christians came to regard unclean species as clean by God’s decree, revealed in the apostle Peter’s vision (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.12">Acts 10:12</a>). Other birds, like quail, sustained the Israelites in their wanderings (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.13">Ex 16:13</a>). The Law prescribed birds as sacrifices for a firstborn child (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.24">Lk 2:24</a>), for a Nazirite vow (<a href="?bref=Num.6.10">Nm 6:10</a>), for cleansing a leper (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.22">Lv 14:22</a>), and as a burnt offering and sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.12.8">12:8</a>).</p>
<p>Birds are easily subject to extinction, especially through human activity. God required the Israelites to practice conservation to prevent any birds from becoming extinct in the Holy Land, both for the birds’ sake and so the Israelites would have a continuous source of food. The Law allowed foraging Israelites to take eggs or the young from a bird’s nest, but they were not permitted to kill both a mother bird and her young (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.6">Dt 22:6</a>).</p>
<p>Biblical writers turned to nature frequently for illustrations of divine principles or human characteristics. Comparisons of humans to birds sometimes carry a sense of lowness, as when King Nebuchadnezzar developed claws like a bird in his madness (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.33">Dn 4:33</a>), or when Job remarked that birds did not know the source of wisdom (<a href="?bref=Job.28.21">Jb 28:21</a>). In Jesus’ parable of the sower, the birds that ate the seed scattered by the wayside may represent indifference and a lack of spiritual understanding (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.4">Mt 13:4</a>).</p>
<p>Scripture also contains sympathetic images of the plight of birds. A lonely man praying was likened to a lonely bird on a housetop (<a href="?bref=Ps.102.7">Ps 102:7</a>). If someone was unjustly hunted by his enemies, he would understand a hunted bird’s plight (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.52">Lam 3:52</a>). Birds were said to be affected by curses on evildoers as they fled from Jerusalem or from the face of the earth (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.10">Jer 9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.3">Zep 1:3</a>).</p>
<p>In spite of such misfortune visited upon birds, Scripture affirms that, like other creatures, they are cared for and delighted in by God (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.11">Ps 50:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.26">Mt 6:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.29">10:29</a>). Both Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar were compared to a tree that gives shelter to the birds (<a href="?bref=Ezek.31.6">Ez 31:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.12">Dn 4:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.2.38">2:38</a>). Human power, however, fails eventually as when the tree representing Nebuchadnezzar was cut down, forcing the birds to flee (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.14">Dn 4:14</a>). God’s protection, by contrast, is unfailing. Jesus likened the kingdom of God to a mustard seed, growing to become a shelter for birds (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.32">Mt 13:32</a>). God provides a habitation for birds (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.12">Ps 104:12</a>), although Jesus, the Son of Man, had nowhere to rest his head (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.20">Mt 8:20</a>).</p>
<p>Birds were considered evidence of God’s handiwork (<a href="?bref=Job.12.7">Jb 12:7</a>). Bird lore provided examples of good sense in learning from a mistake (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.17">Prv 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.6.5">6:5</a>) and of bad judgment in failing to avoid the snares of immorality (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.23">7:23</a>). Birds and other creatures could be tamed, unlike the wicked human tongue (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.7">Jas 3:7</a>). Birds flying without alighting were an image of an undeserved curse (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.2">Prv 26:2</a>). Without trust in God, people might be forced by evil to flee like a bird to the mountains (<a href="?bref=Ps.11.1">Ps 11:1</a>). Birdsong was said to bring joy (<a href="?bref=Song.2.12">Sg 2:12</a>). The return of God’s people to the Promised Land would be like birds returning (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.11">Hos 11:11</a>). Jesus expressed his love for Jerusalem by saying that he longed to gather his people to himself as a hen gathers her brood under her wing (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.37">Mt 23:37</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, birds were occasionally regarded as ominous signs. For example, Pharaoh’s baker learned of impending death because in a dream birds ate the food from a basket on his head (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.17">Gn 40:17</a>). Solomon warned against cursing the king, even in private, because “a little bird may tell them what you said” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.10.20">Eccl 10:20</a>). A vivid biblical image is that of scavenging, carrion-eating birds consuming the bodies of evildoers. To the Israelites, such a desecration of humanity was an image of ultimate horror (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.26">Dt 28:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.44">1 Sm 17:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.11">Is 46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.33">Jer 7:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.9">12:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.29.5">Ez 29:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.4">39:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.17,21">Rv 19:17, 21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IndividualSpecies">Individual Species</p>
<p class="h3" id="Bittern">Bittern</p>
<p class="fl">Long-legged wading bird <span class="ital">(Botaurus stellaris)</span> similar to the heron, but with shorter legs and a smaller, more compact body. Bitterns inhabit marshes, where it is easy for them to hide with their natural camouflage. A bittern’s mottled plumage of barred brown and black so duplicates the color and shape of swamp vegetation that at times the bird seems to disappear before the observer’s eyes. The neck is covered with long, soft feathers, making it appear disproportionately heavy. Bitterns are wary and solitary. During mating season the bittern’s larynx is modified to produce a mysterious-sounding cry. The body twists in an unusual manner in harmony with the notes. Bitterns nest alone in grassy marshes. Because they are shy, they have become symbols of places of desolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>There is some question as to whether the bittern is actually mentioned in the Bible. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> has “bittern” in three places (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.23">Is 14:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">34:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.14">Zep 2:14</a>). Many biblical scholars believe the Hebrew word in those verses refers not to the bittern but to the hedgehog (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.23">Is 14:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.14">Zep 2:14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) or porcupine (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Is 34:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Hebrew word is similar to an Arabic word meaning “porcupine.” Other scholars point out that the references suggest a bird rather than a mammal, especially <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.14">Zephaniah 2:14</a>, which speaks of the creature making its “lodge in her capitals” (i.e., above Nineveh’s doorposts). Bitterns are particularly abundant in the swamps of the Tigris River (near Nineveh). The bittern’s characteristics may fit the references in the three passages better than do the hedgehog’s.</p>

<p class="h3" id="Buzzard">Buzzard</p>
<p class="fl">Hawklike soaring bird <span class="ital">(Buteo vulgaris</span> or <span class="ital">Buteo ferox).</span> It resembles the kite, though its tail is straight and not cleft. It is mentioned in the list of unclean birds (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.13">Dt 14:13</a>). But other translations render the word as “glede” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) or “kite” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">neb</span>). The parallel list in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">Leviticus 11</a>, however, substitutes “kite” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">neb</span>) or “vulture” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) for “buzzard.” Thus, it is difficult to determine whether the buzzard is actually mentioned in the Bible, even though it is a common resident of Israel.</p>
<p>Like other great soaring birds, the buzzard is noted for its sharp eyesight, and may be the bird mentioned for that quality in <a href="?bref=Job.28.7">Job 28:7</a> (variously translated “falcon,” “eagle,” or “vulture”). It will trail its prey for hours, and has a remarkable ability to see a carcass on which it descends to feed. Somewhat larger than the common buzzard is the long-legged buzzard, found in Israel, western Asia, and Syria.</p>

<p class="h3" id="Cormorant">Cormorant</p>
<p class="fl">Large, black gooselike bird <span class="ital">(Phalacrocorax carbo),</span> repeatedly depicted in art from Egypt and the Holy Land. Its length varies from 19 to 40 inches (48.3 to 101.6 centimeters). Its feet have webs between all four toes. The feet, attached far back on the body, serve as propellers when the cormorant dives to catch its meal of fish, crustacea, or amphibia. The long bill is curved at the tip, and under the bill is a sac in which the cormorant keeps the captured fish.</p>
<p>Cormorants live in large companies, making nests of sticks and other vegetation that they carry to trees or to rocky shelves near coasts. Up to four eggs are incubated, and the young are fed by both parents.</p>
<p>The cormorant frequents swamps around the Sea of Galilee, Lake Huleh (the waters of Merom), and the Mediterranean coast. Its Hebrew name originally denoted the “hurling down” of the bird at its prey. Cormorants dive into deep water and sometimes seem to zoom beneath the surface in their hunt for fish. The cormorant’s greed is proverbial. It was ceremonially unclean for the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.17">Lv 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.17">Dt 14:17</a>).</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Pelican">Pelican (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Crane">Crane</p>
<p class="fl">Tall wading birds <span class="ital">(Grus grus)</span> resembling storks and herons but with shorter talons. The plumage has a silvery gloss and the tail feathers are wavy. Large flocks of cranes flying in wedge-shaped formations pass over the Holy Land during the daylight hours each fall on their way to Africa from the northern countries of Europe and again in the spring when they return north to breed. Migratory flocks may number as many as 2,000 birds. <a href="?bref=Jer.8.7">Jeremiah 8:7</a> refers to the crane’s migratory habits.</p>
<p>The usual call of the crane is best described as a bellow, but during migratory flight they emit a chattering sound that may be referred to in <a href="?bref=Isa.38.14">Isaiah 38:14</a>. Cranes have remarkably powerful voices, their calls seeming to carry for miles. Migrating flocks usually have a flock leader who does the calling.</p>
<p>A crane’s height may reach 40 to 60 inches (101.6 to 152.4 centimeters). Except for the ostrich, the crane is the tallest bird ever to inhabit the Holy Land. A crane’s wingspread may exceed 90 inches (228.6 centimeters). The overall color is steel gray; the head and neck are black with a longitudinal white stripe. The crane feeds on land rather than in shallow water. It feeds primarily on grass and grain yet may devour insects, snakes, small alligators, frogs, and worms, using its long, powerful bill as a sharp hammer for killing such creatures.</p>
<p>The crane usually nests in solitary places, often in shallow water or nearby. Its nest is a mass of vegetation, holding two or three eggs that are light-colored with darker spots.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Cuckoo">Cuckoo</p>
<p class="fl">Small, drab brown bird known for its parasitic habits. The term the <span class="sc">kjv</span> used in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.16">Leviticus 11:16</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.14.15">Deuteronomy 14:15</a> may refer either to the common cuckoo <span class="ital">(Cuculus canorus)</span> or to the great spotted cuckoo <span class="ital">(Clamator glandarius).</span> The bird acts as a brood parasite, laying its eggs in the nest of another species after pushing out one of the eggs of the host species. The young cuckoo hatches before the young of the host species and evicts the other young. The foster parents raise it as their own.</p>
<p>The cuckoo, an insect eater, is considered ritually unclean in Scripture, which might imply that it is a predator or carrion-eater. For that reason some believe the Hebrew word actually refers to the seagull or sea mew rather than the cuckoo. Gulls, terns, and petrels are all common on the seashore and lakes of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Other scholars believe that the Hebrew word refers not to the cuckoo but to one of the owls, possibly the long-eared owl.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Owl">Owl</a>; <a href="#Seagull">Seagull (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Eagle">Eagle</p>
<p class="fl">Large bird of prey, genus <span class="ital">Aquila.</span> Vultures were often confused with eagles, making identification of the biblical birds difficult. Eagles’ heads are not bald as are the heads of vultures, but from a distance they appear similar. It is possible that the Hebrew word translated “eagle” (which literally means “to tear with the beak”) may have referred to all large birds of prey, eagles and vultures alike. A number of references to the eagle in Scripture are actually references to the griffon vulture (e.g., <a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>; perhaps <a href="?bref=Matt.24.28">Mt 24:28</a>). In certain passages, however, the true eagle may be meant.</p>
<p>The Holy Land has several varieties of eagle, including the imperial eagle <span class="ital">(Aquila heliaca)</span> and the less common golden eagle <span class="ital">(Aquila chrysaetos).</span> These birds are powerfully built with strong wings; their movements reveal suppleness and strength. A distinctive hooked beak, which enhances the eagle’s dignified and somewhat ferocious appearance, provides it with an effective instrument for tearing and killing prey. Short, powerful legs and prehensile claws enable an eagle to apply an almost unbreakable grip on a struggling victim. The strong talons have sharp points and edges. The eagle hunts by day.</p>
<p>For Jeremiah and other prophets, the eagle was the epitome of swiftness. The golden eagle, which can fly three or four miles (5–7 kilometers) in ten minutes, may have evoked the comparisons in <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.23">2 Samuel 1:23</a>;<a href="?bref=Jer.4.13">Jeremiah 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.22">49:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.19">Lamentations 4:19</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), and <a href="?bref=Hab.1.8">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. Moses used a similar comparison to emphasize the sudden striking power of a hostile enemy (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.49">Dt 28:49</a>). The author of Proverbs, observing the high altitude to which the eagle soars, applied that image to the human situation (<a href="?bref=Pr.23.4-5">Prv 23:4-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.12.14">Rv 12:14</a>).</p>
<p>The eagle’s strength and invincibility were mentioned often with reference to powerful nations attacking Israel. The prophet Ezekiel described Nebuchadnezzar as an eagle (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.3">Ez 17:3</a>). Both the Babylonians and Assyrians frequently depicted the eagle in their art, especially as a deity with a man’s body and an eagle’s head. Nebuchadnezzar even had an experience of temporary insanity in which “his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers, and his nails were like birds’ claws” (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.33">Dn 4:33</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The eagle builds its nest on inaccessible mountain peaks or at the top of the tallest trees, a fact noted by Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.49.16">Jer 49:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Job.39.27-28">Jb 39:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.4">Ob 1:4</a>). The brood consists of two or occasionally three eggs. Only the female sits on the nest, but the young eaglets are fed by both parents. Eagles are devoted to their offspring and train them with great care in the art of flying. Some commentators interpret <a href="?bref=Exod.19.4">Exodus 19:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.32.11">Deuteronomy 32:11</a> as evidence of the eagle’s practice of catching its young on its wings. There is virtually no evidence from observation, however, that any eagle can perform such a feat. In some versions the wording avoids a direct statement that eagles bear their young on their wings.</p>
<p>Some eagles in captivity have lived to an age of over 100 years. This remarkable longevity caused the psalmist to speak of the eagle whose youth is renewed (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.5">Ps 103:5</a>). Confronted by its impressive qualities, biblical authors observed the eagle with awe and wonder (<a href="?bref=Job.39.27-30">Jb 39:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.18-19">Prv 30:18-19</a>). Those awesome qualities also contributed to several prophetic visions, including Ezekiel’s vision of a creature with an eagle’s face (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.10">Ez 1:10</a>) and the apostle John’s vision of a holy beast like a flying eagle (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.7">Rv 4:7</a>).</p>

<p class="h3" id="FowlDomestic">Fowl, Domestic</p>
<p class="fl">Domesticated poultry <span class="ital">(Gallus gallus domesticus),</span> probably derived from the red jungle fowl of India. They seem to have been known already in OT times (<a href="?bref=Pr.30.31">Prv 30:31</a>). A seal of Jaazaniah (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.23">2 Kgs 25:23</a>), dating from about 600 <span class="era">BC</span>, bears the image of a fighting cock. A reference to fowls or poultry for Nehemiah’s table, however, may be to wild game rather than domestic fowl (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.18">Neh 5:18</a>).</p>
<p>Poultry symbolized fertility, and the Jews carried a cock and hen in front of bridal couples at weddings. The motherly concern of hens gathering their broods was familiar to Jesus’ hearers (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.37">Mt 23:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.34">Lk 13:34</a>).</p>
<p>Since roosters habitually crow an hour or two before dawn, the third watch of the night, from midnight to 3:00 <span class="sc">am</span>, was known as the cockcrow. According to the Talmud (a commentary on Jewish law), keeping chickens was prohibited in Jerusalem in NT times to prevent the insects and larvae that breed in chicken droppings from contaminating sacrificial flesh. For that reason the cock that Peter heard (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.34,74">Mt 26:34, 74</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.34,60-61">Lk 22:34, 60-61</a>) probably belonged to Romans living there or to Jews who did not follow Jewish regulations.</p>
<p class="h3" id="GoatsuckerorNightHawk">Goatsucker or Night Hawk</p>
<p class="fl">Migratory bird, dark in color and short-legged, similar to the American whippoorwill. The goatsucker (genus <span class="ital">Caprimulgus</span>) resembles an owl with a flat head, large eyes, soft plumage, and a noiseless flight. It hunts insects at night, catches them on the wing, and during the day rests on branches. Goatsuckers were so named because they were thought by the ancients to milk goats. According to <a href="?bref=Lev.11.16">Leviticus 11:16</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.14.15">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>, they were ritually unclean. Although some scholars believe that an owl is intended, there seems to be good reason to accept the “night hawk” translation.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Goose">Goose</p>
<p class="fl">Long-necked, web-footed water birds with waterproof feathers (genus <span class="ital">Anser</span>). Domestic geese were known to the Greeks of Homer’s day, since they are mentioned in the <span class="ital">Odyssey.</span> They were domesticated in Egypt perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom (c. 2500 <span class="era">BC</span>) and certainly by the time of the New Kingdom (c. 1500– 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>). They were used for food and sacrifice. The breeding of geese was widespread in Canaan in biblical times; ivory carvings of the 13th or 12th century <span class="era">BC</span> showing geese have been found in excavations at Megiddo in Israel.</p>
<p>Many species of geese spend most of their lives on land even though they are waterfowl; some even build their nests in trees. Wild geese tend to inhabit flatlands and prairies rather than mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>Geese may have graced the table of King Solomon. In <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.23">1 Kings 4:23</a> they are referred to as “fatted fowl,” a term that may also refer to ducks, swans, guineas, pigeons, or other domestic edible birds.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Hawk">Hawk</p>
<p class="fl">Small birds of prey found in the Holy Land. Most references are probably to the sparrow hawk <span class="ital">(Accipter nisus).</span> This bird is slightly larger than the kestrel, has a grayish-brown back and a white belly with black and brown bars. It has short feathers, long, curved talons, and broad wings, rounded at the outer ends, which enable it to soar on updrafts. The long tail, acting as a rudder, helps the bird change its course swiftly in flight. It is hence very maneuverable in the air when chasing warblers or other small birds. It does not seize its prey on the ground, as does the kestrel, but hunts and attacks small birds in flight. Hawks hunt in the daytime, unlike owls that are adapted for nighttime hunting. With their eyes located on the side of the head, hawks are very keen-sighted. They usually nest in tall trees and their nests are often occupied by the same pair year after year.</p>
<p>The Egyptians embalmed sparrow hawks and regarded all hawks highly. The god Horus was depicted with the head of a hawk hawk was ceremonially unclean to the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.16">Lv 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.15">Dt 14:15</a>). It was not a permanent resident of Israel but stopped off as it migrated from north to south. Its southward migration is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Job.39.26">Job 39:26</a>. A reference in <a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Isaiah 34:11</a> to “hawk” (“cormorant,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>) is uncertain. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="#KestrelorFalcon">Kestrel or Falcon</a>; <a href="#KiteorGlede">Kite (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Heron">Heron</p>
<p class="fl">Wading bird (genus <span class="ital">Ardea</span>) with a long, thin neck and long legs. It has a characteristic comblike growth on the inner side of the third toe.</p>
<p>Herons are generally white, blue, green, or gray. They nest together in rookeries, and both parents bring in food for the young. Herons feed on fish, small reptiles, and insects, gulping them down in one swallow. Adults and young migrate in the late fall to warm southern climates. The white heron attains a length of more than 3 feet (.9 meter), whereas the dwarf heron is only about 22 inches (55.9 centimeters) long.</p>
<p>At least seven varieties of heron are reported in the Holy Land. The white ibis, or buff-backed heron (<span class="ital">Buphus russatus</span>), was probably the most common species. The purple heron <span class="ital">(Ardea purpureus)</span> is a summer breeder found in all parts of the Holy Land where there is standing water.</p>
<p>The blue-gray heron (<span class="ital">Ardea cinerea</span>) winters in southern Europe and North Africa, migrating to northern Europe in the early spring. In Israel it builds its winter nest near water, in swamps and along riverbanks, where it feeds on fish and frogs. It will stand patiently in the water for hours, and then suddenly its long, pointed beak darts down with lightning speed to catch its prey. Often the blue-gray heron builds its nest in a tall tree to which it may return year after year.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Lev.11.19">Leviticus 11:19</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.14.18">Deuteronomy 14:18</a>, the heron was ceremonially unclean to the Israelites. Some scholars believe those references are to the cormorant, but most scholars think they refer to one of the herons.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Cormorant">Cormorant (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Hoopoe">Hoopoe</p>
<p class="fl">One of the Holy Land’s most beautiful birds (<span class="ital">Upupa epops</span>). It has vividly colored plumage, a lovely crown-shaped crest that becomes erect when the bird is alarmed, and a long, slender curved bill. The pinkish-brown hoopoe is about 11 inches (27.9 centimeters) long, with black and white bands on its back, tail, and wings. Hoopoes are basically desert-dwelling birds.</p>
<p>The name “hoopoe” is derived from the sound of the bird’s call. To emit the sound, the neck feathers are puffed up and the head snapped in the air. When on the ground, the bird hammers its beak into the earth.</p>
<p>The hoopoe arrives in the Holy Land in February, breeds in the summer, and leaves in September. It was held in religious reverence by the Egyptians. It was listed as ritually unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.19">Lv 11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.18">Dt 14:18</a>), probably because it searches for grubs and small insects in such unsanitary places as dunghills.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Ibis">Ibis</p>
<p class="fl">Wading bird (<span class="ital">Threskiornis aethiopica</span>) presently unknown in the Holy Land but possibly known there in biblical times. It was well known in ancient Egypt, where it was sacred to the god Thoth. Today it has practically vanished with the disappearance of swamps along the Nile.</p>
<p>There is some question as to whether the ibis is meant in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.17">Leviticus 11:17</a>, where it is classified as ceremonially unclean. The same Hebrew word in <a href="?bref=Deut.14.16">Deuteronomy 14:16</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Isaiah 34:11</a> is translated “great owl,” a translation preferred by most scholars.</p>

<p class="h3" id="KestrelorFalcon">Kestrel or Falcon</p>
<p class="fl">Small hawk (<span class="ital">Falco tinnunculus</span>) about a foot (30.5 centimeters) long with brown, black, and yellow feathers on its breast. It was abundant in the Holy Land in villages and in the countryside, nesting on rooftops and among rocks. Like most hawks, the kestrel is able to hover and float in midair and then swoop down on its prey, seizing it with sharp, hooklike talons. It feeds largely on mice, small reptiles, and insects.</p>
<p>Embalmed kestrels have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs. The Egyptians also embalmed the hunting kestrel <span class="ital">(Falco cherug),</span> which can be tamed and trained to hunt rabbits and other small game. Falconry (hunting with hawks of various species) was well known among the ancients and is still practiced today. That the Assyrians were familiar with falconry is seen in the records of Ashurbanipal. Because the kestrel is a predator, it was ceremonially unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.14">Lv 11:14</a>). Some translations render the word as “kite” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.14">Lv 11:14</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.13">Dt 14:13</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), an illustration of the difficulty of identifying biblical birds precisely.</p>

<p class="h3" id="KiteorGlede">Kite or Glede</p>
<p class="fl">Large bird of prey <span class="ital">(Milvus milvus).</span> The average length of the kite is about 19 inches (48.3 centimeters). The upper part is generally dark, but the belly is white. Kites nest high in trees and build nests of vegetation, including sticks. They rarely have more than two or three young, which they feed on snakes, grasshoppers, and so on. Sometimes kites are called snake hawks.</p>
<p>The kite is a migratory bird that stays in Israel during the summer, especially in the mountains of southern Judea, in the trackless wastes west of the Dead Sea, and in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>
<p>The red kite or glede is a medium-sized bird of prey. The edges of the upper part of the bill overlap with the lower one, forming sharp scissors. The tail is forked or cleft like that of a fish. Its loud cry often includes sharp whistling notes. Other Holy Land species include the black kite <span class="ital">(Milvus migrans)</span> and the black-winged kite <span class="ital">(Elanus caeruleus).</span></p>
<p>The kite is listed among the unclean birds in Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.14">Lv 11:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.13">Dt 14:13</a>), but the precise identification of the birds mentioned there is disputed by some scholars and translators.</p>

<p class="h3" id="Lammergeier">Lammergeier</p>
<p class="fl">Largest of the vultures and less common than the other members of the family. It is grayish brown with white streaks and has a black tuft of stiff hairs in the facial area that gives it the name “bearded vulture.” Another name for it is “lamb vulture.”</p>
<p>The lammergeier <span class="ital">(Gypaetus barbatus)</span> has a unique way of killing its prey; since its beak is not particularly powerful it carries its victim high in the air and then drops it on rocks.</p>
<p>The lammergeier is especially partial to tortoises and to marrow bone. After jackals and smaller vultures have reduced a carcass to bone, the lammergeier crushes the bones to obtain the marrow, or swallows the pieces intact. Hence it is also known as the ossifrage, from a Latin word meaning “bone crusher.” The lammergeier was unclean in Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.13">Lv 11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.13">Dt 14:13</a>; both translated “vulture” in <span class="sc">nlt</span> and “ossifrage” in <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>

<p class="h3" id="Ostrich">Ostrich</p>
<p class="fl">Two-toed, swift-running, flightless bird (<span class="ital">Struthio camelus</span>) that lives in deserts or in areas covered with stunted bushes.</p>
<p>In biblical times ostriches ranged as far north as Syria and were found over the entire wasteland of the Negev Desert, but they have since become extinct there. Its Hebrew name means “daughter of the desert.” It is the largest of all living birds, attaining a height of about 10 feet (3 meters) and a weight of 175 pounds (79.5 kilograms), though some males may weigh as much as 300 pounds (136.4 kilograms). The female is considerably smaller. Powerful thighs and long legs give the ostrich great speed, reported to be as high as 40 <span class="sc">mph</span> (64 <span class="sc">kph</span>).</p>
<p>The ostrich is omnivorous. It eats grass, fruits, small mammals, birds, snakes, and lizards, as well as large pebbles that assist in the breakdown of food in its gizzard. The ostrich is hunted, but its eggs are generally more sought after than the bird itself. The empty shells are traded throughout the Mediterranean area for use as utensils, or when broken up as raw material for beads. The eggs—as many as 25 in one clutch—are laid in a shallow nest of sand, with some left uncovered. They may appear to be neglected by day, but only because they are ordinarily incubated at night. The cock does most of the incubating; the female participates only during cold days. The strong, thick eggshell protects the embryo from the heat of the desert.</p>
<p>Occasionally the ostrich is used for riding or even for pulling small carts. Ostrich feathers are in great demand. Ostrich plumes graced ancient royal courts as fans. An ivory-handled fan of Pharaoh Tutankhamen (King Tut) had lovely ostrich plumes. The plumes are white in the male and brownish gray in the female. The reputation of the ostrich for stupidity comes from its behavior when hunted and cornered; it fails to take evasive action even when doing so would save it. In open country, however, it is very wary and runs at great speed to escape. In contrast to the partridge, an ostrich will run away from its eggs and chicks when pursued.</p>
<p>Most biblical references to ostriches emphasize their negative characteristics. They were regarded as unclean in Jewish law (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.16">Lv 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.15">Dt 14:15</a>). Several references associate ostriches with images of wilderness and desolation (<a href="?bref=Job.30.29">Jb 30:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.13.21">Is 13:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.13">34:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.20">43:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.50.39">Jer 50:39</a>). Their night cry, which has been compared to an ox’s lowing in pain, is referred to in <a href="?bref=Mic.1.8">Micah 1:8</a>. Biblical writers also noted the apparent indifference of the ostrich to its brood (<a href="?bref=Job.39.13-18">Jb 39:13-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.3">Lam 4:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h3" id="Owl">Owl</p>
<p class="fl">Nocturnal birds (order Strigiformes) with large heads and large, forward-looking eyes. Their wing and tail feathers are soft as velvet, helping to make their flight noiseless. The owl’s body is small and slender, about the size of a pigeon, but it appears bulky because of the thick covering of feathers. Owls have been considered bearers of misfortune and omens of disaster. In the Near East, owls now live in temple ruins and pyramids in Egypt, and in rock-hewn graves, ruins, and caves on both sides of the Jordan River in Israel. They seldom come near inhabited dwellings.</p>
<p>Owls have excellent night vision, which they use to capture rodents or other animals. Although unusually large, the owl’s eyes are almost useless in the daylight because the light dazzles them. The owl is able to swallow its prey whole because of its elastic esophagus. Indigestible hair and bones are regurgitated as pellets. The bill is short but sharply hooked.</p>
<p>Owls may lay up to ten eggs. The young are cared for on the nest by both parents. Both adults and young tend to remain in the area in which they were hatched. Eight species of owls are found in the Holy Land, of which five are plentiful. It is difficult, however, to identify a particular species with any of the four Hebrew words translated “owl” in Scripture. A fifth word translated “owl” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) is more appropriately identified with the ostrich (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Owls appear in the lists of unclean birds (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.17">Lv 11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.16">Dt 14:16</a>), and although translations differ, they concur that all species of owls, being predators, are unclean.</p>

<p class="h3" id="OwlBarnorWhite">Owl, Barn or White</p>
<p class="fl">Large owl <span class="ital">(Tyto alloa)</span> with a distinct heart-shaped face. It may get its Hebrew name from a snoring sound it makes when breathing in the nest. In flight it emits a frightening screech, and thus is sometimes referred to as the screech owl. Its somewhat sinister features—a large head and wide pop eyes—have led some people to consider it demonic, but they have also inspired another name, the monkey-faced owl. It is a useful bird, however, devouring rodents that raid fields and damage stored grain. Like other owls, it sleeps during the day and hunts at night with a well-developed sense of hearing and sight. Its color is light brownish yellow with a white mask around the eyes and cheeks. The whole leg is covered with feathers that protect it against the bites of struggling victims in its talons.</p>
<p>Some modern translations mention the barn or white owl by name (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.17">Lv 11:17</a>, <span class="sc">njb</span>; <a href="?bref=Lev.11.18">11:18</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.16">Dt 14:16</a>, <span class="sc">njb</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>).</p>

<p class="h3" id="OwlGreat">Owl, Great</p>
<p class="fl">Large owl, standing nearly two feet (60.9 centimeters) tall <span class="ital">(Asio otus).</span> The color is mouse gray with gray-brown spots and black stripes. As one of its names indicates, it has tufted “ears” and is sometimes called the great horned owl. It feeds on rodents, such as rats and mice. It winters in Israel among ruins and in groves.</p>
<p>The great owl may be the owl mentioned in the Bible among the birds of desolation that will inhabit devastated Edom (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Is 34:11</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span> mg). It is also mentioned by name in some translations of the lists of ritually unclean birds (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.17">Lv 11:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.16">Dt 14:16</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h3" id="OwlLittle">Owl, Little</p>
<p class="fl">Smallest of all nocturnal birds of prey. Chiefly insectivorous, the little owl <span class="ital">(Athene noctua glaux)</span> also feeds at times on tiny birds. It is the most common owl in the Holy Land, dwelling among ruins, tombstones, rocks, and thickets (perhaps the owl of <a href="?bref=Ps.102.6">Ps 102:6</a>). Its voice sounds like that of a dying person. On occasion it may be observed perched on a rock with its large eyes gazing off into the distance, a pose that the ancients considered a sign of wisdom. The Greeks associated the little owl with the goddess Athena. It is mentioned by name in several translations (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.17">Lv 11:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.16">Dt 14:16</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Owl">Owl (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="OwlScops">Owl, Scops</p>
<p class="fl">Small owl <span class="ital">(Otus scops)</span> distinguished by two horn-shaped crests of hairlike feathers on its head. It perches in an inclined posture and hops and dances like a goat. During the hatching period, the male’s hooting sounds like a moan. The scops owl feeds on insects, rodents, and birds. During invasions of mice or locusts, these owls have appeared in large flocks and helped to destroy the pests. They have been known to attack humans who intrude on their nests. They are well-known inhabitants of Eurasia and Africa.</p>
<p>Some scholars suggest that the scops is the true screech owl, because of its whistling calls that resound through the night. The screech owl is mentioned only once in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.14">Is 34:14</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), but that translation is the subject of scholarly debate. Following traditional Jewish mythology, some translations use the Hebrew word <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">lilith</span><span class="ital">)</span> as a proper name. In Jewish tradition Lilith was a witch-demon who, before Eve’s creation, was Adam’s wife. She became the mother of demons and was thought to attack children during the night; thus the name “Lilith” is translated “night hag” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) or “night monster” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>). Most scholars favoring the mythical interpretation, however, suggest that Isaiah was using a popular legend to evoke a sense of desolation and did not himself believe in the existence of Lilith. There is little support for “screech owl” as an appropriate translation of the name.</p>

<p class="h3" id="Partridge">Partridge</p>
<p class="fl">Most common game bird in the Holy Land. The partridge resembles a chicken in its basic anatomy but has a less chunky body and a longer tail. Two species of partridge inhabit the Holy Land: the sand partridge <span class="ital">(Ammoperdix heyi),</span> found near the Dead Sea, in the Jordan River valley, and in the Sinai Desert; and the chukar partridge <span class="ital">(Alectoris graeca).</span> The sand partridge is a medium-sized bird with yellow feet. The male has sandy-buff plumage, upper tail feathers penciled and barred with brown, and a chestnut and white undersurface. The female is a grayish buff. The chukar partridge resembles the common French partridge of Europe, having a body about 16 inches (40.6 centimeters) long. It is covered with beautiful and radiantly colored feathers.</p>
<p>The biblical reference (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.20">1 Sm 26:20</a>; probably the sand partridge because of the geographical context) alludes to the common method of catching it by chasing. It was also hunted with snares (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.91.3">Ps 91:3</a>) or by hunters hiding in a blind. The fast-running partridge soon becomes exhausted, which enables hunters to run it to the ground and kill it. Nevertheless, by running and jumping, it can ascend very steep cliffs. The bird finds refuge among bushes into which its brownish-green feathers blend protectively. If it were not such a prolific breeder, it would probably have become extinct by being hunted for food.</p>
<p>The biblical description of the partridge gathering a brood she did not hatch (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.11">Jer 17:11</a>) seems to be based on the fact that the hen lays at least two clutches of eggs, one for herself and one for the cock to incubate.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Partridge"/>
<p class="h3" id="Peacock">Peacock</p>
<p class="fl">Member of the quail, partridge, and pheasant family, the peacock <span class="ital">(Pavo cristatus)</span> is actually the male peafowl. Its mate is properly known as the peahen. The male attracts attention because of a stately, luxurious appearance enhanced by magnificent feathers. The breast is a brilliant metallic blue, and each tail feather has a brilliant eye near the tip. When lowered, the unusually long tail feathers form a train behind the peacock on the ground, giving it an overall length of up to six feet (1.8 meters). The train can also be raised to form a huge fan adorned with the multicolored eyes. During courtship the feathers are raised and vibrated to make a distinct rustling noise. The rather drab peahen lacks the long train.</p>
<p>Because it is not native to the Holy Land, the peacocks referred to in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.22">1 Kings 10:22</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.21">2 Chronicles 9:21</a> are thought by some scholars to be Old World monkeys or baboons brought from east Africa, or guinea hens from the upper Nile River region. There is evidence, however, that the Phoenicians introduced peacocks to the Egyptian pharaoh, perhaps as early as the time of King Solomon. It is possible that Solomon’s trade expeditions ranged as far as India, where the peacock is native. The peacock was also well known to the Greeks and Romans. Alexander the Great prized its beauty and forbade his soldiers to kill the bird.</p>
<p>In the early Christian church the peacock became a symbol of the immortality promised in the resurrection of Christ. In addition, the eyes of its tail came to represent the all-seeing eye of God.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Pelican">Pelican</p>
<p class="fl">Largest of all aquatic birds, considerably larger even than the swan. The pelican <span class="ital">(Pelecanus onocrotalus)</span> is generally about 50 inches (127 centimeters) long with a 16-inch (40.6-centimeters) beak, the upper part of which is hooked downward at the end, facilitating fish catching. The lower part of the bill supports a yellow pouch extending down the throat. The pouch may hold up to three gallons (11.4 liters) of food (small fish) and water. The pelican’s webbed feet are peculiar in having webs between all four toes. Pelicans are expert swimmers as well as efficient fliers. The pelican’s massive body, long neck, and comparatively small head give it proportions that make rising from the water difficult. To take off, a pelican must first flap awkwardly along the surface, pounding at the water with its legs.</p>
<p>Pelicans fly and nest in groups. Both sexes care for the young that hatch from the one to four eggs. Whereas most birds feed their young by placing food into their mouths, the pelican reverses the process; the young pelican sticks its head and most of its body into its mother’s throat and plucks partially digested food from the mother’s crop. The deep penetration of the young’s beak into the mother’s gullet led ancients to believe that the young were feeding on the blood of the mother’s breast, thus giving rise to wide usage of the pelican as a symbol of Christ’s atonement, and of charity in general.</p>
<p>The roseate pelican is white, at times with a faint rose tinge, and has black feathers growing from the wing joint farthest from the body. The legs, pouch, and skin around the eyes are yellow; the hook of the beak is red. This species may grow up to six feet (1.8 meters) long with a wingspread of up to eight feet (2.4 meters). During the breeding season, the coloration of the exposed areas of the roseate pelican’s legs and face changes from gray to bright orange or red. At the same time the white feathers acquire a beautiful pink tint originating from an oil-gland secretion. The oil is spread throughout the plumage by the bird as it preens.</p>
<p>Some scholars question whether “pelican” is an appropriate translation of the Hebrew in several verses, believing rather that the word refers to one of the owls, hawks, or vultures. Most translations include the pelican in the lists of ritually unclean birds (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.18">Lv 11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.17">Dt 14:17</a>). Opinion on the other references is more sharply divided. Some scholars maintain that the desert context of the verses eliminates the possibility of a water bird like the pelican (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.102.6">Ps 102:6</a>, “vulture,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Is 34:11</a>, “cormorant,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>; “hawk,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.14">Zep 2:14</a>, “cormorant,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>; “vulture,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>). On the other hand, the roseate pelican frequents the rivers, lakes, and marshes of the Holy Land. After flying out to sea as far as 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) to swoop down on fish near the surface, the pelican often returns inland to a deserted place to digest its enormous meal. Thus, the pelican may be the lonely wilderness bird of those passages.</p>
<p class="h3" id="PigeonorDove">Pigeon or Dove</p>
<p class="fl">Species of the pigeon family (Columbidae). In common usage the names “pigeon” and “dove” are virtually interchangeable. The common domestic pigeon familiar to city dwellers the world over, for example, is actually a descendant of the wild rock dove. Both names are used in English translations of the Bible to translate the same Hebrew word. A second Hebrew word is usually translated “turtledove.” Nevertheless, it seems clear that the ancient Hebrews recognized differences among dove species.</p>
<p>At least six species of pigeon or dove reside in modern Israel: the rock, ring, and stock doves (genus <span class="ital">Columba</span>), and the turtle, collared, and palm doves (genus <span class="ital">Streptopelia</span>). Of the six, the rock dove <span class="ital">(Columba livia)</span> and the turtledove <span class="ital">(Streptopelia turtur)</span> seem to be the two most often referred to in Scripture.</p>
<p>Pigeons vary in size from 6 to over 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters). The most colorful Israeli species is the rock dove, which can be a beautiful silvery gray with grayish-green iridescent plumage on the wings (noted by David, <a href="?bref=Ps.68.13">Ps 68:13</a>). The smaller doves <span class="ital">(Streptopelia)</span> are less colorful, mostly gray or buff with a blackish or checkered half collar on the back of the neck. Pigeons have short necks and small heads, plump bodies, and short wings controlled by strong muscles that enable them to fly considerable distances. The smaller doves have longer tails.</p>
<p>At present, the wild rock dove is found primarily in the area around the Sea of Galilee and farther to the south in the many ravines leading down to the Dead Sea. Wild rock doves prefer to build their nests on rocks and cliff faces, a fact precisely described in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Song.2.14">Sg 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.28">Jer 48:28</a>). All Israeli doves build fragile nests of scraps of vegetation. Eggs are hatched twice a year. Doves seldom lay more than two eggs. The young are cared for in the nest by both parents, who rove over the fields eating seeds and weeds. The adult’s crop contains digested food in a milky condition, called pigeon’s milk, which can be regurgitated and fed to the young.</p>
<p>During courtship there is a great deal of rivalry among the male doves. The turtledove’s courtship dance is an awesome aerial display. The attention to courtship, the joint care of young, and the solicitude of the parents for each other, noted from earliest times, have made the dove one of the most popular symbols of love and peace (<a href="?bref=Song.1.15">Sg 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.2.14">2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.5.2">5:2</a>).</p>
<p>A major distinction between pigeons (ring doves) and turtledoves seems to have been recognized by ancient writers. Pigeons are year-round residents and easily tamed, whereas turtledoves are migratory. Turtledoves were confined in cages singly or in pairs as pets or for sacrifices. Pigeons were probably the first birds to be domesticated, perhaps as early as Noah’s time (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.8-12">Gn 8:8-12</a>). They were depicted on the earliest Egyptian monuments, and their edibility was mentioned in early Egyptian texts. Before long, domestic pigeons were regarded as evidence of a household’s prosperity. In the more prosperous households they nested in dovecotes of molded pottery clay fashioned in latticelike structures (hence the “windows” of <a href="?bref=Isa.60.8">Is 60:8</a>).</p>
<p>In NT times there were many dovecotes in the parks around Herod the Great’s palace in Jerusalem. The dove’s popularity was due not only to its docility but also to its desirability as food and as an acceptable and relatively inexpensive sacrifice. The turtledove may have been regarded more highly as a sacrifice because of its wildness and consequent lesser availability. The two biblical references to turtledoves not in a sacrificial context refer to their migratory habits and to their arrival in Israel in the spring (<a href="?bref=Song.2.12">Sg 2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.7">Jer 8:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.11.11">Hos 11:11</a>).</p>
<p>Most of the references to doves and pigeons in the Bible are in statements about sacrificial procedures (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.7-10">Gn 15:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.1.14">Lv 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.5.7">5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.12.6">12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.10">Nm 6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.24">Lk 2:24</a>). Other references, however, include a range of observations and symbolic usages of the dove. Its throaty moaning was often observed (<a href="?bref=Isa.38.14">Is 38:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.11">59:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.16">Ez 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.2.7">Na 2:7</a>). Its power of flight was well known (<a href="?bref=Ps.55.6">Ps 55:6</a>), as were its beauty (<a href="?bref=Song.1.15">Sg 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.5.12">5:12</a>), its gentleness and loyalty to its mate (<a href="?bref=Song.2.14">Sg 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.5.2">5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.6.9">6:9</a>), its affection (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.19">Ps 74:19</a>), and its innocence (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.16">Mt 10:16</a>). The one negative reference to doves is in <a href="?bref=Hos.7.11">Hosea 7:11</a>, where they are said to be senseless and foolish, perhaps in reference to their overly trusting nature.</p>
<p>Of NT references, perhaps the most significant is the description of the Holy Spirit at Christ’s baptism as a descending dove (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.16">Mt 3:16</a>). The dove’s loving nature made it natural for early Christians to connect the dove image with the concept of the Comforter. Since then the dove has remained the most popular symbol of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class="h3" id="Quail">Quail</p>
<p class="fl">Short, stocky birds with bills and feet similar to those of chickens; hence they are adapted to eating seeds or insects. Quail <span class="ital">(Coturnix coturnix)</span> are the smallest of the subfamily of poultry that also includes pheasants and partridges. Quail (or “quails,” another plural form) are about ten inches (25.4 centimeters) long and have small, rounded wings. They burst from their hiding places in the grass or bushes with a whirring sound. The belly of the quail is white. Up to 18 eggs are laid, and if the mother dies, the male has been known to assume the care of the young. Quail of the Mediterranean region winter in the Sudan and migrate northward in vast flocks in the spring. Quail cannot maintain a long sustained flight but make use of wind currents to keep them aloft.</p>
<p>Enormous flocks of quail twice served as food for the Israelites in the wilderness of Sinai, when the birds were driven down in the desert miraculously by winds (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.13">Ex 16:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.31-32">Nm 11:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.40">Ps 105:40</a>). The second time they were probably flying along the Gulf of Aqaba and were blown off course by the east wind (<a href="?bref=Num.11.31">Nm 11:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.26-28">Ps 78:26-28</a>). Their inability to sustain long flight may account for their low flying level—two cubits, or about 40 inches (101.6 centimeters). When exhausted, they were easily caught by hand (<a href="?bref=Num.11.31-32">Nm 11:31-32</a>). Quail were considered clean and the most delicate eating of all game birds, and they were preserved by drying in the sun.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Raven">Raven</p>
<p class="fl">Member of the crow family (Corvidae). The Hebrew word for “raven” means “black one.” The raven (<span class="ital">Corvus corax</span>) weighs about three pounds (1.36 kilograms) and varies from 22 to 26 inches (56 to 66 centimeters) in length. Its tail is broader in the middle than at either end. Eight species are found in Israel: three ravens, two jackdaws, one crow, one rook, and one chough. The crow, about 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) long, is smaller than a raven, and its tail is uniform in width. The raven’s most conspicuous feature is its glossy black iridescent plumage.</p>
<p>Ravens and crows have survived in spite of the dislike many humans have for them. Excellent fliers, they migrate by day and congregate in great flocks of up to several hundred thousand. During the nesting season, they make nests of sticks in which two to seven eggs are laid. Ravens mate for life. Equipped with strong wings, a strong bill, and strong feet, ravens can live in isolated places from which they range widely for food. That it did not return to the ark was a good sign to Noah, indicating that the raven could find food and possibly a place to rest on dry mountaintops (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.7">Gn 8:7</a>).</p>
<p>The raven, essentially a scavenger, was ceremonially unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.15">Lv 11:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.14">Dt 14:14</a>). Yet ravens fed Elijah at God’s command (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.4-6">1 Kgs 17:4-6</a>). Job was told that God gave the raven its food (<a href="?bref=Job.38.41">Jb 38:41</a>), as the psalmist and Jesus repeated (<a href="?bref=Ps.147.9">Ps 147:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.24">Lk 12:24</a>). The raven’s glistening black plumage inspired the bride’s comparison of her beloved’s hair (<a href="?bref=Song.5.11">Sg 5:11</a>). They prefer desolate, uninhabited areas as their home territory (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.11">Is 34:11</a>). Ravens are crafty, active birds. Some are capable of speaking, solving puzzles, and performing feats of memory. Bold and curious, they sometimes use their talents for theft.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Seagull">Seagull</p>
<p class="fl">Robust seabirds, primarily scavengers (family Laridae). Several species of gulls live along the seacoast of the Holy Land. They are usually gray-backed with white heads and underparts and black wing tips. The slender bill ends in a downward curve.</p>
<p>Seagulls may be 8 to 30 inches (20 to 76 centimeters) long. Many species migrate, traveling long distances with their superb flying ability. Gulls can also swim easily because of their webbed feet. Their voice is like a harsh scream or squawk. In nesting season many nest together in any available place, such as a cliff or tree. Both male and female incubate and care for the young.</p>
<p>Because gulls will eat almost anything, they are listed as ritually unclean birds (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.16">Lv 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.15">Dt 14:15</a>, <span class="sc">asv</span> has “sea mew,” a common European gull). Some commentators believe that those passages refer to an owl or to the cuckoo and not to the seagull.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Cuckoo">Cuckoo (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Sparrow">Sparrow</p>
<p class="fl">Small bird of the finch family (Fringillidae) or the weaver finch family (Ploceidae), considered to be of little worth. The Hebrew word is a general term for “bird” and refers to any small bird such as a sparrow, finch, thrush, or starling. In translation, however, the word sometimes refers to the common English or house sparrow (<span class="ital">Passer domestica;</span> <a href="?bref=Ps.84.3">Ps 84:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.26.2">Prv 26:2</a>).</p>
<p>Dull in color with a black throat, the male house sparrow is a noisy and energetic creature. The nest, when built in open places, has an opening on the side and is made of almost anything available. Sparrows also nest in sheltered places, in dwellings, boxes, or holes in trees. They lay four to seven eggs.</p>
<p>The common or house sparrow was known in ancient Greece and Egypt. There it had a reputation for invading fields in large swarms and picking the seeds from them. It is a permanent resident of the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The sparrow is prolific and lives in close association with humans. It was considered ritually clean. Sparrows brought low prices in countries where they were sold (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.29">Mt 10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.6">Lk 12:6</a>). Today in Near Eastern marketplaces, boys offer live sparrows for sale. Tied together in groups of four to six by strings attached to one leg, the birds fly about over the boys’ heads. Evidently such a sight was common in NT times.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Stork">Stork</p>
<p class="fl">Long-legged, white wading bird (genus <span class="ital">Ciconia</span>) having large, powerful wings with glossy black primary and secondary feathers. The flapping of its wings produces a loud rushing sound. Connecting membranes between the toes prevent the bird from sinking into the mud. Its red bill is sharp and long, serving to seize and lift its prey out of the water. Storks are mute, lacking a voice box.</p>
<p>Flocks of storks pass through the Holy Land during their September migration on the way to central and southern Africa and likewise in the spring on their return flight to their homes in northern Israel, Syria, and Europe. Storks travel in vast flocks during the day, spreading out against the sky.</p>
<p>The stork’s faithful tending of the young is proverbial, as is its habit of returning annually to the same nesting place. Storks have the habit of adding to their nests each year, and it is possible to find nests that are 100 years old and have a height of more than three feet (.9 meter).</p>
<p>Two species of storks frequent the Holy Land. The white stork <span class="ital">(Ciconia alba)</span> is 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) tall, and its wingspread is six feet (1.8 meters), enabling it to move with a slow, sustained flight or to soar. In folklore the white stork is sometimes considered to be a harbinger of good fortune.</p>
<p>The black stork <span class="ital">(Ciconia nigra),</span> common around the Dead Sea valley, nests in trees; hence it may be the tree-dwelling species referred to in <a href="?bref=Ps.104.17">Psalm 104:17</a>. The Hebrew name for “stork” means literally the “kingly one,” or the “loyal one,” a reference to the care of the bird for its young. Like the heron, the stork was ceremonially unclean because of its diet of aquatic organisms, refuse, small animals, birds, and reptiles (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.19">Lv 11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.18">Dt 14:18</a>). Jeremiah mentioned the stork’s uncanny and instinctive knowledge of the time of its migration (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.7">Jer 8:7</a>). Its impressive wings figured in one of Zechariah’s visions (<a href="?bref=Zech.5.9">Zec 5:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h3" id="Swallow">Swallow</p>
<p class="fl">Small, nearly black, forked-tailed bird with long, tapering wings, noted for its graceful flight <span class="ital">(hirundo rustica).</span> The small, weak feet are poorly adapted for walking. Swallows resemble swifts in shape and life habits but are somewhat smaller.</p>
<p>The swallow’s large mouth enables it to catch insects while in flight. Colors vary from brown and blue to white. Swallows often nest in buildings, a feature noticed by the psalmist, who reported a swallow’s home at the temple (<a href="?bref=Ps.84.3">Ps 84:3</a>).</p>
<p>Swallows are basically resident in Israel, whereas the swift is a migratory bird noted for the regularity of its migratory schedule. The “swallow” of <a href="?bref=Isa.38.14">Isaiah 38:14</a> probably refers to a swift, as does <a href="?bref=Jer.8.7">Jeremiah 8:7</a>, where the dependability of the bird is contrasted with the irregularity of God’s people. <a href="?bref=Pr.26.2">Proverbs 26:2</a> may be a reference to either the swallow or the swift.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Swift">Swift (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Swan">Swan</p>
<p class="fl">Large, graceful water birds. Two species of swan (genus <span class="ital">Cygnus</span>) are found in the Middle East as passing migrants <span class="ital">(Cygnus olor</span> and <span class="ital">Cygnus musicus).</span> Swans are known as the best musicians among the birds and were considered sacred to the god Apollo by the Greeks. Their voices sound like flutes and harps.</p>
<p>The references in <a href="?bref=Lev.11.18">Leviticus 11:18</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.14.16">Deuteronomy 14:16</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) are probably not to the swan but to the water hen or the barn owl, since there seems little reason to declare the vegetarian swan an unclean animal. <span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Owl">Owl, Barn or White (above)</a>; <a href="#WaterHen">Water Hen (below)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Swift">Swift</p>
<p class="fl">Small, strong flyers (genus <span class="ital">Apus</span>). Like the swallow, the swift has long, bent wings and a cleft tail, enabling it to obtain great speed as it skims the ground and sweeps through the air. A swift devours a great many harmful insects, catching them in its mouth in flight. Many swifts make their nests in rooftops and in nooks and crannies of city walls. Their nests are built with strong feathers cemented together with saliva. Other swifts live in caves and clefts of rocks.</p>
<p>Common swifts are native to Israel, and in the Jordan Valley they occur in large flocks. <a href="?bref=Isa.38.14">Isaiah 38:14</a> (<span class="sc">niv</span>) seems to be clear reference to the swift’s plaintive call, since the swallow’s sharp chirp is not a striking simile for a distraught king’s cry. The swift has a soft, delicate voice, and its cry could be easily interpreted as melodious wailing.</p>
<p>The migratory swifts arrive on a precise schedule in the Holy Land in late winter, and immense flocks fill the cities with their cries. Thus the reference in <a href="?bref=Jer.8.7">Jeremiah 8:7</a> to swallows, which are largely permanent residents, is probably to swifts.</p>
<p><span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="#Swallow">Swallow (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="Vulture">Vulture</p>
<p class="fl">Subfamily (Aegypiinae) of the hawk family (Accipitridae). Each of the four species of Old World vultures is found in the Holy Land: the Egyptian, griffon, black, and bearded vulture (the bearded vulture is also known as the lammergeier). These birds range in size from the 24-inch (61-centimeters) Egyptian vulture to the huge bearded vulture, largest of all flying birds in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Most vultures are brown or black, having a short neck and a short, hooked bill with which they tear the dead animal flesh of which they are fond. All vultures, except the bearded, have bare or down-covered heads and necks, enabling these scavengers to penetrate deep into a carcass without spoiling the plumage. Excellent eyesight enables a vulture to locate a carcass from a lofty soaring position. Considering the decayed condition of most of its food, a vulture’s poor sense of smell may be a fortunate limitation. Vultures nest in any convenient place; both parents care for the young.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word usually translated “eagle” in the OT may have been a general term for all large birds of prey, including vultures. Thus many of the passages about eagles may refer to either the eagle or the vulture (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.11.13">Lv 11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.12">Dt 14:12</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span> mg). Such passages include references to nesting habits (<a href="?bref=Job.39.27-28">Jb 39:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.49.16">Jer 49:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.4">Ob 1:4</a>), care for fledglings (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.11">Dt 32:11</a>), powers of flight (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.4">Ex 19:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.49">Dt 28:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.9.26">Jb 9:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.19">Lam 4:19</a>), and extremely high soaring altitude (<a href="?bref=Pr.23.5">Prv 23:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.19">30:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.31">Is 40:31</a>). Despite variations among translations, the vulture clearly belongs in the list of unclean birds because of its foul diet (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.13,18">Lv 11:13, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.12,17">Dt 14:12, 17</a>).</p>
<p>Several references to the eagle in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> have been changed to “vulture” in modern translations. The change seems appropriate in the references to the vulture as a sign of present or impending doom (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.19">Lam 4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>). Likewise the eye-plucking bird of <a href="?bref=Pr.30.17">Proverbs 30:17</a> is probably a vulture. The phrase “bald as the eagle” (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.16">Mi 1:16</a>) clearly should read “bald as the vulture,” since there are no bald eagles in Israel and most vultures are bald. Since the vulture, like the eagle, was a symbol of sovereignty and domination in the ancient Near East, some gods were represented as vultures. Thus Ezekiel’s comparison of the kings of Babylon and Egypt to eagles may be conceived alternatively as comparisons to vultures (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.3,7">Ez 17:3, 7</a>). Jesus’ reference to the eagles congregating around corpses at the end times (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.28">Mt 24:28</a>) should also be revised to vultures, since eagles are usually solitary eaters, whereas vultures generally flock together around carrion.</p>
<p>Several <span class="sc">kjv</span> references to vultures are usually translated “kite” or “falcon” in modern translations (cf. various versions of <a href="?bref=Lev.11.14">Lv 11:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.13">Dt 14:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.28.7">Jb 28:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.15">Is 34:15</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Diurnal flesh eater, a little over three feet (.9 meter) long with a wingspread of over three yards (2.7 meters). The feathers of the black or osprey vulture (<span class="ital">Aegypius monachus</span>) are black and the head and upper part of the neck are bald like those of other carrion eaters. It nests in the Jordan River valley and seems to have been abundant in biblical times. Today it is quite rare. The black vulture is probably the osprey of <a href="?bref=Lev.11.13">Leviticus 11:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.14.12">Deuteronomy 14:12</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Also known as the gier eagle or as pharaoh’s hen. The plumage of the Egyptian vulture (<span class="ital">Neophron percnopterus</span>) is basically white with a naked head and yellow neck. The Egyptian vulture breaks bones left by other vultures. Its flight is slow and easy, and its voice is a croak. Measuring about 24 inches (61 centimeters) in length, it is the smallest of all the carrion-eating birds found in the Holy Land. It may be referred to in the list of unclean birds (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.18">Lv 11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.17">Dt 14:17</a>, “gier eagle,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>; “carrion vulture,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Vulture_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Vulture (above)</a>.</p>
<p class="h3" id="VultureGriffon">Vulture, Griffon</p>
<p class="fl">One of the largest flying birds in the Holy Land <span class="ital">(Gyps fulvus).</span> Until a generation ago, the griffon vulture was one of the most common birds in the Holy Land. Today it is on the verge of extinction. Many have been killed by eating poisonous bait meant for foxes and jackals. In addition, its reproduction is limited; the female lays only one or two eggs a year.</p>
<p>The griffon vulture measures about four feet (121.9 centimeters) in length and up to ten feet (3 meters) between wing tips. Its beak is extremely strong, and its short toes are fitted with blunt talons. It is a light-brown bird with a pale yellow head and neck that are almost bare, being covered only with a very fine down.</p>
<p>The griffon vulture feeds mostly on carrion, but also on locusts and small tortoises. It is able to go without food for several days with no ill effects, but when it does break its fast, it gorges itself. It is found especially in the region of the Sea of Galilee. Most biblical references to the vulture are likely to be to the griffon vulture.</p>

<p class="h3" id="WaterHen">Water Hen</p>
<p class="fl">Small water bird of the rail family.

Several alternatives have been suggested, including the swan (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), one of the owls (<span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">neb</span>), or the marsh hen (<span class="sc">tlb</span>). Most scholars rule out the swan, since it is a vegetarian bird and thus should not be considered unclean. An owl remains a possibility.</p>
<p>The marsh hen is a rail, several species of which inhabit Israel. One of those species is the purple gallinule <span class="ital">(Porphyrio porphyrio).</span> Rails are very thin birds varying from 6 to 20 inches (15 to 51 centimeters) in length. They live in marshes, where they eat a great variety of animal and vegetable matter, thus making them a candidate for inclusion in the Mosaic lists of unclean animals.</p>

  <title>Birthright</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BIRTHRIGHT</p>
<p class="fl">Right or privilege belonging to the firstborn son in a Hebrew family. The eldest son ranked highest after the father and in the father’s absence had the father’s authority and responsibility, as illustrated by Reuben’s relationship to his younger brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.19-22,28-30">Gn 37:19-22, 28-30</a>). However, because he later committed incest, Reuben forfeited his birthright (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-4">Gn 49:1-4</a>). Next in line were Simeon, Levi, and Judah (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.31-35">Gn 29:31-35</a>), but Jacob, their father, passed over Simeon and Levi because of their lack of character (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.5-7">Gn 49:5-7</a>). Although he praised Judah (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.8-10">Gn 49:8-10</a>), Jacob gave the birthright to his favorite son, Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.22-26">Gn 49:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.5.1-2">1 Chr 5:1-2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.37.2-4">Gn 37:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>Tablets recovered from Nuzi in Mesopotamia have shown that the birthright could be exchanged among members of the same family (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.19-34">Gn 25:19-34</a>). The holder of the birthright appears to have been in possession of the “teraphim,” or household idols (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.19,32,34">31:19, 32, 34</a>), which were small terra-cotta images, presumably of the particular deity worshiped locally. These tokens would reinforce the position and authority of the firstborn.</p>
<p>The birthright meant not only the honor of family leadership but also an inheritance of twice the amount received by every other son. In polygamous Israelite society the birthright belonged to the actual firstborn of the father and could not be transferred to the son of a favorite wife without just cause (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.15-17">Dt 21:15-17</a>). However, the birthright did not belong to the firstborn son if his mother was a concubine or slave (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.9-13">Gn 21:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.1-2">Jgs 11:1-2</a>). The rights of the firstborn son of a king included the right of succession to the throne (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.1-3">2 Chr 21:1-3</a>). When King Rehoboam of Judah violated custom by making his favorite son, Abijah, his successor, he had to pay off his other sons to avoid trouble (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.18-23">11:18-23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.16">12:16</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, reference is made to the OT account of Esau, the son of the patriarch Isaac, who impulsively traded his birthright for a bowl of lentil stew (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.16-17">Heb 12:16-17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.25.19-34">Gn 25:19-34</a>). Christians are warned not to throw away their inheritance of spiritual blessing from God the way Esau lost his birthright and his father’s blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-46">Gn 27</a>).</p>

The Greek word from which the English title “bishop” and the adjective “episcopal” are derived is often translated in modern versions as “elder,” “overseer,” “shepherd,” or “guardian,” corresponding closely to the current term “pastor.” Jesus is called “the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">1 Pt 2:25</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>In the NT, “bishop,” and “elder” refer to the same office, as shown by the apostle Paul’s telling Titus to appoint “elders in every town” and then referring to those same individuals as “bishops” (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5,7">Ti 1:5, 7</a>). While at Miletus, Paul summoned the elders from the church at Ephesus and then addressed them as “overseers” or “guardians” (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.17,28">Acts 20:17, 28</a>). In his letter to Philippi, Paul greeted the “bishops and deacons” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Phil 1:1</a>). The fact that there were numerous bishops at Philippi, as well as in Ephesus, shows that the episcopal office had not yet developed into what it later became: a single bishop governing one or more churches.</p>
<p>Bishops obviously had positions of authority, but the duties of the office are not clearly defined in the NT. One task was to combat heresy (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.9">Ti 1:9</a>) and to teach and expound the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=1Tim.3.2">1 Tm 3:2</a>). In addition, there is some evidence that a primary concern was with economic matters and the care of the poor, as well as with a general overseeing of the congregation. The lists of qualifications in Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus indicate that a bishop was considered a leader in the congregation and a representative to the non-Christian world. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Elder_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Elder</a>; <a href="?item=Pastor_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Pastor</a>; <a href="?item=Presbyter_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Presbyter</a>.</p>

Abner, commander of Ishbosheth’s army, fled through Bithron after losing a battle to David’s army. The Hebrew root has the meaning “to cut into pieces.” Three explanations have been suggested: (1) it refers to a valley, perhaps the Jabbok; (2) it is the area “cut off” by a great curve in the Jabbok River; (3) it refers to the first part of the day, “all through the morning” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">BITHYNIA</p>
<p class="fl">Roman province located in the northwest corner of Asia Minor. The apostle Paul and Silas wanted to preach the gospel in Bithynia on Paul’s second missionary journey but were prevented by the Holy Spirit from doing so (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.7">Acts 16:7</a>). The apostle Peter may have ministered in Bithynia and other provinces of Asia Minor, since he addressed his first letter to believers there (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pt 1:1</a>). Christianity entered Bithynia somehow, possibly through Peter.</p>
<p>Bithynia was occupied by a Thracian tribe that established a prosperous kingdom there in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>. In 75 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Bithynia’s last king, Nicomedes III, willed his kingdom to the Roman people, it became part of the Roman Empire. For administrative purposes, it was generally linked with the province of Pontus to the east.</p>
<p>After NT times, Bithynia figured significantly in church history. Early in the second century, its Roman governor, Pliny the Younger, elicited from the emperor Trajan the earliest stated imperial policy on persecution of Christians. Later, the church councils of Nicaea (<span class="era">AD</span> 325) and Chalcedon (451) were held in two of Bithynia’s western cities. The Council of Nicaea declared the full deity of Christ; the Council of Chalcedon made pronouncements on the nature of the person of Christ and the canonicity of the 27 NT books.</p>
<p>The Roman province of Bithynia was bordered on the north by the Black Sea, on the west by the Propontis (modern Sea of Marmara), on the south by the province of Asia, and on the east by Galatia and Pontus. Bithynia was mountainous, with Mt Olympus in the south rising to 7,600 feet (2,315.5 meters), but had districts of great fertility near the seacoast and in its interior valleys. Besides producing fruit and grain, the province had fine marble quarries, good timber, and excellent pasturage. The principal river was the Sangarius (modern Sakarya), which flowed from south to north into the Black Sea. Transportation was largely along the river valleys.</p>

<p class="h1">BITTERNESS OR JEALOUSY*, W<span class="lc">ater of</span></p>
<p class="fl">OT “trial” procedure employed when a husband suspected his wife of adultery but had no evidence to support his suspicion. The ritual, described in <a href="?bref=Num.5.11-31">Numbers 5:11-31</a>, is thought by some scholars to belong to a class of procedures known as “trials by ordeal.” Such an ordeal subjected an accused woman to some physical hazard for the purpose of determining her guilt or innocence. The effect of the hazard-producing agent on the accused individual determined the verdict. The premise was that a higher power who knew the guilt or innocence of the accused would act to influence the outcome appropriately.</p>
<p>In Israel, as in many other ancient societies, women had few rights. An Israelite husband could resort to the trial procedure when he had no evidence of his wife’s unfaithfulness but simply had a “spirit of jealousy” concerning her (<a href="?bref=Num.5.11-14">Nm 5:11-14</a>). Very likely a pregnant wife would be subjected to the ritual if her husband suspected the unborn child was not his own.</p>
<p>The suspicious husband brought his wife to the priest with a special offering of a coarse barley meal (<a href="?bref=Num.5.15">Nm 5:15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.2.1-16">Lv 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.5.11">5:11</a>). The priest would take the woman and “set her before the Lord,” mix “holy water” (probably from the tabernacle laver or basin) with dirt from the tabernacle floor, unbind the woman’s hair (perhaps as a sign of shame), and place some of the barley meal offering in her hands (<a href="?bref=Num.5.16-18">Nm 5:16-18</a>). Then the priest made her swear an oath asserting that, if she had been unfaithful, drinking the “water of bitterness” would bring a curse upon her. She gave assent by saying “Amen, Amen” (vv <a href="?bref=Num.5.19-22">19-22</a>). Somehow, after writing out the words of the curse, the priest washed them off into the water. After making a ceremonial offering of a handful of barley meal, the priest made the woman drink the water (vv <a href="?bref=Num.5.23-26">23-26</a>). The effect of a guilty verdict was evidenced by bitter suffering, causing the woman to become infertile (v <a href="?bref=Num.5.27">27</a>).</p>

  <title>Blasphemy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BLASPHEMY</p>
<p class="fl">Profane or contemptuous speech or writing about (or action toward) God. In a general sense, “blasphemy” can refer to any slander, including any word or action that insults or devalues another being. In Greek literature the term was used for insulting or deriding living or dead persons, but it was extended to cover the gods as well, including both doubting the power of and mocking the nature of a god.</p>
<p>In the OT, “blasphemy” always means to insult God, either by attacking him directly or mocking him indirectly. Either way the glory and honor of God are lessened, so blasphemy is the opposite of praise. An Israelite might directly insult the “Name” by cursing God (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.10-16">Lv 24:10-16</a>) or deliberately disobey God’s law (<a href="?bref=Num.15.30">Nm 15:30</a>). Either of those blasphemies was punishable by death, as was idolatry, the ultimate blasphemy (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.3">Is 66:3</a>). It was thought that Gentiles, who had never experienced the power and majesty of the Lord, were the most likely blasphemers. Thus the king of Assyria blasphemed in equating the Lord with the gods of the nations he had already conquered (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.4-6,22">2 Kgs 19:4-6, 22</a>). For his arrogance the king was doomed by the word of the prophet Isaiah. God was also mocked when Israel was exiled (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.5">Is 52:5</a>), when Edom derided the desolate “mountains of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.35.12">Ez 35:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), and when the enemy scoffed that God had not protected Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.18">Ps 74:18</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.6">1 Macc 2:6</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, blasphemy takes on the wider Greek meaning, for it includes slandering a human being (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.19">Mt 15:19</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.3.8">Rom 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.30">1 Cor 10:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.31">Eph 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.2">Ti 3:2</a>), as well as God. It even includes mocking angelic or demonic powers, which is just as wrong as mocking any other being (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.10-12">2 Pt 2:10-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Jude.1.8-10">Jude 1:8-10</a>). In other words, slander, derision, and mocking of any kind are totally condemned in the NT.</p>
<p>The most common form of blasphemy in the NT is blasphemy against God. One might insult God directly (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.6">Rv 13:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.9">16:9</a>), mock his word (<a href="?bref=Titus.2.5">Ti 2:5</a>), or reject his revelation and its bearer (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.11">Acts 6:11</a>). Jesus was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to have a prerogative belonging to God—the power to forgive sins (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.7">Mk 2:7</a>). <a href="?bref=John.10.33-36">John 10:33-36</a> reports an attempt to stone Jesus; his accusers said to him, “You, being a man, make yourself God” (v <a href="?bref=John.10.33">33</a>). Jesus was condemned by the highest Jewish court, the Sanhedrin, on the charge of blasphemy, because he claimed to be the Son of Man (the Messiah) but in their view had given no evidence that he was such an exalted personage, thus appearing to mock the Messiah and, by extension, to mock God himself (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.64">Mk 14:64</a>).</p>
<p>Naturally the early Christians viewed Jesus’ trial from another perspective: the guards insulting Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.64-65">Lk 22:64-65</a>) and the crowds and two dying robbers mocking him on the cross (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.29-32">Mk 15:29-32</a>) were the real blasphemers. Observing how their Lord had been treated, the church was prepared to accept insult as their own lot, both personally (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.13">1 Cor 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.13">1 Tm 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.9">Rv 2:9</a>) and as a response to their message (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.45">Acts 13:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.6">18:6</a>). On the other hand, the church recognized that even Christians could blaspheme by giving way under persecution (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.11">26:11</a>), by teaching false doctrine (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.2">2 Pt 2:2</a>), or by behaving in an unbecoming fashion, which would bring others to think less of Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.24">Rom 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.5">Ti 2:5</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible makes clear that blasphemy is forgivable (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.32">Mt 12:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.28-29">Mk 3:28-29</a>), but if a person will not repent, the only remedy is to turn him or her over to Satan to be taught the lesson (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.20">1 Tm 1:20</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Pronouncement of the favor of God upon an assembled congregation. Worship services, especially observances of Holy Communion in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestant churches, usually end with a blessing spoken by the senior clergyman present. This pronouncement (called “blessing” in the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches and “benediction” in most Protestant churches) is based upon the widespread biblical precedent of blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.27-29">Gn 27:27-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.22-27">Nm 6:22-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.50">Lk 24:50</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.11,14">2 Cor 13:11, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.7">Phil 4:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.16-17">2 Thes 2:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20-21">Heb 13:20-21</a>).</p>
<p>The practice of benediction or blessing is often regarded merely as a ritual of dismissal, but it is actually a pronouncement of God’s gracious favor, to be given only by his ministers on the authority of Holy Scripture to faithful believers. In this action Christians are assured that the grace of God the Father, the love of the Son, and the communion of the Holy Spirit are with them.</p>
<p>The term “blessing” is also applied to thanksgiving for food and drink (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.19">Mt 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.7">Mk 8:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.30">Lk 24:30</a>).</p>

  <title>Blindness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BLINDNESS</p>
<p class="fl">Condition of lacking the ability to see. Physical blindness was common in the ancient Near East and is still prevalent among the poor and tribal peoples lacking the benefits of modern medicine.</p>
<p>Medical causes of blindness are not specified in the Bible, but poor personal hygiene and unsanitary living conditions were undoubtedly contributing factors. Newborn babies were especially susceptible. Much blindness from birth (<a href="?bref=John.9.1-3">Jn 9:1-3</a>) was probably gonorrhea of the eyes. In the birth process germs from the mother passed to the eyes of the infant, where they found an ideal medium for growth. Within three days inflammation, pus and swelling would be evident. In such cases, primitive treatment could not prevent some permanent or even total damage to the eye. Modern medical practice treats all newborn babies with antiseptic eyedrops; but such treatment is not always available to the poor, or is rejected by them in parts of the Middle East today. Babies and young children have also been threatened by infectious ophthalmia. Carried by flies, that disease causes heavy crusting, droopy eyelids, loss of eyelashes, and eventually clouding of the cornea, often leading to total blindness. In parts of the world one may still see a mother (because of folk superstition) permitting flies to swarm continuously on her baby’s face even as she holds the infant in her lap. Blindness among adults might be due to side effects from illnesses such as malaria, long exposure to sandstorms and sun glare in the desert, accidents, punishment (as with Samson, <a href="?bref=Judg.16.21">Jgs 16:21</a>), or old age (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1">Gn 27:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.15">1 Sm 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.4">1 Kgs 14:4</a>).</p>
<p>The OT demanded special consideration for the blind (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.14">Lv 19:14</a>) and imposed punishment for misleading a blind person (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.18">Dt 27:18</a>). A blind man, considered defective, was not permitted to serve as a priest (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.18">Lv 21:18</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus’ healing ministry brought sight to the blind in fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">Lk 4:18</a>). His ability to restore vision was one of the proofs given to John the Baptist that Jesus was the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">Mt 11:5</a>). Jesus healed two blind men in Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.27-30">9:27-30</a>), one blind man in Bethsaida (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">Mk 8:22-26</a>), a man blind from birth in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">Jn 9</a>), and a blind beggar named Bartimaeus and his friend at Jericho (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-52">Mk 10:46-52</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.20.30-34">Mt 20:30-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.35-43">Lk 18:35-43</a>). At times Jesus commanded immediate restoration (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.52">Mk 10:52</a>). On other occasions he used “means” such as clay and water (<a href="?bref=John.9.6-11">Jn 9:6-11</a>) or his own saliva (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.23">Mk 8:23</a>). The apostle Paul was blinded at his conversion and received a miraculous cure in the presence of Ananias (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-9,18">Acts 9:1-9, 18</a>). Paul later afflicted a sorcerer, Elymas, with temporary blindness for opposing his ministry on the island of Cyprus (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.11">13:11</a>).</p>

  <title>Blood</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BLOOD</p>
<p class="fl">Fluid that circulates through the body of a person or a vertebrate animal. Aside from reference to the common physical substance, the term “blood” has a number of metaphorical uses in the Bible. At times, it refers to a red color: “the sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon will turn bloodred” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.20">Acts 2:20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The “blood of the grape” means wine (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.14">Dt 32:14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In the NT the expression “flesh and blood” refers to human life, to “natural” humanity: “Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Mt 16:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50">1 Cor 15:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.16">Gal 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Eph 6:12</a>). After betraying Jesus, Judas recognized that he had “sinned in betraying innocent blood” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.4">Mt 27:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In such passages “blood” has reference to life lived at the human level, natural life as opposed to spiritual or divine life.</p>
<p>The term “blood” is also used in the sense of shedding blood, that is, in killing or murder. <a href="?bref=Ps.9.12">Psalm 9:12</a> speaks of one “who avenges blood.” <a href="?bref=Gen.37.26">Genesis 37:26</a> refers to the brothers who concealed Joseph’s blood, that is, his murder. To be “burdened with the blood of another” (<a href="?bref=Pr.28.17">Prv 28:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) means to be guilty of murder. At the crucifixion Pilate said, “I am innocent of the blood of this man” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.24-25">Mt 27:24-25</a>). Thus, the idea of violent death is regularly connected with blood.</p>
<p>The logic of such expressions becomes particularly clear when one sees how closely life is associated with blood. Three passages specifically tie the two together. “Only you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood” (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.4">Gn 9:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). “For the life of the flesh is in the blood” (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.11">Lv 17:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). “The only restriction is never to eat the blood, for the blood is the life” (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.23">Dt 12:23</a>, <span class="sc">tlb</span>). Because God is the author of all life, any shedding of blood (any killing) is a serious matter. A certain sanctity associated with blood forms the basis for prohibitions against eating it. (Compare what the apostles said in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.20">Acts 15:20</a>.) Blood stands for the “life principle” that is from God.</p>
<p>Because of its association with life, blood takes on a special significance in the sacrificial motif. On the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lv 16</a>), the blood of a bull and of a goat was sprinkled upon the altar as a “covering” of the people’s sin. Life was poured out in death. Animal life was given up on behalf of the life of the people. Judgment and atonement were carried out through a transfer of the sin of the people to the animal sacrifice. Transference is depicted also by the scapegoat in the same ceremony (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.20-22">Lv 16:20-22</a>). In the first Passover (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-13">Ex 12:1-13</a>), the blood bore the same meaning. Animal blood posted on each door was a sign that a death had already taken place, so the angel of death passed over.</p>
<p>Further, because life is connected with blood, blood becomes the supreme offering to God. In the ratification of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-18">Ex 24</a>), Moses poured half the sacrificial blood on the altar; after reading the covenant to the people and receiving their affirmative response, he sprinkled the rest of the blood on them and said, “This blood confirms the covenant the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has made with you in giving you these laws” (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.8">Ex 24:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Sprinkling blood on both the altar and the people bound God and the Israelites together in covenant relationship. In the sacrifices of Israel, blood stood for death and depending on the context, might also stand for judgment, sacrifice, substitution, or redemption. Life with God was made possible by blood.</p>
<p>In the NT, apart from medical references (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.9.20">Mt 9:20</a>) and references to murder (e.g., <a href="?bref=Acts.22.20">Acts 22:20</a>), the primary reference is to the blood of Christ, an allusion to the OT motifs. The synoptic Gospels show that at the Last Supper Jesus spoke of his blood with reference to a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mk 14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>). The language surrounding those sayings reveals the sacrificial motif; Jesus was speaking of his death and its redemptive significance. The fourth Gospel expresses the same theology in different terms and in a different context: “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you” (<a href="?bref=John.6.53">Jn 6:53</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The believer is said to participate by faith in the death and resurrection of the Lord (see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16">1 Cor 10:16</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul’s letters likewise associate blood with Christ’s death, so much so that the word becomes—like the term “cross”—synonymous with the death of Christ in its saving significance: making peace “by means of his blood on the cross” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.20">Col 1:20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>); and in a passage on reconciliation: “though you once were far away from God, now you have been brought near to him because of the blood of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.13">Eph 2:13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). “Blood” and “cross” both stand for the death of Jesus in reconciling Jew and Gentile to God and in the creation of a new humanity. Paul evidently had in mind the sacrifice of the Day of Atonement when he said that God purposed that Christ be an atoning sacrifice by his blood (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>). His vocabulary (from <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lv 16</a>) focused on the most important sacrifice of Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>Peter made reference to the blood of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-18">Ex 24</a>) when he described Christian exiles as having been sprinkled with the blood of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.2">1 Pt 1:2</a>). He reminded his readers that they had been redeemed by that blood (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.19">19</a>). In calling Christ the “spotless lamb of God,” he may have had in mind either the servant of <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> or the Passover lamb, both of which had redemptive significance in his readers’ minds. Finally, to the writer of Hebrews the whole OT system of sacrifices found its ultimate fulfillment in the blood of Christ, that is, in his sacrificial death (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.7-28">Heb 9:7-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.11-12">13:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, NT references to the blood of Christ point to the culminating and comprehensive redemption achieved by God in the death of his Son (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.20">Heb 10:20</a>). Both justice and justification were thus achieved (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.26">Rom 3:26</a>). The blood of Christ is therefore called the “once for all” means of redemption (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.26">Heb 9:26</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Atonement_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Atonement</a>; <a href="?item=OfferingsandSacrifices_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Offerings and Sacrifices</a>.</p>

<p class="list">1. Vaginal discharge such as that during menstruation. <a href="?bref=Lev.15.1-33">Leviticus 15</a> contains social and sanitary laws that God gave to Moses concerning genital discharges. A woman with vaginal bleeding was considered ceremonially unclean during bleeding and for seven days afterward. She could not go to the tabernacle or temple for worship while unclean or mingle with crowds in the street or market. Anyone touching her or her clothes, bed, chair, and the like was also ceremonially unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.19-28">Lv 15:19-28</a>). Sexual intercourse was not allowed while the woman was ceremonially unclean. Seven days after her bleeding stopped, a woman would present to the priest two turtledoves or young pigeons as offerings to atone for the time of her uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.29-30">Lv 15:29-30</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jesus’ miraculous healing of a woman who had been hemorrhaging (slowly or intermittently) for 12 years was recorded in three of the four Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.20-22">Mt 9:20-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.25-34">Mk 5:25-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.43-48">Lk 8:43-48</a>). If her bleeding was vaginal, the years of ceremonial uncleanness and separation must have been particularly distressing for her. Besides being anxious and uncomfortable, she would also have been unable to bear children. Further, she had “suffered a great deal from many doctors” and “had spent everything she had to pay for them, but she had gotten no better” (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.26">Mk 5:26</a>). In despair she ignored the rules about uncleanness and made her way through a crowd to touch Jesus. When she touched him, the bleeding stopped immediately and permanently.</p>

  <title>Bloodguilt*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BLOODGUILT*</p>
<p class="fl">Term used in some English Bibles to translate a Hebrew word meaning “blood” or “bloods” (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.2-3">Ex 22:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.17.4">Lv 17:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.26,33">1 Sm 25:26, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.12.14">Hos 12:14</a>). The translation “bloodguiltiness” occurs only in <a href="?bref=Ps.51.14">Psalm 51:14</a>. The plural form almost invariably means the shedding of blood, but the singular can mean blood itself, bloodshed, or the guilt incurred by bloodshed (i.e., by killing). The idea that killing was punishable by death pervades the Bible; killing was generally done by literally shedding another’s blood.</p>
<p>The first category of bloodshed resulting in bloodguilt was deliberate homicide, murder “in cold blood,” as moderns say, or of “innocent blood,” as the OT says (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.14">Jon 1:14</a>). Several passages define the shedding of innocent blood and its punishment (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.6">Gn 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.19.11-13">Dt 19:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.4">2 Kgs 24:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.6">Ez 33:6</a>). The Bible prohibits any ransom for a murderer (<a href="?bref=Num.35.31">Nm 35:31</a>).</p>
<p>Another category was accidental homicide (<a href="?bref=Num.35.9-28">Nm 35:9-28</a>, <a href="?bref=Deut.19.4-10">Dt 19:4-10</a>). After an accidental killing, the “avenger of blood” might retaliate if he caught the offender outside a city of refuge. If the murderer was unknown, the town nearest the discovered corpse assumed the guilt; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.1-9">Deuteronomy 21:1-9</a> prescribes a ceremony for removing such guilt.</p>
<p>In ancient Israel it was possible to shed the blood of an animal and incur bloodguilt (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.3-4,10-11">Lv 17:3-4, 10-11</a>). An animal that was legally guilty of bloodshed was to be stoned (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.28-29">Ex 21:28-29</a>). Exceptions to bloodguilt were made in the case of self-defense (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.2">22:2</a>), capital punishment (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.9-16">Lv 20:9-16</a>), and war (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.5-6">1 Kgs 2:5-6</a>). Frequently the prophets would use the Hebrew word for “bloods” or “blood” to speak of the whole nation’s guilt (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.15">Is 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.23">Ez 7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.9.9">9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.1.4">Hos 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.2">4:2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.10">Mi 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.2.8,12,17">Hb 2:8, 12, 17</a>; and many others). Other crimes beside bloodshed could bring on a death sentence (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.9-16">Lv 20:9-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.10-13">Ez 18:10-13</a>). Such crimes included honoring pagan deities, worshiping idols, adultery, robbery, oppressing the poor, breach of promise, and usury.</p>
<p>From the beginning (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.10-12">Gn 4:10-12</a>), through the Prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.21">Is 26:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.24.6-9">Ez 24:6-9</a>), and into the NT (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.10">Rv 6:10</a>), the Bible supports the idea that God will avenge wrongs and punish those guilty of bloodshed.</p>

Although some translations make it appear that Jesus actually sweat blood, the Greek text is clearly making a comparison. That is, sweat poured off of Jesus “as though he were bleeding,” an apt analogy for Luke, a physician, to make.</p>

<p class="fl">To speak of deeds, abilities, or characteristics in a manner showing pride or self-satisfaction. In the Bible the word also has a more positive connotation (“to glory in”).</p>
<p>In the OT, “boasting” is often used to describe the basic attitude of the ungodly, who depend on their own resources rather than on God (<a href="?bref=Ps.52.1">Pss 52:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.94.3-4">94:3-4</a>). Enemies of Israel boasted of their victories and claimed the glory for themselves (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.27">Dt 32:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.10.3">Pss 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.35.26">35:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.9">73:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.9">Is 3:9</a>). They boasted of their riches (<a href="?bref=Ps.49.6">Ps 49:6</a>) and wisdom (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.11">Is 19:11</a>). According to the Lord, the rich and wise are to “boast about this: that he understands and knows me, that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on the earth” (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.24">Jer 9:24</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>Jesus depicted a proud Pharisee boasting to God in prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.10-14">Lk 18:10-14</a>). Most of the NT usages of the word occur in the apostle Paul’s letters. The negative aspect of vaunting one’s own accomplishments is contrasted with the positive counterpart of glorying in what the Lord has done (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.27-28">Rom 3:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.17">2 Cor 10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.14">Gal 6:14</a>). Selfrighteousness and bragging are to be avoided (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.30">Rom 1:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.17,23">2:17, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.9">Eph 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.2">2 Tm 3:2</a>). Paul associated boasting with the attitude of those Jews who developed a feeling of self-confidence because of having kept the law. For Paul, the only legitimate boasting was to boast (rejoice) in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.11">Rom 5:11</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rom.5.3">Romans 5:3</a>, the rabbinic view of glorying in one’s sufferings is contrasted with Paul’s view that his present sufferings pointed to God’s power and toward Paul’s hope for the future.</p>
<p>Paul’s boasting was not based upon comparisons with others, in contrast to the boasting of his opponents. Because Christ worked through him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.2-6">2 Cor 3:2-6</a>) and God commended him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.18">10:18</a>), he could give glory to God. Paul preferred to boast of his own weakness, and of the Lord’s power and strength (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.5,9">12:5, 9</a>).</p>
<p>On occasion, the apostle did boast concerning a particular group of Christians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.4,14">7:4, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.24">8:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.2-3">9:2-3</a>), but with the implication that he was expressing confidence in <span class="ital">them,</span> not bragging about his own successes. Concerning himself, Paul boasted reluctantly and only as a means of defense against an unsupportive element in the Corinthian church. He said that those who should have commended him had instead compelled him to engage in “foolish” boasting (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.11">2 Cor 12:11</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">BODY</p>
<p class="fl">Term used biblically in several different ways, including certain metaphorical or theological expressions. Many of the biblical references illustrate special features of Hebrew thought about human life.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The OT writers used a number of Hebrew words translated “body” in English versions, mostly with reference to physical life. The body suffers; it is plagued with illness or is injured. Sometimes it is dead, that is, a corpse or carcass. Reference is even made to the “bodies” of spiritual beings—of the cherubim in Ezekiel’s vision (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.11">Ez 1:11</a>) and of an angel (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.6">Dn 10:6</a>). Jeremiah spoke of the bodies of pagan gods, referring to their images in the form of idols (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.1-16">Jer 10:1-16</a>). Such usages indicate that the Hebrews thought of all beings, whether heavenly or earthly, as embodied.</p>
<p>At times, the word “body” is close to the meaning of “flesh,” and frequently the same Hebrew word lies behind both terms. “Body” is man in his total physical experience. “Flesh” is generally used to refer to the sinfulness or creatureliness of man.</p>
<p>Human beings have bodies and a bodily existence; each person also has a spirit and a spiritual dimension in life. But in Scripture the two are not set over against each other or viewed as separate “parts” of man. The body is not seen as a hindrance to the soul (as in much Greek thought). Not until the intertestamental period did Jewish writers begin to speak of the body as evil or as something set over against the soul.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Though “body” is used in the NT in the same ways as in the OT, the concept is given new significance. The body of Jesus (i.e., his corpse) was taken down from the cross (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.43">Mk 15:43</a>). A body could experience illness and healing (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.29">5:29</a>) and needed to be clothed (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.16">Jas 2:16</a>); yet the body (i.e., physical life) is more than clothing (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.25">Mt 6:25</a>). Jesus said not to fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear those who can destroy both soul and body in hell (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">10:28</a>).</p>
<p>At the Lord’s Supper Jesus said with reference to the bread, “This is my body,” and then added—with the cup in his hand—“This is my blood” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.22,24">Mk 14:22, 24</a>). Those terms from the OT sacrificial system were intended to underscore the sacrificial significance of Jesus’ death. Under both the old and new covenants, a real, physical life was offered in death for the sake of the “covenant people.”</p>
<p>The apostle Paul made the term “body” a fundamental reference in the understanding of Christian experience. Most of the NT references to “body” are in his letters.</p>
<p class="h3">The Sinful Body</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Rom.6.6">Romans 6:6</a> Paul spoke of the destruction of the “sinful body.” The phrase did not mean that the body itself is sinful, as though sin is in some way tied to physical matter. Neither did it refer to some entity, sin, thought to dwell within human nature. Nor did it personify sin. Rather, the phrase referred to the physical life of human beings—life on earth—which is dominated by sin’s influence. In Christian conversion Paul saw that familiar pattern of human experience being destroyed. To link sin with the body is only to recognize that human beings in their earthly life (“life in the body”) are pervasively sinful. After describing the awful conflict in human experience, Paul cried out, “Who will deliver me from this body of death?” (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.24">Rom 7:24</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Human life, “spoiled” by sin and its consequences at every point, requires Christ’s redemption (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.25-8.4">7:25–8:4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Body of the Believer</p>
<p class="fl">In conversion, believers are said by Paul to experience not only the “saving of the soul” but also the transformation of present life. They have died to sin and have been freed from sin’s bondage. Paul therefore called for holiness of life “in the flesh.” “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.12">Rom 6:12</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Righteousness, not sin, is to govern a Christian’s physical experience. The social and personal lives of believers are to be characterized by holiness. Believers are in the world (<a href="?bref=John.17.11">Jn 17:11</a>) and are to live for God in the world (i.e., in their bodily existence); they are not to be indifferent to the world.</p>
<p>Physical, earthly life thus takes on new significance. Paul told Christians to present their bodies as a living sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.1">Rom 12:1</a>). Each individual human life is to be a “living sacrifice” to God. Far from deprecating earthly existence, Paul saw that in Christ it had new potential. The reason is that the Holy Spirit is found there. “Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19">1 Cor 6:19</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). That affirmation is not to be read materialistically, as though the Spirit takes up residence in certain tissues; “body” means one’s whole physical, earthly existence.</p>
<p>Paul also anticipated an ultimate transformation of life in the body through Christ. He spoke of the “redemption of our bodies” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Rom 8:23</a>) and of the transformation of “our lowly bodies to be like his glorious body” (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Phil 3:21</a>). The Bible, although it has a realistic view of human sin and physical deterioration, does not share the pessimism of worldviews that seek escape from the world.</p>
<p class="h3">The Resurrection Body</p>
<p class="fl">The possible separation of body and soul did not occur to the Hebrew mind. Biblically, life beyond death is not bodiless but an existence for which a “new body” is prepared. Though Paul raised many questions in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-57">1 Corinthians 15:35-57</a>, it is clear that he saw continuity between the earthly body and the resurrection body. “It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">44</a>). That expression may be derived in large part from the experience of Jesus, whose dead body was not only brought to life but also transformed so that it was not bound by earth. His resurrection body was derived from the earthly. But Paul was sure that in the promised resurrection, life would return to the body without its present limitations and with new manifestations. Death, said Paul, is thereby “swallowed up in victory” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.54">54</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">BODY OF CHRIST</p>
<p class="fl">Scriptural phrase referring to (1) the physical body of Jesus Christ, (2) his broken body and shed blood viewed symbolically and memorially in the bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper, and (3) both the local and universal church viewed metaphorically.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePhysicalBodyofJesusChrist">The Physical Body of Jesus Christ</p>
<p class="fl">The NT declares that the Son (the second person of the Trinity) had a human body prepared for him by God the Father (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.5">Heb 10:5</a>). The earthly body was engendered by the conceptive work of the Holy Spirit through the virgin Mary (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.20">Mt 1:20</a>); the one thus born, humanly speaking, as a descendant of David (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.3">Rom 1:3</a>), was also to be called the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">Lk 1:35</a>). The apostle John emphasized that the body of Christ was really human physically, not something gaseous or ethereal (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2-3">1 Jn 4:2-3</a>) as some persons in John’s day were already beginning to argue. God “became flesh and dwelt among us” (<a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-4">Is 53:1-4</a>). Jesus’ earthly body possessed ordinary human characteristics and limitations. That is, as a real human being, Jesus Christ experienced sorrow (<a href="?bref=John.11.35">Jn 11:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.7-8">Heb 5:7-8</a>), weariness (<a href="?bref=John.4.6">Jn 4:6</a>), thirst (<a href="?bref=John.19.28">19:28</a>), and pain (vv <a href="?bref=John.19.1-3">1-3</a>).</p>
<p>When Jesus gave up his spirit, his physical body died on the cross (<a href="?bref=John.19.30,33">Jn 19:30, 33</a>). The NT proclaims that he bore the sins of the world in his body on the cross (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">1 Pt 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.53.5-6">Is 53:5-6</a>). His death is described as a perfect sacrifice for sinners (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.12-14,26-28">Heb 9:12-14, 26-28</a>), a sacrifice of his body that makes believers in him holy and righteous (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.10">Heb 10:10</a>).</p>
<p>Christ’s physical body was prepared in the normal way for burial (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.59">Mt 27:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.46">Mk 15:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.53,56">Lk 23:53, 56</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.1">24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.39-40">Jn 19:39-40</a>) and placed in the rock tomb of Joseph of Arimathea (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.57-60">Mt 27:57-60</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.41">Jn 19:41</a>). On the third day the body of Christ experienced a real physical resurrection, as he had predicted (<a href="?bref=John.2.19-22">Jn 2:19-22</a>). He was seen in his physical resurrection body (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.9">Mt 28:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.31,36">Lk 24:31, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.10-19,26">Jn 20:10-19, 26</a>). He was heard, touched, and held onto (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.9">Mt 28:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.39">Lk 24:39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.17">Jn 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1">1 Jn 1:1</a>). He offered his body, scarred by his crucifixion, to be touched (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.39">Lk 24:39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.17">Jn 20:17</a>). The fact that he ate shows that his resurrection body was a physical one (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.42-43">Lk 24:42-43</a>). In addition, Christ’s body was “glorified,” that is, it was not restricted as ordinary bodies are: he entered and left rooms in a remarkable way (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.31,36">Lk 24:31, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.19,26">Jn 20:19, 26</a>). Christ’s bodily resurrection is said in Scripture to guarantee that believers in Christ will experience resurrection of their own bodies (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20-23,50-57">1 Cor 15:20-23, 50-57</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.20-21">Phil 3:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBodyofChristintheLordsSupper">The Body of Christ in the Lord’s Supper</p>
<p class="fl">At the last supper (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.26-29">Mt 26:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-25">Mk 14:22-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.15-20">Lk 22:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.23-26">1 Cor 11:23-26</a>), which accompanied the Passover supper, Jesus held up a loaf of bread and said, “This is my body”; then he picked up a cup of wine and said, “This is my blood of the covenant” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.26,28">Mt 26:26, 28</a>). Jesus meant that the bread symbolized his body, which would be broken when he was beaten at his trial and pierced at his crucifixion (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.33">Lk 23:33</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.1-2">Jn 19:1-2</a>). The apostle Paul said that Christ, our paschal lamb, was sacrificed for us (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>), meaning that the Passover lamb in the OT was an object lesson pointing to “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">Jn 1:29</a>).</p>
<p>For Christians, the body of Christ is viewed symbolically as a broken body (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.17">Mt 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">1 Pt 2:24</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.53.4-5">Is 53:4-5</a>) in the breaking of the bread at the Lord’s Supper. The cup is a sign of his blood poured out, viewed as the central factor in God’s covenant of grace with his people. Jesus referred to “the new covenant in my blood” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>). The whole ceremony of the Lord’s Supper was also to be a memorial (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25-26">1 Cor 11:25-26</a>). In the ceremony believers are reminded that Christ died for sinners, that is, for the forgiveness of their sins (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>). They are also reminded that they are participating in the body of Christ in that they are united with him (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-11">Rom 6:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16">1 Cor 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.10">Phil 3:10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBodyofChristthePeopleofGod">The Body of Christ, the People of God</p>
<p class="fl">The phrase “body of Christ” is also used as a metaphor for the whole church, a unity of believers connected with and dependent on Christ. God’s people are thus said to be members of Christ’s “mystical body” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27">1 Cor 12:27</a>), in fellowship with Christ and spiritually nourished by him (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.25,29">Eph 5:25, 29</a>). A number of other metaphors are also used for the whole people of God, such as the vine (<a href="?bref=Ps.80.8">Ps 80:8</a>), temple of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.16-17">1 Cor 3:16-17</a>), building (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>), chosen people (v <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">9</a>), and family of God (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.15">Eph 3:15</a>). Such metaphors amplify the interrelatedness, communion, and dependence of the “body of Christ” upon the living God.</p>
<p>The term “body of Christ” was often used by Paul to remind a local church that it was a vital part of the larger body. Paul said to the church at Rome, “For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another” (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.4-5">Rom 12:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Paul taught the Corinthian Christians that they, individually and collectively, were part of the body of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27">1 Cor 12:27</a>). They and Paul were all baptized by one Spirit into that one body (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.30">Eph 5:30</a>).</p>
<p>In a number of passages written by Paul, the church is called the “body” and Christ the “head” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>). Christ has been made “head over all things for the church,” which “is his body” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">Eph 1:22-23</a>). The body grows by “holding fast to the Head” (<a href="?bref=Col.2.19">Col 2:19</a>). As head of the body, Christ is its Savior (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.23">Eph 5:23</a>). The head/body metaphor stresses the organic dependence of the church on Christ and his lordship over the church. The church finds its self-understanding in terms of its Head. The relationship is organic in that the life flows from, and is sustained by, the Head. The relationship is immediate, direct, and complete. Apart from Christ, both in his historic atoning sacrifice and in his present position at the right hand of God, the church has no existence.</p>
<p>In the NT the term “body of Christ” is used to mean both the universal church and each local group of believers. In both senses the church is said to be the spiritual body in which believing Jews and Gentiles are united (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-16">Eph 2:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.4">4:4</a>). It is the body that Christ redeemed (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.23">Eph 5:23</a>), over which he presides (<a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>) and sovereignly rules (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">Eph 1:22-23</a>) and for which he supplies strength and unity (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.15-16">Eph 4:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.19">Col 2:19</a>).</p>
<p>Each member of the body of Christ has been given spiritual gifts with which to serve Christ in the body (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.6">Rom 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.11">1 Cor 12:11</a>). Such gifts are enumerated several times in Scripture, and range from apostleship and pastoring to encouraging and showing mercy (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.7-8">Rom 12:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.11">Eph 4:11</a>). The ministry of serving is to be shared by all Christians, for example, through giving to the physical needs of others (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.29-30">Acts 11:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1-4">1 Cor 16:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-5">2 Cor 8:1-5</a>) and praying for one another (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.15-23">Eph 1:15-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.14-19">3:14-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.18-20">6:18-20</a>). No one should look down on others or on their gifts, since God has chosen each one to function in his or her place in the body (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.14-26">1 Cor 12:14-26</a>). The gifts are given to equip “the saints, for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.12-13">Eph 4:12-13</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The goal is “to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ” (vv <a href="?bref=Eph.4.15-16">15-16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Body_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Body</a>; <a href="?item=Church_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Church</a>; <a href="?item=LordsSupperthe_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Lord’s Supper, The</a>; <a href="?item=Resurrection_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Resurrection</a>.</p>

The pus is a mixture of germs and white blood cells, which are the body’s defense against germs. Although painful, boils usually heal naturally after rupturing or being lanced. A more severe boil with several openings is called a carbuncle. If the infection goes deeper and injures internal organs or tissues, it is called an abscess and can even be fatal.</p>
<p>In the Bible the word translated “boil” probably referred to a variety of skin diseases.

  <body>
<p class="h1">BOND, BONDAGE</p>
<p class="fl">Anything that fastens or restrains; subjection or slavery. The basic concept in Hebrew and Greek words translated “bond” or “bondage” is “loss of freedom.” The concept connotes servitude to another. The OT uses several words for bondage to describe the period of Israelite servitude in Egypt as well as the Babylonian captivity and Persian domination. Some English versions use the word “bond” to denote a state of individual servitude, such as the conditions of indenture permitted under the laws of Moses (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.39-44">Lv 25:39-44</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The archaic term “bondmaid” is used to denote a concubine or secondary wife. The concept is used metaphorically to describe the control that God exercises over the nations of the world (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.3">Ps 2:3</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the bondage metaphor has positive and negative aspects. Negatively, it indicates spiritual subjection to sin or Satan (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.14-15">Heb 2:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.19">2 Pt 2:19</a>), to the flesh (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.12-14">Rom 8:12-14</a>), or to the Law (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.4">Gal 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.1">5:1</a>). Human beings are enslaved when forces hostile to their well-being control their actions. The term is also used to picture the subjugation of creation to physical decay (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.21">Rom 8:21</a>), which itself is the result of human sin.</p>
<p>The positive aspect draws upon the broader use of bondage in the Bible to denote servanthood, especially service to God as an obligation or vow (<a href="?bref=Num.30.2-15">Nm 30:2-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.37">Ez 20:37</a>). The term describes the necessity and value of suffering (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.34">Heb 10:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.3">13:3</a>). Paul especially uses it in a double sense (calling himself a “prisoner of Christ”) to associate his physical bonds with his spiritual bondage to Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.1">Eph 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.7-14">Phil 1:7-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.1.8">2 Tm 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.9">2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.9-10,13">Phlm 1:9-10, 13</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">One of the separate parts of the human or animal skeleton. After death, bones retain their form long after the soft tissues have decomposed, so bones are often associated with dead bodies or with death itself. The Israelites were concerned about proper respect for the bodies of the dead (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.25">Gn 50:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.11-13">1 Sm 31:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.14-18">2 Kgs 23:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.14-16">Ez 39:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.1">Am 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.22">Heb 11:22</a>).</p>
<p>A valley of “old, dry bones” symbolized the people of Israel, who were without hope until the Spirit of the Lord would put life back into them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-14">Ez 37:1-14</a>). In a living body, however, bones are living tissue, and Ezekiel knew that broken bones could heal (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.21">30:21</a>). Intact bones were a requirement for an unblemished lamb for the Passover (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.46">Ex 12:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.9.11-12">Nm 9:11-12</a>). Thus, the NT states that when Jesus Christ, the “Lamb of God” (<a href="?bref=John.1.36">Jn 1:36</a>), was crucified, contrary to Roman practice, his legs were not broken (<a href="?bref=Ps.34.20">Ps 34:20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.30-37">Jn 19:30-37</a>).</p>
<p>Some references to bones in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Job.2.5">Jb 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.19.20">19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.30.30">30:30</a>) carry the connotation of deep feelings, as in the phrase “I feel it in my bones.” Other references are metaphorical expressions of close kinship, “flesh and bone” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.23">Gn 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.29.14">29:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.9.2">Jgs 9:2</a>) being equivalent to the expression “one’s own flesh and blood.”</p>

<p class="h1">BOOK</p>
<p class="fl">A set of written sheets or a scroll—whether composed of wood, parchment, papyrus, or paper—containing records or a literary composition. With respect to the Bible, each individual composition is called a “book” because that was what the document was before it became part of the biblical collection. As such, the Bible has 66 books—such as Genesis, Isaiah, Matthew, and Revelation.</p>
<p>The most important book to the ancient Hebrews was the Book of the Law (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.8">2 Kgs 22:8</a>), because it came from God to Moses (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.6">Jos 23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.26">Mk 12:26</a>) and contained the record of the Mosaic covenant (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-26">Ex 20</a>). God instructed Joshua to meditate on it day and night (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.8">Jos 1:8</a>). The prophets appealed to it constantly, particularly to Deuteronomy. The discovery of the Book of the Law during the renovation of the temple in Josiah’s reign led to important religious reforms (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.8-13">2 Kgs 22:8-13</a>).</p>
<p>Some books specifically labeled as biblical source materials are the Book of the Wars of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Num.21.14">Nm 21:14</a>), the Book of Jashar (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.13">Jos 10:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.18">2 Sm 1:18</a>), the Book of the Acts of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.41">1 Kgs 11:41</a>), and the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.29">14:29</a>). A number of prophetic works are cited in the books of Chronicles as sources for the material recorded in those books. Some of these are the Chronicles of Samuel the Seer, the Chronicles of Nathan the Prophet, the Chronicles of Gad the Seer (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>), and the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="?bref=2Chr.9.29">2 Chr 9:29</a>). The fact that prophetic sources were used for Chronicles demonstrates that the Hebrew people regarded their history as the record of God’s activity. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Writing_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Writing</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">BOOK OF LIFE</p>
<p class="fl">Term used to refer to a heavenly record. The phrase appears seven times in the NT: <a href="?bref=Phil.4.3">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.5">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.13.8">13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12,15">20:12, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.27">21:27</a>. The Christian understanding of the phrase, however, is rooted in the OT. Passages such as <a href="?bref=Exod.32.32">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.87.6">Psalm 87:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.10">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1">12:1</a>; and <a href="?bref=Mal.3.16">Malachi 3:16</a> imply or affirm a record kept by God. God is seen as keeping account of his people’s faithfulness and disobedience—and possibly that of other nations as well (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.87.6">Ps 87:6</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.69.28">Psalm 69:28</a> uses the phrase “book of the living”; parallel poetic lines refer to physical living.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Dan.7.10">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.1">12:1</a>; and <a href="?bref=Mal.3.16">Malachi 3:16</a> references are linked with descriptions of final judgment and events of the end times. Names and deeds from the divine records are evidence set before a judge. <a href="?bref=Luke.10.20">Luke 10:20</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.12.23">Hebrews 12:23</a> reflect similar thought; no concrete mention of a “book” is made but a heavenly record is assumed. In <a href="?bref=Phil.4.3">Philippians 4:3</a> Paul uses “Book of Life” to encourage his fellow workers in a lively hope for the future.</p>
<p>“Book of Life” in the book of Revelation refers to a heavenly record with the names of persecuted Christians who remain faithful. It is used first in the letter to Sardis (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.5">3:5</a>) where the risen Lord, identified as “the Lamb” is keeper of the book (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.8">13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.7">21:7</a>). If a person’s name is found in the book, admittance is granted to new Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.15">20:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.27">21:27</a>). If one’s name is not written there, the judgment is final destruction. Absolute confidence in God’s care for his own is affirmed by the words “written before the foundation of the world” (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.8">13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>).</p>

  <title>Book of the Covenant</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BOOK OF THE COVENANT</p>
<p class="fl">Term occurring in two OT contexts. It describes, first, a document read by Moses to the people of Israel at Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.7">Ex 24:7</a>), and second, a document discovered in the temple by Hilkiah the priest at the time of King Josiah’s program of repairing the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.2,21">2 Kgs 23:2, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.30">2 Chr 34:30</a>). The term “covenant” refers to the covenant laws that God made with his people Israel in the time of Moses. The Hebrew term “book” means any written document, whether written on clay or stone tablets or on parchment scrolls. Ancient covenants were often in written form. The main problem in understanding the two references to “book of the covenant” is in trying to determine the concepts of those particular documents.</p>
<p>The book read at Mt Sinai has been taken to refer either to the Ten Commandments or to the whole section of <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-23.32">Exodus 20 to 23</a>, minus the narrative parts. Since the people responded, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do,” it was evidently legal in its thrust, but it seems impossible to define its contents more precisely than that. The fact that Moses wrote the book (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.4">Ex 24:4</a>) need not exclude the Ten Commandments, which are explicitly stated to have been written by God (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.15-16">32:15-16</a>). Moses could also have written them down, perhaps in a preliminary stage (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.25">19:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1">20:1</a>).</p>
<p>The content of the “book of the covenant” read by King Josiah to the people of Judah is uncertain. Some scholars have tried to reconstruct its contents on the basis of Josiah’s reforms, concluding that those reforms were similar to principles taught in the book of Deuteronomy. That approach has several weaknesses. First, some of the reforms are nowhere mentioned in the Law (e.g., burning the chariots of the sun—<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.11">2 Kgs 23:11</a>) and would have to represent inferences Josiah derived from the Law. It becomes unclear how much of his reform was based on explicit passages in the Book of the Covenant and how much on inferences. Second, the account in <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.30-33">2 Chronicles 34:30-33</a> indicates that much of the reform took place <span class="ital">before</span> discovery of the Book of the Covenant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, explicit statements in 2 Kings indicate that some of the reforms were based on the Book of the Covenant. Thus the book must have contained instructions on the Passover (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.21">2 Kgs 23:21</a>). It probably dealt with mediums, wizards, and other idolatrous practices, unless that reform was an inference suggested by the wording. In addition, the book evidently contained warnings of the destruction God would bring if his words were not followed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.16-19">22:16-19</a>). Those expressions probably indicate that Josiah’s Book of the Covenant was larger than <a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-23.33">Exodus 21–23</a>. In the older book, the Passover is mentioned only as the Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.15">Ex 23:15</a>). <a href="?bref=Exod.22.18">Exodus 22:18</a> might possibly give a basis for Josiah’s action against wizards. But in <a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-23.33">Exodus 21–23</a> no statement of judgment for disobedience is sufficient to explain the wording of <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.16-19">2 Kings 22:16-19</a>; the closest thing to it is <a href="?bref=Exod.23.33">Exodus 23:33</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that Josiah’s Book of the Covenant is also called the Book of the Law (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.8">2 Kgs 22:8</a>) suggests that numerous references to the Book of the Law in the OT should also be understood as referring to the Book of the Covenant.</p>

  <title>Book of the Dead*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BOOK OF THE DEAD*</p>
<p class="fl">Modern name (nonbiblical) given to ancient Egyptian funerary (burial) texts. In the broadest sense, it designates all such texts, whether found on pyramid walls, coffins, or papyri. Some scholars use the term in a narrower sense, to mean the later forms of such texts written on papyri.</p>
<p>The purpose of any Book of the Dead was to describe a person’s journey from this life to the next as an assured accomplishment. Its ancient Egyptian name was “Chapters of Coming Forth by Day.” Such a book would be prepared for any deceased person of importance. In later stages of Egyptian history such texts were mass-produced, spaces being left for the person’s name. For influential people the papyrus could be up to 100 feet (30.5 meters) long and lavishly illustrated with scenes depicting the person’s experiences after death. There was no standard selection or arrangement of the material.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of a deceased person was to go to the Other World, the kingdom of Osiris, and ultimately to become a god. In order to get there, the soul had to pass through various gates and be able to give the name of the gatekeeper to be admitted. Thus the texts meticulously informed the deceased of information they might need. One particularly important phase of the journey was judgment at the Hall of Truth. There the person’s heart was weighed in the balance over against the feather of truth and justice. The soul would pray for the outcome and make a “negative confession,” disclaiming any guilt, particularly with regard to theft and other social relationships. If the heart was as light as the feather, it was declared truthful. Otherwise it was given to destruction. The texts also provided the soul with an ample supply of hymns and prayers to assist it on its journey. Thus more emphasis was placed on magic and ritual than on truly moral character.</p>

<p class="h1">BOTTOMLESS PIT</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase used in the Bible to denote the abode of the dead and of demonic forces. The Hebrew word (literally “the deep”) is translated “abyss” in many versions of the Bible. In the ancient world, the concept referred to anything so deep as to be unfathomable—for example, wells or fountains. It is used in that way in the OT to describe the primeval sea (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Gn 1:2</a>) or the ocean depths (<a href="?bref=Ps.33.7">Pss 33:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.77.16">77:16</a>). In Near Eastern cultures, the term was used to signify the inverse of the great vault of heaven; hence, it came to be used metaphorically for the grave, synonymous with Sheol (<a href="?bref=Ps.71.20">Ps 71:20</a>). In intertestamental times, it came to be used for the abode of evil spirits (Jubilees 5:6; 1 Enoch 10:4, 11).</p>
<p>In the NT, the term is used in both of these metaphorical ways. The demons pleaded not to be flung into “the abyss” (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.31">Lk 8:31</a>), which many connect with later references to a “prison” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4">2 Pt 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.6">Jude 1:6</a>). The exact meaning of such a prison is difficult to define; recent studies of passages like the above and of <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19">1 Peter 3:19</a> and <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.6">4:6</a> suggest that the abyss is probably not meant to be synonymous with hades. More likely, it refers to a place where evil spirits are confined. <a href="?bref=Rom.10.7">Romans 10:7</a>, on the other hand, uses the term for the grave, contrasting descent into it with ascension into heaven. Paul there freely adapted <a href="?bref=Deut.30.12-13">Deuteronomy 30:12-13</a>.</p>
<p>The major use of the term comes in the book of Revelation. There the “bottomless pit” is the abode of scorpion-like locusts (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1-11">Rv 9:1-11</a>); of the prince of the underworld, named “Abaddon” or “Destruction” (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.11">9:11</a>); and of the “Beast,” or Antichrist (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.7">11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>). It is also the place where Satan is confined for 1,000 years (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.1,3">20:1, 3</a>).</p>
<p>Several characteristics should be noted in a study of the “bottomless pit” concept in Revelation. First, it is under the absolute control of God. The angel “was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit” to unlock it (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.1">9:1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>); the Beast “is to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to perdition” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Satan is seized, bound, thrown, and locked in it (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.2-3">20:2-3</a>). Second, from the beginning it is meant for eternal destruction. After it was opened, “from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace” (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.2">9:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Although the bottomless pit is not the place of torment (i.e., “the lake of fire” in <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10-15">20:10-15</a>), it will be replaced by eternal punishment after the End (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.17.8">17:8</a>). Finally, it is the reverse image of heaven, and from it wickedness gushes forth. This is in keeping with the metaphor and the picture throughout Revelation in which the dragon (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.9">12:9</a>) and the Beast attempt to duplicate the power and glory reserved for God alone. Just as heaven is the source of all that is worthwhile, the bottomless pit is the source of all that is evil. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=RevelationBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Revelation, Book of</a>.</p>

The disease caused prolapse of the intestines (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.19">19</a>). Either an inflammatory bowel disease or cancer of the colon or rectum could have accounted for these symptoms.</p>
<p>The only fatal intestinal disease recorded in the NT also occurred in a king (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.21-23">Acts 12:21-23</a>).

An acute intestinal obstruction, possibly due to roundworm infestation, could account for these symptoms. Roundworms may have been expelled during the illness, or maggots could have been seen on necrotic skin resulting in the observation by Luke that Herod was “eaten of worms and died.”</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">BRANCH</p>
<p class="fl">Literally, a shoot or sprout from a tree or bush; figuratively, a messianic or other spiritual metaphor. It is used for the three sets of arms that come off the main shaft of the golden lampstand in the tabernacle (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.25.31-36">Ex 25:31-36</a>) and for the palm fronds from which booths were constructed for the ancient Jewish Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.40-43">Lv 23:40-43</a>).</p>
<p>Metaphorically, the expression is found in passages where Israel is described as an olive tree (<a href="?bref=Hos.14.6">Hos 14:6</a>), a cedar (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.23">Ez 17:23</a>), and a vine (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.6">Ez 17:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.80.8-11">Ps 80:8-11</a>). “Branch,” with its implication of new growth, can signify prosperity (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.22">Gn 49:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.8.16">Jb 8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.80.8-11">Ps 80:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.8">Ez 36:8</a>). Branches can be cut or broken off; hence, the word may depict judgment (<a href="?bref=Job.18.16">Jb 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.9.14">Is 9:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.16">Jer 11:16</a>). Such passages speak of withering, being cut, or being burned; Jesus combined all three ideas into one metaphor (<a href="?bref=John.15.6">Jn 15:6</a>). In a similar way, the apostle Paul wrote that the Jews who didn’t believe would be broken off (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.19-21">Rom 11:19-21</a>).</p>
<p>The major use of such symbolism refers to the Davidic Messiah. Although that use of “branch” actually stems from the prophetic period, its roots go much farther back. The concept was used with reference to an influential figure, such as a king’s personal servant (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.9-13">Gn 40:9-13</a>), the patriarch Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.22">49:22</a>), Job (<a href="?bref=Job.29.19">Jb 29:19</a>), or the Assyrian king Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.12">Dn 4:12</a>). Passages such as <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.4">2 Samuel 23:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.132.17">Psalm 132:17</a> speak of the Davidic line as “growing” or “sprouting forth” (the literal meaning of the Hebrew verbs). Finally, images of agricultural prosperity were used as promised blessings of the messianic age (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">Lv 26</a> with the prophetic passages on previous page). It is understandable how the term “branch” could become a technical designation for the Messiah, as is described above.</p>

  <title>Bread</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BREAD</p>
<p class="fl">Food made from the dough of flour or meal from grain.</p>
<p class="h2" id="KindsofSeedUsedinMakingBread">Kinds of Seed Used in Making Bread</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible tells us that wheat, barley, rye, beans, lentils, millet, and manna were used in making bread.</p>
<p class="h3">Wheat</p>
<p class="fl">Wheat is mentioned frequently in Scripture (about 48 uses of four Hebrew words in the OT; 14 uses of one Greek word in the NT). The hard winter grain <span class="ital">(Triticum aestivuum)</span> remains the most popular with farmers of Palestine, who still sow in the fall and reap in the following summer.</p>
<p class="h3">Barley</p>
<p class="fl">Barley matures faster and produces more prolifically than wheat. The hail plague in Egypt destroyed the barley crop because it had ripened; at the same time wheat and rye had not matured (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.31-32">Ex 9:31-32</a>). Barley is mentioned 32 times in the OT. Barley produced a crop even in time of famine (<a href="?bref=Ruth.1.22">Ru 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.2.17,23">2:17, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.3.2,15,17">3:2, 15, 17</a>) and sold cheaper than wheat (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.7.1,16">2 Kgs 7:1, 16</a>). Poorer people depended on barley. The boy who contributed his lunch to Jesus to feed 5,000 had barley bread (<a href="?bref=John.6.9,13">Jn 6:9, 13</a>). Palestinians fed barley to cattle (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.28">1 Kgs 4:28</a>). Barley on the stalk carries a larger husk with a long, wiry hair (thus the name in Hebrew means “long hair”), making chaff separation more difficult. The greater likelihood of extraneous matter in the flour, combined with the less-liked flavor, made barley cheaper.</p>
<p class="h3">Rye</p>
<p class="fl">“Rye” translates a Hebrew word appearing in various versions as “vetch,” “fitches,” or “spelt” (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.32">Ex 9:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.25">Is 28:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9">Ez 4:9</a>). A hardy grass, it produces a crop even on poor soil. Rye bread gained popularity in northern Europe and to some degree in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.9.32">Ex 9:32</a>). <a href="?bref=Isa.28.24-28">Isaiah 28:24-28</a> summarizes the farmers’ work in growing and threshing various seed crops. Jews occasionally made bread from rye (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9">Ez 4:9</a>), but normally used it for cattle feed.</p>
<p class="h3">Other Seeds</p>
<p class="fl">Beans, lentils, and millet were ground and mixed to make a bread, along with wheat, barley, and spelt (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.9">Ez 4:9</a>). The prophet Ezekiel ate this concoction as a sign of the “defiled bread” the Jews would eat in captivity among the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="h3">Manna</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Num.11.8">Numbers 11:8</a> tells us that the people ground the manna in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made loaves of bread. However, in its prime state God called it bread (see <a href="?bref=Exod.16.4-32">Ex 16:4-32</a>). It appeared as coriander seed (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.31">Ex 16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Nm 11:7</a>); therefore, the dull white grains were smaller than wheat. The Hebrews complained they had not bread, and their souls hated “this light bread” (<a href="?bref=Num.21.5">Nm 21:5</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The psalmist called it “the bread of the angels” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.25">Ps 78:25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="EquipmentUsedinMakingBread">Equipment Used in Making Bread</p>
<p class="fl">Bas-reliefs in Egyptian mastaba tombs illustrate most of the equipment used in ancient Near Eastern bakeries.</p>
<p class="h3">Sieve</p>
<p class="fl">A wicker strainerlike device helped separate small impurities from the grain.</p>
<p class="h3">Grindstones</p>
<p class="fl">A pair of stones were shaped so that a top stone turned against the bottom stone, crushing grain into flour.</p>
<p class="h3">Jars</p>
<p class="fl">Clay jars contained olive oil, water, and liquid leaven to be mixed with the flour to make dough (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.4">Lv 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.12-16">1 Kgs 17:12-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Bowls</p>
<p class="fl">Kneading bowls (<a href="?bref=Exod.8.3">Ex 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.34">12:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.5,17">Dt 28:5, 17</a>), boards or tables made of wood, provided space for a thorough mixing of ingredients.</p>
<p class="h3">Pans</p>
<p class="fl">The poor used heated flat stones or the inside walls of their ovens as baking pans. Most people used iron griddles, plates, or pans (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.5">Lv 2:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.21">6:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.8">Nm 11:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.31">1 Chr 9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.29">23:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.13">2 Chr 35:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.4.3">Ez 4:3</a>). These were often flat, with handles up to five feet (1.5 meters) long. The dough placed on the griddle was ready for the heat.</p>
<p class="h3">Ovens</p>
<p class="fl">Sometimes ovens had a chamber separated from the fire, but usually not. A fire of wood, dried grass (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.30">Mt 6:30</a>), or dung (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.12,15">Ez 4:12, 15</a>) heated the oven (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.4">Lv 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.11.35">11:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.26.26">26:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.7.4-7">Hos 7:4-7</a>). While the coals and oven walls retained their heat, the plate carrying bread was inserted. Flat, hard unleavened cakes, or small leavened cakes (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.17">Mt 14:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.38">Mk 6:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.13">Lk 9:13</a>) were done in a few minutes. Large loaves about one foot in diameter would swell to more than three inches (7.6 centimeters) thick, would weigh more than two pounds (.9 kilogram), and required about 45 minutes for baking (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.17">1 Sm 17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1">2 Sm 16:1</a>).</p>

  <title>Bread of the Presence</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BREAD OF THE PRESENCE</p>
<p class="fl">Loaves of bread placed on a special table in the sanctuary or Holy Place of the tabernacle and later in the temple. Two other terms in the OT are used to describe the “bread of the Presence,” which means bread that has been set before the Lord’s face (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.23,30">Ex 25:23, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.13">35:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.39.36">39:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.48">1 Kgs 7:48</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.19">2 Chr 4:19</a>). The term “showbread” (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “shewbread”) refers to the arrangement of the bread in rows on the table (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.32">1 Chr 9:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.29">23:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.16">28:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.4">2 Chr 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.11">13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.18">29:18</a>).</p>
<p>Although the table of showbread, the altar of incense, and the golden lampstand were not in the Holy of Holies, they were nevertheless considered to be in the presence of God. As an offering placed before the presence of God, the loaves were considered holy and could be eaten only by priests. Later in Israel’s history, provision for offering the bread of the Presence as well as other temple services was financed by a tax of one-third shekel upon all citizens (<a href="?bref=Neh.10.32-33">Neh 10:32-33</a>).</p>
<p>The bread of the Presence consisted of 12 very large loaves, each made of one-fifth ephah of fine flour. Since an ephah was just over a bushel, two and a half bushels (30.3 liters) of finely ground wheat were required to make the 12 loaves. They were sprinkled with frankincense, arranged in two rows, the one leaning against the other, and placed on the table of showbread (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.5-9">Lv 24:5-9</a>). Arranged in that way, the bread became an “offering of food” to the Lord. The loaves were changed weekly on the Sabbath day.</p>
<p>The bread of the Presence is featured in one incident recalled in the NT. The tabernacle was at Nob when David was fleeing from the presence of King Saul. David went to Ahimelech, the priest, in search of food (<a href="?bref=1Sam.21.1-6">1 Sm 21:1-6</a>). Ahimelech had only the showbread, which he agreed to share with David’s men, provided they had been sexually continent for a period of time before their eating. Jesus later referred to the incident as a parallel to his own ministry of supplying the needs of those who followed him (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-8">Mt 12:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.25-26">Mk 2:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.1-5">Lk 6:1-5</a>). As God’s anointed, David and his men were permitted to eat the holy bread. Likewise Jesus, God’s anointed one, provided for the needs of others in spite of the Sabbath regulations.</p>

<p class="h1">BRIBE, BRIBERY</p>
<p class="fl">To give a person in authority something valuable in order to influence that person’s decision or action. Bribery was prohibited under OT law (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.8">Ex 23:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.19">Dt 16:19</a>) and condemned by the prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.23">Is 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.12">Am 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.11">Mi 3:11</a>). Although Samuel denied that he ever took a bribe (<a href="?bref=1Sam.12.3">1 Sm 12:3</a>), his sons did not maintain the same standard (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.3">8:3</a>).</p>
<p>The distinction between bribery and merely giving gifts was not always clear. Hence, giving something valuable is seen as a way to prevent unwanted conflict (<a href="?bref=Pr.21.14">Prv 21:14</a>). Giving a gift is described (with neither approval nor condemnation) as a way to get ahead (<a href="?bref=Pr.18.16">18:16</a>).</p>
<p>For the most part, bribery is seen in the Bible as despicable. “The wicked accept secret bribes to pervert justice” (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.23">Prv 17:23</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Any system that legitimizes bribery gives the rich an unfair advantage in persuading leaders and judges; the poor find it difficult to get a fair hearing. Innocent people who are poor can be condemned; guilty people who are rich can offer a sizable bribe and go free (<a href="?bref=Ps.15.5">Ps 15:5b</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.23">Is 5:23</a>). In extreme cases, bribes are said to have been used to hire killers (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.25">Dt 27:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.12">Ez 22:12</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Oblong block of shaped mud or clay that has been dried either by the sun or by burning in a kiln for use in building or paving, and the furnace in which bricks are burned and hardened. Brick was the most extensively used building material in the ancient biblical world, especially common in Babylonia. The Hebrew word for “brick” is taken from a verb meaning “to be white,” referring to the appearance of the clay out of which brick was made.</p>
<p>In Babylonia, stone suitable for building was seldom at hand, so Babylonian architects used it sparingly, usually for lintels, thresholds, and door hinges. Babylonian bricks were made from the mud or clay of marshes and plains, after removing foreign substances such as pebbles. The clay was mixed with chopped straw or grass that, on decaying, released acids that gave the substance greater moldability. The brick maker added water, kneaded the mixture by foot, and molded it into square bricks, each about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30.5 centimeters) across and 3 to 4 inches (7 to 10 centimeters) thick. The bricks were frequently stamped with a wooden block bearing the name of the reigning king (e.g., Sargon). Some peasant houses found near Babylon today have bricks containing King Nebuchadnezzar’s stamp.</p>
<p>Babylonian bricks were commonly burned in brick kilns rather than sun-dried. Sun-dried bricks disintegrated easily in heavy rainfall, whereas bricks burned in a kiln were virtually indestructible. Kiln-burnt bricks were used especially for facings, pavements, and important buildings. Archaeological remains of many brick kilns have been found in Babylonia.</p>
<p>Evidence exists of walls, temples, and storehouses constructed of brick in ancient Egypt, although almost no brick kilns (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “brickkiln”) have been found. Egyptian bricks were usually sun-dried rather than burned. Clay bricks were sometimes made without straw, but bricks made of mud from the Nile River required straw to keep them from falling apart. Egyptian bricks were rectangular, ranging from about 4 to 20 inches (10 to 51 centimeters) long, about 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 centimeters) wide, and about 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 centimeters) thick. Egyptian bricks were also often stamped with an identifying seal.</p>
<p>The Egyptians regarded brick making as a lowly occupation to be imposed upon slaves. Thus, during their bondage in Egypt, the Israelites were forced to make bricks (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.11-14">Ex 1:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.5.6-19">5:6-19</a>). Their suffering was increased by denying them the usual supplement of straw, since they had to take time to locate their own straw while keeping up the required production quota. The Israelites carried the art of brick making back to the Promised Land at the exodus.</p>

<p class="h1">BRIDE OF CHRIST*</p>
<p class="fl">One of the NT metaphors for the church. In it Christ is pictured as a husband, and the church as his bride.</p>
<p>Addressing the church at Corinth, the apostle Paul referred to himself as the one who gave the church to Christ, presenting her as a pure bride to her one husband (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.2-3">2 Cor 11:2-3</a>). In ancient Near Eastern culture the father gave his daughter in marriage to the bridegroom, assuring him of her purity. To Paul, understanding himself as the church’s spiritual father (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.15">1 Cor 4:15</a>), the thought of the church as his daughter sprang readily to mind. To be Christ’s pure bride requires the church to have pure and simple devotion. Like a concerned father, Paul was worried that the young bride (the church) might commit adultery by her willingness to accept “another Jesus,” “another Spirit,” or “a different gospel” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.4">2 Cor 11:4</a>). As between marriage partners, the relation between the church and Christ is governed by a covenant of mutual faithfulness. Disloyalty shatters the covenant.</p>
<p>The OT furnished Paul a rich background for that image of the church. God’s covenant with Israel was commonly pictured as a marriage pledge, with Israel as God’s bride. Through the prophet Jeremiah, the Lord said to Israel: “I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride” (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.2">Jer 2:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). He went on to lament the fact that Israel had been faithless; by going after other gods, she had actually prostituted herself and become an adulteress (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.6-9,20">Jer 3:6-9, 20</a>).</p>
<p>The theme of Israel’s desertion of her lover (God) was explicitly treated in <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.1-63">Ezekiel 16</a> and in Hosea. The terms “harlotry” and “whoredom” were used to connote disloyalty to Yahweh and allegiance to other gods. Thus, adultery and idolatry became synonymous. Through his own struggles with a faithless wife, the prophet Hosea experienced God’s agony over his bride Israel and his longing for her to return. Hosea was given a vision of a future day in which God would betroth his people to him forever in steadfast love and faithfulness (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.19-20">Hos 2:19-20</a>). That vision may have enabled Paul to transfer the image of Israel as God’s bride to the church as the bride of Christ.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Eph.5.22-33">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>, the relationship between Christ and his church is compared to the relationship between a husband and wife. The image is taken from the common understanding of the husband-wife relationship in that part of the world. The church’s submission to Christ is compared with the wife’s submission to the husband, but the stress of the passage is on the role of the husband: he is to love her as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Christ relates to the whole church on the basis of self-sacrificial love. Just as a husband is joined to his wife, with a mutual interdependence so intimate that they become one, so Christ and his church become one body. As the man’s love for his wife intends her wholeness, so Christ’s love of the church intends her completeness.</p>
<p>A variation on the theme is found in John the Baptist’s testimony to Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.3.29">Jn 3:29</a>). John saw himself as “the Bridegroom’s friend” who, according to Jewish custom, takes care of the wedding arrangements. The Messiah is identified with the bridegroom to whom the bride (his messianic community) belongs and who comes to claim that bride.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-21">Revelation 19</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">21</a> the metaphor of the church as the Messiah’s bride is further developed. The vision in <a href="?bref=Rev.19.7-8">Revelation 19:7-8</a> announces the marriage of the Lamb (Christ) to the bride (church). In <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">Revelation 21</a> the vision depicts the new Jerusalem coming down from heaven, “prepared as a bride adorned for her husband” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">2</a>). Then the seer is invited to behold “the Bride, the wife of the Lamb” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.21.9">9</a>) and to see the Holy City “coming down out of heaven from God” (v <a href="?bref=Rev.21.10">10</a>). The new Jerusalem is identified as the people of God, the bride of Christ, among whom and with whom God will be present forever.</p>

Cast from bronze and about three inches (7.6 centimeters) thick (a handbreadth), it was mounted on 12 bronze oxen (three facing in each compass direction) in the courtyard at the southeast corner of the sanctuary.

<p class="h1">BRONZE SERPENT, BRONZE SNAKE</p>
<p class="fl">Piece of sculpture that God commanded Moses to make when the Israelites were being bitten by “fiery serpents” (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Nm 21:4-9</a>). The serpents had been sent as a judgment because the people were grumbling against God and against Moses. When the people repented, God ordered the replica made; those who looked at it were healed.</p>
<p>Some connect the theological meaning of the scene with an episode in which Moses’ rod became a serpent, swallowed up the serpent-rods of the Pharaoh’s magicians, and then became a rod again (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.8-12">Ex 7:8-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.4.2-5,28-30">4:2-5, 28-30</a>). The serpent was a deified figure in both the Egyptian and Canaanite religions. Therefore, the triumph of God’s serpent figure typified the superiority of the Lord over the pagan gods. In <a href="?bref=Num.21.1-35">Numbers 21</a>, however, such a realization must have been secondary. That event was the last of a number of “apostasies” in the wilderness (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.9">1 Cor 10:9</a>), all of which included four elements: complaints against God, judgment, repentance, and forgiveness or deliverance. The major theological theme is not the Lord’s superiority but his provision of salvation. The stress was not on a magical formula for healing, but rather on the serpent as a symbol of salvation offered to all who would focus on it.</p>
<p>The bronze serpent appears again in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kings 18:4</a>. In the intervening centuries it had become an idolatrous object, and King Hezekiah (716–686 <span class="era">BC</span>) of the southern kingdom of Judah abolished it in his reform movement. The final reference to it in pre-Christian literature is in the apocryphal book Wisdom of Solomon, which supports the above interpretation: salvation came not through the serpent but through God’s provision. “He who turned towards it was healed, not by what he saw, but by you, the Savior of all” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.16.7">Wisd of Sol 16:7</a>).</p>
<p>Against this background, Christ said that he, like Moses’ serpent, must be lifted up (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>). The “lifting up” of the “Son of Man” is a definite reference to Christ’s death and has two foci. One is a “death as salvation” theme, seen in the Mosaic serpent imagery and the divine imperative “must” (in Jn referring to the necessity of God’s ordained plan of salvation). The other is a “death as exaltation” theme, seen in the verb itself (containing the idea of majesty) and in John’s stress on the glory of Jesus’ earthly ministry and of his resurrected status.</p>

<p class="fl">Man or boy in his relationship to the other children of his parents; also a close male friend or fellow member of the same race, creed, profession, organization, and the like; a kinsman.</p>
<p>In the OT the Hebrew word translated “brother” describes the relationship between male children who have at least one parent in common. Joseph and Benjamin were children of Jacob and Rachel (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.24">Gn 35:24</a>), but the other sons born to Jacob are also called Joseph’s brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.6">42:6</a>). The love Joseph had for Benjamin is not always found between brothers. Cain killed his brother Abel (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.8">4:8</a>), and Esau hated his brother, Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.41">27:41</a>). A brother may be a bad influence (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.6-7">Dt 13:6-7</a>), but ideally he is one who helps in times of need (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.17">Prv 17:17</a>). The law of levirate marriage required that if a man died leaving a childless widow, the man’s brother had to raise up children through her to perpetuate the family name (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5">Dt 25:5</a>).</p>
<p>David spoke affectionately of his “brother” Jonathan, although they were not related (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.26">2 Sm 1:26</a>). A fellow Israelite could be called brother. The relationship required certain obligations: money could not be loaned to a brother at interest, and a brother could not be enslaved (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.35-43">Lv 25:35-43</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the Greek word is used to describe natural brothers, such as Andrew and Peter (<a href="?bref=John.1.41">Jn 1:41</a>). Four brothers of Jesus are named (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>). (The Roman Catholic view is that they were really Jesus’ cousins, but the Greek language has several words for cousin, and the word “brother” is used here; thus, it refers either to children or foster children of Mary and Joseph.) Jesus’ brothers did not believe in him at first (<a href="?bref=John.7.5">Jn 7:5</a>), but after the resurrection they were meeting with the Christian community (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.14">Acts 1:14</a>). Jesus taught that his disciples had one Father (God) and were therefore brothers (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.8-9">Mt 23:8-9</a>), and he graciously identified himself with the disciples as their brother (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.10">28:10</a>).</p>
<p>Early in the history of the church it became customary for Christians to address one another as brother (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.17">Acts 9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.1">Col 1:1</a>); on two occasions the Christian community is called “the brotherhood” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.17">1 Pt 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.9">5:9</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Specific duties and responsibilities accompany Christian brotherhood. A Christian’s love for his brother will be demonstrated in the restraint of sexual passions (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.6">1 Thes 4:6</a>), provision of material goods when needed (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.15-16">Jas 2:15-16</a>), and determination not to offend (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.13">Rom 14:13</a>). A Christian must not “go to law” against a brother (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.5-6">1 Cor 6:5-6</a>), but brothers must resolve their problems either personally or within the church group (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.15-17">Mt 18:15-17</a>). The relationship between Christians is significant because a Christian cannot offer worship to God if he is out of harmony with his brother (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.23-24">Mt 5:23-24</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Designation of those in the household of God. Good evidence exists that Jews at the time of Jesus frequently referred to themselves as brothers (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.29,37">Acts 2:29, 37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.2">7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.5">22:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.21">28:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.3">Rom 9:3</a>). From the beginning it seemed natural for Jewish Christians to call each other “brothers” (that is, “siblings”—the term included both male and female; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.15-16">Acts 1:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.30">9:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.1">11:1</a>). Members of gentile religious communities also called each other brothers, so the name found a home in the gentile churches as well (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.14">Acts 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.13">Rom 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1,10">1 Cor 1:1, 10</a>; plus dozens of other places in Paul’s letters to gentile churches). In fact, along with “disciple” (in Acts) and “saint” (always plural in the writings of Paul and the book of Revelation), it was one of the most popular names for Christians and the only one used in James and 1 John.</p>
<p>Each Christian was called “brother,” and the Christians collectively were “the brothers.” The name stressed the intimacy of the Christian community. That is, the relationship of believers to one another was as close as that of blood kin (closer, in fact—<a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-31">Mk 10:23-31</a>). In 1 John and James the name underlines the claim that poorer Christians have upon those better off (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.15">Jas 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.10-18">1 Jn 3:10-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.20-21">4:20-21</a>).

They are described as visiting Jesus with Mary, his mother (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.47-50">Mt 12:47-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.34-35">Mk 3:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.19-21">Lk 8:19-21</a>), and hearing Jesus’ statement that all who did the will of God were brother, sister, and mother to him.</p>
<p>They were well enough known in Nazareth that when Jesus returned to preach there, the people said, “Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In Matthew’s Gospel the order of the names of the last two brothers is reversed (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>). When Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum, they were accompanied by Mary and his brothers (<a href="?bref=John.2.12">Jn 2:12</a>). Just before the Feast of Tabernacles the brothers visited Jesus to persuade him to go to Jerusalem for the festival. Although they were skeptical about his miracles, they said he should perform his feats in public to gain recognition (<a href="?bref=John.7.4">Jn 7:4</a>). Jesus acknowledged opposition from within his family when he said, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family” (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.57">Mt 13:57</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). His brothers or other friends from home thought him to be losing touch with reality when crowds were first attracted to him (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.21">Mk 3:21</a>).</p>
<p>In spite of their earlier skepticism, however, the brothers became active members of the Jerusalem church during its earliest days. They are mentioned as being frequently at prayer in an upper room with Mary, showing a sharp reversal from their earlier lack of faith (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.14">Acts 1:14</a>). One of the resurrection appearances was made to James (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.7">1 Cor 15:7</a>). On Paul’s return to Jerusalem after his conversion, he met Peter and James, “the Lord’s brother,” but not the other apostles (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.19">Gal 1:19</a>). When the apostle Peter was released from prison, he went to the home of Mary the mother of John Mark, and despite the excitement of the occasion, he immediately asked the group to “tell this to James and to the brethren” (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.17">Acts 12:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). A number of references in Acts show James as a strong, respected leader of the Jerusalem church (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.13-21">Acts 15:13-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.18">21:18</a>). In the council at Jerusalem, he expressed a strong opinion on the acceptance of Gentiles into the church; he was later visited by Paul, who told him about his ministry and the many conversions among the Gentiles. Although James is mentioned more often by name, all the brothers seem to have been well respected at that time. Thus, their actions were used as an example by Paul when he argued that it would be appropriate for him also to have a wife accompany him on his journeys, as Jesus’ brothers did (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">1 Cor 9:5</a>).</p>
<p>The author of the Epistle of James is generally assumed to be the Lord’s brother, although he does not identify himself specifically that way (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">1:1</a>). It seems clear, though, that the author wrote as a recognized leader in the church; hence, to identify him as the Lord’s brother seems logical. The author of the Epistle of Jude identifies himself as the brother of James. The reference would most logically be to James, the leader mentioned in Acts and probably the author of the other epistle. The author thus seems to be the Judas named as the brother of the Lord in the Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>).</p>
<p>Throughout the NT the group of the 12 apostles is consistently distinguished from the brothers of the Lord. Luke named the apostles and then said, “All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.13-14">Acts 1:13-14</a>). The apostle Paul pointed to the brothers of the Lord as a group separate from the apostles (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">1 Cor 9:5</a>); each mention of them in the Gospels describes them as family members and distinct from the disciples.</p>

  <title>Burial, Burial Customs*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BURIAL, BURIAL CUSTOMS*</p>
<p class="fl">The Bible makes frequent reference to burial practices. A society’s burial customs are a reflection of its views about death and the afterlife. The ancient Egyptians, for example, thought of life after death as a continuation of physical activities in another realm, as evidenced by their elaborately furnished tombs. The ancient Hebrews emphasized a more spiritual concept of union or fellowship of the departed with generations gone on before.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GravesandTombs">Graves and Tombs</p>
<p class="fl">Among the Hebrews, location of burial plots was generally determined on a family basis. The OT contains many references to an Israelite’s desire to be buried in the family burying place, describing his death as “going to his fathers” (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.15">Gn 15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.22">1 Kgs 13:22</a>).</p>
<p>The cave of Machpelah at Hebron was one example of family “cohabitation” of a tomb for a succession of generations. Abraham purchased the site from Ephron the Hittite at the time of Sarah’s death (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">Gn 23</a>). When Abraham died, Isaac and Ishmael laid his body in the same tomb (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.9">25:9</a>), and there Jacob in turn buried his parents, Isaac and Rebekah, as well as Jacob’s wife Leah (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.31">49:31</a>). After his death, Jacob’s body was buried with his father’s in accord with his own request (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.29">49:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.50.13">50:13</a>). Jacob’s son Joseph made his kinsmen promise that his remains would be preserved so they could be carried back to the homeland when God enabled his people to return from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.25">50:25</a>). Samuel is spoken of as being buried in his house at Ramah, evidently referring to a family graveyard plot (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1">1 Sm 25:1</a>). Joab was buried in his own house in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.34">1 Kgs 2:34</a>). King Manasseh was buried in the garden of his palace (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.18">2 Kgs 21:18</a>), and Joshua in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.30">Jos 24:30</a>). Kings were careful to perpetuate their memory by special burial sites, often in the City of David (the part of Jerusalem on the southeastern ridge first occupied by that great king). King Josiah designated his burial place in advance, most likely an ancestral tomb (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.30">2 Kgs 23:30</a>).</p>
<p>Individual burial sites, such as that of Deborah near Bethel (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.8">Gn 35:8</a>) and of Rachel on the road to Ephrath (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.1,20">Gn 35:1, 20</a>), were an exception necessitated by sudden death at some distance from the family tomb.</p>
<p>Bodies were buried in tombs, that is, natural caves or rock-hewn sepulchers, such as that belonging to Joseph of Arimathea where the body of Jesus was laid (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.59-60">Mt 27:59-60</a>). They were also buried in shallow graves covered with rock heaps, serving both to mark them and to prevent desecration of the body by animals.</p>
<p>Some graves were marked by a monument erected in love (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.20">Gn 35:20</a>) and honor (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.17">2 Kgs 23:17</a>), but stones were sometimes heaped on a dishonorable burial place, as in the case of Achan (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.26">Jos 7:26</a>) and Absalom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.17">2 Sm 18:17</a>). Tombs were often adorned or embellished, sometimes whitewashed, in part to warn against ceremonial contamination prohibited by Mosaic law. Jesus spoke of such embellishment in a rebuke of the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.27">Mt 23:27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TreatmentoftheCorpse">Treatment of the Corpse</p>
<p class="fl">The assurance given by God to Jacob that “Joseph’s hand shall close your eyes” (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.4">Gn 46:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) probably alludes to the custom of a near relative closing the eyes of one who died with a fixed stare. Close relatives might also literally embrace and kiss the body immediately upon expiration. The body was washed and dressed in the deceased one’s clothing. Pins and other ornaments found in excavated tombs are evidence that the dead were buried fully clothed. Soldiers were buried in full regalia, with shields covering or cradling the armored bodies, their swords under their heads (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.27">Ez 32:27</a>).</p>
<p>Embalming was not a usual practice in Israel. Egyptian treatment for Jacob and Joseph was the exception rather than the rule. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Egyptians commenced embalming procedures by removing the brain from the cranium through the nasal apertures, piecemeal, using a long curved hook. When this had been done, the cranial cavity was rinsed out with a mixture of resins and spices. The corpse was eviscerated, and the entrails were placed in four canopic jars. The body was soaked in a solution of natron for a period of from 40 to 80 days, depending on the cost of the burial. At the time of interment, the corpse was wrapped in strips of fine linen cloth from head to foot and put in an anthropoid coffin. The canopic jars were placed in the tomb along with the body, symbolizing the reuniting of the personality and its survival after death.</p>
<p>Cremation of the bodies of Saul and his sons (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.12-13">1 Sm 31:12-13</a>) was also an exception to normal practice. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote that in contrast with Roman custom, Jewish piety required the burying rather than burning of dead bodies. Under Mosaic law such burning was reserved as a sentence of judgment (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.9">Lv 21:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.25">Jos 7:25</a>).</p>
<p>After preparation of the body, it was carried on a bier (a simple frame with carrying poles) without being placed in a coffin. The body was laid either in a prepared niche in the wall of a rock-hewn chamber or directly in a shallow grave dug in a burial plot. Neither bier nor any form of casket entered the pit with the corpse. The spices used as a perfume and temporary deterrent to decay cannot properly be considered an attempt at embalming (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mk 16:1</a>).</p>
<p>As we know from the Gospel record of Jesus’ burial, some cave tombs had a seal at the doorway, either a hinged wooden door or a flat stone shaped so it could be rolled into place. Such a stone seal could be reopened only with extreme effort (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.46">Mk 15:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.3-4">16:3-4</a>). By NT times the Jews sometimes economized on the use of a family tomb by placing the dry bones of formerly buried relatives in ossuaries. These boxlike receptacles were probably an adaptation of chests used by the Romans for holding ashes after a cremation.</p>
<p>Under Mosaic legislation, ceremonial defilement was contracted either through physical contact with the corpse or by participation in the formalities of mourning. Especially stringent prohibitions applied to the priests of Israel. The high priest himself could have nothing at all to do with mourning. In particular, he “must never defile himself by going near a dead person, even if it is his father or mother. He must not desecrate the sanctuary of his God by leaving it to attend his parents’ funeral, because he has been made holy by the anointing oil of his God” (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.10-12">Lv 21:10-12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Although the customs and procedures were evidently modified little from OT to NT times, some added details are given in the NT record. For example, it is noted that the corpse was washed (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.37">Acts 9:37</a>). The body was then anointed and wrapped in linen cloths with spices enclosed (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mk 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.40">Jn 19:40</a>). Finally, the limbs were tightly bound and the head covered with a separate piece of cloth (<a href="?bref=John.11.44">Jn 11:44</a>).</p>

  <title>Burning Bush</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">BURNING BUSH</p>
<p class="fl">Flaming bush on Mt Horeb, where Moses experienced God’s presence and received the commission to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-15">Ex 3:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.26">Mk 12:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.37">Lk 20:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.30-34">Acts 7:30-34</a>). The enigma of a plant burning without being consumed provided the opportunity for God to reveal his name, “<span class="divine-name">I Am Who I Am</span>.” The burning bush was a theophany, a visible revelation of God’s glory. Association of clouds, fire, and smoke with the manifestation of God’s glory is a common biblical theme (see <a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">Ex 13:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.18">19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10-11">1 Kgs 8:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.12">2 Kgs 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.11">2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-6">Is 6:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.7">2 Thes 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.14">Rv 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.12">19:12</a>).</p>
<p>The burning bush was also symbolic of God’s holiness. Moses was commanded not to approach, but to remove his shoes because the place where he was standing was holy ground (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.5">Ex 3:5</a>). Unlike the gods of Egypt, who were pictured as living in gloomy darkness, Israel’s God revealed himself as one who lives in unapproachable light (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.16">1 Tm 6:16</a>). The burning bush evidently symbolized his intent not to consume or destroy his people, but to be their savior, to lead them out of bondage in Egypt and into the Promised Land.</p>
