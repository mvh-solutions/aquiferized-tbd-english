<p class="h1">ZAANAN</p>
<p class="fl">Village mentioned in Micah’s lament over Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.11">Mi 1:11</a>). Zaanan is probably a play on the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">yatsa’</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to come forth.” The village was in the Shephelah; it is probably the same place as Zenan.</p>

<p class="h1">ZAANANNIM</p>
<p class="fl">One of the markers of the border of Naphtali listed between Heleph and Adami-nekeb (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.33">Jos 19:33</a>). <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a> puts it near Kedesh. There Sisera took refuge in the tent of Heber the Kenite and was killed by Jael (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11-21">11-21</a>). While the precise location is not known, it was west of Lake el-Huleh (modern Merom) in a region that was probably marshy in ancient times. Though the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates the text as “plain of Zaanaim,” it is more likely “Oak of Zaanannim” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Since many terebinth trees are located in the region, the text is probably referring to a terebinth set aside as a sacred tree.</p>

<p class="h1">ZACCHAEUS</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish tax collector who collected taxes for the Romans at Jericho. He probably secured this position by purchasing the exclusive right to collect revenue in that region or by working as a subcontractor for another affluent official. In either case, Zacchaeus himself accrued great wealth (largely by illegitimate means) from his customs enterprise. Jericho, a significant center of commerce, was situated along a major trade route connecting Jerusalem and its environs with the lands east of the Jordan.</p>
<p>In his Gospel, Luke records Zacchaeus’s encounter with Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.2-8">Lk 19:2-8</a>). Seeking Jesus, but unable to see him over the crowd because of his small stature, Zacchaeus climbed a sycamore tree to get a better view when Jesus passed by. To his astonishment, Jesus stopped under the tree and after calling him down, invited himself to the publican’s house for the night. Subsequently, Zacchaeus repented and followed Jesus, promising to restore fourfold to those whom he had wrongfully exploited and give to the poor. According to Clement of Alexandria, Zacchaeus later became the bishop of Caesarea (<span class="ital">Homily</span> 3.63).</p>

  <title>Zadok</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ZADOK</p>
<p class="fl">Common OT name meaning “righteous one.”</p>
<p class="list-space">1. David’s priest, probably the most famous and influential of Israel’s high priests apart from Aaron. He first appeared at the time of Absalom’s revolt, when he and his fellow priest Abiathar showed their loyalty to David by coming to him with the ark, fully prepared to share his exile (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.24-29">2 Sm 15:24-29</a>). David refused their offer and sent them back to Jerusalem to act in his interests.</p>
<p class="list-text">In <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Samuel 8:17</a>, Zadok is listed as the son of Ahitub, who is noted in <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.3">1 Samuel 14:3</a> as the grandson of Eli. In the genealogies of Chronicles, Zadok’s descent through Ahitub is traced back to Eleazar, the eldest son of Aaron (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.1-8,50-53">1 Chr 6:1-8, 50-53</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.2-5">Ezr 7:2-5</a>), but with no reference to Eli. A slight problem emerges in that Zadok replaces the banished Abiathar, a descendant of Eli. This is regarded as the fulfillment of an earlier prophecy that the tenure of the high priestly office by Eli’s family would be broken in favor of a different branch of Aaron’s family (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.30-36">1 Sm 2:30-36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">1 Kgs 2:26-27</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In both summaries of David’s court officials (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.17">2 Sm 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.25">20:25</a>), Zadok is listed as one of David’s two principal priests, an office held throughout the latter part of David’s reign. When David was near death, a power struggle over the throne was precipitated by Adonijah, David’s oldest surviving son. With the support of Joab, the commander of the army, and the priest Abiathar, David’s long-standing friend, Adonijah declared himself king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.5-10">1 Kgs 1:5-10</a>). Nathan the prophet promptly intervened with Bathsheba as Solomon’s advocate. Zadok and Benaiah, the captain of the mercenary troops, supported Solomon. Adonijah’s cause was hopeless once David had indicated his approval of Nathan’s plans. Consequently, the discredited Abiathar was banished (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26-27">2:26-27</a>), leaving the loyal Zadok as Solomon’s chief priest (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.35">2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.4">4:4</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In the centuries that followed, the descendants of Zadok preserved this dominance, and as Jerusalem’s prestige increased, so did their status. Azariah, the chief priest in Hezekiah’s reign, was a Zadokite (<a href="?bref=2Chr.31.10">2 Chr 31:10</a>). Ezekiel restricted the main priestly functions to the “sons of Zadok,” demoting the Levites generally to the rank of “temple caretakers” because of their apostasy during the monarchy (<a href="?bref=Ezek.44.10-16">Ez 44:10-16</a>). When the Jews came under Seleucid domination in the early second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the high priesthood, regarded as a political appointment, was taken away from the Zadokites. Conservative elements, however, like the Qumran covenanters, continued to look for its restoration.</p>

Zalmon is also mentioned in connection with the defeat of Israel’s enemies in <a href="?bref=Ps.68.14">Psalm 68:14</a>. Because of the mention of snowfall and the “mighty mountain of Bashan” in the following verse, the Septuagint and some commentators consider this Zalmon to be Mt Hermon in Lebanon.

  <title>Zealot</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ZEALOT</p>
<p class="fl">Term used for the second Simon among the Twelve to distinguish him from Simon Peter (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Lk 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>). Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.4">Mt 10:4</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mk 3:18</a>) use “Cananaean”—Greek and Aramaic equivalents for “zealous defender, enthusiast, one eager to acquire, fanatic” (from root words meaning “burn with zeal, or jealousy; desire eagerly”; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.14">Ex 34:14</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.2">2 Macc 4:2</a>). In this general sense, Christ showed zeal for God’s house. Some were “zealots” for spiritual gifts, good works, goodness, and the law, as Paul was for the tradition of the fathers and for God (<a href="?bref=John.2.17">Jn 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.20">Acts 21:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">22:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.12">1 Cor 14:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.14">Gal 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.14">Ti 2:14</a>). So, Simon was distinguished from Peter and the others by his religious zeal.</p>
<p>By the time Luke wrote, the title “Zealot” had become attached especially to a militant, anti-Roman, revolutionary faction, equally religious and political in motivation. This party may have been founded in <span class="era">AD</span> 6, following the death of Herod the Great, by Judas the Galilean and Zadduk the Pharisee. The movement was rooted in Maccabean resistance to foreign rule and infiltration (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.15-28">1 Macc 2:15-28</a>). Zealot opposition to Roman rule was rooted in zeal for the Torah and for God the only King. The Zealot regarded himself as an agent of divine judgment and redemption, resolutely and fearlessly contending against idolatry, apostasy, and collaboration. The Zealots thought that the Messiah would become their leader.</p>
<p>As hostility between Rome and Judea sharpened, the religious motivation was channeled by nationalist feeling into a “holy war.” Whereas the Maccabees had been forced to take arms in self-defense, the Zealots became increasingly militaristic. Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.1.1-6; <span class="ital">War</span> 4.3.9), with some prejudice, calls them brigands and robbers. Their Latin name was <span class="ital">sicarii,</span> assassins, but supporters would call them patriotic guerrillas. They reached preeminence in the revolt against Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70). Their last refuge and stronghold, at Masada, was overcome in <span class="era">AD</span> 73, when the surviving 960 committed suicide.</p>
<p>Simon probably was, or had been, a member of this movement’s earlier phase, around <span class="era">AD</span> 30. It is less probable that Judas Iscariot (possibly Sicarius) and the “sons of thunder” (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mk 3:17</a>) were. Judas the Galilean (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.37-38">Acts 5:37-38</a>), and even Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.38">21:38</a>), were considered Zealots.</p>

<p class="h1">ZEBAH AND ZALMUNNA</p>
<p class="fl">Two Midianite kings who slaughtered Gideon’s brothers at Tabor. Gideon subsequently killed them in order to avenge his brothers’ deaths (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.18-21">Jgs 8:18-21</a>).</p>
<p>During Gideon’s day, Midianite camel raiders annually made forays into Israelite territory at harvesttime, stealing crops and livestock (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.3">Jgs 6:3</a>). So complete were their raids that nothing was left in Israel, including crops, sheep, oxen, or donkeys.</p>
<p>In this state of affairs God called Gideon to deliver Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.16">Jgs 6:16</a>). His well-known victory over Midian near Mt Moreh was an important step toward realization of this divine commission (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.1-23">7:1-23</a>). In the operations following the battle, Ephraimite warriors captured and assassinated two Midianite leaders named Zeeb and Oreb (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.24-8.3">7:24–8:3</a>).</p>
<p>Gideon determined to capture Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of the Midianite forces. In tracking them down, he crossed the Jordan River and traveled more than 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) from the site of the original battle. Along the way, two successive towns, Succoth and Penuel, refused to help Gideon and his men, doubtless fearing reprisal from the Midianite raiders should Gideon fail to defeat them.</p>
<p>Gideon routed the remaining Midianite warriors and captured Zebah and Zalmunna (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.12">Jgs 8:12</a>). Because Zebah and Zalmunna had killed his brothers, Gideon killed the two Midianite kings (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.8.19-21">19-21</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.83.11">Psalm 83:11</a> indicates that Zebah, Zalmunna, and the Midianites were the enemies not merely of Israel but also of God.</p>

After he goaded Gaal into attacking Abimelech outside of the city, Zebul shut Gaal out of the city, preventing retreat into its confines. It is difficult to determine Zebul’s fate when Abimelech later attacked and destroyed the city, but it is possible that he too met a treacherous fate.</p>

<p class="h1">ZEBULUN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of Jacob’s 12 sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.23">Gn 35:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1">1 Chr 2:1</a>). He was the sixth and last son borne to Jacob by Leah, who named the boy Zebulun, meaning “abode, dwelling,” for she said, “Now my husband will <span class="ital">dwell with</span> me, because I have borne him six sons” (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.20">Gn 30:20</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, emphasis added). Later, he settled his family in Egypt with Jacob and his brothers (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.3">Ex 1:3</a>). Jacob foretold that Zebulun’s descendants would become a maritime people with their border touching Sidon (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.13">Gn 49:13</a>). Though Zebulun’s tribe was separated from the Mediterranean by Asher’s tribe and from the Sea of Galilee by Naphtali, it prospered greatly in trade with the Canaanite cities of the coastal plains. Zebulun fathered three sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.14">Gn 46:14</a>) and founded one of Israel’s 12 tribes (<a href="?bref=Num.1.30-31">Nm 1:30-31</a>).</p>

  <title>Zebulun, Tribe of</title>

<p class="h1">ZEBULUN, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Tribe descended from Zebulun, the tenth son of Jacob and the sixth borne to him by Leah (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.19-20">Gn 30:19-20</a>). His tribe was divided into three clans named after his three sons: the Seredites, the Elonites, and the Jahleelites (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.14">Gn 46:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.27">Nm 26:27</a>). At the census taken on the plains of Moab, the number of men in the tribe over 20 years of age and fit for military service was 60,500 (<a href="?bref=Num.26.26-27">Nm 26:26-27</a>).</p>
<p>The territory allotted to Zebulun’s tribe was in central Canaan and included the valley of Jezreel, but the boundary lines given in <a href="?bref=Josh.19.10-16">Joshua 19:10-16</a> are difficult to trace because only the tribe’s southeastern and eastern borders are indicated. The western border on the Mediterranean side is not clearly defined. In the blessing of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.18-19">Dt 33:18-19</a>), Zebulun, along with Issachar, “shall draw out [lit. suck] the abundance of the sea,” which would seem to indicate that Zebulun would have access to the sea (Mediterranean) and therefore to the mercantile and maritime trade.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="LocationOfZebulun"/>
<p>The boundary details, however, do not bring Zebulun in touch geographically with the sea, in apparent contradiction to <a href="?bref=Gen.49.13">Genesis 49:13</a>. But this reference may not imply actual contact with the Mediterranean. Zebulun’s position did enable it to profit by maritime trade because the great caravan route to the sea passed through Zebulunite territory. In addition, Zebulun’s “lot,” with its fruitful fields and valleys, ensured olive groves, vineyards, and splendid harvests. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.12.40">1 Chronicles 12:40</a> the tribe was able to provide rich provisions for David. Throughout the centuries the tribe maintained its identity.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, the tribe of Zebulun held a strong position among its tribal neighbors around Galilee and was settled more securely. In contrast to the tribes of Asher and Naphtali, who continued to live among the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.32-33">Jgs 1:32-33</a>), the Canaanites constituted a minority in Zebulun. Throughout the period of the judges the tribe was very active. For example, the victorious army in the battle of Kishon was composed of men of Zebulun and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.6-10">4:6-10</a>); in the Song of Deborah, Zebulun is praised as a people that puts its life in jeopardy to the point of death (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.18">5:18</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Judg.6.35">Judges 6:35</a>, the men of Zebulun took part in Gideon’s struggle with the Midianites on the plain of Jezreel and fought with outstanding valor. The judge Elon belonged to the tribe of Zebulun (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.11-12">12:11-12</a>), and since Galilee was in the territory of Zebulun (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.15">Jos 19:15</a>), Ibzan of Bethlehem was probably also a Zebulunite. Another indication of the strength and importance of Zebulun’s tribe within the united kingdom period is found in the mention of Zebulun’s fighting force as the largest of the western tribal armies that fought under King David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.33">1 Chr 12:33</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT there are two references to Zebulun. The first notes Zebulun as a region into which Jesus, the great light, made an appearance (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13-15">Mt 4:13-15</a>). The second mention of Zebulun appears in the list of the 12 tribes in <a href="?bref=Rev.7.8">Revelation 7:8</a> after Issachar.</p>

<p class="list">14. Son of Jehoiada the priest, who rebuked the princes of Judah for turning against the Lord and worshiping false gods. Enraged by Zechariah’s rebuff, they conspired against him, and at King Joash’s command, stoned him to death in the court of the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20-22">2 Chr 24:20-22</a>). The Lord, however, avenged Zechariah’s death by allowing the Syrians to defeat Judah, kill the princes, and severely wound Joash, who was subsequently killed by two of his own servants.</p>
<p class="list-text">In his castigation of his own generation of Jewish leaders, Jesus alluded to Zechariah’s shameful murder in the temple’s sacred precincts: “You will become guilty of murdering all the godly people from righteous Abel to Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered in the Temple between the altar and the sanctuary” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.35">Mt 23:35</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Abel was the first and Zechariah the last of the recorded prophets of God who were unjustly slain, according to the OT.</p>

<p class="list">18. Kohathite Levite who was appointed to oversee the repair of the temple during King Josiah’s reign (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.12">2 Chr 34:12</a>).</p>

<p class="list">20. Prophet, Berechiah’s son and the grandson of Iddo, who began prophesying as a young man in 520 <span class="era">BC</span> during the reign of King Darius I of Persia (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">Zec 1:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Zech.2.4">2:4</a>). Little is known about the prophet. He ministered with Haggai, his contemporary, in postexilic Jerusalem during the days of Zerubbabel, the governor, and Jeshua, the high priest (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1">Ezr 5:1</a>). He exhorted the Jews to finish building the second temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.14">6:14</a>) and headed Iddo’s priestly family during Joiakim’s term as high priest (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.16">Neh 12:16</a>). Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah served as both priest and prophet (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1,7">Zec 1:1, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.1,8">7:1, 8</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Numerous suggestions have been offered to resolve the discrepancy of Zechariah’s pedigree. In the Ezra and Nehemiah passages, Iddo is listed as his father, whereas in Zechariah, Berechiah is the father. Some conclude that Berechiah and Iddo were different names for the same person, or that Berechiah’s name (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1,7">Zec 1:1, 7</a>) was a later scribal emendation that confused Jeberechiah’s son with Iddo’s son (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.8.2">Is 8:2</a>). A more plausible theory identifies Iddo as Zechariah’s grandfather, the renowned head of his family, who returned to Jerusalem from exile in 538 <span class="era">BC</span>. Either by Berechiah’s early death or by the precedence of his grandfather’s name, Zechariah was considered Iddo’s successor.</p>

<p class="list">32. John the Baptist’s father, priest of Abijah’s division, and the husband of Elizabeth, a woman of priestly descent.

They lived in the Judean hill country during King Herod the Great’s reign (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Lk 1:5</a>). Zechariah and Elizabeth both lived righteous and pious lives; however, they were advanced in years and still had no children.</p>
<p class="list-text">As priest, Zechariah was one of the men chosen to represent his division in its yearly appointed session of service in the Jerusalem temple (the priests of Israel were divided into 24 orders, each being assigned an annual two-week period of service in the temple). One day while serving in Jerusalem, Zechariah was selected by lot to burn incense in the temple’s Holy Place, a privilege granted to a priest only once in his lifetime. While performing this temple duty, the angel Gabriel appeared to him, telling him that Elizabeth his wife, though barren, would bear him a son, whose name would be called John and who would prepare the way for the Messiah. As a sign confirming the angel’s report, Zechariah was made mute for his disbelief that, in their old age, he and Elizabeth would produce a child. When Zechariah returned to the temple court, the gathered multitude perceived that the gesturing priest had seen a vision.</p>
<p class="list-text">Elizabeth became pregnant as promised and in her sixth month was visited by her relative Mary, who was also with child. Later, shortly after the baby’s birth, Zechariah affirmed that his son’s name would be John, at which time his speech was restored and he was filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesying and praising God for the work that he was about to do in Israel.</p>

<p class="h1">ZECHARIAH, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Longest book of the Minor Prophets and the most difficult to understand. One reason for this difficulty is the numerous visions that call for an interpreter. At times an interpreting angel is present to tell what the vision means (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.9-10,19-20">Zec 1:9-10, 19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.1-6">4:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.5.5-6">5:5-6</a>), but at other times, when an interpretation is really needed, there is no angel to give one. The obscure meaning of many passages has spawned numerous theories concerning the date, authorship, unity, and interpretation of this book. One thing that makes the book of Zechariah significant for the Christian is its use in the NT. The last part of Zechariah (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-11.17">9–11</a>) is the most quoted section of the Prophets in the Gospel Passion narratives, and, other than Ezekiel, Zechariah influenced the book of Revelation more than any other OT book.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The name Zechariah probably means “the Lord remembers” or “the Lord is renowned.” Zechariah is a common name in the OT and NT. At least 30 different people in the OT are named Zechariah. There is a problem in identifying the prophet’s father. In <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">Zechariah 1:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Zech.1.7">1:7</a>, the prophet is called “the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo,” but in <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1">Ezra 5:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.14">6:14</a> he is called simply “the son of Iddo.” There was another Zechariah in Isaiah’s time whose father was named Jeberechiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.2">Is 8:2</a>). Another prophet by the name of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, lived much earlier during the reign of Joash, king of Judah (835–796 <span class="era">BC</span>). This prophet was stoned to death because he proclaimed that the Lord had forsaken his people because of their sins (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20-22">2 Chr 24:20-22</a>). Jesus seemed to refer to this or a similar unrecorded incident, but he calls the prophet the son of Berechiah, the last of the martyrs among the prophets (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.35">Mt 23:35</a>). However, Luke’s account of what Jesus said about Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.51">Lk 11:51</a>) does not include the words “the son of Berechiah.” Since Jesus was quoting 2 Chronicles, which was the last book in the Hebrew Bible, he was simply indicating the sweep of time from the first murder (Abel) to the last (Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada). There is no evidence that the prophet of the book of Zechariah was martyred; therefore, the best solution to the problem is to consider Berechiah the father, and Iddo the grandfather, of this prophet.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The first part of the book of Zechariah (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-8.56">1–8</a>) is easy to date. The first date is in the first verse, “the eighth month of the second year of Darius.” This was Darius, king of Persia (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>). The eighth month of Darius’s second year would be October 520 <span class="era">BC</span>. This date seems to be the first time the “word of the Lord” came to Zechariah. The second date in Zechariah is in <a href="?bref=Zech.1.7">1:7</a>: “On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius . . .” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). This date would be February 15, 519 <span class="era">BC</span>. The word of the Lord that came to Zechariah on this date seems to include the account of eight night visions, along with some oracles, from an angel who talked with him. The third date in Zechariah is in <a href="?bref=Zech.7.1">7:1</a>: “In the fourth year of King Darius . . . on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev . . .” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). This date would be the equivalent of December 7, 518 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>There are no dates in <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">Zechariah 9–14</a>. Zechariah’s name is never mentioned, and neither is Darius or any king. A period of relative peace and stability gives place to war. The temple is standing (<a href="?bref=Zech.11.13">11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.20">14:20</a>), and evidently Greek soldiers are present (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.13">9:13</a>). Any attempt to assign specific dates to <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">Zechariah 9–14</a> would be speculation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nebuchadnezzar made several raids against Jerusalem before and after it fell, taking many captives to Babylon (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-17">2 Kgs 24:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1">Dn 1:1</a>). On two occasions, Jeremiah had predicted that captivity would last 70 years (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.11">Jer 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.10">29:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Dan.9.2">Dn 9:2</a>). In the time of Zechariah, the period of 70 years since the fall of Jerusalem was coming to an end (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.12">Zec 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.5">7:5</a>). It had been 66 years since Jerusalem fell, when the first “word of the Lord” came to Zechariah in the second year of Darius (520 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Babylonian Empire had fallen to the Persians in 538 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Cyrus the first king of Persia signed a decree permitting all captives to return to their homes (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.23">2 Chr 36:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezr 1:1-4</a>). Evidently, the first contingent of Jewish captives returned to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest about 536 <span class="era">BC</span>. One of the first objectives of the returnees was to rebuild the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.3">Ezr 1:3</a>), but internal strife and external opposition from the Samaritans prohibited the immediate rebuilding of the temple. After Darius I became king of Persia in 521 <span class="era">BC</span>, a wave of expectation and enthusiasm swept over the Jewish communities in Jerusalem and Babylon. Two prophets, possibly from the Babylonian exiles, Haggai and Zechariah, began preaching so powerfully that work on the second temple began in 520 <span class="era">BC</span> and was finished in 516 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1,14-15">Ezr 5:1, 14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1-2.23">Hg 1–2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-8.23">Zec 1–8</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Zechariah opens in the second year of Darius (520 <span class="era">BC</span>). Some of the captives had been back in Jerusalem for 16 years, but nothing was being done about rebuilding the temple. Zechariah’s first message called for the people to repent and not repeat the mistake of their fathers, whose sins and refusal to repent led to the exile and destruction of the temple (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-6">Zec 1:1-6</a>). Then a series of eight night visions follows (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.7-6.8">1:7–6:8</a>), assuring the people that the temple would be rebuilt by Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.16">1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.9">4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.15">6:15</a>). Two verses in Zechariah speak volumes concerning the hardships and difficulties in Jerusalem before the temple was rebuilt: “This is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Almighty says: Take heart and finish the task! You have heard what the prophets have been saying about building the Temple of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Almighty ever since the foundation was laid. Before the work on the Temple began, there were no jobs and no wages for either people or animals. No traveler was safe from the enemy, for there were enemies on all sides. I had turned everyone against each other” (<a href="?bref=Zech.8.9-10">8:9-10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The first eight chapters of Zechariah are set against the social, political, and religious situations in Jerusalem from 520 to 518 <span class="era">BC</span>. But beginning with chapter <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-17">9</a>, historical moorings are lost. Chapter <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-17">9</a> opens with an oracle against Syria, including Damascus, Tyre, and Sidon, and against Philistia. Each of these places will be conquered and cleansed and will become like a clan in Judah. There is the promise of a new king coming triumphantly to Jerusalem, yet humbly riding on a donkey. His reign will be peaceful and universal. The next oracle speaks of setting the captives free, but this may not refer to the Babylonian captives, because of a reference to the Greeks. <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-12.14">Zechariah 9–12</a> is almost wholly concerned with the future. Some scholars call this part apocalyptic literature. The nations attack Jerusalem and are defeated (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-14">12</a>, <a href="?bref=Zech.14.1-21">14</a>). The temple is standing (<a href="?bref=Zech.11.13">11:13</a>), but it does not seem to have a place of great prominence in the new Jerusalem and in the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.6-9">14:6-9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandMessage">Purpose and Message</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of the book is to reassure and encourage. The restored Jewish community of 520 <span class="era">BC</span> needed the assurance that the temple would be rebuilt, and later groups of God’s people needed to know that ultimately the kingdom of God would come in its fullness. There are three messages in the book of Zechariah: the need for repentance (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-5.11">1:1–5:11</a>); the eight night visions (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.7-6.8">1:7–6:8</a>) signifying that the temple would be rebuilt and God’s glory would return to Jerusalem; and the coming kingdom of God (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">9–14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Zechariah may be divided into two main parts: chapters <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-8.23">1–8</a> and <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">9–14</a>. The first part is dated between 520 <span class="era">BC</span> and 518 <span class="era">BC</span>. It consists of oracles and visions of Zechariah the son of Berechiah. Mainly prose, its primary concern is to assure the restored Jewish community that the temple will be rebuilt. The second part (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">9–14</a>) is undated. There are no references to Zechariah. The temple is standing, and much of the language is eschatological and apocalyptic. The second part itself has two parts: chapters <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-11.17">9–11</a> and <a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-14.21">12–14</a>. Chapters <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-17">9</a> and <a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-14">12</a> begin essentially the same way: “The oracle of the word of the Lord.”</p>
<p>The first part of Zechariah (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-8.23">1–8</a>) has four main sections: superscription and first oracle (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1-6">1:1-6</a>); eight night visions and related oracles (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.7-6.8">1:7–6:8</a>); the symbolic crowning of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.9-15">6:9-15</a>); and the question about fasting and morality (<a href="?bref=Zech.7.1-8.23">7:1–8:23</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Superscription (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">1:1</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section is dated specifically “in the eighth month” of the Babylonian calendar, which was from mid-October to mid-November. The second year of Darius, king of Persia, was 520 <span class="era">BC</span>. The date is important in relating the work of Zechariah to that of Haggai (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1,15">Hg 1:1, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.1,10,18-20">2:1, 10, 18-20</a>) and to the reconstruction of the temple under Zerubbabel. The first oracle concerns the need for repentance. The first message of Zechariah came between Haggai’s second and third message. He, like Haggai, probably attributed the failure of the crops and other hardships to a failure to rebuild the temple (cf. <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.6-11">Hg 1:6-11</a>). Zechariah calls for the people to repent so that they can persevere with work on the temple.</p>
<p class="h3">The Eight Night Visions and Related Oracles (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.7-6.8">1:7–6:8</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">These visions that Zechariah saw in Jerusalem all seem to have been given on the night of the 24th day of the 11th month (Shebat) in the second year of Darius (mid-January to mid-February 519 <span class="era">BC</span>). Seven of the eight visions have essentially the same form. Four of the visions begin with the words “Then I looked up and saw” (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.18">1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.1">2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.1">6:1</a>). One begins, “In a vision during the night” (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.8">1:8</a>). Another begins, “Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me, as though I had been asleep. ‘What do you see now?’ he asked” (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.1-2">4:1-2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Still another (the seventh) vision begins, “Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said . . .” (<a href="?bref=Zech.5.5">5:5</a>). However, the fourth vision is different from the other seven. It begins, “Then he showed me” (<a href="?bref=Zech.3.1">3:1</a>, cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.7.1,4,7">Am 7:1, 4, 7</a>). This message in the third person contains no interpreting angel nor any direct message to Zechariah, as if he were merely an observer. This fourth vision is so different from the other seven that it was not a part of the original series of eight.</p>
<p>An overall pattern to the eight visions is not evident. Some scholars have seen some significance in the fact that the visions move from the evening or night in the first vision to the sunrise in the last vision. Others have detected some relationships in pairs of visions. The first and last visions involve horses and riders or chariots. The second and third visions involve the restoration of Judah and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.18-21">1:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.1-5">2:1-5</a>). The fourth and fifth deal with the place of the two leaders in the restored community: Joshua will be cleansed and restored as the high priest (<a href="?bref=Zech.3.1-5">3:1-5</a>) and Zerubbabel the governor will complete the temple (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.1-14">4:1-14</a>). The sixth and seventh visions involve the cleansing of the land. A flying scroll enters the house of every thief and false witness and consumes it (<a href="?bref=Zech.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>). Wickedness personified as a woman will be carried in an ephah (basket) to the land of Shinar (vv <a href="?bref=Zech.5.5-11">5-11</a>). Interspersed in the vision accounts are four oracles (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.14-17">1:14-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.8-13">2:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.6-10">3:6-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.8-14">4:8-14</a>). Each of these passages begins with the messenger formula, “Thus says the Lord,” or the expression “Cry out” (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.14,17">1:14, 17</a>). The first oracle assures the people that the temple, the cities, and the choice of Jerusalem will be renewed. The second oracle exhorts any exiles remaining in Babylon to return to Judah and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Zech.2.7-12">2:7-12</a>). <a href="?bref=Zech.2.12-13">Zechariah 2:12-13</a> are interesting. Verse <a href="?bref=Zech.2.12">12</a> is the only OT reference to Palestine as “the Holy Land,” and verse <a href="?bref=Zech.2.13">13</a> is similar to the call to worship in <a href="?bref=Hab.2.20">Habakkuk 2:20</a>: “Be silent before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, all humanity, for he is springing into action from his holy dwelling” (<a href="?bref=Zech.2.13">Zec 2:13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The third oracle in the visionary accounts concerns Joshua the high priest as a sign of the coming of God’s servant, the Branch who removes the guilt of the land in a single day (<a href="?bref=Zech.3.6-10">3:6-10</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Symbolic Crowning of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.9-15">6:9-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Zechariah is told to go into the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah, take silver and gold from some returnees from Babylon, make a crown, and put it on the head of Joshua the priest as a symbol of the royal and priestly king, the Branch, the builder of the temple. After the ceremony the crown is to be hung in the temple as a memorial of those who gave the silver and the gold. The last verse (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.15">6:15</a>) seems to say that just as gold and silver from exiles was used to symbolize the crowning of the coming king of the kingdom, so exiles, “those who are far off,” will also participate in the completion of the temple. Then Zechariah’s hearers will know God sent him to prophesy. This will all take place when and if they will diligently obey the voice of the Lord.</p>
<p class="h3">The Question about Fasting and Morality (<a href="?bref=Zech.7.1-8.23">7:1–8:23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">A delegation from Bethel (10 miles or 16.1 kilometers north of Jerusalem) came to Jerusalem in the fourth year of Darius (518 <span class="era">BC</span>). Work on the temple had been going on for two years. The purpose of this visit was to entreat the favor of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Zech.7.2">7:2</a>) and to ask the priests and the prophets if they should continue to fast as they had done since the temple was destroyed 70 years earlier (v <a href="?bref=Zech.7.3">3</a>). The Lord told Zechariah to ask why they were fasting—for the Lord or for selfish motives? The answer to the question of fasting seems to be that God desires truth, justice, and covenant-love more than fasting. Zechariah reiterates the message the Lord had already given his people by the former prophets. The last section in the first part of Zechariah is a decalogue of promises (<a href="?bref=Zech.8.1-23">8:1-23</a>). The ten promises begin with the words “Thus says the Lord” or “The word of the Lord came to me.” The last word of God is not judgment but promise, hope, forgiveness, and restoration.</p>
<p class="h3">The Oracles of the Lord (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-12.14">9–12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The last half of the book of Zechariah (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-14.21">9–14</a>) falls into two nearly equal parts: chapters <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-11.17">9–11</a> (46 verses) and chapters <a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-14.21">12–14</a> (44 verses). Each part begins with the words “An oracle” (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.1">9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.1">12:1</a>). Both “oracles” are primarily eschatological. The first part (chs <a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-11.17">9–11</a>) is concerned with the restoration of the tribes to Palestine (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.11-17">9:11-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.6-12">10:6-12</a>). In order to accomplish this, the Lord will rid Palestine and Syria of opponents to his rule (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.1-8">9:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.11.1-3">11:1-3</a>), remove the evil shepherds (rulers; <a href="?bref=Zech.10.2b-5">10:2b-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.11.4-17">11:4-17</a>), and the Prince of Peace will come (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.9-10">9:9-10</a>). The last “oracle” of Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-14.21">12:1–14:21</a>) is also eschatological. This time the concern is primarily that of Jerusalem and Judah. Twice Jerusalem is attacked by the nations (<a href="?bref=Zech.12.1-8">12:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.1-5">14:1-5</a>). Each time the Lord fights for Jerusalem, Judah, and the house of David. Jerusalem weeps and mourns for an unidentified martyr (<a href="?bref=Zech.12.10-14">12:10-14</a>). The martyr could be called the “good” shepherd who is killed and his sheep scattered (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.7-9">13:7-9</a>). Jesus referred to this passage in connection with his arrest (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.31">Mt 26:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.27">Mk 14:27</a>). A fountain will be opened for the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will be cleansed from sin, idolatry, and false prophets (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.1-6">Zec 13:1-6</a>). The new Jerusalem will remain aloft on its site and the land around it will be turned into a plain (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.10-11">14:10-11</a>). There will be no night nor extreme temperatures in the new Jerusalem. Living waters will flow from Jerusalem, and the Lord will become King of all the earth. Those who fight against Jerusalem will be destroyed, but those who survive will worship the Lord year by year by keeping the Feast of Booths.</p>
<p>The last scene in the book of Zechariah is a picture of the world after Armageddon, a new world cleansed of sin. It will be a time of peace and security. When God comes to reign, everything will become holy. The warhorses will become as holy as the priest’s turban, and the ordinary cooking vessel will be as temple vessels. The Canaanite or trader will be eliminated. There will be no difference between Jew and Gentile, as long as one worships the Lord of Hosts as King.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">ZEDEKIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Judah’s last king and a key political figure in the fateful final decade of the southern kingdom. His reign (597–586 <span class="era">BC</span>) spanned Nebuchadnezzar’s two attacks on Jerusalem, in 597 and 586. The first attack was in reprisal for the rebellion of Josiah’s son, Jehoiakim (609–598 <span class="era">BC</span>), against Nebuchadnezzar; however, by the time his forces captured Jerusalem, Jehoiakim was dead and had been succeeded by his 18-year-old son Jehoiachin. Nebuchadnezzar deposed the young king and deported him to Babylon, along with the elite of the nation: government officials, army officers, and craftsmen. As Jehoiachin’s replacement, Nebuchadnezzar appointed his uncle Mattaniah, a younger brother of Jehoiakim and of the earlier, short-lived King Jehoahaz (609 <span class="era">BC</span>). Mattaniah was thus the third son of Josiah to occupy the throne of Judah. The Babylonian king named him Zedekiah, which means “the Lord is my righteousness.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Zedekiah found himself in a difficult position as Judah’s king. Many evidently still regarded Jehoiachin as the real king (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.28.1-4">Jer 28:1-4</a>). Certainly the Judeans deported to Babylonia dated events by reference to Jehoiachin (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27">2 Kgs 25:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.2">Ez 1:2</a>). Though the Babylonians exacted from Zedekiah an oath of loyalty (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.13">2 Chr 36:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.13-18">Ez 17:13-18</a>), evidence suggests that they too viewed Zedekiah’s predecessor as the legitimate king and Zedekiah as regent. They may have been holding him in reserve for possible restoration to power, should events require it.</p>
<p class="list-text">Judah was filled with a false optimism that could hardly have helped the new king. It was confidently expected that the deportation of the leading citizens would be only temporary; prophets were guaranteeing that Babylon’s power would be broken within two years (<a href="?bref=Jer.28.2-4">Jer 28:2-4</a>). They were opposed by a few prophets led by Jeremiah, whose message found little support.</p>
<p class="list-text">Pressure both from within the nation and from without was put on Zedekiah to change his political allegiance. In the fourth year of his reign (593 <span class="era">BC</span>), the neighboring states of Ammon, Moab, Tyre, and Sidon formed a coalition to fight for independence from Babylon. Envoys were sent to Zedekiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-3">Jer 27:1-3</a>). However, Jeremiah advised the king not to get involved. In the same year, according to <a href="?bref=Jer.51.59">Jeremiah 51:59</a>, Zedekiah visited Babylon. He may have been summoned to affirm his loyalty and to explain his role in the political situation. The planned rebellion did not occur, perhaps because aid from Egypt failed to materialize.</p>
<p class="list-text">Within the Judean court a strong pro-Egyptian party existed. This party saw Egypt as an ally for breaking away from their eastern master, just like the advisers of King Hezekiah a century before (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.31.1-3">Is 31:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.6">36:6</a>). Zedekiah, finding it difficult to resist this political pressure, eventually transferred his allegiance to Egypt.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hophra (589–570 <span class="era">BC</span>), Psammetichus’s heir to the Egyptian throne, organized a joint rebellion in the west against Babylon. According to <a href="?bref=Ezek.21.18-32">Ezekiel 21:18-32</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.12-17">25:12-17</a>, Judah and Ammon supported him, while Edom and Philistia shrewdly abstained. Zedekiah was rebuked by the prophet Ezekiel (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.13-18">Ez 17:13-18</a>) for breaking his oath to Nebuchadnezzar (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.13">2 Chr 36:13</a>) and rebelling against him by sending envoys to Egypt to negotiate for military support.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the face of this western uprising engineered by his Egyptian rival, Nebuchadnezzar was forced to march westward. Setting up headquarters at Riblah in northern Syria, he decided to make Jerusalem his prime target (<a href="?bref=Ezek.21.18-23">Ez 21:18-23</a>). The ensuing siege of Jerusalem was temporarily lifted due to an Egyptian attack but afterward was resumed until the city fell. Zedekiah, fleeing eastward with his troops, was caught near Jericho and taken north to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah. There he was put on trial for breaking his promises of vassalage. By way of punishment, his sons were killed before his eyes. This tragic sight was the last he ever saw, since his eyes were then put out. He was taken in chains to Babylon, where he eventually died in prison (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.5-7">2 Kgs 25:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.39.7">Jer 39:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.8-11">52:8-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.13">Ez 12:13</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">According to the editorial heading (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.1">Zep 1:1</a>), Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>). His family tree is given in an unusually full form. Some scholars have suggested that his great-great-grandfather was King Hezekiah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>). But remarkably there is no Jewish or Christian tradition to support the suggestion, which there probably would have been if it had been true. His own name, meaning “he whom the Lord protects or hides,” was not uncommon and was a testimony to the keeping power of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">Zephaniah probably prophesied around 630 <span class="era">BC</span>. The fall of Nineveh (612 <span class="era">BC</span>) had not yet occurred (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.13-15">2:13-15</a>). Josiah’s reign falls into two periods, dividing at 622 <span class="era">BC</span>. In that year, while the temple was being cleared of pagan articles, the Book of the Law was found, which gave momentum to Josiah’s religious reforms (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1-20">2 Kgs 22</a>). The unreformed state of affairs described by Zephaniah (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.4-12">Zep 1:4-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>) points to a date before 622, at least for his denunciations. The prophet addressed Judah, the southern kingdom, and in particular the civil and religious authorities in Jerusalem. He most probably prophesied during the reign of Josiah, who came to the throne at the age of eight.</p>
<p>The negative parts of the book concerning the sin and punishment of Judah—now fulfilled—would serve as a serious warning against disobedience to God. Moreover, the fulfillment of Zephaniah’s prophetic threats would serve to enhance the positive side of the book, confirming the hope of completion in the experience of a fresh generation of God’s people.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Politically, the Assyrian Empire had spread westward and held Palestine in its grip. The long reign of Manasseh (696–642 <span class="era">BC</span>) had been a period of total subservience to Assyria. Political subservience as an Assyrian vassal meant religious subservience to the gods of Assyria, especially worship of the heavenly bodies (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.5">2 Kgs 21:5</a>). Zephaniah complained of this sin (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.5">Zep 1:5</a>). When the door opened to one foreign religion, others naturally came in. Once the exclusiveness of the worship of the God of Israel was abandoned, Palestinian cults were openly accepted. The Canaanite Baal was blatantly worshiped (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.3">2 Kgs 21:3</a>), as Zephaniah attested (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.4">Zep 1:4</a>). Zephaniah condemned the worshipers of Molech (v <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.5">5</a>), who sacrificed children to the Ammonite god (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.7">1 Kgs 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">2 Kgs 23:10</a>). International imperialism meant a weakening of national culture, so that foreign customs were practiced, probably with religious overtones (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.8-9">Zep 1:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>The reign of Josiah brought changes, marking a political and religious turning point. Assyria, preoccupied with troubles on the eastern and northern frontiers and unable to consolidate its acquisitions, became unable to reinforce its authority in the west. This weakness induced Josiah to launch a national liberation movement. He threw off the yoke of Assyria and expanded his sphere of influence northward into the territory of the old northern kingdom. From a religious standpoint, he completely dissociated himself and his country from the religions that prevailed in Judah and recalled the nation to a pure and exclusive faith in the God of Israel. The book of Zephaniah shows that there was at least one person who shared his ideals. His prophetic ministry undoubtedly paved the way for Josiah’s subsequent reformation. He was a contemporary of Jeremiah, at least for the early part of that prophet’s career (Jeremiah began prophesying in 627 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Scholars have suggested that Zephaniah’s prophesying was prompted in part by attacks of the Scythians. The Greek historian Herodotus tells how the barbaric Scythians overran western Asia and reached as far south as the Egyptian frontier at about the time that Zephaniah prophesied. There is now much less inclination to believe Herodotus’s tale and relate Zephaniah’s prophetic ministry to it. There is no objective evidence for Scythian attacks on so large a scale as Herodotus claimed. Probably Zephaniah spoke simply out of a theological necessity, as he himself claimed (e.g., <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.17">1:17</a>). From his inspired standpoint, he foresaw that a clash involving divine intervention and human downfall was unavoidable.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTeaching">Purpose and Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">As Zephaniah prophesied in God’s name, he denounced the religious sins of Judah and the corruption rampant among both civil and religious authorities. He foretold the downfall of the nation that actually occurred in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The moral and religious landslide could only culminate in a political avalanche of destruction that would engulf the nation. This avalanche is called by Zephaniah “the Day of the Lord.” It was not a new term, and the prophet knew that it would arouse terror in the hearts of his hearers. Amos used it, and even in his time it was well established (<a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-20">Am 5:18-20</a>). Isaiah was the first to use the expression in the southern kingdom (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.6-22">Is 2:6-22</a>, see v <a href="?bref=Isa.2.12">12</a>). In this, as in a number of respects, Zephaniah was a latter-day Isaiah called by God to reapply truths earlier prophesied by Isaiah to a later generation.</p>
<p>The theme of the Day of the Lord refers to a time when the Lord would decisively intervene in the world to establish his sovereignty. Hostile elements would be swept aside. The enemies of God, sinners against his moral will, would be exposed and punished. It was associated with judgment upon those who did not acknowledge God’s sovereignty—especially Gentiles, but also sinful Israel. The emphasis on the suffering of God’s people was intended to correct the popular assumption that other nations would be the sole target of divine judgment.</p>
<p>The “day” also would vindicate those who were loyal to God. It guaranteed the rehabilitation of his oppressed supporters. Zephaniah developed this two-sided phenomenon in order to communicate the truth of God to his own generation. It is “a day of the wrath of God” (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.15,18">Zep 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.2">2:2</a>), when his reaction to human sin would be demonstrated. Its target was not only other nations but Judah as well, both Jerusalem, the capital (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.10-13">1:10-13</a>), and the other cities of Judah.</p>
<p>Zephaniah also had a positive message for the people of Judah. For the prophets, the message of salvation did not cancel the message of doom. Judgment would come first, then salvation would follow. But the period of tribulation could not be avoided. The prophet’s grim descriptions of “the day of wrath” are interpreted as dire warnings and implicit pleas to the people of Judah to abandon their complacent, sinful ways.</p>
<p>Clearly, Zephaniah’s role under God was to reapply earlier truths sadly forgotten by his own generation. Zephaniah was able to foresee God’s judgment of Judah and the world. But he also proclaimed permanent truths concerning the nature of God and his providential relationship to the world and concerning the responsibilities of the people of God.</p>
<p>The importance of the book of Zephaniah for the NT lies in the phraseology about the Day of the Lord. There are a number of allusions to this aspect of his message (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.41">Mt 13:41</a> [<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.3">Zep 1:3</a>]; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.17">Rv 6:17</a> [<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.14">1:14</a>]; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.5">14:5</a> [<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.13">3:13</a>]; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.1">16:1</a> [<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.8">3:8</a>]). These echoes stress Zephaniah’s importance beyond his own time. He contributed to the total biblical picture of a God who intervenes in human history and will establish his kingdom. Zephaniah’s descriptions are a pattern for events that will mark the end of history.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The heading (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.1">Zep 1:1</a>) introduces Zephaniah, gives the historical setting, and above all stresses his meditation on the divine word.</p>
<p>The first major part of the book is <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.2-2.3">1:2–2:3</a>. It subdivides into four units: verses <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.2-7,8-13,14-18">2-7, 8-13, 14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.1-3">2:1-3</a>. Verses <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.2-7">2-7</a> include Judah in a forecast of universal destruction. Zephaniah used traditional material to stress that God’s people were by no means exempt, as they often chose to believe (cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-20">Am 5:18-20</a>). The prophet supported his startling revelation with reasoned statements regarding the religious deviations practiced in Jerusalem. The image of sacrifice was used ironically, portraying Judah as the victim.</p>
<p>The national administration and members of the royal family were guilty (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.8-13">Zep 1:8-13</a>). Superstitions were punctiliously observed, yet basic divine commands against stealing and fraudulent gain went unheeded. Zephaniah saw the enemy attack on the north side of Jerusalem as an illustration of God’s punishment of dishonest traders (cf. <a href="?bref=Amos.8.5-6">Am 8:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.10-11">Mi 6:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>There follows a shocking and terrifying description of the grimness of the coming “Day” (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.14-18">Zep 1:14-18</a>). The prophet stirred up a complacent people who did not want to hear God’s message. He frightened them into reality with a monotonous drumbeat of doom and destruction. Judah would be the demoralized target of God’s wrath. Their wealth had secured luxurious imports but could not prevent divine judgment.</p>
<p>The prophet completed his sermon with an appeal for repentance (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.1-3">2:1-3</a>). Having emotionally stirred his audience from their apathy, he was able to bring the good news that all was not yet lost. A penitential assembly at the temple and the intercession of the spiritually minded and obedient among God’s people might prevent destruction. God’s punishment of foreign nations is described in the second main part of the book (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.4-15">2:4-15</a>). Representative states are named to the west, east, south, and north of Judah. In the context of the previous material, it amplifies the universal nature of the Day of the Lord. Like the first part, it subdivides into four passages: verses <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.4-7,8-11,12">2:4-7, 8-11, 12</a>, and <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.13-15">13-15</a>.</p>
<p>The subject of the first passage is the Philistines. In the case of the cities of Gaza and Ekron, there is a play on words typical of Hebrew prophecy. Both names contain doom within their very sound. The Philistines are labeled as trespassers because they were illegal immigrants from Crete into the Promised Land, which was intended for God’s own people.</p>
<p>Zephaniah predicted that Moab and Ammon would suffer attack for their overbearing attitude and their annexation of Judean territory (<a href="?bref=Zeph.2.8-11">2:8-11</a>). God would come to the aid of his covenant people.</p>
<p>The first two main sections have spelled out at length a message of judgment for both Judah and the surrounding nations. This twofold message is now repeated in a much shorter form in the third main section (<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.1-8">3:1-8</a>). Zephaniah criticized Jerusalem in its combined role of political capital and religious center. The responsibility of being God’s representatives rested too lightly on the shoulders of government and temple officials. Civil leaders abused their powers by demanding bribes and even killing their political opponents. Instead of being the shepherds of the people (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.1-31">Ez 34</a>), they were beasts of prey (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.22.25-27">Ez 22:25-27</a>). The prophets misused their gifts for their own selfish interests, while the priests broke the strict regulations of the temple. The lessons of history went unheeded; they had not learned caution and reverence. The conclusion is clear: Judah could not escape punishment in the coming Day of the Lord but would suffer with other nations.</p>
<p>The outworking of God’s will for both Judah and the nations is in view in the final main section (<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.9-20">Zep 3:9-20</a>), but this time from a quite different aspect. Punishment was not God’s last word for his own people or even for the nations at large. Ultimately God’s will is not destruction but salvation (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.9">2 Pt 3:9</a>). The section has three parts: <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.9-10,11-13">Zephaniah 3:9-10, 11-13</a>, and <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.14-20">14-20</a>. Verses <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.9-10">9-10</a> deal with the conversion of the nations. This remarkable passage looks forward with divinely guaranteed certainty to the willing submission of Gentiles to the God of Israel. Their turning to God would not be based on human initiative but would originate in the providential activity of God. Lips defiled by worship of pagan gods would be purified and devoted solely to the adoration of the God of Israel. People from remote parts of the earth, here illustrated as the remote south beyond the Ethiopian Nile, would come as suppliants, as if they were scattered Jews returning home.</p>
<p>God’s own people would be marked by a change of heart (<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.11-13">3:11-13</a>). By now they would have been purged of the proud people who put themselves before God in the sphere of politics and religion. They would be a purified people who humbly trusted in God. To them were promised the blessings of paradise.</p>
<p>The last passage speaks of coming joys (<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.14-20">3:14-20</a>). The prophet projects himself into the future, to the time when God’s judgment would be over and the time of salvation had dawned. God’s people would rejoice in the presence of their Lord. Fear and demoralization would be canceled by God’s powerful presence and radiant joy. His joy would infectiously communicate itself to them so that they too would rejoice. Moreover, his joy would be a reaction to the transformation he was working in the lives of his people (v <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.17">17</a>; “he will renew you in his love,” <span class="sc">rsv</span>). A necessary part of this transformation would feature the vindication of God’s suffering people. They would be brought to a position of honor, as the visible representatives of the God of glory. Ultimately, God’s power would be revealed through a people of power.</p>

<p class="list">2. One of the twin sons of Judah by his daughter-in-law Tamar (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.30">Gn 38:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.46.12">46:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.3">Mt 1:3</a>). Although Zerah thrust out his hand first, he retracted it, allowing his brother, Perez, to be born first. The descendants of Zerah (the Zerahites) became one of the most influential clans of Judah (<a href="?bref=Num.26.20">Nm 26:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1,18">Jos 7:1, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.22.20">22:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.4-6">1 Chr 2:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.6">9:6</a>). Because Ethan and Heman are listed as sons of Zerah in <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.6">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, the Ezrahites mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.31">1 Kings 4:31</a> and the titles to <a href="?bref=Ps.88.1-18">Psalms 88</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.89.1-52">89</a> are also considered to be Zerahites. However, Ethan and Heman are listed as Levites in <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.17">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>, thus making it more likely that the Ezrahites were a Levite clan.</p>
<p class="list">3. One of the sons of Simeon from whom the Zerahite clan descended (<a href="?bref=Num.26.13">Nm 26:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.24">1 Chr 4:24</a>); alternately called Zohar in <a href="?bref=Gen.46.10">Genesis 46:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.6.15">Exodus 6:15</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. One of the sons of Iddo, from the Gershonite branch of Levi’s tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.21">1 Chr 6:21</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. One of the ancestors of Asaph from Levi’s tribe, listed as the son of Adaiah and the father of Ethni (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.41">1 Chr 6:41</a>). Several believe him to be the same individual as #4 above.</p>
<p class="list">6. Commander of the Ethiopians (Cushites) who fought against Asa, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.14.9">2 Chr 14:9</a>). It is difficult to identify this individual or the historical event with any certainty. The most common identification has been with Usarkon II of Egypt. The account of the battle agrees with the chronology of Usarkon’s reign in Egypt, as do the number and nationalities of the troops involved in the conflict.</p>

<p class="h1">ZERUBBABEL</p>
<p class="fl">Babylonian-born Jew who returned to Palestine in 538 <span class="era">BC</span> to serve as governor of Jerusalem under Persian rule. The name presumably means “seed [offspring] of Babylon,” referring to someone born in Babylon.</p>
<p>The exact identity of Zerubbabel’s biological father is uncertain. All biblical references except one mention Shealtiel as his father (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.2,8">Ezr 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.2">5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.1">Neh 12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1,12-14">Hg 1:1, 12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.2,23">2:2, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.12-13">Mt 1:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.27">Lk 3:27</a>). This would make Zerubbabel the grandson of the Davidic king Jehoiachin. However, <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.19">1 Chronicles 3:19</a> identifies Pedaiah, the brother of Shealtiel, as Zerubbabel’s father.</p>
<p>Two solutions have been proposed. Many scholars have assumed that Shealtiel died before fathering an heir. His brother, Pedaiah, would then have fathered Zerubbabel by Shealtiel’s widow. Hence, Zerubbabel would have retained the name of Shealtiel rather than Pedaiah in accordance with the law of levirate marriage (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5-10">Dt 25:5-10</a>). This solution is weakened by its lack of textual support; similarly, the Chronicler would hardly have failed to state such an important piece of information if he had been desirous of “correcting” an error pertaining to Zerubbabel’s parentage.</p>
<p>A simpler solution is obtained by reading the Septuagint text of <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.19">1 Chronicles 3:19</a>, which lists Salathiel (Shealtiel) as the father of Zerubbabel. In this way, the single reference to 1 Chronicles may be harmonized with the other verses cited above.</p>
<p>In either case, whether Shealtiel or Pedaiah was Zerubbabel’s biological father, it is clear that Zerubbabel was of Davidic lineage and was viewed by members of the Israelite community as a viable candidate for leading them back to a position of power.</p>
<p>Following the edict of Cyrus in 538 <span class="era">BC</span>, Jews were permitted to return to Palestine and reclaim their former homeland. Zerubbabel was appointed governor, and probably by the decade of 529–520 had started work on the reconstruction of the Jerusalem temple. However, because of several discouraging events, little was accomplished until the year 520 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The writings of Haggai and Zechariah reveal much information about Zerubbabel’s standing in the community. These two prophets evidently viewed Jeshua and Zerubbabel as the two men chosen by God for the task. Accordingly, in many of their oracles, support for one or both men is openly stated (e.g., <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.21-23">Hg 2:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.8">Zec 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6-7">4:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.12">6:12</a>). The prophets viewed Jeshua and Zerubbabel’s work as being messianic. This is most clearly seen in the vision of Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.11-14">Zec 4:11-14</a>). In the vision, two olive branches, one on either side of the lampstand, are identified as “the two anointed who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.” As the context clearly shows, none other than Jeshua (or Joshua; named in <a href="?bref=Zech.3.1-9">3:1-9</a>) and Zerubbabel (named in <a href="?bref=Zech.4.6-10">4:6-10</a>) are meant. Because of his association with the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel had been accorded a place of great honor in Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>Some hold that Zerubbabel was known to the Persians as Sheshbazzar. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Sheshbazzar_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Sheshbazzar</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">ZEUS</p>
<p class="fl">Chief god of the Greek pantheon (Roman Jupiter). Zeus was initially worshiped as part of an animistic cult, as the sky god with thunder as his principal manifestation. Well before the time of Homer, however, Zeus had become the preeminent personal god of the Greek residents of Thessaly, with Mt Olympus serving as the focal point of the cult. By NT times, Zeus was considered the Greek father god who possessed supreme powers. The quotation Paul used in <a href="?bref=Acts.17.28">Acts 17:28</a> from Cleanthes (and/or Aratus) was originally ascribed to Zeus (“in him we live and move and have our being”).</p>
<p>Zeus is most significant in biblical writings as a result of Paul and Barnabas’s encounter with the priest of Zeus at Lystra (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.8-18">Acts 14:8-18</a>). Because Paul and Barnabas had healed a lame man, the residents of Lystra attempted to worship them, identifying Barnabas with Zeus and Paul with Hermes, the messenger of the gods. It was not unusual that this misidentification should take place, since the Greek gods were frequently represented as taking on human appearances and intervening directly in human affairs. Unlike the true God, Zeus and his consorts were often viewed as capriciously bestowing favor or disfavor. The attribution of “divinity” to Paul and Barnabas allowed them to identify the key differences between Greek and Christian theology.</p>

<p class="fl">Former servant of Saul whom David commissioned to find survivors of the house of Saul so that he might “show them kindness” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.2-12">2 Sm 9:2-12</a>). In the period following Saul’s death, Ziba apparently had not only gained his freedom but had also become a successful landowner. This status was lost as a result of the discovery of Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s crippled son. Ziba later became involved in a controversy with Mephibosheth concerning Mephibosheth’s failure to accompany David when he fled during Absalom’s rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1-4">2 Sm 16:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.17,24-29">19:17, 24-29</a>). Most commentators have blamed Ziba with duplicity and slander in the affair, but the text allows no certain conclusion as to who was guilty. On Mephibosheth’s behalf, it is unlikely that he would have believed that he could inherit the throne, as Ziba had claimed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.3">2 Sm 16:3</a>). Mephibosheth also seems to have been loyal to David (though it is possible that David brought him to Jerusalem to ensure that he would be under protective surveillance). In Ziba’s defense, it is notable that David did believe without question that Mephibosheth might have had aspirations for the throne. Ziba also appears consistently as a loyal supporter of David in spite of the fact that David’s decision had cost him his independent status (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1">2 Sm 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.17">19:17</a>). Of course, Ziba’s displeasure at his loss of independence might have motivated him to defame Mephibosheth. In any case, David appears to have had reason to doubt both versions of the truth. Rather than supporting either claim, he chose to divide the land between them (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.29">2 Sm 19:29</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Term meaning “temple tower”; a ziggurat was similar in profile to the step pyramid of Egypt and was used for worship. They were frequent in the major cities of Mesopotamia. The Tower of Babel (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">Gn 11:1-9</a>) is believed to have been of this construction. It was widely believed that deities dwelt above, in high places. Therefore, worship was more appropriate on hills or mountains. There are no hills in Mesopotamia, nor is there building stone. Consequently, the inhabitants built with mud brick. The ziggurats of mud brick were constructed as substitutes for hills, where the worshiper or priest could get closer to the gods. Like the pyramids of Egypt, these temple towers were square. Instead of having sloping sides, there was a succession of terraces, each smaller than the one below. Access to each level was by stairways or ramps. The shrine or altar was on top, where the priests would officiate at sacrifices, incantations, and prayers. The great seven-story ziggurat at Babylon measured nearly 300 feet (91.4 meters) on a side at the base and rose to about the same height.</p>

<p>The area identified as the wilderness of Zin is associated with the village of Zin (<a href="?bref=Num.34.4">Nm 34:4</a>). The wilderness was west of Edom, southwest of the Dead Sea, and south of Judah. Within this arid area were four copious springs or oases, including Kadesh-barnea. Most of the 38 years the Israelites spent in the Sinai Desert were spent in this area. From the wilderness of Zin the spies were dispatched to spy out the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.13.1-26">Nm 13:1-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.32.8">32:8</a>).

  <title>Zion</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ZION</p>
<p class="fl">The Jebusite fortress in Jerusalem conquered by David. Thereafter, Zion was used by biblical writers to identify other areas of Jerusalem and was used as a designation of the entire city. Zion was also used to describe, spiritually speaking, the eternal city of God.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Zion"/>
<p class="h2" id="GeographicalSites">Geographical Sites</p>
<p class="h3">The Jebusite Fortress</p>
<p class="fl">The first occurrence of the word “Zion” is in the narrative of David’s conquest of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-10">2 Sm 5:6-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.4-9">1 Chr 11:4-9</a>). David captured the “fortress of Zion,” which was thereafter known as the “city of David.” The “fortress of Zion” may refer to the entire walled perimeter of the approximately 11-acre (4.5-hectare) site on the southeastern ridge (the Ophel Ridge), or to a smaller fortified area within that site.</p>
<p class="h3">The Temple Mount</p>
<p class="fl">Changes in the perimeter of the city by incorporating more territory within the walls extend the term Zion. When Solomon built the temple and his palace and extended the walls north of the Ophel Ridge to encompass the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.16-18">2 Sm 24:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.15-18,28">1 Chr 21:15-18, 28</a>), the name Zion was applied to these areas as well. The transfer of the ark “from the city of David which is Zion” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.1">1 Kgs 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.5.2">2 Chr 5:2</a>) to the temple hill brought both an extension and a reduction of the territory embraced by the term “Zion.” The whole city could still be called Zion, but from this point on, there would be a close identification between Zion and the temple hill. The temple precincts became the primary Zion; references to Zion in the poetic books and the preaching of the prophets are primarily to the temple area as the dwelling place of God.</p>
<p class="h3">The Entire City</p>
<p class="fl">The word “Zion” can be used as a designation of the entire city or its population without any particular reference to the temple area. This use is clearest in poetic passages where Zion is the parallel term to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.18">Pss 51:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">76:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.102.21">102:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.21">135:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.147.12">147:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.3">Is 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.19">30:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.20">33:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.32">37:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.9">40:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.41.27">41:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.62.1">62:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.26.18">Jer 26:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.35">51:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.2">Am 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.14">Zep 3:14</a>) or to the villages of Judah (<a href="?bref=Ps.69.35">Pss 69:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.8">97:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.9">Is 40:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalMotifs">Theological Motifs</p>
<p class="h3">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Many theological motifs attach to the Zion theme as it develops in redemptive history. The dominant motif of Zion as the dwelling place of God, the place where God is in the midst of his people, is conjoined to the larger theme of Immanuel, “God in our midst.” Just as the pillar of fire and cloud stood above the tabernacle during the wilderness wandering, so once Israel had attained the place of God’s choosing (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.5-14">Dt 12:5-14</a>), he would dwell there. When Jerusalem became David’s capital and Solomon had completed the temple, the glory cloud filled the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.10">1 Kgs 8:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.5.13-14">2 Chr 5:13-14</a>) and Jerusalem became the dwelling place of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.2">Pss 74:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">76:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.21">135:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.18">Is 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.17-21">Jl 3:17-21</a>). The Lord loved and chose Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.68">Pss 78:68</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.13">132:13</a>). His glorious presence was there, and from there he would speak (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.1-2">50:1-2</a>). His fire was in Zion, his furnace in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Isa.31.8-9">Is 31:8-9</a>). There he was enthroned above the cherubim (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.11">Pss 9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1-2">99:1-2</a>) and ruled over his people and the nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.23">Is 24:23</a>). His chosen king ruled from that holy hill (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.6">Pss 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1">48:1</a>).</p>
<p>Though the size of the site of ancient Jerusalem is not particularly impressive and ordinarily would not be considered a large hill, for the psalmist Zion is God’s holy hill (<a href="?bref=Ps.99.9">Ps 99:9</a>). The prophets describe it as “chief among the mountains, raised above the hills” (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.2">Is 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1">Mi 4:1</a>). The Canaanite god Baal was thought to dwell on a great mountain to the north, Mt Zaphon, so the psalmist describes Zion as “beautiful in its loftiness, like the utmost heights of Mt Zaphon” (<a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-2">Ps 48:1-2</a>). God’s sanctuary is “like the high mountains” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.68">Ps 78:68</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.2">Ez 40:2</a>).</p>
<p>An adequate water supply has been a problem for Jerusalem throughout its history. During the OT period, the city’s water came from one small spring. But in the eyes of the poets and prophets, Zion is gladdened by a great river that brings life wherever it flows (<a href="?bref=Ps.46.4">Ps 46:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1-12">Ez 47:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.18">Jl 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.1">Zec 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.8">14:8</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-2">Rv 22:1-2</a>). The threatening waters of chaos cannot shake the city of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.46.1-3">Ps 46:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>Because Zion is the city of God, it is the object of pilgrims, Jew and Gentile alike, who thirst to be in the presence of God in Zion’s temple (<a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-2">Pss 42:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.63.1">63:1</a>). The pilgrim psalms give vivid expression to their longing (<a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-12">84</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.122.1-9">122</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.125.1-128.6">125–128</a>). All humanity will come to God in Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.65.1-4">65:1-4</a>). The Gentiles will make annual pilgrimages bringing gifts (<a href="?bref=Ps.76.1-12">Ps 76</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.18.7">Is 18:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.9-10">Zep 3:9-10</a>); even former enemies will be regarded as native-born citizens of Zion (<a href="?bref=Ps.87.1-7">Ps 87</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.14">Is 60:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.21">Zec 14:21</a>). The nations will stream into Jerusalem to inaugurate an era of peace (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.1-5">Is 2:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-8">Mi 4:1-8</a>). Year after year the festivals of Israel will be celebrated in Zion by Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.16-19">Zec 14:16-19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT further develops the emphasis on both the heavenly and the eschatological Zion. For example, the author of Hebrews said that the OT saints looked “forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God . . . longing for a better country—a heavenly one” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.10,16">Heb 11:10, 16</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>), but none of them received the promises because God had planned something even better (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.11.39-40">39-40</a>). The church now enjoys what believers of the old covenant could never know: unlimited access to the presence of God in that Holy City, “Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.12.22">12:22</a>; see vv <a href="?bref=Heb.12.18-24">18-24</a>). Earthly Zion is but a shadow of the heavenly reality. The present city of Jerusalem is likened to a slave woman, but the heavenly Jerusalem is free and the mother of both Jew and Gentile (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-27">Gal 4:21-27</a>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.49.14-23">Is 49:14-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.1">54:1</a>). The NT also looks forward to the eschatological expectation of the re-creation of heaven and earth and the revelation of the new Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">Rv 21:2</a>). It is a city on a great high mountain (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.10">Rv 21:10</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-2">Pss 48:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.68">78:68</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2">Is 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.2">Ez 40:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1">Mi 4:1</a>), and a river of life flows within (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-2">Rv 22:1-2</a>).</p>

  <title>Zion, Daughter of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ZION, Daughter of</p>
<p class="fl">Term used primarily in prophetic literature to designate the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Zion) and its surrounding regions. The term was further applied to those in Babylon who had been exiled from Jerusalem and the Judean countryside (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.8">Is 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.31">Jer 4:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.2,23">6:2, 23</a>). Since ancient cities were considered metaphorically to be the mother of their inhabitants, referring to the people of Jerusalem as “daughters of Zion” was entirely appropriate, particularly in poetic literature. While Israel was to be the “virgin daughter” of spiritual Zion (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.21">2 Kgs 19:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.37.22">Is 37:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.2.13">Lam 2:13</a>), many of the prophetic contexts proclaim judgment on the unfaithful “daughters” (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.16-17">Is 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.4.4">4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.1.13">Mi 1:13</a>). Although the “daughters of Zion” were judged for their unfaithfulness, the ultimate promise was that God would deliver them (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.2">Is 52:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.62.11">62:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zec 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.5">Mt 21:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.15">Jn 12:15</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">ZOAN</p>
<p class="fl">One of the principal cities in the delta region of ancient Egypt. Zoan, which was variously known as Zoan, Tanis, Avaris, and possibly Rameses (the towns were either the same or contiguous), was located on the south shore of Lake Menzaleh at the northeastern edge of the Egyptian Delta. Zoan was rebuilt during or shortly before the Hyksos period (c. 1730 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.22">Nm 13:22</a>). Because of its strategic location on the Tanitic branch of the Nile and near Egypt’s northeastern frontier, Zoan was an important military and political base during the entire period of Egyptian native rule. It served as the capital city during the Hyksos period, as well as serving as the effective capital during the 21st through the 23d dynasties (c. 1090–718 <span class="era">BC</span>) and as the northern capital during the 25th dynasty (c. 712–663 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Zoan was significant to the Israelites during each of its periods of ascendancy. Whether the exodus occurred early (c. 1441 <span class="era">BC</span>) or late (1290 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Israelite settlement in Egypt would have been in the general vicinity of Zoan. The Israelites built the store cities of Pithom and Rameses, and possibly the latter should be identified with Zoan. In the account of the exodus in <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">Psalm 78</a>, the city of Zoan is poetically parallel to Egypt, indicating that it was either the capital or at least a significant city. During the period of Isaiah, Zoan was again significant, being designated as the home of the “princes” and “officials” of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.11-13">Is 19:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.14">Ez 30:14</a>).</p>

Despite the fact that Zoar was evidently a small town (v <a href="?bref=Gen.19.22">22</a>; Zoar means “little”), this place was evidently considered a significant geographical landmark in ancient times. When Abraham and Lot divided the land, Lot selected the land close to Zoar (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.10">13:10</a>).

<p class="h1">ZOBAH</p>
<p class="fl">Aramean nation suffering military defeat from Israel during the early kingdom period. King Saul defeated the kings of Zobah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sm 14:47</a>). Soon after David became king of Israel, he defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.3-5,12">2 Sm 8:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.3-10">1 Chr 18:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.60.1">Ps 60 title</a>). Later, the Ammonites hired 20,000 “Syrians of Zobah” for an anticipated attack by David’s forces. The coalition of Ammonites and hired mercenaries was defeated by soldiers led by Joab (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.6-14">2 Sm 10:6-14</a>). When Hadadezer’s army counterattacked, they were again defeated decisively by David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.15-19">2 Sm 10:15-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.16-19">1 Chr 19:16-19</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">A city of the Shephelah and its people, attributed to both the tribe of Dan and of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.33">Jos 15:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.41">19:41</a>). It was part of Judah’s original allocation but was settled by Danites until they established their own territory near Laish (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-11">Jgs 18:1-11</a>). Originally Zorah and nearby Eshtaol seem to have been settled by residents of Kiriath-jearim (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.53">1 Chr 2:53</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.2">4:2</a>). The city was the home of Manoah, the father of Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.2">Jgs 13:2</a>). Samson’s ministry was focused in the region surrounding Zorah and Eshtaol, and he was ultimately buried there. Zorah is traditionally identified with Tell Sur’ah, which is strategically located at the entrance to a large valley leading toward the Mediterranean plain.</p>

Possibly these Zuzites are associated with the Zamzummites of <a href="?bref=Deut.2.20">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>, since both are linked to the same geographical proximity. Furthermore, both passages speak of them in connection with races of giants, including the Horites, the Emim, and the Rephaim.</p>
