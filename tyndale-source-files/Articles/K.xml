<p class="fl">City located in the extreme south of Judah’s territory adjacent to neighboring Edom (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.21">Jos 15:21</a>; also called Jekabzeel in <a href="?bref=Neh.11.25">Neh 11:25</a>).

<p class="h1">KADESH, KADESH-BARNEA</p>
<p class="fl">Home of the wandering Israelites for nearly 38 years. In the vast area of the Sinai there are two main oases: in the south is Wadi Feiran, near the mountain of Moses (Mt Sinai or Horeb); in the north is Kadesh, or Kadesh-barnea. The former was the place where the law was given; the latter, the main campsite of the 12 tribes during their exodus from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.46">Dt 1:46</a>).</p>
<p>Kadesh-barnea (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.7">Gn 14:7</a>, “En-mishpat”) was raided by Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, during the time of Abraham. In this area Hagar was driven from the tent of Sarah, her mistress (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.14">16:14</a>), and here Miriam died and was buried (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1">Nm 20:1</a>). The great contention over water took place here, giving rise to the name Meribah or Meribath-kadesh (<a href="?bref=Num.20.2-24">Nm 20:2-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.51">Dt 32:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.19">Ez 47:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.48.28">48:28</a>). This was also the scene of Korah’s rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron (<a href="?bref=Num.16.1-17.13">Nm 16–17</a>). This area would long remain in the memory of the Israelite tribes as the place of their unbelief following the report of the 10 spies and a delay of 38 years before their occupancy of the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.8-11">Ps 95:8-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-19">Heb 3:7-19</a>).</p>
<p>Because of the water, pasture, and agricultural lands, plus its proximity to Canaan, the Israelites found this area the best spot in which to spend most of their time prior to entering the Promised Land.</p>

<p class="list">1. Second son of Ishmael, Abraham’s son (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.13">Gn 25:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.29">1 Chr 1:29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Tribe or area appearing mainly in the prophetic writings from Solomon to the exile. In Isaiah’s prophecy against Arabia, Kedar is mentioned twice (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.13-17">Is 21:13-17</a>). Along with Arabia, Dedan, and Tema, the Kedarites are threatened with destruction. The pomp attributed to them in verse <a href="?bref=Isa.21.16">16</a> indicates some degree of affluence (see also <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.21">Ez 27:21</a>), and the militaristic tone of verse <a href="?bref=Isa.21.17">17</a> points to the fact that they were a warring people. In <a href="?bref=Jer.49.28">Jeremiah 49:28</a> Kedar is linked with Hazor as victims of Nebuchadnezzar’s conquests. Although there is no extrabiblical record of Nebuchadnezzar’s march on Kedar, Ashurbanipal, the king of Assyria, does mention the conquest of Kedar. That would have been about 650 <span class="era">BC</span>, or a half a century earlier than the Babylonian conquest. Apart from Ashurbanipal’s account, the only other ancient extrabiblical reference to Kedar is found on a silver bowl offered to the Arabian goddess Han-’ilat in the Egyptian Delta. The inscription on the bowl reads, “Cain, son of Geshem, king of Kedar,” and the date is firmly fixed in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. This Geshem was very likely the enemy of Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.19">Neh 2:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.6.1-6">6:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The picture the Bible gives of Kedar is that of a desert nomadic people descended from Ishmael. They were not initially believers in Yahweh but are included in Isaiah’s prophecy of the future kingdom of God (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.42.11">Is 42:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.7">60:7</a>). Their desert environment limited their work to sheep herding and trading. Because of unpredictable water supplies in the desert, they were constantly moving—a way of life best handled by living in tents rather than permanent houses (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.120.5">Ps 120:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.1.5">Sg 1:5</a>). For this reason archaeologists have found no site named Kedar. All we can surmise is that the area of Kedar lay to the east and slightly to the south of Israel in what is today the southern part of Jordan. The people of Kedar presumably died out or were assimilated into the surrounding nations.</p>

<p class="h1">KEDORLAOMER</p>
<p class="fl">King of Elam who participated with three other kings in a campaign against five cities near the southern end of the Dead Sea plain (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Gn 14</a>). Although Kedorlaomer is initially third in the list (v <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1">1</a>), he was evidently the leader of the four kings. Elsewhere in the chapter his name comes first or stands alone.</p>
<p>For 12 years the five cities of the plain were vassals of Kedorlaomer. In the 13th year the cities rebelled, and the next year Kedorlaomer enlisted allies to enforce his lordship. The victorious kings looted the cities and took prisoners. Because the patriarch Abram’s nephew Lot was among the captives, Abram mustered his servants and allies and pursued Kedorlaomer as far as Damascus. Kedorlaomer was defeated, and the captured loot and prisoners were rescued.</p>
<p>The first half of the name Kedorlaomer is a common Elamite word meaning “servant.” The second half is probably the name of an Elamite deity. Although both elements of the name are known outside the Bible, the combination is not. It fits, however, with an early second-millennium <span class="era">BC</span> date for the encounter, coinciding with the biblical account.</p>

<p class="h1">KENITES</p>
<p class="fl">One of 10 tribes living in Canaan during Abraham’s time (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.19">Gn 15:19</a>). The Kenites, however, are not included in the parallel statement from Moses’ day (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.17">Ex 3:17</a>). The apparent reason for this is a more favorable relationship with Israel by that time. That Israel continued to accord special treatment to the Kenites is clear from <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.6">1 Samuel 15:6</a>. When Saul mobilized his army against the Amalekites, he gave a warning before the attack. This kindness seems to reflect the aid given by Hobab, son of Reuel, who was their guide in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29-31">Nm 10:29-31</a>).</p>
<p>By the time of Barak the judge and Deborah the prophetess, there was a branch of the Kenites in Galilee. <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a> says, “Now Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Moses’ brother-in-law Hobab, had moved away from the other members of his tribe and pitched his tent by the Oak of Zaanannim, near Kedesh” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This Kedesh was in Galilee and was not the Kadesh-barnea of the Sinai wilderness.</p>
<p>Since the name Kenite is closely related to the word for (copper) smith in both Arabic and Aramaic, it may be that this tribe was something of a trade guild of wandering smiths who offered their skills where needed. Nomadic tribes of metalworkers were known to have moved about in the ancient Near East from the early second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Such artisans are found among the party of Asiatics pictured on the Beni-Hasan tomb in Egypt, dating from the 19th century <span class="era">BC</span>. In modern times at least one Arab tribe of gypsylike traveling smiths or tinkers has followed the trade routes in search of employment.</p>
<p>In light of the biblical information about the Kenites, the major question is the influence this seemingly ubiquitous tribe had on the life and culture of the Hebrews. The least likely suggestion is that Moses was dependent on his Kenite/Midianite father-in-law, Jethro, for making the bronze serpent (<a href="?bref=Num.21.4-9">Nm 21:4-9</a>). However, it is likely that the Kenites, if indeed expert in metallurgy, may have taught this technology to God’s covenant people to help them achieve settled nationhood. More serious is the suggestion that Jethro (also called Reuel), “priest of Midian,” was the source of Moses’ theology—the monotheistic religion of Jehovah (or Yahweh). This suggestion can be countered from two angles—one biblical and the other historical.</p>
<p>The biblical reference specifically stating that Jehovah was the personal God known to godly men from the earliest generations is <a href="?bref=Gen.4.26">Genesis 4:26</a>: “And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah” (<span class="sc">asv</span>). Equally significant is the fact that Moses’ mother (or ancestress, as some would conclude) bore the name Jochebed, “Jehovah is glory.” Obviously, then, Moses did not first hear of Jehovah from his father-in-law during his exile in the wilderness of Midian. The historical evidence indicates that no cultic sites (worship centers) other than the mobile tabernacle were located in Sinai or anywhere south of Beersheba. It was south of that city that the God who earlier revealed himself to the patriarchs at various localities in the north announced to Moses that he was none other than the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6">Ex 3:6</a>). The Israelites never returned to Sinai for worship, even though God had first revealed himself to them there.</p>
<p>Jethro clearly learned of Jehovah through Moses, not vice versa. Those Kenites who became part of the family of God’s people did so by adoption, by introduction through Israel’s witness into the covenant relationship with the God of Jacob.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.55">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> includes the Kenite Hammath, father of the Recabites, within the genealogy of Judah’s tribe, into which they had been assimilated. David also links the Kenites with other inhabitants of southern Judah (<a href="?bref=1Sam.27.10">1 Sm 27:10</a>). <a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-19">Jeremiah 35</a> states that the Recabites preserved the simple nomadic life of their ancestors down to the time of the Babylonian captivity. This, too, conforms to what is known about the nature of the Kenites.</p>

<p class="h1">KENIZZITES</p>
<p class="fl">A people related to Kenaz, grandson of Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.11,15">Gn 36:11, 15</a>). The Kenizzites were of Edomite stock and resided to the southeast of Judah in the vicinity of the Kenites. They are thought to belong to the pre-Israelite population of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.19">Gn 15:19</a>). Their territory was to be given to the Israelites along with that of the Kenites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.15.19-21">19-21</a>).</p>
<p>In Numbers and Joshua, Caleb, the faithful spy, is reckoned to belong to the Kenizzites (<a href="?bref=Num.32.12">Nm 32:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.14.6,14">Jos 14:6, 14</a>). According to <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.15">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>, Caleb’s genealogy is traced back to Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.1">1 Chr 4:1</a>). The relationship of Caleb to the Kenizzites is far from clear. Caleb established his patrimony at Kiriath-sepher (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.11-13">Jgs 1:11-13</a>), which is in Judah but which is also situated close to the territory of the Kenizzites. Critical opinion views the Kenizzites as non-Israelites who occupied Hebron, Debir, and the southernmost hill country of the Negev and became politically incorporated into Judah.</p>

They were judged with “the rest of the seacoast” for the Philistines’ offense against Israel. Since the Philistines most likely originated in the islands of the Mediterranean, including Crete, the word Kerethite probably means Cretan. “Pelethite” is probably an alternate spelling of Philistine.</p>
<p>Because of the Kerethites’ Philistine connections, what is known about the Philistines may shed light on them. Archaeological evidence from Cretan murals and Egyptian tomb paintings and temple reliefs shows Philistines wearing plumed headdresses. Similarities between Philistine, Cretan, and Greek pottery designs also suggest a strong link among these Mediterranean peoples.</p>
<p>Kerethites and Pelethites were hired by David as mercenaries, forming an elite corps of foreign soldiers faithful to him through all his troubles (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.18">2 Sm 15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.20.7,23">20:7, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.38">1 Kgs 1:38</a>).

  <title>Kerygma*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">KERYGMA*</p>
<p class="fl">Basic evangelistic message proclaimed by the earliest Christians. More fully, it is the proclamation of the death, resurrection, and exaltation of Jesus that leads to an evaluation of his person as both Lord and Christ, confronts one with the necessity of repentance, and promises the forgiveness of sins. The kerygma is drawn from two sources: (1) the fragments of pre-Pauline tradition that lie embedded in the writings of the apostle, and (2) the early evangelistic speeches of Peter in the book of Acts. When these two sources are compared, a single basic message emerges.</p>
<p>The kerygma is essentially the same as the gospel, although the term itself emphasizes the <span class="ital">manner</span> of delivery somewhat more than the <span class="ital">message</span> that is being proclaimed. In the ancient world the king made known his decrees by means of a <span class="greek">kerux</span> (a town crier or herald). This person, who often served as a close confidant of the king, would travel throughout the realm announcing to the people whatever the king wished to make known. It is this note of authoritative declaration that is so appropriately transferred to the evangelizing activities of the primitive church.</p>
<p>The simplest outline of the kerygma is made up of (1) a proclamation of the death, resurrection, and exaltation of Jesus, seen as the fulfillment of prophecy and involving human responsibility; (2) the resultant evaluation of Jesus as both Lord and Christ; and (3) a summons to repent and receive forgiveness of sins. However, on the basis of a careful study of the actual texts themselves, the kerygma did <span class="ital">not</span> contain (1) a declaration of the dawn of the messianic age; (2) any reference to the life and ministry of Jesus (in contrast to his death and resurrection); or (3) a major emphasis on the Second Coming as part of the evangelistic proclamation. While all of these issues are part of the larger theological presentation of the NT, they do not appear to have been included in the essential apostolic gospel. In any case, they are missing from the various texts that provide the source for the kerygma.</p>
<p>It is evident that the resurrection plays the central role in the drama of redemption. The kerygma always focuses on the resurrection. This supernatural act of God in history authenticates the words and works of Jesus and constitutes the basis for the Christian hope of immortality. Without the resurrection, the church would be no more than a group of well-intentioned religious people who had placed their faith in the superior philosophical and ethical teachings of an unusually fine man. The resurrection is proof positive that Jesus is who he said he was. Only if he is the Son of God can his death provide an appropriate and sufficient sacrifice for human sin. Essentially, the kerygma is a declaration that Christ is risen from the dead and that by that great act God has brought salvation.</p>
<p>The kerygma is not a dull recital of historical facts but a dynamic confrontation between the Holy Spirit and the sinful heart of man at the point of its basic need. Who can deny that the reality of the resurrection validates the claims of Christ? Who can resist the compelling logic of the resurrection as it leads irresistibly to the conclusion that Jesus of Nazareth is the living Lord? To repent and believe is to enter the kingdom of God. The kerygma has as its ultimate goal not a sophisticated theology but a transformed life. It is the declaration that in Christ the new order of eternal life has already entered into time and history.</p>

Keturah’s sons were the ancestors of tribes with which Israel came into contact after the Conquest, especially Midian and Jokshan’s sons Sheba and Dedan (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.3">Gn 25:3</a>). As far as can be determined, the tribes settled in the north and central regions of the northern Euphrates, as far as the central sections of the Arabian Desert.

  <title>Keys of the Kingdom</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">KEYS OF THE KINGDOM</p>
<p class="fl">Symbolic description of the authority given by Jesus to Peter in <a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">Matthew 16:19</a>: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Many ancient peoples believed that heaven and hell were closed by gates to which certain deities and angelic beings had keys. In Greek mythology, for example, Pluto kept the key to hades. Jewish writings near the time of Jesus give God the key to the abode of the dead. In the book of Revelation, John sees Christ holding the keys of death and hades (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.18">Rv 1:18</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rev.3.7">3:7</a>).</p>
<p>In Matthew’s Gospel the keys symbolize the authority to open and shut the kingdom of heaven. In response to Peter’s declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>), Jesus entrusts authority to “bind” and “loose” to Peter (v <a href="?bref=Matt.16.19">19</a>). This authority is later extended to the other disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.18">18:18</a>). The words “bind” and “loose” were used by rabbis near the time of Christ to declare someone under a ban (“binding”) and relief of the ban (“loosing”). Sometimes this referred to expulsion or reinstatement at a synagogue. At other times binding and loosing indicated consignment to God’s judgment or acquittal from it. The “power of the keys” (or binding and loosing) of which Jesus speaks is a spiritual authority like that he gave the disciples in <a href="?bref=John.20.23">John 20:23</a>: “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The Pharisees and scribes assumed that as teachers of the law they had power to shut the kingdom of heaven against others (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.13">Mt 23:13</a>). Yet as blind guides they failed to recognize what Peter had acknowledged—that Jesus was the one in whom God’s kingdom had come. The keys of the kingdom authorized the pronouncement of judgment and the promise of forgiveness—not by human authority, but on the basis of Christ’s word.</p>

The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.6">2 Samuel 6:6</a> refers to this place as “the threshing floor of Nacon.” Following the death of Uzzah, the place was renamed Perez-uzzah, which means either “the breach of Uzzah” or “the outbreak against Uzzah” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.8">2 Sm 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.11">1 Chr 13:11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">KIDRON</p>
<p class="fl">Valley and streambed running below the southeast wall of Jerusalem and separating the city from the Mt of Olives on the east. It then turns southeast from Jerusalem and follows a winding course to the Dead Sea. The Kidron can be described as a torrent bed that is nearly always dry, since the watercourse flows only in the rainy season, partly maintained by the two irregular springs Gihon and En-rogel.</p>
<p>The Gihon was the vital water source for the old City of David, and in Hezekiah’s day an underground tunnel was cut in the rock to guarantee a water supply in time of siege, thus supplying the pool of Siloam within the city walls.</p>
<p>The term “brook” found in <a href="?bref=John.18.1">John 18:1</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) would be better translated “winter flow” or “winter course,” since the original word intends to convey this seasonal character of the creek rather than to suggest a river.</p>
<p>The two most important functions of the Kidron Valley for the city of Jerusalem are military and funerary. The walls of the city have always towered over the valley, and its steepness made it extremely difficult for any attack to succeed from that side. Over the centuries rubble from nearby ruins has raised the floor of the valley. In places the present floor is some 40 feet (12.2 meters) above earlier historic levels; it is not certain how many ancient caves and tombs must lie below the present surface. The wide space just south of the city, where the Kidron meets and merges with the Tyropean and Hinnom Valleys, has always been a favorite spot for the royal gardens, irrigated from the two nearby springs.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfTheKidronValley"/>
<p>Since the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>, the Kidron has been called “the valley of Jehoshaphat” (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.12">Jl 3:12</a>), scene of the judgment of nations at the last day, and this tradition is strong among both Muslims and Jews. Today the sides of the valley are crowded with tombs. Even before the exile it was a popular place for burial (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.4-12">2 Kgs 23:4-12</a> refers to the graves of the common people and to the dumping of idolatrous refuse there; see also <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.4-5">2 Chr 34:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>The first reference to the Kidron Valley is in <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.23">2 Samuel 15:23</a>, where the people and David crossed over toward the desert. This strategic move would give them a way of escape if rebellious Absalom’s forces decided to attack the city. The people and the king wept bitterly during this move (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.30">2 Sm 15:30</a>) because it had such a depressing significance; David was abandoning Zion without a fight. Later the offensive Shimei was forbidden to cross the Kidron by Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.36-38">1 Kgs 2:36-38</a>) on pain of death. Josephus mentions that the wicked queen Athaliah was put to death in the Kidron Valley (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 9.7.3), but it is not clear from <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.16">2 Kings 11:16</a> whether the horses’ entrance to the palace opened onto the Kidron.</p>
<p>The last reference to the Kidron is the occasion of Jesus’ crossing it with his disciples on the eve of his betrayal (<a href="?bref=John.18.1">Jn 18:1</a>). The parallels with the crossing of David are interesting, considering the place David holds in the establishment of the biblical symbolism of king and kingdom. Eschatologically, Jeremiah foretells a time when the Kidron will be sacred to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.38-40">Jer 31:38-40</a>) as part of the restoration of Israel.</p>

  <title>Kindness</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">KINDNESS</p>
<p class="fl">State of being that includes the attributes of loving affection, sympathy, friendliness, patience, pleasantness, gentleness, and goodness. Kindness is a quality shown in the way a person speaks and acts. It is more volitional than emotional.</p>
<p>The Bible is filled with illustrations of kindness. Joseph wanted Pharaoh’s butler to show kindness by remembering him to Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.14">Gn 40:14</a>). Rahab requested kind treatment from Israel for her protection of the two spies who had come into her home (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.12">Jos 2:12</a>). Before he attacked Amalek, Saul asked the Kenites to leave the Amalekite territory, not wanting to kill them along with the Amalekites because of the kindness they had shown Israel when Israel came up from Egypt (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.6">1 Sm 15:6</a>). David commended the men of Jabesh-gilead for the kindness they had shown Saul in giving his body a decent burial (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.5">2 Sm 2:5</a>). Jonathan requested “unfailing kindness” of David so that he would not be killed (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.14-15">1 Sm 20:14-15</a>). David extended this kindness to Jonathan’s son by granting him the right to eat at the king’s table (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.1-7">2 Sm 9:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>It is the worst kind of ingratitude to return evil for kindness. Abimelech wanted Abraham to swear that he would return kindness for kindness to his offspring (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.23">Gn 21:23</a>). Abner showed kindness to Ishbosheth by not delivering him over to David, while Ishbosheth, in return, charged Abner with guilt regarding Saul’s concubine, Rizpah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.8">2 Sm 3:8</a>). Hanun received David’s kind act of sending condolences on his father’s death by humiliating David’s messengers, thereby bringing on war between the two nations (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.2-19">10:2-19</a>). Absalom rebuked Hushai, David’s friend, for supposedly leaving David’s side when he needed him. Absalom asked Hushai if that was the way he was repaying David’s friendship (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.17">2 Sm 16:17</a>; see also <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.22">2 Chr 24:22</a>).</p>
<p>God’s actions provide the outstanding illustrations of kindness in the Bible. The Levites praised God because he had proved to be a God of forgiveness, graciousness, compassion, and abundant lovingkindness (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.17-31">Neh 9:17-31</a>). To highlight God’s virtue even more, they declared his kindness against the backdrop of Israel’s unfaithfulness. God did not forsake his people, even though they forsook him for a golden calf. He gave them his Spirit to instruct them. He gave them manna to eat and water to drink for 40 years in the wilderness. He gave them Canaan, a land in which to dwell.</p>
<p>The high point of God’s kindness was his provision of salvation for sinners, not on the basis of their works but on the basis of his mercy (<a href="?bref=Titus.3.4">Ti 3:4</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Eph.2.7">Eph 2:7</a>). Because of God’s great kindness toward them, in giving both physical and spiritual blessings, Christians are exhorted, as God’s elect, to put on hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience; that is, to show kindness to others in return for God’s kindness (<a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>). The apostle Peter commanded Christians to add to their faith, along with other excellences, the excellence of brotherly kindness (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.7">2 Pt 1:7</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">KING</p>
<p class="fl">The word <span class="hebrew">melek</span> (king) occurs more than 2,000 times in the Hebrew OT. It may refer to God (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.3">Ps 95:3</a>) or to human rulers. Generally it designates one invested with ultimate authority and power over his subjects. In the OT, the word <span class="hebrew">melek</span> designates the ruler of a tribe (“the kings of Midian,” <a href="?bref=Num.31.8">Nm 31:8</a>), a city (Jericho, Ai; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.12.9-24">Jos 12:9-24</a>, where 31 kings of city-states conquered by the Israelites are listed), a nation (Israel, Judah, Ammon, Moab, Aram), or an international power (such as Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, or Persia). Other words may also refer to royalty. The Philistines introduced the title <span class="hebrew">seren</span> (lord) into Hebrew vocabulary. The five Philistine cities were ruled by five lords. Another word for an Israelite king is <span class="hebrew">nagid</span> (ruler). Both Saul and David were anointed as <span class="hebrew">nagid</span> over Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">1 Sm 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.13">16:13</a>). In the NT and the Septuagint, the Greek version of the OT, the Greek word <span class="greek">basileus</span> has a meaning similar to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">melek</span><span class="ital">.</span> The NT <span class="greek">basileus</span> refers to secular rulers living in the first century, kings of Israel, rulers of the past, and the divine King, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The phrase “King of kings,” attributed to Jesus (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.15">1 Tm 6:15</a>), is a Hebrew expression meaning supreme or greatest king. For example, in Ezekiel’s prediction of the fall of Tyre, Nebuchadnezzar is named the “king of kings” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.26.7">Ez 26:7</a>). The great rulers of Assyria and Babylon introduced this title. Before their time, rulers were called either “king” or “great king,” as in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.28">2 Kings 18:28</a>: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Later rulers had their titles adjusted to keep up with the expanse of their empires.</p>
<p class="h2" id="KingshipinIsrael">Kingship in Israel</p>
<p class="fl">God chose Abraham as the father of nations; through him and his descendants the messianic rule would be established on earth. In his promises to Abraham, God repeatedly assured him that he would become the father of a mighty nation, to whom God would give the land of Canaan, and that kings would arise from his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.6">Gn 17:6</a>). Abraham showed his acceptance of the rule of God over his family by obeying God’s command to be circumcised, which set the clan of Abraham apart for the service of God (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.17.10-14">10-14</a>). The ultimate purpose of God’s relation with Abraham and his descendants was that God would be King over Israel and that his people would show their acceptance of his rule by their faithful obedience to him (v <a href="?bref=Gen.17.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>At the heart of the covenant was God’s expectation of loyalty to his rule. Abraham and his descendants were to exercise their God-given “rule” over the nations by living in fellowship with the great King. Thus the Lord reestablished his dominion over mankind. Through Abraham and his descendants, he would raise up a “royal nation” to whom the full privileges of rule over his creation would be restored.</p>
<p>The Lord also made a covenant with Israel. This covenant was a sovereign administration of grace and promise by which the Lord consecrated the people unto himself by the sanctions of divine law and by his very presence. The nation, witnessing God’s care for them, had to learn that by their obedience to God’s expectations the theocratic kingdom might become a reality on earth. In the Sinaitic covenant the theocracy (the rule of God) was established. Israel was entrusted with the commandments, so that they might show themselves to be a theocratic nation, as God revealed to Moses: “Now if you will obey me and keep my covenant, you will be my own special treasure from among all the nations of the earth; for all the earth belongs to me. And you will be to me a kingdom of priests, my holy nation” (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-6">Ex 19:5-6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). They were God’s elect for the sake of the nations; through Israel’s priestly obedience and intercession, the whole earth might know the Creator-Redeemer.</p>
<p>The qualities of God’s kingship were power, glory, fidelity, wisdom, concern, service, delegation of power to man, blessing and protection, just rule, judgment, vindication, and deliverance. Israel’s kingship was to be no different from God’s. Their varied and sometimes complex laws taught Israel to distinguish between what was holy and common, clean and unclean, the ways of God and the ways of the nations. The ways of God enhanced love, fidelity, justice, peace, harmony, service, concern for others, wise living, defense of the needy, and judgment of the guilty. The ways of the kingdoms of the world all too often promoted selfishness, anarchy, despotism, and disregard for justice. </p>
<p>The Lord also instituted an organizational structure designed to promote his theocratic purposes. In the wilderness Moses and the chosen leaders of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.19-26">Ex 18:19-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.24-25">Nm 11:24-25</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.1.15-18">Dt 1:15-18</a>) were God’s instruments for upholding his kingship in Israel. Upon Moses’ death, Joshua took over the theocratic rule. The Lord was with him as he had been with Moses, and all Israel recognized the continuity of God’s rule in Joshua’s leadership (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.9">Dt 34:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.3.7">Jos 3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.4.14">4:14</a>). Like Moses had before his death, Joshua charged the leadership and Israel to persevere in the gracious covenant relationship (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-24.33">Jos 23–24</a>). However, Israel perished because of its greed, immorality, strife, and idolatry. During the period of the judges, each one did what was right in his own eyes (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.6">Jgs 17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1">18:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1">19:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.21.25">21:25</a>). There was no king in the land in those days. The judges were military leaders whom the Lord raised up to deliver his people from their foreign oppressors. But God remained King, regardless of the fact that Israel lived as if he were not. The period of the judges demonstrated that apostate Israel, disobedient to their King, was unsuccessful in dealing with the surrounding nations.</p>
<p>The theocratic leadership was restored to Israel by the ministry of Samuel. He was born into a Levitical family and served the Lord at the Shiloh tabernacle. He was called to be a prophet—an office which had not been filled since Moses’ death (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.20-21">1 Sm 3:20-21</a>). He was recognized as a judge in Israel (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.15">7:15</a>). In Samuel the offices of priest, prophet, and king were combined. He is never called king, as his lifestyle was that of a prophet rather than that of a ruler. The carefully calculated request of the people for a king was a rejection of Samuel’s ministry. The people were not satisfied with the spiritual, charismatic leadership of Samuel. In their search for a more dynamic leader they found in the kings of the surrounding nations attractive elements: power, manifestation of glory, and stability. Thus far the tribes had experienced several civil wars that endangered the unity of Israel. It was thought that a king would remedy all of the social and political problems. Though God had foreseen the days of the monarchy in the law (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">Dt 17:14-20</a>), the people were motivated to introduce the kingship for secular rather than religious reasons: “Give us a king like all the other nations have” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.5">1 Sm 8:5</a>); “We want to be like the nations around us. Our king will govern us and lead us into battle” (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.8.20">20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Samuel never accepted the idea of kingship; it was foreign to the theocratic ideal.</p>
<p>The crucial difference between kingship in Israel and kingship in neighboring lands lay in the fact that God endowed the king of Israel with his Spirit to establish his rule on earth. God ruled for his people, and his people benefited was from his rule; he was their provider, protector, and divine warrior.</p>
<p>Samuel was instrumental in anointing Saul (a sad example of kingship) and David (a good example of kingly rule under God). Saul’s kingship revealed a despotic, uncaring attitude and self-aggrandizement. He was intent on establishing his dynasty, while not caring sufficiently for the people of God. Therefore, the Lord rejected his kingship (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.23">1 Sm 15:23</a>).</p>
<p>David’s kingship, in contrast to Saul’s, was in line with God’s because it reflected the glory of Yahweh’s kingship. David’s life and rule are taken up in the two books of Samuel as a commentary on the pros and cons of kingship. Positively, David was a man after God’s heart, who sought the will of God, repented of his sin, and sought the glory of God. Negatively, David failed in his personal and family life to uphold the high standards of God’s law. Yet God was pleased to choose David’s dynasty as the lineage through which Jesus Christ would come. The prophet Nathan assured David that his dynasty would last: “Your dynasty and your kingdom will continue for all time before me, and your throne will be secure forever” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sm 7:16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). But God did not promise that it would be immune from prosecution or banishment.</p>
<p>The outstanding qualities of the kingship of David and his son Solomon reflect the true theocratic intention: concern for the Lord, for a heart of wisdom and integrity, and for the well-being of God’s people. Concern for the Lord found expression in the preparation for and actual building of the temple (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.132.1-18">Ps 132</a>). Concern for integrity and wisdom is clearly evident, especially in David’s response to Nathan’s rebuke (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.1-31">2 Sm 12</a>) and in Solomon’s request to have a heart of wisdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1-28">1 Kgs 3</a>). Concern for the people comes to expression in their securing the borders against enemies, achieving national unification, and bringing opportunity for economic growth. The era of David and Solomon represented a true reflection of God’s kingship on earth.</p>
<p>The accounts in Kings and Chronicles unfold the subsequent history of kingship in Israel and Judah. The good kings followed the examples provided by David and Solomon in securing Jerusalem against foreign invaders, in supplying for the needs of the temple, in having God’s people instructed in the word of God, and in modeling their rule after the law of Moses. A good Davidic king loved the Lord, the temple, the law, and God’s people. He served them as a good shepherd. Evil kings were those who rejected this model of kingship in favor of the pagan models. So Omri and Ahab introduced the Phoenician culture with its Baalism, utterly disregarding the heritage of Israel.</p>
<p>The Davidic king was treated as a member of God’s household, being a “son” of the great King (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.14-16">2 Sm 7:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.2.6-7">Ps 2:6-7</a>). The Davidic king was to be loyal to the great King, Yahweh. He, like Moses and Joshua, received his orders directly from the Lord; but unlike with Moses, the word of the Lord was mediated through the prophets. He, like Moses and Joshua, was expected to serve his God and his people.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMessiah-King">The Messiah-King</p>
<p class="fl">The descendants of David failed to maintain and expand the theocracy. By the eighth and seventh centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, it was apparent that even the greatest kings were dwarfed by the stature of David and Solomon. The prophets (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.2-7">Is 9:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-9">11:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.14-16">Jer 33:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.22-31">Ez 34:22-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2-5">Mi 5:2-5</a>) spoke of another king, the Messiah, a descendant of David who would rule permanently and by whose rule the reign of God would extend to the ends of the earth. He would put down all opposition to God’s rule, remove all enemies, and bring in an era of universal peace and righteousness. The Messiah-King would reveal the perfections of divine rule, as the Spirit of God would be upon him. His kingship would be marked by service to the people of God, so that they would be a well-cared-for flock; he would serve them as their shepherd.</p>
<p>In the coming of Jesus the messianic kingdom is more clearly revealed. He is the King of whom the angels said, “The Savior—yes, the Messiah, the Lord—has been born tonight in Bethlehem, the city of David!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.11">Lk 2:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). These magnificent words show continuity with the prophetic word. Jesus is the Savior, whose role includes deliverance from sin but also deliverance from all causes of adversity, evil, and the effects of the curse. His mission pertains to both forgiveness and to the establishment of peace on earth (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.77-79">1:77-79</a>). In this light we must look at Jesus’ ministry of healing, feeding, opposing the forces of evil, suffering, and teaching as the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth. He is the King who serves, fights against the demonic powers, and overcomes. The resurrection marks his victory, and he is crowned with glory by being seated at the right hand of the Father (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.33-36">Acts 2:33-36</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.25">1 Cor 15:25</a>). In being the Savior he is none other than Christ the Lord. The early apostolic preaching proclaimed that Jesus is the Messiah of God and the Lord. The lordship of Jesus is corollary to his being the Messiah. To those who call on him, he is the Savior-Messiah-Lord (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.9-15">Rom 10:9-15</a>), but to those who reject him, he is the divine warrior, before whom all knees will bow and who will bring in the era of the Father’s judgment (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.1.12-16">Rv 1:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-21">19:11-21</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus taught his disciples that at his coming in glory he would be seated on his throne and all mankind would pay him obeisance. The enemies of God will be cast out from his presence, and the people of God will fully inherit the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Mt 25:31-46</a>). In accordance with Jesus’ teaching, the members of his body, the church, are expected to work out the theocratic ideal in their lives, that by their works and faith they may glorify the Father and show that they are his (<a href="?bref=John.17.20-26">Jn 17:20-26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.25.33-40">Mt 25:33-40</a>). This is the biblical manner of witness that Israel failed to give and that the church is privileged to give; as Paul wrote to Timothy:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">I command you before God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, . . . that you obey his commands with all purity. Then no one can find fault with you from now until our Lord Jesus Christ returns. For at the right time Christ will be revealed from heaven by the blessed and only almighty God, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No one has ever seen him, nor ever will. To him be honor and power forever. Amen. (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.13-16">1 Tm 6:13-16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Then Paul gives several instructions as to how the people of God must demonstrate their allegiance to Jesus. Throughout the book of Revelation, Jesus is viewed as King over the church (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.2,9-11">Rv 4:2, 9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.1,9-13">5:1, 9-13</a>). At his return his kingship will be established. At this time, the enemies of the cross will see the one whom they have rejected and will bow before the messianic King (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.25-28">1 Cor 15:25-28</a>). “After that the end will come, when he [Jesus] will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having put down all enemies of every kind” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.24">24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Introduction">Introduction</p>
<p class="fl">According to the testimony of the first three Gospels, the proclamation of the kingdom of God was Jesus’ central message. Matthew summarizes the Galilean ministry with the words “Jesus traveled throughout Galilee teaching in the synagogues, preaching everywhere the Good News about the Kingdom” (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23">Mt 4:23</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The Sermon on the Mount is concerned with the righteousness that qualifies people to enter the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">5:20</a>). The collection of parables in <a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-58">Matthew 13</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.4.1-41">Mark 4</a> illustrate the “mystery” of the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.11">Mt 13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.11">Mk 4:11</a>). The establishment of the Lord’s Supper looks forward to the establishment of the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.29">Mt 26:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.25">Mk 14:25</a>).</p>
<p>The NT reports two different forms of the expression: “the kingdom of God” and “the kingdom of the heavens.” The latter is found only in Matthew, but Matthew also has “the kingdom of God” four times (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.28">Mt 12:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.19.24">19:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.31,43">21:31, 43</a>). “The kingdom of heaven” is a Semitic phrase that would have been meaningful to Jews but not to Greeks. The Jews, out of reverence for God, avoided uttering the divine name, and contemporary literature gives examples of substituting the word “heaven” for God (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.18,50">1 Macc 3:18, 50</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.10">4:10</a>; see <a href="?bref=Luke.15.18">Lk 15:18</a>).</p>
<p>The key to an understanding of the kingdom of God is that the basic meaning of the Greek word <span class="greek">basileia</span><span class="ital">,</span> as also of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">malkut</span><span class="ital">,</span> is rule, reign, dominion. We frequently find in the OT the expression “in the year of the kingdom of . . . ,” meaning in the year of the reign of a given king (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.31">1 Chr 26:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.2">2 Chr 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.10">15:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.1">Ezr 7:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.16">Est 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.7">Jer 10:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.31">52:31</a>). When we read that Solomon’s kingdom was firmly established (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.12">1 Kgs 2:12</a>), we are to understand that his authority to reign was settled. To “turn the kingdom of Saul over to [David]” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.23">1 Chr 12:23</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) indicates that the authority that had been Saul’s was given to David. As a result of having received legal authority, David became king. This abstract idea of <span class="hebrew">malkut</span> is evident when it is found in parallelisms with such ideas as power, might, glory, and dominion (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.34">Dn 4:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.14">7:14</a>).</p>
<p>When <span class="hebrew">malkut</span> is used of God, it almost always refers to his authority or to his rule as the heavenly King. “They will talk together about the glory of your kingdom; they will celebrate examples of your power. . . . For your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. You rule generation after generation” (<a href="?bref=Ps.145.11,13">Ps 145:11, 13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Further, if a king rules, there must be a realm or sphere over which he reigns. This is also called <span class="hebrew">malkut</span><span class="ital">.</span> “So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round about” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.30">2 Chr 20:30</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see <a href="?bref=Esth.3.6">Est 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.7">Jer 10:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.1">Dn 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.9">11:9</a>).</p>
<p>This same twofold use of <span class="greek">basileia</span> is found in the NT. In fact, <span class="greek">basileia</span> could be translated by the expression “kingly power” in <a href="?bref=Luke.23.42">Luke 23:42</a> (<span class="sc">niv</span> mg) and by “kingship” in <a href="?bref=John.18.36">John 18:36</a>. When a nobleman went into a far country to get a “kingdom” (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.12">Luke 19:12</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>) he went to the governing authority to get an appointment as king. When Jesus said, “My kingship is not of this world” (<a href="?bref=John.18.36">Jn 18:36</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), he did not mean to say that his rule has nothing to do with the world but rather that his kingship—his dominion—does not come from man but from God. Therefore, he rejects the use of worldly fighting to gain his ends.</p>
<p>This central meaning of <span class="greek">basileia</span> makes it easy to understand many sayings in the Gospels. In the Lord’s Prayer the petition “Thy kingdom come” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.10">Mt 6:10</a>) is a prayer for God to manifest his reign so that his will may be done on earth as it is in heaven. When we read that we are to “receive the kingdom of God like a child” (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.15">Mk 10:15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), we must open our hearts and lives to the rule of God.</p>
<p>Also in the NT are sayings about being <span class="ital">in</span> the kingdom or of <span class="ital">entering</span> the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.11">Mt 8:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.47">Mk 9:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-25">10:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.28">Lk 13:28</a>). There is no philological or theological objection to understanding “the kingdom of God” first as the divine reign or rule and second as the sphere of blessing in which that reign is experienced.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentBackground">Old Testament Background</p>
<p class="fl">The expression “the kingdom of God” is not found in the OT, but the idea appears throughout the prophets. God is frequently spoken of as the King, both of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.18">Ex 15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.23.21">Nm 23:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.33.5">Dt 33:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.15">Is 43:15</a>) and of all the earth (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.15">2 Kgs 19:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.29.10">Pss 29:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.47.2">47:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.93.1-2">93:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.10">96:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.1-9">97:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.99.1-4">99:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.145.11-13">145:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.5">Is 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.18">Jer 46:18</a>). Although God is not the earthly King of Israel, other references speak of a day when God shall become King and shall rule over his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.23">Is 24:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.22">33:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.7">52:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.21">Ob 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.3.15">Zep 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.9-11">Zec 14:9-11</a>).</p>
<p>This brief summary of God’s kingship provides the outline for the entire OT concept. While God is King over all the earth, he is in a special way King over his people, Israel. God’s rule is therefore something realized in Israel’s history. However, it is only partially and imperfectly realized. Israel again and again rebelled against the divine sovereignty. Furthermore, Israel was constantly plagued by wars with its pagan neighbors in which it was not always victorious. Again, there are evils in nature and the physical world that often bring suffering to God’s people. Therefore, the prophets look forward to a day when God’s rule will be fully experienced, not by Israel alone, but by all the world. The main emphasis of the prophets is on hope, the establishing of God’s perfect rule in the world.</p>
<p>The prophets describe the final establishment of God’s kingdom in terms of a theophany—a divine visitation (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.3-4">Mi 1:3-4</a>). Zechariah foresees a “Day of the Lord” when all nations will be gathered in battle against Jerusalem, when the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.3,5">Zec 14:3, 5</a>). Israel will be visited by the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.29.6">Is 29:6</a>) and delivered from its enemies (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.4">35:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.59.20">59:20</a>). God’s coming will also mean judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.21">2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.26.21">26:21</a>). This final coming of God will mean the salvation of the Gentiles as well as of Israel (<a href="?bref=Zech.2.10-11">Zec 2:10-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.66.18-24">Is 66:18-24</a>).</p>
<p>Behind this language is a distinct theology of “the God who comes.” It is a fact widely recognized in contemporary OT theology that the God of the OT is not a nature god, like the gods of other peoples, but a God of history—a God who visits his people in history to bless or to judge them. God visited Israel in Egypt to deliver them from bondage and to constitute them as his people. The rescue from Egypt was not merely an act of deliverance; it was an act through which God made himself known and through which Israel was to know and serve him. </p>
<p>Because God has visited his people again and again in their history, he must finally come to them in the future to judge wickedness and to establish his kingdom. Israel’s hope is thus rooted in history, or rather in the God who works in history. God will finally break into history in a glorious theophany to establish his rule in all the earth. The source of the kingdom is not history itself but God.</p>
<p>While the prophets visualize the kingdom as coming from God, the kingdom is always on earth. The divine irruption into the natural order is not designed to accomplish its destruction but to make way for a new, perfect order arising out of the old, imperfect one. The prophets do not present a single consistent picture of the new order. Sometimes the new order is described very much in this-worldly terms. “The terraced vineyards on the hills of Israel will drip with sweet wine” (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.13">Am 9:13</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). On the other hand, God will create new heavens and a new earth (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">Is 65:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.22">66:22</a>), where there will be untroubled joy, prosperity, peace, and righteousness. The final visitation of God will mean the redemption of the world, for a redeemed earth is the scene of the kingdom of God. The prophets look forward again and again to the deliverance of creation “from the bondage to decay.” The description is often couched in simple physical terms. The wilderness will become fruitful (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">32:15</a>); the desert will blossom (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.2">35:2</a>); sorrow and sighing will flee away (v <a href="?bref=Isa.35.10">10</a>). The burning sands will be cooled and the dry places become springs of water (v <a href="?bref=Isa.35.7">7</a>); peace will return to the animal world so that all injury and destruction are done away with (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.6">11:6</a>). All this results because the earth becomes full of the knowledge of God (v <a href="?bref=Isa.11.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>Such language is not mere poetry but reflects a profound theology of creation. Humans as creatures were made to dwell on the earth, and the earth shares in human destiny. The main point is that creation as such is good and not a hindrance to true spirituality, as was often true in Greek thought. Redemption always includes redemption of the earth, which then becomes the blessed environment God intended it to be. Salvation does not mean deliverance from creaturehood, for this is not an evil thing but an essential and permanent element of true, human existence. Salvation does not mean escape from bodily creaturely existence, as in some Greek thought. On the contrary, ultimate redemption will mean the redemption of the whole person. The emergence of the doctrine of bodily resurrection is a reflection of this theology of creaturehood. The corollary of this is that creation in its entirety must share in the blessing of redemption.</p>
<p>A distinctive element in prophetic eschatology is the tension between history and eschatology. That is, as the prophets looked into the future, they saw an immediate historical judgment as well as a more remote eschatological visitation. For Amos, the Day of the Lord is both the immediate judgment of Israel by the Assyrians and a final eschatological salvation. Joel sees an imminent historical visitation of drought and locusts, but beyond this he sees the eschatological Day of the Lord. Zephaniah sees an imminent Day of the Lord in some undesignated historical visitation (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.2-18">Zep 1:2-18</a>), but beyond it he sees the salvation of the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Zeph.3.9">3:9</a>). The same God who acts in history to bless and judge his people will act at the end of history in an eschatological act of judgment and salvation. The prophets do not sharply distinguish between these two days, for it is one and the same God who is concerned to judge and save his people.</p>
<p>The eschatological hope of the prophets is always an ethical hope. That is to say, the prophets are not interested in the future for its own sake but for the impact of the future on the present. The prophetic predictions were given that, in light of future judgment and salvation, Israel might be confronted in the present by the will of God. “Prepare to meet your God as he comes in judgment, you people of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Amos.4.12">Am 4:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>) might well be taken as the keynote of all the prophets.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="h3">The Synoptic Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus’ teachings about the kingdom of God embodied the same contrast between the present order and the future age as that of the prophets, and he expressed it in the idiom “this age and the age to come.” This fact is obscured in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, which translates the word for “age” by “world.” These are, however, two different concepts. A rich man asked Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.17">Mk 10:17</a>). The context makes it clear that he was asking about eschatological life—the life of the resurrection (<a href="?bref=Dan.12.2">Dn 12:2</a>). Jesus speaks of the difficulty of entering the kingdom of God. (The parallel passage in <a href="?bref=Matt.19.23-24">Matthew 19:23-24</a> has both “kingdom of God” and “kingdom of heaven,” proving that they are interchangeable terms.) In their reaction the disciples ask, “Then who can be saved?” Jesus’ answer contrasts the lot of his disciples “in this time” with the “age to come” (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.29-30">Mk 10:29-30</a>) when they would inherit eternal life. It is clear from this passage that in some sense the kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, salvation, and eternal life all belong to the age to come. So far as this saying is concerned, God’s people will not experience eternal life until they do so in the new age.</p>
<p>Matthew alone records the expression “the close of the age.” This age will be terminated by the coming of the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.3">Mt 24:3</a>) and by the judgment of humanity (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.39-42">13:39-42</a>). Then the righteous will be separated from the wicked (v <a href="?bref=Matt.13.49">49</a>). The same expression occurs in the promise of the risen Jesus assuring his disciples of his presence until the consummation of the age (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.20">28:20</a>). It follows that if this age is to come to its consummation, it must be followed by another age—the age to come.</p>
<p>The eschatological kingdom will be inaugurated by an apocalyptic event—the glorious coming of the Son of Man. This is made clear by two of the parables about the kingdom of God. In the parable of the tares, “the Son of man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers, and throw them into the furnace of fire” (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.41-42">Mt 13:41-42</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The parable of the sheep and goats reflects the same eschatology. When the Son of Man comes in his glory, he will sit on his glorious throne to judge the nations, separating the sheep from the goats. The righteous—the sheep—are to “inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world”; and entrance into the kingdom is synonymous with entrance into life (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">25:31-46</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The eschatological character of the kingdom of God is seen also in the other two parables of <a href="?bref=Matt.25.1-46">Matthew 25</a>. “The kingdom of heaven shall be compared to ten maidens who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.25.1">1</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). However, five of them were foolish and did not provide an adequate supply of oil for their lamps. Thus they were late for the wedding and were excluded from the wedding feast—a symbol of the eschatological kingdom—while those properly prepared entered the kingdom. In the same way the two faithful servants who had been “faithful over a little” were granted to “enter into the joy of your master” (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.25.21,23">21, 23</a>), while the unfaithful servant was excluded from the kingdom and cast into outer darkness.</p>
<p>Jesus almost never showed any interest in descriptions of the eschatological kingdom, but it is clear that its coming was constantly in his thoughts. The pure in heart will see God (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.8">Mt 5:8</a>). The harvest will take place and the grain will be gathered into the barn (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.30,39">13:30, 39</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.29">Mk 4:29</a>). Jesus frequently used the metaphor of a feast or table fellowship to describe life in the eschatological kingdom. He will drink wine again with his disciples in the kingdom of God. They will eat and drink at Jesus’ table in the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.30">Lk 22:30</a>). People will be gathered from all corners of the earth to sit at a table with the OT saints (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.11-12">Mt 8:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.29">Lk 13:29</a>). The consummation is likened to a wedding feast (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Mt 22:1-14</a>) and a banquet (<a href="?bref=Luke.14.16-24">Lk 14:16-24</a>). All of these metaphors picture the restoration of communion between God and people, a union that had been broken by sin.</p>
<p>In most of the sayings cited to illustrate the future character of the kingdom, “kingdom” refers to the eschatological order—the eschaton, the age to come. However, when Jesus taught his disciples to pray “Thy kingdom come” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.10">Mt 6:10</a>), he was not referring to the new eschatological order; he was referring to the kingdom as God’s kingly rule, his reign. It is a prayer that God will effectively establish his sovereign rule in the world.</p>
<p>In his teaching about the kingdom of God as the apocalyptic consummation, Jesus does not differ essentially from the OT prophets. The most distinctive element in Jesus’ teaching—indeed, the fact that characterizes his entire mission and message—is the fact that in some real sense of the word, the kingdom of God has come in history in an utterly unexpected way. This sets Jesus’ teaching apart from all contemporary Jewish thought.</p>
<p>This is seen first of all in his repeated teaching that his mission is a fulfillment of the OT messianic prophets. Mark summarizes Jesus’ message with the words “The Kingdom of God is near! Turn from your sins and believe this Good News!” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This saying can have one of two meanings. It may refer to the imminent coming of the apocalyptic kingdom. Matthew summarizes the message of John the Baptist with nearly the same words: “Turn from your sins and turn to God, because the Kingdom of Heaven is near” (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The Baptist expounds what he means by the approach of the kingdom of God: “He is ready to separate the chaff from the grain with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, storing the grain in his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.3.12">12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). John proclaimed an apocalyptic act; “unquenchable fire” can mean no strictly historical event but only an apocalyptic judgment. John expected Jesus to be the one in whom the cosmic event expected by the prophets would be carried out.</p>
<p>It is possible that this was also Jesus’ meaning. However, another interpretation is possible that is better supported by the actual course of his mission: “The time is fulfilled.” The messianic promises of the prophets were not only about to be fulfilled; they were actually in process of fulfillment in his mission. In Jesus, God was visiting his people. The hope of the prophets in some real sense was being realized.</p>
<p>The meaning of this can be seen in Luke’s introduction of Jesus’ ministry. Luke selects an event that occurred in Nazareth later in Jesus’ ministry (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-21">Lk 4:16-21</a>) and places it at the beginning of his Gospel in order to sound this note of fulfillment. Jesus read from Isaiah a promise that looked forward to the messianic salvation: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has appointed me to preach Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the downtrodden will be freed from their oppressors, and that the time of the Lord’s favor has come” (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-19">18-19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Then Jesus astonished his audience by the assertion “This Scripture has come true today before your very eyes!” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.4.21">21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Here was an amazing claim. John the Baptist had announced an apocalyptic visitation of God that would mean the fulfillment of the eschatological hope and the consummation of the messianic age. Jesus proclaimed that the messianic promise was actually being fulfilled in his person. This is no apocalyptic kingdom but a present salvation. In these words Jesus did not proclaim the imminence of the apocalyptic kingdom. Rather, he boldly announced that the kingdom of God had come. The presence of the kingdom was a happening, an event, the gracious action of God. This was no new theology or new idea or new promise; it was a new event in history.</p>
<p>The note of fulfillment is again sounded in Jesus’ answer to the question about fasting. “Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. They can’t fast while they are with the groom” (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.19">Mk 2:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The marriage feast had become a metaphor in Judaism for the messianic consummation. In these words Jesus announced the presence of the messianic time of salvation. It would be a contradiction in terms for the disciples to fast when they were enjoying the blessings of the messianic age. The time of fulfillment had come.</p>
<p>A saying found in different contexts in Matthew and Luke touches this central note of the fulfillment in history of the OT hope: “Blessed are the eyes which see what you see! For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it” (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.23-24">Lk 10:23-24</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.13.16-17">Mt 13:16-17</a>). Both Matthew and Luke associate this saying with the kingdom of God, and both agree that the hope of former generations has become an object of experience. Many prophets and kings looked forward to something, but they looked in vain, for it did not come to them. What they longed for has now come, and this can be nothing less than the promised messianic salvation.</p>
<p>Fulfillment in history is again asserted in Jesus’ answer to John’s question about the one who is to come (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-3">Mt 11:2-3</a>). “The deeds of the Christ” (Messiah) were not the deeds John had announced. Wicked rulers like Herod were not being judged in fire. Instead, Jesus was helping people, not bringing an apocalyptic kingdom. Jesus replied in words that echo the promise of the messianic salvation in <a href="?bref=Isa.35.5-6">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>: “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them” (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.4-5">Mt 11:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In these words Jesus claimed that the blessings of the messianic salvation are present. There was indeed reason for John’s perplexity, for the fulfillment was not taking place along expected lines. The apocalyptic consummation did not appear to be on the horizon. The point of Jesus’ answer was that fulfillment was taking place without the eschatological consummation. Therefore, Jesus pronounced a special blessing upon those who were not offended by the character of the messianic fulfillment (v <a href="?bref=Matt.11.6">6</a>). The fulfillment was indeed taking place, but not the apocalyptic consummation.</p>
<p>The most unambiguous statement of the presence of the kingdom is found in the words about the binding of Satan. One of Jesus’ most characteristic acts was the exorcism of demons—deliverance from satanic power. The Pharisees admitted his power but attributed it to Satan. Jesus replied, “If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? . . . But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.26,28">Mt 12:26, 28</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Here the verb has the clear meaning “to come, to arrive” (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.30">Rom 9:30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.14">2 Cor 10:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.16">Phil 3:16</a>). Here is a clear affirmation that the kingdom of God has come among men.</p>
<p>In explanation Jesus said, “Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house” (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.29">Mt 12:29</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The strong man is Satan; this “present evil age” (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.4">Gal 1:4</a>) is his “house”; his “goods” are demon-possessed men and women. Jesus has invaded the strong man’s house to snatch away from him men and women whom he has in his power, and this is the work of the kingdom of God. The kingly reign of God has come into history in the person of Jesus before the apocalyptic consummation when Satan will be destroyed, to render Satan a preliminary defeat. Jesus has already “bound” Satan (i.e., curbed his power). This has been accomplished by the presence of the kingdom of God in the mission of Jesus.</p>
<p>A similar saying is found in <a href="?bref=Luke.10.18">Luke 10:18</a>. Jesus had sent a band of his disciples on a preaching mission. Like Jesus, they were to proclaim the nearness of the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.9">Lk 10:9</a>). They, too, were to exorcize demons. When they returned to Jesus to report their success, Jesus said, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.10.18">18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This again is metaphorical language that asserts that in the mission of Jesus’ disciples, as well as in Jesus himself, Satan has fallen from his place of power. Both “binding” and “falling” are metaphors that describe the same truth: the victory of the kingdom of God over Satan.</p>
<p>Here is the element that sets Jesus apart from the OT and from all of contemporary Judaism. The prophets conceived of the kingdom being established by a heavenly supernatural being (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Dn 7</a>) or ruled by a powerful Davidic messianic king (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-21">Is 9</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-16">11</a>). The fulfillment of the messianic hope is everywhere in the prophets an eschatological hope. The same is true of the Jewish writers who despaired of history and cast all hope into the future.</p>
<p>In contrast to all that had gone before him, Jesus proclaimed the kingdom of God as an event taking place in his own person and mission. God had again assumed the initiative; God was acting. No first-century Jew had any idea of the kingdom of God coming into history in the person of an ordinary man—a teacher who was meek and lowly.</p>
<p>The presence of the kingdom is further seen in the fact that the rule of God, present in Jesus, is a gift to be received. This is also true of the kingdom in its eschatological consummation, where the kingdom is freely inherited by the righteous (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.34">Mt 25:34</a>). In answer to the young man’s question about inheriting eternal life (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.17">Mk 10:17</a>), Jesus spoke of entering the kingdom (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-24">23-24</a>) and receiving the gift of eternal life (v <a href="?bref=Mark.10.30">30</a>) as though they were synonymous. The kingdom is a gift that the Father is pleased to bestow upon the little flock of Jesus’ disciples (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.32">Lk 12:32</a>).</p>
<p>If God’s eschatological rule brings to his people the blessings of that kingdom, and if God’s kingdom is his rule invading history before the eschatological consummation, then we may expect God’s rule in the present to bring a preliminary blessing to his people. This fact is reflected in numerous sayings. The kingdom is something to be sought here and now (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">Mt 6:33</a>) and to be received as children receive a gift (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.15">Mk 10:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.16-17">Lk 18:16-17</a>). Although it is present in an unexpected form, the kingdom of God in Jesus’ person is like a hidden treasure or a pearl of great price whose possession outranks all other goods (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.44-46">Mt 13:44-46</a>). The gift of the kingdom is also seen in that the deaf hear, the blind see, lepers are cleansed, and the poor have good news preached to them (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">11:5</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">John’s Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">In the Gospel of John the concept of eternal life takes the place of the kingdom of God in Jesus’ teaching. The kingdom of God is mentioned twice (<a href="?bref=John.3.3,5">Jn 3:3, 5</a>), and it is placed in connection with eternal life. The kingdom of God is here the eschatological kingdom, and eternal life is the life of the kingdom. Thus, as the kingdom of God in the synoptic Gospels is both future and present, so eternal life is both the life of the age to come (<a href="?bref=John.12.25">12:25</a>) and also a present blessing (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">3:16</a>, etc.).</p>
<p class="h3">Acts</p>
<p class="fl">In Acts it seems the earliest disciples generally failed to understand Jesus’ message about the kingdom of God as a present spiritual blessing. They gathered together to await the coming of the eschatological kingdom to Israel (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.6">Acts 1:6</a>). Acts relates that the disciples continued to preach the kingdom of God, but usually it is an eschatological blessing (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.14.22">14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.8">19:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.25">20:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.23,31">28:23, 31</a>). However, the last two references make the kingdom of God synonymous with the gospel about Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>One important theme in Acts is linked to that of the kingdom of God. On the Day of Pentecost, Peter announces that God has seated Jesus at his right hand in fulfillment of <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">Psalm 110:1</a> (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.33-35">Acts 2:33-35</a>). In the Psalms this is a prophecy of the enthronement of the Davidic king in Jerusalem. Peter asserts that this prophecy is now fulfilled in the heavenly reign of Jesus. Therefore, he has been made both Lord and Christ (Messiah). These are interchangeable terms, “Lord” meaning absolute sovereign, “Christ” meaning the messianic king.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Writings</p>
<p class="fl">Paul carried further this theme of the heavenly rule of Christ, the anointed King. The kingdom is both an eschatological inheritance (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9">1 Cor 6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50">15:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.21">Gal 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.5">Eph 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.12">1 Thes 2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.5">2 Thes 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.1,18">2 Tm 4:1, 18</a>) and a present blessing into which believers now enter (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.17">Rom 14:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.13">Col 1:13</a>). The key to this is the interchangeable character of lordship and messianic kingship. Jesus is now exalted as Lord over all (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.11">Phil 2:11</a>), and even as his lordship is invisible, it will become manifest to all at his second coming. In the same way, he has been enthroned as messianic King by virtue of his resurrection and heavenly session, and he must reign as King until he has put all his enemies under his feet (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.25">1 Cor 15:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.22">Eph 1:22</a>). The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</p>
<p class="h3">Revelation</p>
<p class="fl">The central message of the Revelation to John is the consummation of God’s redemptive purpose, when the kingdom of this world becomes the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.15">Rv 11:15</a>). Revelation pictures the plight of a persecuted church in a hostile world, but it assures the church that Christ has already won a victory over the powers of evil (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">5:5</a>), by virtue of which he can finally destroy them (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.11-20.14">19:11–20:14</a>). Again, the last enemy to be destroyed is death (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.13-14">20:13-14</a>). Revelation closes with a highly symbolic picture of the kingdom of God (chs <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">21–22</a>) when God comes to dwell among his people, and “they shall see his face” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.4">22:4</a>). Thus the NT ends: divine order is restored to a disordered world. This is the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class="h1">KINGS, Books of First and Second</p>
<p class="fl">Books continuing the history of the covenant people as recorded in Joshua, Judges, and the books of Samuel. The record in Kings begins with the events at the end of David’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-2.46">1 Kgs 1–2</a>). It continues through the reign of Solomon (chs <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1-11.43">3–11</a>); the histories of the divided kingdoms (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-2Kgs.17.41">1 Kgs 12—2 Kgs 17</a>); and the history of the surviving kingdom in the south, through its fall in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> and the subsequent kindness shown Jehoiachin by Evil-merodach, king of Babylon, around 561 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-25.30">2 Kgs 18–25</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="AuthorshipandDate">Authorship and Date</p>
<p class="fl">Kings was originally regarded as one book in the Hebrew canon; the division into two books of approximately equal length appeared first in the Septuagint and finally entered the Hebrew Bible in the 15th century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>The book itself is anonymous, and information about its author can only be deduced by examining the concerns and perspectives of the work. The Babylonian Talmud (<span class="ital">Baba Bathra</span> 15a) attributes Kings to Jeremiah. Although this identification could have arisen from the tendency of later Jewish tradition to assign biblical books to prophetic authors, the theory of origin in prophetic circles fits the evidence quite well. Substantial portions are given to the lives of the prophets; 16 of 47 chapters are devoted to the lives of Elijah and Elisha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-2Kgs.10.36">1 Kgs 17—2 Kgs 10</a>), and there is considerable interest in other prophetic figures such as Ahijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-39">1 Kgs 11:29-39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.1-16">14:1-16</a>), an unnamed man of God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-10">13:1-10</a>), and Micaiah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.13-28">22:13-28</a>). Possible dependence on Isaiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-20.21">2 Kgs 18–20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">Is 36–39</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-25.30">2 Kgs 24–25</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">Jer 52</a>) also suggest prophetic origin. The author-compiler also shows intense concern with the efficacy of the prophetic word, frequently calling attention to the fulfillment of words spoken earlier by the prophets.</p>
<p>One might initially think that such a history would be unlikely for a prophet, but the evidence is to the contrary. The prophets were the guardians of the covenant relationship and are known to have produced accounts used as sources by other biblical historians. The following are among such sources: the acts of Samuel the seer, the acts of Nathan the prophet, the acts of Gad the seer (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>); the acts of Nathan the prophet, the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, the visions of Iddo the seer (<a href="?bref=2Chr.9.29">2 Chr 9:29</a>); the chronicles of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.15">12:15</a>); the annotations of the prophet Iddo (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.22">13:22</a>); and the acts of Uzziah by Isaiah the prophet (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.22">26:22</a>). Add to this the fact that Kings is positioned in the Hebrew canon in the Former Prophets (Joshua to 2 Kings), and a consistent picture of prophetic origin emerges.</p>
<p>The date of the final part of the book must be after the last events recorded. Evil-merodach’s kindness toward Jehoiachin (c. 561 <span class="era">BC</span>) is the terminus of the book and therefore fixes the earliest date. Since the work shows no knowledge of the restoration period, a date before 539 <span class="era">BC</span> is probable. The author’s selection of his data to answer the burning theological questions of the exilic community also suggests a date between 561 and 539 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Sources">Sources</p>
<p class="fl">The compiler of Kings specifically names three of the sources that he used in his work, and biblical scholars have suggested the presence of a number of other sources that may have been cited. Of course, the sources not mentioned specifically by the compiler are only the speculations of those who have studied his work and can have only varying degrees of probability. The sources both specified and alleged are as follows.</p>
<p class="h3">The Book of the Acts of Solomon</p>
<p class="fl">As <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.41">1 Kings 11:41</a> says, “The rest of the events in Solomon’s reign, including his wisdom, are recorded in <span class="ital">The Book of the Acts of Solomon”</span> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Presumably additional materials of a biographical nature were included, specifically accounts similar to the judgment between the two mothers (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.16-28">3:16-28</a>) or the visit of the queen of Sheba (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-10">10:1-10</a>). There has been debate as to whether these materials were official court records or nonofficial documents. Some scholars have attempted to isolate further materials within this section by identifying descriptions of the buildings as from temple archives (chs <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1-7.51">6–7</a>) and lists of administrators as from administrative documents (chs <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.1-5.18">4–5</a>), but this must remain speculative.</p>
<p class="h3">The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel</p>
<p class="fl">This source is mentioned 17 times in Kings, usually in the closing formulas at the end of the account of the reign of a northern king. Some idea of the nature of these chronicles can be derived from looking at the type of information to which the compiler refers his readers (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.19">1 Kgs 14:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.39">22:39</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.12">2 Kgs 13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.28">14:28</a>). These passages suggest that this source was the official annals covering the reigns of the kings.</p>
<p class="h3">The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah</p>
<p class="fl">This source is mentioned in 15 passages, and as with the kings of Israel, is found in the concluding formulas to the accounts of the reigns. This source was to be consulted for additional details on individuals’ reigns (for example, see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.23">1 Kgs 15:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.45">22:45</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kgs 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.17">21:17</a>). These sources for the histories of the two kingdoms were probably similar to the annals known from the surrounding cultures, particularly from the reigns of Assyrian kings. They were likely official court histories kept in Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In addition to these explicitly mentioned sources, scholars have suggested the compiler drew on other sources that he does not name.</p>
<p class="h3">Davidic Court History</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=2Sam.9.1-20.26">Second Samuel 9–20</a> is often identified as a unit of material in the composition of the books of Samuel; it is variously called “the court history” or “the succession narrative.” Because of similar vocabulary and outlook, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-2.46">1 Kings 1–2</a> are often associated with this material from Samuel. The statement of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.46">1 Kings 2:46</a>, “so the kingdom was now firmly in Solomon’s grip,” is taken to be the end of this record.</p>
<p class="h3">Sources for the House of Ahab</p>
<p class="fl">The reigns of individual kings are ordinarily given only brief notices; for example, the father of Ahab, Omri, is given eight verses, even though when judged by political and economic significance, he was among the greatest of the northern kings (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.21-28">1 Kgs 16:21-28</a>). However, beginning with the reign of Ahab, the record becomes quite expansive, and extensive coverage is given the dynasty of Ahab through the coup by Jehu (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1--2Kgs.12.21">1 Kgs 16—2 Kgs 12</a>). The use of the stereotyped formulas for the reigns is suspended in this material, and the existence of other literature used by the compiler is probable. This material is commonly subdivided into further sources for the lives of Elijah and Elisha and the reign of Ahab.</p>
<p>The Elijah section covers material in the following chapters: <a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-19.21">1 Kings 17–19</a>, including the feeding by the ravens, the incidents with the widow of Zarephath, the drought, the fire on Carmel, and the revelation of God at Sinai; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-29">1 Kings 21</a>, the affair of Naboth’s vineyard; and <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.1-18">2 Kings 1</a>, the death of Ahaziah’s messengers. The reign of Ahab, which gets so much attention in Kings, is primarily a backdrop for the accounts concerning Elijah.</p>
<p>The Elisha material found in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1-13.25">2 Kings 2–13</a> may have had an independent literary development from that of the Elijah accounts. It includes the following: chapter <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.1-25">2</a> (Elisha’s succession to the prophetic office, the purification of a spring, the death of mocking children); chapter <a href="2Kgs.3.1-27">3</a> (on the campaign against Moab); chapter <a href="2Kgs.4.1-44">4</a> (the widow’s oil, the Shunammite woman); chapter <a href="2Kgs.5.1-27">5</a> (Naaman’s leprosy); chapter <a href="2Kgs.6.1-33">6</a> (the Aramean attempt to capture Elisha); chapter <a href="2Kgs.7.1-20">7</a> (the famine in Samaria); chapter <a href="2Kgs.8.1-29">8</a> (the Shunammite’s property, the coup of Hazael); chapter <a href="2Kgs.9.1-37">9</a> (the anointing of Jehu); and chapter <a href="2Kgs.13.1-25">13</a> (the death of Elisha). No other portion of the OT takes the sheer delight in the miraculous that is seen in the Elisha narratives.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1-34">1 Kings 16</a> to <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.1-25">2 Kings 13</a> there are additional incidents not directly related to the biographies of Elijah and Elisha; accounts such as the military campaigns of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.1-34">1 Kings 20:1-34</a> and further details of Jehu’s coup (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.11-10.36">2 Kgs 9:11–10:36</a>) are often attributed to a third source containing accounts of the dynasty of Ahab and his successors. In all three of these possible sources the orientation is toward affairs in the northern kingdom.</p>
<p class="h3">Isaiah Source</p>
<p class="fl">The account of the reign of Hezekiah contains a section (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-20.19">2 Kgs 18:13–20:19</a>) that is nearly a verbatim citation of material also found in Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">Is 36:1–39:8</a>). The section records the invasion of Sennacherib, the mission of the Rabshakeh, Hezekiah’s prayer, Isaiah’s prophecy, Hezekiah’s illness, the regression of the sun, and the envoys from Merodach-baladan. The material must be regarded as based on the book of Isaiah or some other source used in both Isaiah and Kings.</p>
<p class="h3">A Prophetic Source</p>
<p class="fl">Because Kings shows great interest in the prophets and their ministries, various scholars have suggested that yet another source was used by the compiler; this would be an independent literary unit containing accounts of the prophets. This source would have contained the records for the material on Ahijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-39">1 Kgs 11:29-39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.1-16">14:1-16</a>), unnamed prophets (ch <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-33">12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.20.35-43">20:35-43</a>), Micaiah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.13-28">22:13-28</a>), and other references.</p>
<p>Apart from the sources explicitly mentioned and inferences about their character, the remainder of the sources suggested have only varying degrees of probability. Considerable scholarly effort has gone into identifying and characterizing such sources, but it remains speculative. When considering the sources the compiler may have used, one important caution must be kept in mind. Even if such sources did exist, one cannot have confidence in a reconstruction of the compositional history. Which sources had already been integrated into a larger composition before they were used by the compiler of Kings? We cannot be certain that the life situation out of which these other sources grew has been correctly identified, nor can we know that even the compiler himself was aware of the past history of his sources. Biblical scholarship has expended considerable energy in trying to delineate the past history of the book of Kings, but it has often been at the neglect of the unity of perspective that is the product of the final compiler(s) in whose hands the book received its canonical form.</p>
<p>What is important to understanding the book is not the perspective of its various sources (of which the compiler himself may have been unaware), but the perspective of the book as a whole on the history of the kingdoms. It is the outline that the compiler has imposed on the sources that establishes the teaching of the book; his sources are used in accord with his own purposes, a fact that makes the purposes for which the sources had been prepared largely irrelevant to the teaching of the book in its present form. Exploring possible sources, worthwhile in itself, must not eclipse the message of the book as a whole. This is not to imply that the books of Kings are simply a compilation of unaltered sources. The writer(s) undoubtedly exercised a measure of selectivity and literary skill in composing the historical narrative.</p>
<p>One compositional technique of the compiler is quite prominent in the histories of the divided kingdoms: this is the use of formulaic introductions and conclusions to the various reigns. The formulas for both kingdoms are quite similar, differing only in minor details. For the kings of Judah, the full introductory formula is as follows: (1) year of accession synchronized with the regnal year of the northern king; (2) age of the king at his accession; (3) length of his reign; (4) name of his mother; (5) judgment on the character of the reign. The account of a Judean king’s reign is concluded as follows: (1) a reference to the chronicles of the kings of Judah for further information; (2) a statement regarding the death of the king, including the place of burial; (3) successor: “And his son reigned in his stead” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The full formula for a Judean king can be seen, for example, in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.21-22,29-31">1 Kgs 14:21-22, 29-31</a>).</p>
<p>The formulas differ slightly for the kings of Israel; the introduction is as follows: (1) year of succession synchronized with the regnal year of the southern king; (2) length of his reign; (3) location of the royal residence; (4) condemnation for idolatry; (5) name of the king’s father. The account of an Israelite king’s reign ends as follows: (1) a reference to the chronicles of the kings of Israel for further information; (2) a statement regarding his death; (3) a statement of the succession of his son, unless a usurper follows. The full formula for an Israelite king can be seen, for example, in the reign of Baasha (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.33-34">1 Kgs 15:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.5-6">16:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>There is some variation in the use of these patterns, but on the whole, they are consistently followed and provide the basic framework for the history of the divided kingdom. The synchronisms of the reigns provide data for constructing the chronology of the period. The variations in the formulas may reflect the characteristics of the sources the compiler was using or may reflect his own interests. The name of the mother of a Judean king is recorded, but not of an Israelite king, perhaps reflecting concern with a more exact and fuller record of the Davidic succession. The royal residence is presumed to be Jerusalem for the southern kings (though it may be mentioned) but is recorded for the northern kings since it moved several times, from Shechem to Penuel to Tirzah to Samaria. The mention of the king’s father for a northern ruler also reflects the frequent change in dynasties there, as opposed to the dynastic stability of Judah, which is reinforced by mentioning the burial of almost all its kings in the city of David.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologyandPurpose">Theology and Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The books of Kings record the history of the covenant people from the end of the reign of David (961 <span class="era">BC</span>) through the fall of the southern kingdom (586 <span class="era">BC</span>). Yet it is not history written in accord with modern expectations for history textbooks. Rather than concentrating on economic, political, and military themes as they shaped the history of the period, the compiler of Kings is motivated by theological concerns.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the theology and purpose of the books of Kings is made easier by the fact that there is a parallel history for much of Kings found in the books of Chronicles. By comparing the two accounts, especially where the later Chronicler adds or deletes material found in Kings, the interests of both histories are thrown into clearer relief.</p>
<p>The books of Kings were composed during the exile, likely between 560 and 539 <span class="era">BC</span>. Jerusalem had been turned into rubble, and there was no longer a throne of David. Those two pillars of the popular theology—the inviolability of the temple and the throne of David (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.4">Jer 7:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.13-14">13:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.1-9">22:1-9</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.16,29">1 Kgs 8:16, 29</a>)—had tumbled. If Israel’s faith was to survive, the burning questions that had to be answered were “How did it all happen? Can’t God keep his promises to David and to Zion? Have the promises failed?” The writer of Kings aims to deal with the bewilderment of the chosen people in response to the disasters of 722 <span class="era">BC</span> (fall of Samaria) and 586 <span class="era">BC</span> (fall of Jerusalem). Kings, like the book of Job, is a theodicy, a justification of the ways of God to men.</p>
<p>In order to answer the question “How did it happen?” the compiler adopts the procedure of recounting the history of the covenant people in light of standards propounded in the Law. For this reason Kings could be called Pentateuchal history, or even more pointedly, Deuteronomic history, for standards propounded only in the book of Deuteronomy in the Pentateuch are used by the compiler to measure the kingdoms. Among the prominent themes selected from Deuteronomy and applied to the kingdoms are the centralization of worship, the institution of the monarchy, the efficacy of the prophetic word, and the outworking of the covenant curses on disobedience.</p>
<p class="h3">Centralization of Worship</p>
<p class="fl">The primary concern of the writer is the purity of the worship of the Lord. His major criterion for measuring this purity is the attitude of the kings toward centralization of worship in the Jerusalem temple as opposed to the worship of the Lord elsewhere and the continuation of Canaanite cults mingled with Yahwism at the high places. Centralization of worship at the central shrine is called for in <a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-32">Deuteronomy 12</a>. Perhaps “centralization of worship” is a misnomer, for worship was always centered around the tabernacle in the periods prior to the temple; the change that is envisaged in Deuteronomy is not the centralizing of worship but rather the fact that the shrine would no longer be mobile but stationary. For the kings of the northern kingdom, this criterion becomes virtually a stereotyped formula that “he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who sinned and made all Israel sin along with him” (see <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.16">1 Kgs 14:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.30">15:30</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.3">2 Kgs 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.31">10:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.2,11">13:2, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.24">14:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.9,18,24,28">15:9, 18, 24, 28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.22">17:22</a>). The compiler of Kings sees the rival altars with the golden calves at Dan and Bethel as the great sin of which the northern kings never repented (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.25-13.34">1 Kgs 12:25–13:34</a>). Rejecting the primacy of Jerusalem, these altars became the rod with which to measure the northern kings. All the kings of Israel are condemned by this standard (except for Shallum, who reigned but a month, and Hoshea, the last of the northern kings)—even Zimri, the murderer of Elah, who ruled only one week before committing suicide in the flames of his own palace (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.9-20">16:9-20</a>). For the kings of Judah, a different standard is used: what their attitude was to the high places where heterodox worship was allowed to flourish in the environs of Jerusalem. Only Hezekiah and Josiah receive the compiler’s unqualified endorsement for following the ways of David (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.3">2 Kgs 18:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.2">22:2</a>). Six others are commended for their zeal in suppressing idolatry, though they did not remove the high places (Asa, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.9-15">1 Kgs 15:9-15</a>; Jehoshaphat, <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.43">22:43</a>; Jehoash, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.2-3">2 Kgs 12:2-3</a>; Amaziah, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.3-4">14:3-4</a>; Azariah, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.3-4">15:3-4</a>; Jotham, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.34-35">15:34-35</a>). The remainder of the Judean kings are condemned for their participation in the high places and their desecration of the temple itself. This one theme is the preeminent motif in the book.</p>
<p class="h3">History of the Monarchy</p>
<p class="fl">A second prominent interest for the compiler was to trace the history of the monarchy. <a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a> provides for the day when Israel would ask for a king and charges that king with the basic religious responsibility for the people. This provision for a king, again a feature found only in Deuteronomy, becomes the basis for the compiler’s intense interest in the history of the monarchy, and particularly the religious fidelity of the kings. David becomes the model of the ideal king, the one by whom the others are measured, the one whose sons “continue long in his kingdom in the midst of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.20">17:20</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.11">1 Kgs 15:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.3">2 Kgs 18:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.2">22:2</a> for following in the ways of David, and <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.8">1 Kgs 14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.3">2 Kgs 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.2">16:2</a> for the reverse). The compiler wanted to show that God had been faithful to David even though David’s sons were not faithful. While both kingdoms had about the same number of kings, the northern kingdom is marked by repeated dynastic changes and regicide through its 200 years, while the dynasty of David is maintained as a lamp in the south through 350 years (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.13,32,36">1 Kgs 11:13, 32, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.4-5">15:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.19">2 Kgs 8:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.34">19:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.6">20:6</a>). It is the disaster that had befallen the house of David, and the consequent doubts about the promises of God, that prompted the compiler to write.</p>
<p class="h3">Efficacy of the Prophetic Word</p>
<p class="fl">Another reason why Kings can be called Deuteronomic history is its concern with the efficacy of the prophetic word. There are three passages in the Pentateuch that deal with the institution of the prophetic order: <a href="?bref=Num.12.1-8">Numbers 12:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-5">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a>; and <a href="?bref=Deut.18.14-22">Deuteronomy 18:14-22</a>. It is only in <a href="?bref=Deut.18.1-22">Deuteronomy 18</a> that the test of a true prophet is given: that what he has spoken comes about, that his words are fulfilled. Notice the number of instances where the writer calls attention to the fulfillment of the words of the prophets: <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.13">2 Samuel 7:13</a> in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.20">1 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-36">1 Kings 11:29-36</a> in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.15">12:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-3">1 Kings 13:1-3</a> in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.16-18">2 Kings 23:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.6-12">1 Kings 14:6-12</a> in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.17-18">14:17-18</a> and <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.29">15:29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1-4">1 Kings 16:1-4</a> in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.7,11-12">16:7, 11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.6.26">Joshua 6:26</a> in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kings 16:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.17">1 Kings 22:17</a> in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.35-38">22:35-38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.21-29">1 Kings 21:21-29</a> in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.7-10,30-37">2 Kings 9:7-10, 30-37</a> and <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.10-11,30">10:10-11, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.6">2 Kings 1:6</a> in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.17">1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.10-15">2 Kings 21:10-15</a> in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.2">24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.15-20">2 Kings 22:15-20</a> in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.30">23:30</a>. The writer is concerned to show that the words of the prophets were efficacious, powerful words. His concern with the prophetic order is also seen in the material devoted to Elijah and Elisha and to other prophetic figures.</p>
<p class="h3">Fulfillment of the Curses</p>
<p class="fl">Another aspect of the compiler’s interest in Deuteronomy is seen in his concern to trace the fulfillment of the covenant curses on disobedience. God’s covenant with Israel would issue in curses or blessings depending on the obedience of the people; the compiler of Kings sees the curses inflicted on the two kingdoms because of their failure to meet the demands of the covenant. He takes care to show that most of the curses of <a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a> had some historical realization in the life of the people. Moses had warned that disobedience would “bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as the eagle swoops down” (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.49">Dt 28:49</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>), and the Assyrians came to Samaria and the Babylonians to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.52">28:52</a>). The siege of Samaria lasted from 724 to 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, and the siege of Jerusalem from 588 to 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The dire conditions of the siege would drive the people to devouring their own children; women would feed on their afterbirths. It happened to Israel in the siege of Ben-hadad (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.24-30">2 Kgs 6:24-30</a>). Just as the Lord had delighted to prosper and multiply his people, so he would not refrain from destroying them and scattering them among the peoples of the earth (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.63-67">Dt 28:63-67</a>).</p>
<p>In these and other ways the writer of Kings set out to write the history of Israel and Judah to solve a theological dilemma. How was one to reconcile the exile with God’s promises to the nation and David? His answer is twofold: (1) the problem was not with God but with the people’s disobedience—God remains just; (2) the end of the state does not equal the end of the people or the house of David. Here the ending of the book is instructive: Evil-merodach releases Jehoiachin from prison, elevates him above the other kings, and provides his rations (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27-30">2 Kgs 25:27-30</a>). Even during the exile, though cut down to almost nothing, the house of David still enjoys the favor and blessing of God. God has not abandoned his promises; the people should keep hope.</p>
<p>Other themes in Kings also show the theological motivations underlying the compiler’s selection and arrangement of the data, particularly his use of Deuteronomy as a framework for examining the history of the people. Compare the laws governing the observance of Passover in <a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-20">Exodus 12:1-20</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.16.1-8">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>: whereas the Passover is centered in the family in Exodus, it is celebrated at the sanctuary in Deuteronomy. The writer of Kings is careful to show that the Passover during the reign of Josiah was celebrated in accordance with the requirements of Deuteronomy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.21-23">2 Kgs 23:21-23</a>). A passage in Deuteronomy is explicitly cited with reference to Amaziah’s keeping the law (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.16">Dt 24:16</a> in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.6">2 Kgs 14:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Contrast with Chronicles</p>
<p class="fl">The interests of Kings are further highlighted when compared with the parallel accounts in Chronicles. While the writer of Kings worked in the aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem and had to answer the “how?” and “why?” questions, the Chronicler is part of the restoration community. Here the burning theological questions were not “how?” and “why?” but rather “What continuity do we have with David? Is God still interested in us?” The need is not to account for the exile but rather to relate the postexilic and the preexilic. The building of the second temple and the ordering of worship there show up in increased detail in Chronicles in any matter pertaining to the former temple. Chronicles is a history of Judah and of the Davidic line, reflecting the fact that it alone survives after the exile. Interesting, too, are the things omitted from the account by the Chronicler. Since he is not building a case for an indictment, as was done in Samuel and Kings, he is free to omit references to David’s sin with Bathsheba (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-27">2 Sm 11</a>) or to Solomon’s difficulties in gaining the throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-2.46">1 Kgs 1–2</a>). Since in his day the northern kingdom had not survived, the Chronicler did not go into detail about the sins of Jeroboam (chs <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-14.31">13–14</a>). Chronicles is interested more in the affairs of the temple and does not show the marked interest in prophetic matters found in Kings, so that the lives of Elijah and Elisha are omitted (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1--2Kgs.10.36">1 Kgs 16—2 Kgs 10</a>). Nor does the Chronicler recite the sins that led to the demise of the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-18.12">2 Kgs 17:1–18:12</a>). In all these examples one can see the interplay of the historical moment and theological concerns of the people and the compilers. Each compiler has selected and arranged the data in accordance with the concerns and needs of the community in which he was a member; comparing the two accounts throws the interests of each into sharp relief.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="KeyPlacesin1Kings"/>
<p class="fl">The books of Kings fall into three parts: (1) the reign of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-11.43">1 Kgs 1–11</a>); (2) the history of the divided kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-2.46">1 Kgs 12–2</a> Kgs 17); (3) the history of the surviving kingdom in Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-25.30">2 Kgs 18–25</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Reign of Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-11.43">1 Kgs 1–11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The record begins with an account of the court intrigue surrounding Solomon’s accession to the throne, set against the backdrop of the abortive coup by Adonijah (ch <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.1-53">1</a>). The dying David charges Solomon to obey the commandments of God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>) and also to take vengeance on his enemies (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.5-9">5-9</a>). After David’s death Solomon orders the deaths of Adonijah, Joab, and Shimei, and the banishment of Abiathar, the priest who had supported Adonijah in his bid for the throne (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.13-46">13-46</a>). Enemies eliminated, the kingdom was firmly established by Solomon (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.46">46</a>).</p>
<p>The remainder of Solomon’s reign is divided into two parts: Solomon the good, who follows in the ways of his father, David (chs <a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.1-10.29">3–10</a>); and Solomon the bad, whose heart is led astray (ch <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-43">11</a>). While sacrificing at Gibeon, Solomon asks God to give him the gift of wisdom to rule—wisdom promptly demonstrated in the quarrel of two prostitutes about a child (ch <a href="1Kgs.3.1-28">3</a>). An account is given of the administrative organization of the kingdom and the incomparable wisdom of Solomon (ch <a href="1Kgs.4.1-34">4</a>). The compiler of Kings gives extensive coverage to the preparations (ch <a href="1Kgs.5.1-18">5</a>), building (chs <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1-7.51">6–7</a>), and dedication (ch <a href="1Kgs.8.1-66">8</a>) of the temple. God appeared to Solomon a second time, reminding him to keep his commandments as David had done (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.1-9">9:1-9</a>). Details are given of the king’s building and commercial activities (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.10-27">10-27</a>). The account of the visit by the queen of Sheba is followed with elaboration of Solomon’s splendor (ch <a href="1Kgs.10.1-29">10</a>). But Solomon did not keep God’s commands; seduced to pagan worship by his foreign wives, he was not fully devoted to the Lord as David had been (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.4">11:4</a>), and God determined to take away the northern tribes from the rule of his son (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.11-13">11-13</a>). As punishment from the hand of God, Solomon faced rebellion among conquered peoples (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.14-25">14-25</a>) and within Israel in the person of Jeroboam (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.26-40">26-40</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">History of the Divided Kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-2Kgs.17.41">1 Kgs 12—2 Kgs 17</a>)</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="KeyPlacesin2Kings"/>
<p class="fl">The united monarchy dissolved after the death of Solomon. The northern kingdom (Israel) would exist for about two centuries, would be ruled by 20 kings from nine different dynasties, and would show a history of internal weakness riddled with regicide and usurpation. In contrast, the southern kingdom would last for three and a half centuries and would be ruled by 19 kings of Davidic descent (apart from a short period under the dynastic interloper Athaliah).</p>
<p>There had been a long history of independent action and even warfare between the northern and southern tribes prior to David and Solomon, so it is no surprise that the division would take place along the lines that it did. The immediate cause, however, was the unwise severity with which Rehoboam replied to the representatives of the northern tribes while negotiating for the kingship. Jeroboam, the popular hero of the earlier insurrection against Solomon, became king in the north. He immediately erected the rival sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-33">1 Kgs 12</a>); these rival altars became the measure by which the kings of Israel were condemned for following in the sins of Jeroboam.</p>
<p>For two generations there would be warfare between Israel and Judah over the border areas in Benjamin claimed by both sides. Fifty years of sporadic fighting on their mutual frontier, interlaced with invasions from the Arameans in the north or the Egyptians in the south, would consume the reigns of Jeroboam, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, and Zimri in Israel and of Rehoboam, Abijam, and Asa in Judah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-16.20">1 Kgs 13:1–16:20</a>).</p>
<p>The accession of Omri in Israel introduced a ruling house that would last for a total of four generations and end the dynastic instability of the northern kingdom. Though Kings gives Omri a scant eight verses (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.21-28">1 Kgs 16:21-28</a>), he was among the greatest of the northern kings, forging alliances with the Phoenicians and Judah; for over a century, the Assyrians would call Israel “the house of Omri.”</p>
<p>The reigns of Omri’s successors, Ahab, Ahaziah, and Jehoram, are treated at disproportionate length, taking almost a third of the total book, 16 of 47 chapters (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1--2Kgs.10.36">1 Kgs 17—2 Kgs 10</a>). This is due to the fact that the compiler of Kings incorporated extensive coverage of the lives of Elijah and Elisha, weaving a contrast between good and evil by paralleling the dynasty of Omri with these prophets. Ahab and Jezebel were used as foils for the account of Elijah, so that Ahab became a paradigm of the evil king (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.3">2 Kgs 21:3</a>).</p>
<p>Because of this preoccupation with the dynasty of Omri and the lives of Elijah and Elisha, the equivalent period in Judah is not given as extensive coverage. During this period, the northern kingdom appears to have exercised some hegemony over Judah, as attested by the marriage of an Omride (Athaliah, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.18,26">2 Kgs 8:18, 26</a>) to Jehoram of Judah and the subservient role of Jehoshaphat to Ahab at the battle of Ramoth-gilead (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-53">1 Kgs 22</a>). Judah’s fortunes declined in this period when Edom revolted against Jehoram (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.20-22">2 Kgs 8:20-22</a>), costing Judah control over the port at Ezion-geber and consequent economic losses.</p>
<p>In 842 <span class="era">BC</span> Jehu, after being anointed king by a prophet (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-13">2 Kgs 9:1-13</a>), led a coup ending the house of Omri and also killing Ahaziah of Judah (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.14-29">14-29</a>). Jehu’s purge also brought the death of Jezebel, Ahab’s family, members of the family of Ahaziah, and the ministers of Baal (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.30-10.36">9:30–10:36</a>). The consequences were severe politically: the murder of the Phoenician princess Jezebel and the king of Judah cost Israel its allies to the north and south.</p>
<p>Jehu’s dynasty had the longest succession of any in Israel, including Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zechariah, a period spanning 90 years. Jehu’s murder of Ahaziah of Judah set the stage for the one threat to the continuity of the Davidic dynasty. Queen Athaliah, herself an Omride, seized the throne and attempted a purge of Davidic pretenders. She ruled for six years, until the faithful priest Jehoiada staged a countercoup to place the child Joash on the throne of David (ch <a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1-21">11</a>).</p>
<p>Israel endured a half century of weakness as a result of Jehu’s coup, during which the Arameans had a free hand, reducing the forces of Jehu’s son Jehoahaz to a small army and bodyguard (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.1-7">2 Kgs 13:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>The reemergence of Assyria early in the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span> gave relief to Israel and Judah. Assyrian armies conquered the Arameans; with that threat removed, Israel and Judah enjoyed a dramatic resurgence. Jehoash of Israel, grandson of Jehu, reconquered cities lost to the Arameans (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.25">2 Kgs 13:25</a>); Elisha died during his reign (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.20">20</a>). In the south Amaziah reconquered the Edomites (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.7">14:7</a>). Amaziah and Jehoash renewed the warfare between the kingdoms, with the north again victorious (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.8-14">8-14</a>).</p>
<p>Under Jeroboam II, Israel enjoyed a period of prosperity when the borders of the kingdom reached the same extent as they had under Solomon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23-28">2 Kgs 14:23-28</a>). Uzziah (Azariah), his contemporary in Judah, also fortified Jerusalem and undertook a program of offensive operations extending Judah’s sway to the south (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.21-22">14:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.1-7">15:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>Yet this resurgence was but a brilliant sunset in the history of the two kingdoms. After the death of Jeroboam II, the history is one of successive disasters, culminating in the fall of Israel and the subjugation of Judah to the might of Assyria. The next 30 years in Israel would see four dynasties, three represented by only one king, and repeated regicides as the northern kingdom hastened to its demise. A period of civil war and anarchy would see five kings in just over ten years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.1-38">2 Kgs 15</a>). Heavy tribute was paid to Tiglath-pileser III in both the north and south (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19-20">15:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7-10">16:7-10</a>). Israel and the Arameans forged a coalition to throw back the Assyrians and sought to press Ahaz of Judah into the fight; Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-pileser III for help. The coalition was destroyed, and Israel and Judah became vassals. Hoshea defected as soon as he felt safe, looking to Egypt for help, but it was suicide for the northern kingdom. Shalmaneser V retaliated, and the political history of the state of Israel came to an end (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-23">17:1-23</a>). The area was resettled with other displaced populations (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24-41">24-41</a>).</p>
<p>Israel had faced the Arameans and survived, only to fall to Assyria. And now, similarly, Judah would outlast Assyria, only to fall to Babylon.</p>
<p class="h3">History of the Surviving Kingdom of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-25.30">2 Kgs 18–25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ahaz’s appeal for Assyrian aid cost him his liberty, and Judah became a vassal of the Assyrian Empire. Illegitimate worship flourished under his rule (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.1-19">2 Kgs 16:1-19</a>). Ahaz was succeeded by the first of the outstanding reform kings of Judah: Hezekiah. Much of the account of his reign is given to his rebellion against Sennacherib of Assyria: the rebellion, the Assyrian envoys and threats, Isaiah’s assurances of deliverance, and the destruction of the Assyrian armies (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.9-19.37">18:9–19:37</a>). Hezekiah’s illness was averted after a sign and oracle from Isaiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.1-11">20:1-11</a>). As part of what appears to be negotiations toward an anti-Assyrian alliance, Hezekiah also entertained envoys from Babylon, a decision that the prophet announced would be costly (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12-21">12-21</a>).</p>
<p>Hezekiah was followed by Manasseh, who ruled longer than any other king of Judah (a total of 55 years). His reign was marked by great apostasy—apostasy so severe that the compiler of Kings regarded his reign as sufficient reason for the exile that was unavoidable (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1-18">2 Kgs 21:1-18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26">23:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.3-4">24:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.1-4">Jer 15:1-4</a>). Manasseh was followed by his son Amon, a carbon copy of his father, who ruled only two years before he was deposed by the people (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.19-26">2 Kings 21:19-26</a>).</p>
<p>The second great reform king of Judah, Josiah, followed. In his reign the Book of the Law was found while the temple was being refurbished; he led the people in a renewal of the covenant and suppressed illegitimate worship (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1-23.14">2 Kgs 22:1–23:14</a>). The Assyrian Empire was in rapid decline, so Josiah extended his borders to the north, destroying the altar at Bethel and the high places throughout Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.15-20">23:15-20</a>). A great Passover celebration was convened in Jerusalem, and further measures were taken to rectify worship (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.21-25">21-25</a>). Josiah tried to block Pharaoh Neco’s foray to assist Assyria, and he lost his life at Megiddo (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.26-30">26-30</a>).</p>
<p>Josiah was the only king of Judah to have three of his sons succeed him. At his death the people put Jehoahaz on the throne, but Neco removed him three months later and took him to Egypt in chains (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.31-33">2 Kgs 23:31-33</a>), replacing him with another son of Josiah, Eliakim, whose name was changed to Jehoiakim (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.34-37">34-37</a>). During his reign, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Judah, and Jehoiakim became his vassal. Late in his life Jehoiakim rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim died, leaving his son Jehoiachin to face retaliation from Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-10">24:1-10</a>). Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem; when the city fell, Jehoiachin, the queen mother, the army, and the leaders of the land were carried away captive. Nebuchadnezzar put Mattaniah (uncle of Jehoiachin and third son of Josiah) on the throne, changing his name to Zedekiah (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.11-17">11-17</a>). Nine years later Zedekiah, too, would rebel against Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city for two years and, when it fell, utterly destroyed it. Zedekiah’s sons were killed before his eyes, and then his own eyes were put out, and he was taken to Babylon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.18-25.21">24:18–25:21</a>). Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah to rule as governor from nearby Mizpah; he was assassinated, and the conspirators fled to Egypt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.22-26">25:22-26</a>).</p>
<p>The book concludes by showing that God had not forgotten his promise to David, mentioning that in captivity Jehoiachin enjoyed favor from the hand of Evil-merodach, successor of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27-30">2 Kgs 25:27-30</a>).</p>

  <title>King’s Highway*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">KING’S HIGHWAY*</p>
<p class="fl">The road running north-south across the Transjordanian plateau. It appears in the OT only twice in requests by the Israelites to use this road when passing through Edom (<a href="?bref=Num.20.17">Nm 20:17</a>) and the Amorite kingdom of Heshbon (<a href="?bref=Num.21.22">21:22</a>). The route may also be called simply “the highway” (<a href="?bref=Num.20.19">20:19</a>). The northern segment is called “the way of Bashan” (<a href="?bref=Num.21.33">Nm 21:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.1">Dt 3:1</a>).</p>
<p>This highway connected Damascus with the caravan route running through the Hijaz down to southern Arabia and the rich sources of spices, perfumes, and other exotic products (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2">1 Kgs 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.22">Ez 27:22</a>). Control over it was a key factor in the geopolitics of Israel and its rivals.</p>
<p>The local topography limits the possible lines of march to two parallel routes. A double watershed exists the full length of the Transjordanian plateau. One is created by the shorter streams that bisect the mountains from east to west; they leave a watershed about 13 to 16 miles (21 to 26 kilometers) east of the Jordan Valley. The larger streams, the Yarmuk, Jabbok, Arnon, and Zered, begin some 25 to 30 miles (40 to 48 kilometers) to the east, usually running north before curving westward. The route bypassing them on the east must follow the fringes of the north Arabian Desert. Though the latter has an easier course to follow, it passes fewer good water sources and settlements where supplies could be obtained. The former, on the western watershed, had ample water and was lined with major towns; however, the caravans had to negotiate the steep canyons of the four large wadis.</p>
<p>The earliest record of movement along this route is in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Genesis 14</a>. The four kings went from Ashtaroth, the capital of Bashan, to Ham in northern Gilead, then to Shaveh-kiriathaim on the Moabite plateau, and finally to Mt Seir as far as El-paran. The patriarchs probably always came this way when traveling to Canaan; Jacob came through Gilead (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.21">Gn 31:21</a>) and established a base at Succoth before crossing the Jordan to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.17">33:17</a>).</p>

It is also mentioned in an Egyptian list of towns conquered by Thutmose III in the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>.

<p class="fl">A relative of the same family. In ancient Israel the tribe was the largest social and political unit. The smallest social unit within the tribe was the family. The relationship of one family to another was carefully regulated by the list of those to whom one should not be married (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Lv 18</a>). Those who were related, even though somewhat distantly, received by law privileges and obligations for all members of the family. It was the right of the “kinsman” to receive the inheritance of a family without heir (<a href="?bref=Num.27.11">Nm 27:11</a>). He was also obligated to reclaim property of a kinsman who had gone into debt (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.25-28">Lv 25:25-28</a>), especially if it involved someone’s enslavement to a non-Israelite (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-49">47-49</a>).

<p class="fl">Village on the road from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem. Excavations by the French revealed a settlement 7,000 years old in which the residents changed from grazing to farming. Its modern name is Abu Ghosh, so named after a family of Arab sheiks who robbed pilgrims en route to Jerusalem until Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt terminated the practice early in the 19th century. The Crusaders mistakenly identified this village as Emmaus, where Jesus revealed himself to two people after his resurrection (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.13">Lk 24:13</a>). Because of this, they built a church there (in the 12th century). The massive walls of the church were built over the remains of a Roman fort where Titus had stationed his veterans of the Jewish Revolt. The large crypt under the church contains a spring, mentioned in memoirs of the First Crusade as the “Emmaus Spring.”</p>
<p>In the time of the judges this village was one of the four cities of the Gibeonites who, under false pretenses, made a mutual defense pact with Joshua and the elders of Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.3-27">Jos 9:3-27</a>). Because it was on the border between Judah and Benjamin, it was integrated into the tribe of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.9">15:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.14">18:14</a>). During the time of Samuel, after the Philistines captured the ark (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.11">1 Sm 4:11</a>) and found its possession to be dangerous, they were advised to return it to Israel. This they did; the ark arrived in Beth-shemesh, where 70 men who peered into it perished. Because of the danger its presence presented, it was sent on to Kiriath-jearim, where it remained in the house of Abinadab (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.1">1 Sm 7:1</a>) for 20 years. One of King David’s first official acts after arriving in Jerusalem was to bring the ark from Baalah (Kiriath-jearim) to Obed-edom’s house, then on to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-23">2 Sm 6</a>).</p>
<p>Uriah the prophet, who condemned the reign of King Jehoiakim and was later executed (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.20-23">Jer 26:20-23</a>), was a native of Kiriath-jearim. Among the returnees from the exile were citizens originally from Kiriath-jearim (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.25">Ezr 2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.29">Neh 7:29</a>).</p>

  <title>Kish</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">KISH</p>
<p class="list">1. Benjamite of Gibeah, father of King Saul and a man of some position in the community (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1">1 Sm 9:1</a>). His genealogy is traced for four generations, as is that of Elkanah, the father of Samuel, who would anoint Saul king (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1">1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is some obscurity in the genealogical information about Kish. His father’s name is listed as Abiel in <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.1">1 Samuel 9:1</a>. If the Kish mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Chr.8.30">1 Chronicles 8:30</a> is the same person, then we must conclude that Abiel was also known as Jeiel. But it may be that this second Kish was an uncle of Saul’s father. A further obscurity results from <a href="?bref=1Chr.8.33">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> and <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.39">9:39</a>, where Ner, not Abiel, is said to be the father of Kish. Yet in <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.51">1 Samuel 14:51</a> Abiel is said to be the father of two sons whose names were Ner and Kish. The solution probably lies in the assumption that Ner in the Chronicles references was an earlier ancestor, probably Abiel’s father or grandfather. If that should be the case, then the father-son relationship between Ner and Kish should be taken in an extended sense, as elsewhere in the OT. No other details of Kish’s life are available. His grave was in Zela of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.14">2 Sm 21:14</a>). The <span class="sc">kjv</span> of <a href="?bref=Acts.13.21">Acts 13:21</a> spells his name Cis.</p>
<p class="list">2. Levite, grandson of Merari, Mahli’s son and the father of Jerahmeel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.21-22">1 Chr 23:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.24.29">24:29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Abdi’s son, another Levite of the family of Merari. He was one of the Levites who assisted Hezekiah in the cleansing of the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12">2 Chr 29:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Benjamite and the great-grandfather of Mordecai. Mordecai was carried into exile by Nebuchadnezzar in 597 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.5">Est 2:5</a>), together with King Jehoiachin and the prophet Ezekiel.</p>

<p class="list">2. River draining the valley of Jezreel. It is a mere 25 miles (40 kilometers) in length but gathers into itself numerous small streams that originate in the hill country to the south and the north along its course. It rises in the north of the Samaritan highlands where the watershed directs some waters north and others west down the plain of Dothan. Numerous small wadis empty into the main watercourse as it moves northwest down the slopes of the north Samaritan hills into the plain of Esdraelon. These upper reaches are dry in summer but in winter (the rainy season) can become torrential. From Jenin to the narrow gap at Tell el-Qassis (the “mound of the priest”), the fall is about 250 feet (76.2 meters). The course of the river follows the Mt Carmel ridge, and numerous streams join the main stream from the Carmel ranges to the south and the hills of Galilee to the north. Because this region has a much better rainfall than the area of the upper reaches of the river, the Kishon becomes a perennial stream for the last part of its course. It flows for the last six miles (9.7 kilometers) of its length beside Mt Carmel and empties into the Mediterranean Sea about two miles (3.2 kilometers) north of Haifa. Just before it reaches the sea, it attains a width of 65 feet (19.8 meters).</p>
<p class="list-text">The heavy runoff from the hills, especially at the time of the spring rains, combined with the flat terrain of the plain of Esdraelon, produced swampy conditions along its course and provided a serious obstacle to transportation in early times. Its middle course has been largely drained in recent years.</p>
<p class="list-text">Two important biblical events took place in the region of the Kishon River. The defeat of Sisera by Barak and Deborah took place here. Canaanite chariots were caught in the swamps of the Kishon and were overcome by the Israelite attack (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">Jgs 4–5</a>). The river was praised in the Song of Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.21">5:21</a>), and the event was recalled in <a href="?bref=Ps.83.9">Psalm 83:9</a> (where it is called Kison in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Later, the prophets of Baal, humiliated by Elijah on Mt Carmel, were killed along the banks of the Kishon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.40">1 Kgs 18:40</a>). The river is mentioned by the Roman historian Pliny, by Arab writers, and by the Crusaders. In recent years the last part of the river has been deepened and widened so that a channel 984 feet (300 meters) long, 164 feet (50 meters) wide, and 13 feet (4 meters) deep provides an auxiliary harbor for Haifa, especially for fishing vessels.</p>

<p class="h1">KISS, KISS OF PEACE*</p>
<p class="fl">Common salutation symbolizing love and fellowship. In the Bible, kissing is referred to in a wide variety of contexts. In addition to its ordinary expression among relatives (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.11">Gn 29:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.33.4">33:4</a>), its sensual aspect is noted (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.6-13">Prv 7:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.1.2">Sg 1:2</a>). It is well attested as an act of homage (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.1">1 Sm 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.31.27">Jb 31:27</a>), although such expressions may be heinous in God’s sight (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.18">1 Kgs 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.2">Hos 13:2</a>). Hypocrisy, even betrayal, may accompany a kiss (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.48-49">Mt 26:48-49</a>).</p>
<p>Five NT texts refer to a “holy kiss,” called later in church liturgy a “kiss of peace” (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.16">Rom 16:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.20">1 Cor 16:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.12">2 Cor 13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.26">1 Thes 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.14">1 Pt 5:14</a>). Peter speaks of a “kiss of love” and mentions peace in conjunction with it. Although the practice is neither described nor limited by Scripture, the kiss was evidently exchanged between Christians as a pledge of brotherly friendship and fidelity (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.25-27">1 Thes 5:25-27</a>).</p>
<p>In the generations following the apostolic era, the kiss of peace came to occupy an established place in liturgical worship. In the latter part of the second century, Justin Martyr spoke of the exchange of kisses throughout the congregation following the conclusion of prayer. Eventually, the church placed the ceremony immediately prior to Holy Communion. Later on, the actual kiss was largely replaced by a simple bow. Other variant forms of the practice are still observed in various churches.</p>

  <title>Kneeling</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">KNEELING</p>
<p class="fl">Position often denoting worship, respect, or submission. A strong knee symbolically implied a man with strength of faith and purpose, and thus bowing the knee indicated submission to a superior. The knee was bowed before a king, a ruler, a governor, or God. <a href="?bref=Gen.41.43">Genesis 41:43</a> describes the people who were kneeling before Pharaoh and Joseph. Kneeling in reverence before the Lord was common (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.23">Is 45:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.14.11">Rom 14:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.10">Phil 2:10</a>). In a time of famine, when the Israelites turned away from the Lord, those who remained faithful were described as “all the knees that have not bowed to Baal” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.18">1 Kgs 19:18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see <a href="?bref=Rom.11.4">Rom 11:4</a>).</p>
<p>As firm knees represented strength, so smiting those knees represented the destruction of power (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.35">Dt 28:35</a>). Isaiah pleaded with the Lord for the strengthening of weak knees (<a href="?bref=Isa.35.3">Is 35:3</a>). References to weak or feeble knees were generally used to show a lack of firmness of faith (<a href="?bref=Job.4.4">Jb 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.12">Heb 12:12</a>) but could sometimes refer to failing health (<a href="?bref=Ps.109.24">Ps 109:24</a>). Ezekiel referred to those who had knees “as weak as water” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.7.17">Ez 7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.21.7">21:7</a>).</p>
<p>Kneeling before the Lord was a posture representing worship (<a href="?bref=Ps.95.6">Ps 95:6</a>) and also prayer (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.10">Dn 6:10</a>). Christ himself knelt to pray in the garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.41">Lk 22:41</a>), and Peter, Paul, and Stephen all did the same (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.60">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.40">9:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.36">20:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.5">21:5</a>). Solomon knelt in prayer and supplication before the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.54">1 Kgs 8:54</a>), and even on one occasion had a scaffold built so that he could climb up and be seen by the whole congregation of Israel kneeling before the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.13">2 Chr 6:13</a>).</p>
<p>Some knelt in penitence, as Ezra did at the evening sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.5">Ezr 9:5</a>) and as Peter did when begging the Lord’s forgiveness for his lack of faith and trust (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.8">Lk 5:8</a>). Those who were beseeching the prophet Elijah knelt before him as God’s representative (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.13">2 Kgs 1:13</a>), and many came kneeling and begging the Lord for healing (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.14">Mt 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.40">Mk 1:40</a>). Daniel knelt in wonder and awe before an angel (<a href="?bref=Dan.10.10">Dn 10:10</a>), and a sign of Belshazzar’s fear was that his “knees knocked together” (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.6">Dn 5:6</a>). In the NT a regal and patient Christ is subjected to the taunting and mockery of the soldiers who knelt before him and sarcastically cried, “Hail, King of the Jews” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.29">Mt 27:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.19">Mk 15:19</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p class="fl">Observation and recognition of objects within the range of one’s senses; acquaintance of a personal nature that includes a response of the knower.</p>
<p>The word “know” or “knowledge” occurs more than 1,600 times in the Bible. The specific connotation of the word group provides insight into the basic messages of both the OT and the NT.</p>
<p>The Hebrew view of man is one of differentiated totality—the heart, soul, and mind are so interrelated that they cannot be separated. “To know” thus involves the whole being and is not simply an action of the mind. The heart is sometimes identified as the organ of knowledge (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.49.3">Ps 49:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.10">Is 6:10</a>). The implication is that knowledge involves both will and emotions. It is in light of this connotation that the OT uses “to know” as an idiom for sexual intercourse between husband and wife.</p>
<p>The Jew’s concept of knowledge is beautifully illustrated in <a href="?bref=Isa.1.3">Isaiah 1:3</a>: “Even the animals—the donkey and the ox—know their owner and appreciate his care, but not my people Israel. No matter what I do for them, they still do not understand” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Israel’s failure lay not in ritual behavior but in refusal to respond in loving obedience to the God who has chosen her. Only the fool refuses to respond to this revelation. Thus the person who does not respond in obedience obviously has an incomplete knowledge of the Lord. “To know God” involves relationship, fellowship, concern, and experience.</p>
<p>The NT continues this basic idea of knowledge and adds some variations of its own. In the Gospel of John the knowledge of God is mediated through Jesus as the Logos. Jesus has perfect knowledge of God’s purpose and nature, and reveals it to his followers: “If you had known who I am, then you would have known who my Father is” (<a href="?bref=John.14.7">Jn 14:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The identification of Jesus’ own relationship with the Father as a model for the relationship of the disciples indicates that knowledge signifies a personal relationship that is intimate and mutual.</p>
<p>The definition of eternal life in <a href="?bref=John.17.3">John 17:3</a> adds further content to this concept: “And this is the way to have eternal life—to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, the one you sent to earth” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This concept is vastly different from that of Hellenistic mysticism, in which contemplation and ecstasy are consummated in the gradual merging of the knower and God. In John, by contrast, the result of knowledge is having a personal relationship with God through his Son.</p>
<p>Paul also places the revelation of God in Christ as the source of knowledge. God has made known the “mystery of his will” to the one who is “in Christ.” The spiritual person is taught by the Spirit of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.12-16">1 Cor 2:12-16</a>) and responds to the truth as it is revealed in Jesus Christ. Again, there is emphasis on relationship and encounter as essential elements in the concept of knowledge.</p>
<p>Christian knowledge of God is not based simply on observation or speculation but is the result of experience in Christ. This knowledge is contrasted sharply with natural wisdom, which operates from an incorrect perspective. Paul is quick to point out that the mystery of God’s redemptive plan has been made known and there is now no room for ignorance. Knowledge, then, is the whole person standing in relationship with God through Christ.</p>

<p class="h1">KOHATH, KOHATHITES</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Levi (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.11">Gn 46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.16">Ex 6:16</a>), father of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.18">Ex 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.19,27">Nm 3:19, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.2">1 Chr 6:2</a>), and progenitor of the Kohathite branch of Levitical families who were responsible for the tabernacle service (<a href="?bref=Num.3.31-32">Nm 3:31-32</a>). Moses, Aaron, and Miriam were descendants of Kohath (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.18-20">Ex 6:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.59">Nm 26:59</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3">1 Chr 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.13-17">23:13-17</a>).</p>
<p>The three main divisions of the tribe of Levi bore the names of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, who were traditionally the original sons of Levi (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.11">Gn 46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.16">Ex 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.17">Nm 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.1,16">1 Chr 6:1, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.6">23:6</a>). The Kohathites, therefore, were a prominent Levitical family. The order of their names in <a href="?bref=Num.4.1-49">Numbers 4</a>, <a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-45">Joshua 21</a>, <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.16">1 Chronicles 6:16</a>, and <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12">2 Chronicles 29:12</a> indicates that they were assigned a more honorable office than either Gershon or Merari. Their position and responsibilities—whether referred to as “the Kohathites,” or “the sons of Kohath”—are noted throughout the early writings of the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.18">Ex 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.19,27-30">Nm 3:19, 27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.2-4,15,18,34,37">4:2-4, 15, 18, 34, 37</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.21">10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.57">26:57</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.4-5,10,20,26">Jos 21:4-5, 10, 20, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.2,18,22,33,54,61,66,70">1 Chr 6:2, 18, 22, 33, 54, 61, 66, 70</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.5">15:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.12">23:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.19">2 Chr 20:19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12">29:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.12">34:12</a>).</p>
<p>During the wandering of the Israelites in the desert following their exodus from Egypt, the Kohathites were assigned a position on the southern side of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.3.29">Nm 3:29</a>). When the tabernacle was moved, they were to carry the ark and other sacred things on their shoulders (<a href="?bref=Num.7.9">7:9</a>). At the time of the building of the tabernacle, a census was taken to determine the number of male Kohathites who would be involved in the service of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Num.3.27-28">3:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.1-4,34-37">4:1-4, 34-37</a>).</p>
<p>After the settlement of the tribes in the land of Canaan, the service of the Kohathites appeared to have ended. God, however, specifically stated that they should be cared for in the same manner as the other Levitical families. The Kohathites were given numerous cities (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.4-5,20-26">Jos 21:4-5, 20-26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.66-70">1 Chr 6:66-70</a>).</p>
<p>When David became king, he organized the Levites into three divisions (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.6">1 Chr 23:6</a>). Heman, who represented the Kohathites, was charged with the musical service in the house of the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Chr.6.31">6:31</a>), and another group of Kohathites was made responsible for the “bread of the presence” each Sabbath (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.32">9:32</a>). When David brought the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem, Uriel, a Kohathite, was commissioned to supervise its transportation (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>).</p>
<p>During the period of the divided kingdom, the combined forces of the Moabites and Ammonites attacked Judah. King Jehoshaphat admitted his inability to repulse the aggressors and sought the aid of the Lord. The Kohathites led the people in a song of praise and probably led the army when, the next morning, the king and the fighting men of Judah went out against the invaders (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.19-22">2 Chr 20:19-22</a>).</p>
<p>Two important reform movements characterized the declining years of the kingdom of Judah. The first took place during the reign of Hezekiah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-37">2 Kgs 18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.1-30.27">2 Chr 29–30</a>); the second in the reign of Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1-23.37">2 Kgs 22–23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.1-33">2 Chr 34</a>). The climax of Josiah’s reform came in 621 <span class="era">BC</span> with the discovery of the Book of the Law. In both these movements the Kohathites played an important role. In the reign of Hezekiah they were numbered among those who cleansed the house of the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.12-16">2 Chr 29:12-16</a>), and in Josiah’s time two notable Kohathites were among those appointed to supervise the work of the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.12">34:12</a>).</p>
<p>Following the exile, mention is again made of the Kohathites. The paucity of evidence precludes any judgment of the significance of their ministry. In all probability they were numbered among those who attempted to serve the Lord faithfully in the midst of general spiritual decline. The few whose names are forever enshrined in Scripture were appointed to humble offices. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it may be assumed that they discharged their duties faithfully (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.19,31-32">1 Chr 9:19, 31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.42">Ezr 2:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.25">Neh 12:25</a>).</p>

Dathan and Abiram accused Moses of making himself a prince over the people and then failing to lead them into the Promised Land (vv <a href="?bref=Num.16.12-14">12-14</a>). The stories of the two rebellions are interwoven in such a way that it is difficult to separate them. It may be that the two revolts occurred simultaneously.</p>
<p class="list-text">Moses challenged Korah and his followers to a trial by ordeal. Together with Aaron, they were to take censers filled with fire and incense to the tent of meeting the next day; the Lord would then select from among them whoever should be the holy priest before the Lord (<a href="?bref=Num.16.4-10,15-17">Nm 16:4-10, 15-17</a>). Moses accused Korah and his company of rebelling against God rather than against Aaron (v <a href="?bref=Num.16.11">11</a>). When the men gathered as Moses had instructed, the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. The Lord ordered Moses to tell the congregation to separate themselves from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram (vv <a href="?bref=Num.16.19-24">19-24</a>). Moses proposed a test to show the source of his authority, but while he was still speaking, the earth opened and swallowed all the rebels, their families, and their possessions. Fire consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense. The rest of the Israelites were terrified and fled from the scene (vv <a href="?bref=Num.16.31-35">31-35</a>). <a href="?bref=Num.26.11">Numbers 26:11</a> adds, however, that “the sons of Korah did not die that day” with the others.</p>
<p class="list-text">Then, through Moses, the Lord instructed Eleazar, the son of Aaron, to take the censers of the men who had died and have them made into hammered plates to be used as a covering for the altar; thus, they would serve as a reminder to the Israelites that no one who was not a priest and a descendant of Aaron should ever draw near to burn incense before the Lord, lest that person meet the same fate as Korah and his company (<a href="?bref=Num.16.36-40">Nm 16:36-40</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Instead of being convinced that God had vindicated Moses and Aaron, the next day the congregation began complaining that they had killed the Lord’s people. For this act of rebellion God threatened to destroy the congregation and sent a plague among them. Moses interceded and averted complete catastrophe, but not before 14,700 Israelites had died (<a href="?bref=Num.16.41-50">Nm 16:41-50</a>).

<p class="fl">Name of Cilicia in OT times. From there Solomon imported horses (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.28">1 Kgs 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.1.16">2 Chr 1:16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). It included two geographical areas, the plain on the east (Cilicia Pedias) and the mountains on the west (Cilicia Tracheia). It was bounded on the south by the Mediterranean, on the west and northwest by the Taurus ranges, on the northeast by the anti-Taurus, and on the east by the Amanus.</p>
<p>The Akkadian rulers of the late third millennium, Sargon the Great and his grandson Naram-Sin, claimed to have reached the “cedar forest” and the “mountain of silver,” evidently the Amanus and Taurus, respectively. The name of the plain in the middle Bronze Age was Adaniya; during the late Bronze Age a kingdom called Kizzuwatna, composed of Luwian and Hurrian elements, came into being there but was subjugated by the Hittite Empire.</p>
<p>The Iron Age (first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>) saw the rise of the Neo-Hittite kingdom of Kue; it acted as a middleman, bringing horses down from the north (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.14">Ez 27:14</a>). In the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span> Kue joined a coalition of states to resist the aggression of Shalmaneser III (858 <span class="era">BC</span>), who finally conquered Kue in 839–833 <span class="era">BC</span>. When the Assyrians withdrew, Kue was third in importance after Aram-Damascus and Arpad (according to the stela of Zakir, king of Hamath). By the end of the eighth century, Urikki, king of Kue, paid tribute to Tiglath-pileser III (738 <span class="era">BC</span>), and somewhat later Kue was annexed by Assyria. With the death of Sargon (705 <span class="era">BC</span>), all the Assyrian provinces in Cilicia and Anatolia rebelled; Sennacherib did not reconquer them until 695 <span class="era">BC</span>. In spite of pressure from the neighboring Tabal and the tribes of the Khilakku (who later gave the name Cilicia to the plain), Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal managed to keep their hold on Kue. The Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar conducted campaigns there in 593 and 591 <span class="era">BC</span>. Later, Chaldean kings also controlled it and campaigned against neighboring Lydia. With the fall of Babylon to the Persians, the Khilakku took advantage of the situation to occupy the plain. This brought an end to Kue and the beginning of the classical Cilicia.</p>
