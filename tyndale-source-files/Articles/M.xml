  <title>Maccabean Period*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MACCABEAN PERIOD*</p>
<p class="fl">Period of Israel’s history when the Maccabeans fought for Israel’s freedom and governed the country. This period lasted from 167 <span class="era">BC</span> to approximately 40 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the priest Mattathias and his descendants, particularly his son Judas, surnamed Maccabeus, were active opponents of all attempts to introduce Hellenistic practices into Jewish life and religion.</p>
<p>From the conquest of Alexander the Great in 332 <span class="era">BC</span>, Judea became alternately a pawn and a battleground as the Egyptian descendants of Ptolemy, the Syrians, and later the Romans vied for political control. The Ptolemies, though directing activities from Egypt rather than from Athens, were themselves Greeks and, like the Syrian kings of the Seleucid dynasty, were descendants of Alexander’s generals. Thus the Ptolemies were also Hellenists. They believed in the superiority of everything Greek. They encouraged the extension of learning and built the library of Alexandria to develop a center of Greek culture in competition with Athens itself.</p>
<p>The aim of the pro-Greeks or Hellenists was to introduce Greek culture to the Near East, to establish Greek-style cities and colonies, and to encourage intermarriage between Greeks and Asians. In this way nationalism would be engulfed in the overall Greek plan, national heritage would be lost, and national or regional religions would give way to the legends and symbolism of the colorful Greek gods.</p>
<p>Judah represented a small nation in this vast picture. The chances for the survival of the religion, heritage, or political freedom of this group would have appeared to be minimal. In their favor, however, was the faith and assurance that God was with his people and that, if they followed his dictates, they would survive. They realized that as a people they might face suffering and exile, but they knew that, if they held firm in their faith, the nucleus of a nation would be preserved. They were also upheld in their attitude by the belief that the coming of the Messiah was imminent.</p>
<p>Before 200 <span class="era">BC</span>, neither Egypt nor Syria seemed able to gain long-term control over Judea, until an agreement was reached assigning the jurisdiction to Syria, and this was supported by Judea. In appreciation, Antiochus the Great of Syria canceled Judean taxes for three years and promised compensation for the cities destroyed in the preceding battles. Priests, scribes, and temple singers were exempted from certain taxes, and duties on imported timber were removed temporarily to facilitate reconstruction in Jerusalem. Money was made available for sacrifices, and many Jewish prisoners were freed.</p>
<p>By 175 <span class="era">BC</span>, the picture had changed considerably. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had gained the throne of Syria by assassinating both his brother and the rightful heir to the kingdom. Prior to this, Antiochus IV had lived in Athens and had also been held hostage in Rome for 14 years. He understood and respected the political power of Rome, and to prevent a takeover of the Near East, he decided to expand his own position by conquering Egypt and bringing the entire area under Syrian control. Impressed by Greek philosophy and traditions, he aimed to use a program of Hellenization as a tool to unite the diverse peoples under his control. A dangerous madman, he would stop at nothing to achieve his political ends.</p>
<p>The most influential position in Jerusalem at the time was that of the high priest. It seemed to be as much a political as a religious office. Traditionally the high priest had been a descendant of Aaron, and during this period of unrest, it was essential for the position to be held by a strong and inspiring leader, firm in his own faith, who could be an example and help to rally those who opposed the encroachments of Hellenism. Thus the right to select the high priest became vested in the one who held military control over the area. When Syrian power was strong, the king attempted to install his own nominee as high priest. When Syria was involved in internal political squabbles or external military engagements, or was being defeated by the followers of Judas Maccabeus, the Jewish people were permitted temporarily to choose their own high priest and simultaneously to enjoy a certain amount of political independence and relief from taxes.</p>
<p>It is understandable, therefore, just how upset the Jews were when Antiochus first attempted to install his own nominee, Menelaus, as high priest. Since he was not of the line of Aaron, he had no claim to the position, having actually obtained it by making Antiochus a high monetary offer that swelled the coffers of the financially impoverished king. While Antiochus was busy invading Egypt, the people of Jerusalem took advantage of the opportunity to oust Menelaus and reinstate the former high priest. In revenge, Antiochus ordered that the city be sacked. Many of the inhabitants were killed, the temple was desecrated, and its treasure was removed. After this, the city was left in the hands of a Syrian military commander (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.20-29">1 Macc 1:20-29</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.5.14-22">2 Macc 5:14-22</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.5.3).</p>
<p>Still eager to obtain control of Egypt, Antiochus invaded it again, but retreated rapidly when he received orders to do so from the Senate in Rome. Fearful of the power and extent of Roman authority, he determined to secure the loyalty of the Jewish state by pressing his program of Hellenization. He thus hoped to use Judea as a partial buffer between himself and Rome.</p>
<p>The observance of the Sabbath, religious festivals, sacrifices, and the circumcision of male children were forbidden by law, and copies of the Torah were destroyed. Altars to Greek gods were set up, and the Jews were ordered to eat the flesh of pigs, which was prohibited to them (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.18">2 Macc 6:18</a>; see <a href="?bref=Lev.11.7">Lv 11:7</a>). The temple in Jerusalem became a shrine dedicated to Zeus, and a pig was offered in sacrifice on the altar (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.41-64">1 Macc 1:41-64</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.1-11">2 Macc 6:1-11</a>; see <a href="?bref=Dan.11.31-32">Dn 11:31-32</a>).</p>
<p>In each Judean village an altar was set up and sacrifice offered under the watchful eye of a Syrian officer. In 166 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the time came for Mattathias, an aged priest with five sons, to offer a sacrifice of unclean flesh to a pagan god, he refused on behalf of himself and his sons. In anger Mattathias killed both an apostate Jew, who had offered sacrifice, and the Syrian officer supervising the enactment of the new law. Prior to this, resistance had been steady but isolated, and although there were those who accepted the edict, many refused and faced death for their faith (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.60">1 Macc 1:60</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.29-37">2:29-37</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.6.18-31">2 Macc 6:18-31</a>).</p>
<p>Mattathias called upon supporters of the Hebrew law to follow him (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.15-27">1 Macc 2:15-27</a>), and he and his sons fled to the hills. Mattathias was joined by an ardent religious group called the Hasidim, and together with other supporters, they waged a most successful guerrilla war from bases in the Judean hills.</p>
<p>Attacks were made on isolated villages, heathen altars were torn down, and uncircumcised Jewish boys were circumcised. With the death of Mattathias in 166 <span class="era">BC</span>, a more warlike phase of the struggle began under the direction of his son Judas Maccabeus, who became the symbol of Jewish resistance. He was a leader who waged a vigorous campaign in a righteous cause. He brought into focus the nationalistic sentiment of his people, and above all he was successful in the face of huge odds. His forays were more than a thorn in the flesh to Antiochus, for Judas’s tactics and victories earned the respect of his friends and fear of his enemies.</p>
<p>The success of Judas gave him virtual control of the country. He immediately set about the restoration of the temple. The altar that had been used for sacrifice to Zeus was destroyed, and faithful priests rededicated the temple so that daily worship could be resumed (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.36-59">1 Macc 4:36-59</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.1-8">2 Macc 10:1-8</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.7.6-7). The practice of the Jewish faith was restored in symbolism and in fact for all to see, with the institution of the Feast of Dedication or Lights (Hanukkah). With the spiritual house in order, Judas set about rebuilding the city walls so that Jerusalem would be able to withstand the next Syrian onslaught.</p>
<p>Then Judas and his brothers broadened their sights, hoping to secure freedom not only for Judea but for the whole of Palestine. Therefore, attacks were made against the Idumeans in Transjordan (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.1-8">1 Macc 5:1-8</a>) and against Philistia (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.9-68">9-68</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.8.1-6). Judas then set about achieving political freedom for Judea. He opposed the appointment of a high priest who, although of the line of Aaron, was a Hellenist (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.14">1 Macc 7:14</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.14.3-7">2 Macc 14:3-7</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.9.7). The Hasidim broke ranks with Judas and accepted the new high priest, but certain promises were not honored, and 60 of them were slain. The remainder realized their mistake and rededicated their allegiance to Judas (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.15-20">1 Macc 7:15-20</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.10.2). A Syrian army that was dispatched to secure the high priest’s position in Jerusalem was destroyed, and the Syrians, together with their priestly nominee, fled ignominiously.</p>
<p>Throughout the period, Rome was an overshadowing presence, and Judas hoped to use the might of Rome for his own political advantage in the perennial fight against Syria. A warning was sent to Demetrius stating that Judas was under the protection of Rome, but it arrived after a huge Syrian army had set out on a mission of revenge. Some of the Maccabean army deserted before the mighty hordes of Syria, and in the ensuing battle Judas was killed.</p>
<p>While the Maccabeans regrouped under Judas’s younger brother, Jonathan, the Syrians and the Hellenists were in control of Jerusalem, rebuilding the walls and strengthening other cities against a possible Maccabean attack. Over the next few years, the Syrians suffered a defeat, and their support of the Hellenists in Judea was weakened. No new high priest was appointed by the Syrians, to the satisfaction of Jonathan, who did not want to see his own authority curtailed. When the Maccabees gained the ascendancy once more, they punished the Hellenists (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.23-73">1 Macc 9:23-73</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.1.1-6), and for the following five years there was peace.</p>
<p>From 152 <span class="era">BC</span>, Syria was embroiled in internal struggles, both major factions vying for Jonathan’s support, while he in turn used the situation to strengthen his own position. Promises to Jonathan from these two factions ranged from the title of high priest to exemption from taxes and an increase in territory. Ultimately Jonathan was appointed high priest, being the first of the Maccabees to be offered this prestigious position. Judas would probably have liked the office as a crown to his military successes, but his family was not of the house of Aaron, and at that time the people would not have been prepared to accept him as high priest.</p>
<p>As the throne of Syria changed hands through death in battle and assassination, Jonathan sided first with one faction, then with the other. He also sent an embassy to Rome to reconfirm his support in that quarter. Jonathan was then held hostage and murdered by the Syrians and was succeeded by Mattathias’s sole surviving son, Simon, in 143 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Simon extracted a treaty from the young Syrian king Demetrius II whereby Judea became virtually independent and considerably larger in territory. Simon was even given the right to mint coinage (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.6">1 Macc 15:6</a>), a sure sign of independence, but as soon as Antiochus came to power in 139 <span class="era">BC</span>, the right was withdrawn. In the period of peace that followed Simon’s treaty with Demetrius, many expected that the coming of the Messiah was near. They thought that perhaps he would be a descendant of Simon, despite the fact that the standards and tactics of some of the Maccabean leaders had been most questionable. Simon retained the title and office of high priest, and it became a hereditary position for his family.</p>
<p>There was by no means universal support for Simon as high priest, however, even among the anti-Hellenists and the Hasidim, who had previously supported the Maccabeans. Some Jews also maintained that the priesthood should remain in the hands of the Aaronic line. The peace and relative prosperity continued until Simon was murdered by his son-in-law about 135 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Simon, the first of the Hasmonean line, was succeeded by his son John Hyrcanus. He was a strong ruler, despite the troubled period that opened his reign. Antiochus VII, who had gained the throne of Syria a few years previously, attacked Jerusalem, and although the city held out for a year, it finally succumbed. Judea once again became tributary to Syria, not regaining its freedom until the death of Antiochus, about 128 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>At this time John Hyrcanus gained the enmity of the Hasidim (from then on known as Pharisees), whose disciple he had once been. It would seem likely that a claim to kingship had angered the Pharisees, who considered that this right rested with the Davidic line, whether or not there was a claimant ready to accept the throne.</p>
<p>In his role as high priest, John Hyrcanus would have had close dealings with the Sadducees, a party as political as it was religious. It gained its support chiefly from the upper levels of society, whose descendants were the rulers of the Sanhedrin in NT times. The Pharisees, who observed the Torah in minute detail, must have constrained any ruler who tried to govern within their limitations.</p>
<p>During the earlier Judean struggles, the Hasidim had sometimes sided with the Maccabeans but at other times had been content to remain quietly under the Syrian yoke so long as their freedom of worship was guaranteed. Under John Hyrcanus, however, they began to enjoy the privilege of influencing the national policy, and thriving on that taste of power they were reluctant to relinquish it. Their dismay at seeing political control pass into the hands of the Sadducees can be imagined.</p>
<p>As dissension and dissatisfaction spread among the Pharisees, a leader emerged in Judea whom we know from the Qumran literature as the “Teacher of Righteousness.” As well as advocating strict adherence to the law, he taught that the present generation was the last generation and that final preparations for the imminent coming of the Messiah should be made. During the subsequent reign of Alexander Janneus, those who adhered strictly to the law were persecuted actively, and the “Teacher of Righteousness,” along with his immediate followers, left to set up their own establishment at Qumran in the Judean wilderness. They felt that since wickedness in the person of Alexander Janneus was prevailing, then God must have abandoned Israel and that he would, instead, be pleased to dwell with the surviving righteous remnant in Qumran.</p>
<p>The group dissociated themselves completely from the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem by not finding it necessary to offer sacrifices in the temple and by resorting to the ancient calendar that had been preserved in Samaria, so that the great festivals were even celebrated on different dates. The success of the group also helped to undermine the authority of the temple and of the remainder of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>After the death of John Hyrcanus, the throne passed to a younger son, Aristobulus, who reigned for one year only, and then to the eldest son, Alexander Janneus, in 103 <span class="era">BC</span>. At this time Jewish hopes ran high. The Syrians were too involved in their own political turmoil to be a threat and the new king set out on a path of successful conquest. In the midst of fighting, torture, and death, he was in his element, and from what we know of his character, it would seem that there was ample reason why the throne had passed first to his younger brother.</p>
<p>He was extremely successful, however, in extending the boundaries of the Jewish nation from the Mediterranean coast to the frontiers of Egypt. His success was dearly won, as he frequently lost almost as many troops as his enemy. Most of his army consisted of mercenaries, whose pay came from a heavy tax burden for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>For six years he was engaged in a bitter civil war and remained feared and unpopular. He seemed to have little genuine interest in religion, and it was unacceptable to many that a man with such a lust for blood should hold the office of high priest. He had also married his brother’s widow, Alexandra (Salome), which although permitted under the laws of levirate marriage (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5-10">Dt 25:5-10</a>), was strictly forbidden to the high priest (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.13-14">Lv 21:13-14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.22">Ez 44:22</a>). The bitter feelings of the people toward Alexander Janneus were seen in the year 90 <span class="era">BC</span>, when festival pilgrims pelted him with lemons as he was attempting to perform his priestly function at the Feast of Tabernacles. He reacted predictably by turning his guards on the crowd and killing 6,000 people (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.13.5).</p>
<p>Since the king was supported by the Sadducees, the loyalty of the people veered toward the Pharisees. As opposition to Alexander Janneus built up, Syrian help was requested from Demetrius III. Fifty thousand Jews were estimated to have been killed in the subsequent fighting. Alexander Janneus suffered a severe defeat at Shechem, but Demetrius withdrew, leaving the shattered Pharisaic party to face the terrible wrath of their king. Many were executed, and approximately 8,000 went into exile (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 14.14.2).</p>
<p>The Pharisees considered that Alexander Janneus had secularized the Jewish kingdom. His own Hellenistic upbringing in Galilee did not endear him to them. They were concerned, too, not only with his conquests but also with his attempts to impose the Jewish religion on other groups by force. On his deathbed Alexander Janneus handed the throne over to his wife, Alexandra Salome, instructing her to make peace with the Pharisees by giving them a share of power. She may have been the daughter of a prominent Pharisee, and she certainly heeded the advice, relinquishing almost complete power to the Pharisaic party (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 13.16.2).</p>
<p>Revenge was sweet for the Pharisees, and many of the old traditions of the Sadducees were set aside. The situation was complicated further by the fact that the queen’s elder son, Hyrcanus, supported the Pharisees, while the younger, Aristobulus, followed the Sadducees. Though high priest and heir apparent, Hyrcanus, the elder son, was quiet and lacking in ambition. Contrary to this, Aristobulus grew in the image of his father and was appointed commander of the army.</p>
<p>The Sadducees, claiming threats to national security, obtained permission from the queen to occupy several strongholds in the country. During Alexandra’s nine-year reign, the law had been upheld and well administered by the Pharisees. But with the death of the queen in 67 <span class="era">BC</span>, the stage was set for turmoil between her two sons.</p>
<p>As Aristobulus gathered an army and attacked his brother, many of the troops deserted Hyrcanus and he relinquished both crown and priesthood to Aristobulus. Instead of being able to retire quietly to his country estate as he had hoped, Hyrcanus was still looked on by the Pharisees as their leader.</p>
<p>An Idumean named Antipater, father of the future king Herod the Great, then schemed to restore Hyrcanus to his unwanted throne. Quite clearly, Antipater hoped to be the power behind the figurehead Hyrcanus. Antipater and Hyrcanus, with outside support, defeated Aristobulus and besieged him in Jerusalem. Many devout Jews, eager to abandon the squabbling and bitterness, left for a new life in Egypt. The siege of Jerusalem aroused the interest of the nearby Roman army, and both sides appealed for assistance, offering large bribes. The Roman commander decided to support Aristobulus, but two years later, in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, Pompey intervened personally.</p>
<p>Aristobulus, having aroused the suspicion of the Romans, attempted to defy the might of the approaching army. Followers of Hyrcanus opened the gates of the city to the Romans, and the temple was stormed on the Sabbath after three months of resistance by the supporters of Aristobulus. Pompey marched sword in hand into the Holy of Holies but did not remove the temple treasure. Although Aristobulus was spared, many of his principal supporters were executed. Judea lost any semblance of authority over many of the surrounding areas, and it became a tributary to Rome.</p>
<p>The amount paid to Rome in taxes, although substantial, must have seemed small compared with the taxes that had been necessary to underwrite the incessant fighting of the previous century. Judea then entered upon a period of relative calm. To the Romans, the area was unimportant in the sense that major trade routes now focused on Rome. The routes to the East were no longer either useful or accessible because of the political barriers to the east, and the north-south trade route to Egypt was declining in importance.</p>
<p>In 57 <span class="era">BC</span> Aristobulus raised a minor revolt, the only result of which seems to have been the whittling away of what little authority remained to Hyrcanus. Aristobulus and his supporters continued their unsuccessful attempts for several years, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Antipater, meanwhile, continued firm in his support of Hyrcanus and of Rome. During the civil war that began in 49 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antipater changed sides from Pompey to Caesar, acting in the name of Hyrcanus, and when Caesar was successful, the Jews were rewarded with a remission of Roman taxes.</p>
<p>They were confirmed in their religious freedom, and in Jewish matters they were allowed to be tried in their own courts. They were also exempt from Roman military service. Their territory was increased, and they were permitted to raise their own taxes. Antipater was personally rewarded by the Romans, and as his authority increased, so did the hatred and distrust of him by the Sadducees. Antipater appointed his son Herod as governor of Galilee.</p>
<p>Herod immediately undertook to rid the area bordering on Syria of a group of “brigands” or “Judean patriots” who were under the leadership of Hezekiah. They had considerable local support, but many of the group were subsequently captured, including their leader, and they were executed. Since under Jewish law no man could be executed without the sentence being sanctioned by the Sanhedrin, Herod himself was called to account by the Jewish elders of the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p>During the years of turmoil that followed, Antigonus was responsible for the death of Hyrcanus. Herod went to Rome and was confirmed as king of the Jews by the Senate, while Antigonus, the last of the Hasmoneans, was executed in Antioch. Thus the stage was set for the coming of a new and strong religious leader for the Jewish people, the long-awaited Messiah.</p>

<p class="h1">MACCABEES, 1 and 2</p>
<p class="fl">Two deuterocanonical books that cover the period of Israel’s history from 167 <span class="era">BC</span> to 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. The books are named after Judas Maccabeus, who initiated the Jewish revolt in 166 <span class="era">BC</span> against Rome. The chief value of these books is that they provide historical accounts of Israel’s struggles during the time between Malachi (the last book of the Jewish canon) and the time of Christ (6/5 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 30).</p>
<p class="h2">1 Maccabees</p>
<p class="fl">This work was written, much as Chronicles was, to record a “spiritual” history of the nation, except that it deals exclusively with the Maccabean period up to 100 <span class="era">BC</span>. The author, who is unknown, drew upon some genuine literary sources, although the authenticity of parts of the work has been questioned.</p>
<p class="h2">2 Maccabees</p>
<p class="fl">This book (written c. 100 <span class="era">BC</span>) is even more theologically oriented than 1 Maccabees. Whereas 1 Maccabees endeavors to present a reasonably objective account of the Hasmoneans, 2 Maccabees comprises a rhetorical summary of a considerably larger work on the subject of the Maccabean era. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=MaccabeanPeriod_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Maccabean Period</a>.</p>

  <title>Maccabeus, Judas</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MACCABEUS, Judas</p>
<p class="fl">Third son of Mattathias; leader of the Jewish insurrection against Rome in 166 <span class="era">BC</span>. His surname, Maccabeus (perhaps from an Aramaic word meaning “the Hammerer”), was later applied to all of the Hasmonean family.</p>
<p>Judas Maccabeus was one of the great generals in Jewish history. With but a few thousand followers, he faced the superior Syrian armies sent by Lysias under generals Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias with direct orders from Antiochus IV Epiphanes to “wipe out and destroy the strength of Israel and the remnant of Jerusalem; . . . to banish the memory of them from the place, settle aliens in all their territory, and distribute their land” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.35-36">1 Macc 3:35-36</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). When confronted with over 40,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry, the Jewish insurrectionists said, “It is better for us to die in battle than to see the misfortunes of our nation and of the sanctuary. But as his will in heaven may be, so he will do” (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.59-60">59-60</a>). <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.1-25">First Maccabees 4:1-25</a> records their resounding victory over Gorgias, “Israel had a great deliverance that day” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.25">25</a>).</p>
<p>Judas won the peace from Lysias (165 <span class="era">BC</span>), and in 164 <span class="era">BC</span> his army occupied Jerusalem, where the temple was purified from the defilement of the worship of Zeus and the daily Jewish sacrifice was restored. This event is commemorated by the Jewish festival Hanukkah, or the Feast of Dedication (<a href="?bref=John.10.22">Jn 10:22</a>). Judas continued the fight by opposing enemies in and around Judea, thus consolidating his authority, and extended the reach of his power north to Galilee and east to Gilead. In 163 <span class="era">BC</span> Syria recognized the religious liberty of the Jews. As 1 Maccabees quotes Lysias: “Let us come to terms with these men, . . . and agree to let them live by their laws as they did before; for it was on account of their laws which we abolished that they became angry and did all these things” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.6.58-59">1 Macc 6:58-59</a>).</p>
<p>The rebellion against religious oppression that began with Judas’s father, Mattathias, had become a war for political independence. To this end, Judas initiated a pact of friendship with Rome (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.8.1-32">1 Macc 8:1ff</a>). But the ascension of Demetrius I to the Syrian throne had an effect on Judea. A traitorous Jew named Alcimus, who had designs on the position of high priest, brought accusations against Judas to the new king. Therefore, Demetrius sent Bacchides and Alcimus with an army to punish Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.1-53">7:1ff</a>). They tried to overcome him by deceit but only succeeded in slaughtering 60 innocent Hasidim.</p>
<p>So Nicanor, “who hated and detested Israel” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.26">1 Macc 7:26</a>), was sent with yet another Syrian army. He also met with defeat at the hands of Judas (161 <span class="era">BC</span>), and “the land of Judah had rest for a few days” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.50">1 Macc 7:50</a>). Finally Bacchides and Alcimus returned and again joined in battle with Judas. The Jews were outnumbered 20 to 1 because of the desertion of the majority of their forces, and Judas was killed in the ensuing battle at Alasa (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.1-41">9:1ff</a>). Israel mourned, “How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!” (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.21">21</a>), and the Maccabean leadership fell to Jonathan and his brother Simon.</p>

<p class="h1">MACEDONIA</p>
<p class="fl">Roman province in NT times, beginning as a kingdom in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. Little is known about the first several centuries of its history, but with the coming to power of the Greek king Philip II (359–336 <span class="era">BC</span>), and especially of his son Alexander III (the Great, 336–323 <span class="era">BC</span>), Macedonia became a world power. After Alexander’s death, the empire was divided among his successors into several regions, one of them the original Macedonian kingdom. Instability held sway for the next 150 years, and in 167 <span class="era">BC</span> Macedonia came under Roman rule. Initially divided into four districts by the Romans (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.12">Acts 16:12</a> is a possible reference to this division), this territory was made into a Roman province in 14 <span class="era">BC</span> with Thessalonica as its capital. Briefly, from <span class="era">AD</span> 15–44, Macedonia was combined with Achaia and Moesia (other parts of Greece) into one large province; however, in <span class="era">AD</span> 44, the three were again separated. Macedonia’s importance continued through the Roman era, and it remained a separate entity down to modern times, though it was part of Yugoslavia from 1945 to 1991.</p>
<p>The Roman province of Macedonia included the northern region of Greece and southern sections of present-day Albania, Bulgaria, and the Fomer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Noted for its gold, silver, timber, and farmlands, the region also served as a land route for trade between Asia and the West. Shortly after the Romans incorporated Macedonia as a province, they built the Via Egnatia, a paved road over 500 miles (804.5 kilometers) long, running from the Adriatic coast to the Aegean, no doubt traveled by the apostle Paul as he moved through the Macedonian cities of Neapolis, Philippi, Amphipolis, Apollonia, and Thessalonica (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.11-12">Acts 16:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.1">17:1</a>).</p>
<p>The gospel was introduced to Europe by way of Macedonia when Paul responded to a vision while on his second missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.9-12">Acts 16:9-12</a>). Details of that work, centering in Philippi and Thessalonica, are described in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.11-17.15">Acts 16:11–17:15</a>. On his third journey, though delayed initially (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.21-22">19:21-22</a>), Paul later returned to Macedonia, and again after a stay in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.1-3">20:1-3</a>; see <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.5">1 Cor 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.16">2 Cor 1:16</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.13">2:13</a> for other references to Macedonia visits).</p>

<p>Macedonian believers played an important part in the collection Paul gathered for the poor in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.26">Rom 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.2-4">2 Cor 9:2-4</a>); Paul commended them for their liberality (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-2">2 Cor 8:1-2</a>). He also praised them for their example of faith, even in times of adversity (<a href="?bref=2Cor.7.5">2 Cor 7:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.7">1 Thes 1:7</a>), and for their love of others (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.10">1 Thes 4:10</a>). Some of the Macedonians worked directly with Paul in carrying out the gospel commission (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.29">Acts 19:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.4">20:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.27.2">27:2</a>), and he addressed letters to churches in two Macedonian cities, Philippi and Thessalonica.</p>

<p class="fl">Fortified castle where John the Baptist was imprisoned and later beheaded by Herod Antipas (according to Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.5.2). The name does not occur in canonical Scripture nor in the Apocrypha, but it was one of the strongest fortresses in all Palestine, having been built by Alexander Janneus (Josephus’s <span class="ital">War</span> 7.6.1-4). It was destroyed by Gabinius in the wars of Pompey (<span class="ital">War</span> 1.8.5) but restored and greatly enlarged by Herod the Great, who built a magnificent palace within the enclosure. It was situated east of the Dead Sea at the southern extremity of Perea on a promontory overlooking the Dead Sea. It is identified with the modern M’Khaur.</p>
<p>Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-12">Mt 14:1-12</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.17-29">Mk 6:17-29</a>) report that Herod, upon hearing of the fame of Jesus, attributed his miracle-working power to John the Baptist, whom he believed had been restored to life. The confinement of John the Baptist was apparently not so rigorous as to exclude the visit of friends (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-3">Mt 11:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.18-20">Lk 7:18-20</a>). It was from this castle that the Arabian wife of Herod, who had been repudiated by him for the sake of Herodias, fled to her father, Aretas, the king of Arabia. This precipitated the war between Herod and Aretas (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.5.1) and resulted in the defeat of Herod.</p>

<p class="fl">“Wise men” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) appearing in <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-12">Matthew 2:1-12</a> who, following a star, came to Jerusalem and then to Bethlehem in order to pay homage to the newborn “king of the Jews.” Matthew’s account forms a significant introduction to his Gospel by drawing attention to the true identity of Jesus as King and by foreshadowing the homage paid by the Gentiles to Jesus throughout that Gospel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMagiintheAncientWorld">The Magi in the Ancient World</p>
<p class="fl">Extrabiblical evidence offers various clues that shed light on the place of origin and positions held by the magi of <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-23">Matthew 2</a>. The historian Herodotus mentioned magi as a priestly caste of Media, or Persia, and, as the religion in Persia at the time was Zoroastrinism, Herodotus’s magi were probably Zoroastrian priests. Herodotus, together with Plutarch and Strabo, suggested that magi were partly responsible for ritual and cultic life (supervising sacrifices and prayers) and partly responsible as royal advisers to the courts of the East. Believing the affairs of history were reflected in the movements of the stars and other phenomena, Herodotus said, the rulers of the East commonly utilized the magi’s knowledge of astrology and dream interpretation to determine affairs of state. The magi were, therefore, concerned with what the movement of the stars (as signs and portents) might signify for the future affairs of history. Such an interest could account not only for the magi’s interest in the star in Matthew, but also their conclusion, shared with Herod, that the star’s appearance signified the birth of a new ruler of great importance (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.2">2:2</a>). Several centuries before Christ, a similar correlation was noted between a stellar phenomenon and the birth of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IdentityinMatthewsGospel">Identity in Matthew’s Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">Matthew’s infancy narrative contains little information concerning the identity of the magi. Matthew states only that the magi were “from the East” (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-2">2:1-2</a>), an ambiguous point of origin that left room for many subsequent hypotheses. Some church fathers proposed Arabia on the basis of where the gifts (gold, frankincense, and myrrh, <a href="?bref=Matt.2.11">2:11</a>) were likely to have originated. Others suggested Chaldea or Media/Persia because Persia had a caste of priests (magi), which would fit the description in Matthew.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SignificanceinMatthewsGospel">Significance in Matthew’s Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">The visit of the magi plays a significant role in introducing Matthew’s Gospel. From the beginning it reveals the true identity of the infant as the long-expected and prophesied royal Messiah of Israel. This is brought out first in the appearance of the “star,” which carried clear messianic connotations: “a star shall come forth out of Jacob, a scepter shall arise out of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Nm 24:17</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Isa.60.3">Is 60:3</a>). Second, the interchange between the magi, Herod, and the chief priests and scribes (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.2-6">Mt 2:2-6</a>) reveals that Jesus is the fulfillment of the messianic prophecy of <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Micah 5:2</a>, the ruler of Israel coming from the small village of Bethlehem. Third, the offering of the gifts (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.11">Mt 2:11</a>) may also echo the possible messianic promises of <a href="?bref=Ps.68.29">Psalms 68:29</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.72.10">72:10</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to confirming that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah, the account of the magi’s visit, as part of the introduction to Matthew’s Gospel, introduces several prominent themes that reappear in subsequent chapters. First, the account establishes that Jesus’ messiahship has bearing not only on the Jews but even on the gentile world (symbolized in the “wise men from the East”). A second theme, which surfaces later, is the surprising Gentile’s faith, a faith that is lacking among Jesus’ own people. Even as the foreign magi honor the infant Messiah, Herod and possibly the chief priests and scribes of the people plot the baby’s death (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.3-6,16">Mt 2:3-6, 16</a>). So also elsewhere in the Gospel, Gentiles exhibit faith in Jesus, which often contrasts markedly with the faithlessness of the Jews (see <a href="?bref=Matt.8.5-13">8:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.21-28">15:21-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.19,54">27:19, 54</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MAGIC</p>
<p class="fl">Attempt to influence or control people or events through supernatural forces. These forces are called upon by means of ceremonies, the recitation of spells, charms, incantations, and other forms of ritual.</p>
<p>There are a number of terms used in the Bible that might fall into the broad category of magic. Several of the words are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Deut.18.9-14">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a>. The use of magical and occult practices by Israel is not permitted. The people of God are instructed to avoid magical practices because God provides them with his personal revelation through his prophets. Human magical practices lead to either false hope or false fear and therefore lead away from the truth of God. Yet while magical practices cannot measure up to the accuracy of God’s prophet, the Bible does leave open the possibility that there may be supernatural reality behind some magical practices.</p>
<p>Magicians are prominent in the OT book of Exodus, where the magicians of Egypt contend with Moses. The text does not discount the success of the magicians as mere trickery, for they were at least partially successful at first (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-8.32">7–8</a>). But their failures begin to become clear in chapter <a href="?bref=Exod.8.1-32">8</a> and continue through chapter <a href="?bref=Exod.9.1-35">9</a>. The Bible does not flatly deny that there may be certain evil supernatural power at work in the person of the magician. What the Bible does make clear is that this power is not in accord with, nor can it defeat, the will of God.</p>
<p>The NT addresses the issue of magic in the book of Acts. When Philip went to Samaria, he encountered Simon the magician. Simon had drawn a great deal of attention to himself by amazing the people with his magic (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.11">Acts 8:11</a>). Philip’s message was believed and people began to be drawn to him. Simon saw the wonders that Philip was able to perform and thought that these powers were received through the ritual of the laying on of hands. Philip made clear that the wonders of his work could not be purchased but came through the gracious gift of God to the penitent.</p>
<p>Another important passage is found in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.11-20">Acts 19:11-20</a>. Certain Jewish exorcists thought they could magically use the name of Jesus in their work. The result was violent reaction: the man in whom resided the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them, and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. This passage shows that the power responsible for the apostolic miracles was based upon the personal relationship of the apostle with the Lord Jesus Christ. The result of the above incident is also important; it led the people of Ephesus to make a clear decision between the word of the Lord and their magical practices. Several who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the presence of everyone. This dramatic display of the power of God and the need for clear loyalty to him led to further expansion of the gospel.</p>
<p>The biblical stand against magic is stated strongly in the last book of the Bible, where sorcerers are condemned to the lake of fire (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">Rv 21:8</a>). The biblical view is consistent in its opposition to magic. The Bible does not preclude the possibility that Satan can use magic for evil purposes, and magical practices are condemned because they may lead to false hope or false fear and away from loyalty to God’s Word.</p>

<p class="h1">MAGISTRATE</p>
<p class="fl">Title of a public official who acted as judge and administrator of a given municipality. King Artaxerxes ordered Ezra to select magistrates along with judges to govern the people when they returned to Palestine (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.25">Ezr 7:25</a>). This official was one of the officers of Nebuchadnezzar’s court invited to the dedication feast (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.2-3">Dn 3:2-3</a>). <a href="?bref=Luke.12.58">Luke 12:58</a> portrayed the magistrate as a ruling authority whose verdict was final.</p>
<p>During the Roman era, each Roman colony was assigned two magistrates (called <span class="ital">duumviri</span>) who were primarily responsible for judging criminal offenses against the state. Hence, Paul and Silas were brought before the magistrates at Philippi for allegedly advocating customs unacceptable to the Romans (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.20-38">Acts 16:20-38</a>). Before this <span class="ital">duumvir,</span> they were ordered to be stripped, beaten, and thrown into prison.

  <title>Magog</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MAGOG</p>
<p class="fl">Term found only five times in the Bible but significant because of its use in the well-known prophetic passages of <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.1-39.29">Ezekiel 38–39</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a>. In the register of nations in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.2">Genesis 10:2</a> (see also <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.5">1 Chr 1:5</a>), Magog was listed among the sons of Japheth, identifying both an individual and the nation that came forth from him. In Ezekiel and Revelation, Magog came to refer either to a land, a people, or both.</p>
<p>Magog is not mentioned in the contemporary literature of biblical times. Therefore, a definition must come primarily from the witness of Scripture, though writers from later times have given additional clues for the identification of the word. Magog was first identified biblically as a son of Japheth (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.2">Gn 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.5">1 Chr 1:5</a>), along with Tubal and Meshech (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.2">Ez 38:2</a>). <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.2">Ezekiel 38:2</a> associates Magog with the person Gog, indicating that Magog was the land (along with Tubal and Meshech) over which Gog ruled. <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.6">Ezekiel 39:6</a> uses the term Magog to speak of the people from the land of Magog. Together, <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.1-23">Ezekiel 38</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.1-29">39</a> present an invasion of Israel in the latter days (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.8-16">Ez 38:8-16</a>) by Gog and his people from the land of Magog, along with peoples from every corner of the known world (cf. vv <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.5-6">5-6</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rev.20.8">Revelation 20:8</a> depicts Gog and Magog as invading the land of Israel with a great company of nations from every part of the world. It certainly appears that Ezekiel and Revelation had the same event of the latter days in mind. <a href="?bref=Rev.20.8">Revelation 20:8</a> can be understood to identify Gog as Satan and to see Magog as invading peoples who come with Satan. Some see “Gog and Magog” in <a href="?bref=Rev.20.8">Revelation 20:8</a> as a symbol of a future great battle at the end of the millennium that is similar to the invasion in <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.1-39.29">Ezekiel 38–39</a>, but the terms themselves are not identified specifically. Some see Magog in <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a> as another person along with Gog.</p>
<p>Extrabiblical writings give additional clues. Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 1.6.1 equates Magog with the Scythians of the north who lived in the area of present-day Turkey and south-central Russia. Jubilees 7:19 and 9:8 refer to Magog as the “northern barbarians.” In the OT, Magog is associated with Tubal and Meshech, geographical areas normally believed to lie in the mountainous region between, and south of, the Caspian and Black Seas.</p>
<p>The available data argue for the identification of Magog in Ezekiel and Revelation with the northern barbarian hordes (perhaps the area of the Scythians) from the modern geographical region of Turkey and south-central Russia who will invade Israel under the leadership of Gog in the latter days. However, there is no warrant in the Scripture or elsewhere to conjecture that these modern nations are <span class="ital">the</span> identification of these terms.</p>

David fled to this city when Absalom rebelled against him. Here he received supplies from Barzillai and some Gileadites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.17.24-27">17:24-27</a>). At this city gate he wept as he received the news of Absalom’s death. Solomon chose the city for the capital of his seventh district and established Ahinadab as its governor (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.14">1 Kgs 4:14</a>).</p>
<p>Biblical references point to a location somewhere along the Jabbok River in central Gilead. Outside of this, the city could have been located virtually anywhere. It was earlier identified with Khirbet al-Makhna, two miles (3.2 kilometers) north of Aijalon. Most recent attention, however, has moved to the twin hills of Tulul al-Dhahab on the Jabbok. Aharoni suggests that the western mound of Tulul al-Dhahab is Mahanaim and the eastern mound is Penuel.</p>

<p class="h1">MAID, MAIDEN</p>
<p class="fl">Young unmarried woman, often of the servant class. In the OT, five Hebrew words with varying shades of meaning are translated by the English word “maiden.”</p>
<p>One of these words is <span class="hebrew">’amah</span><span class="ital">.</span> Various English translations of this word include “bondmaid,” “bondwoman,” “handmaid(en),” “maid(en),” “maid servant,” “female servant,” “female slave,” “slave girl,” and “girl.”</p>
<p>Another term is <span class="hebrew">shiphchah</span><span class="ital">.</span> This Hebrew word is of similar meaning to <span class="hebrew">’amah</span><span class="ital">.</span> It is translated variously as “handmaid,” “maid(en),” “female slave,” and “slave girl.” Although both <span class="hebrew">shiphchah</span> and <span class="hebrew">’amah</span> refer to female slaves, <span class="hebrew">shiphchah</span> seems to imply that a closer relationship existed between the slave and the family to whom she belonged. In the patriarchal story this term is often employed in reference both to female slaves in general and specifically to the concubines who were also slaves to the free wife of their husbands (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">Gn 16</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-30.43">29–30</a>).</p>
<p>Still another Hebrew term for “maiden” is <span class="hebrew">bethulah</span><span class="ital">.</span> This term refers specifically to a virgin, or a young woman of marriageable age (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.16">Gn 24:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.22.16">Ex 22:16</a>). The OT prophets sometimes used this term figuratively to refer to a city or country as a “virgin” (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.21">Jer 31:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.2">Am 5:2</a>).</p>
<p>Another word, <span class="hebrew">na‘arah</span><span class="ital">,</span> is itself used in several ways in the OT. Often it refers to an unmarried girl (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.4">Est 2:4</a>); at other times it is used in speaking of a servant (<a href="?bref=Esth.4.4">Est 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.2.23">Ru 2:23</a>). This same word is the base of the proper name of a woman (Naarah, the wife of Ashhur, in <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.5-6">1 Chr 4:5-6</a>) and of a city in Ephraim near Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.7">Jos 16:7</a>).</p>
<p>For many years controversy has surrounded the meaning of <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span><span class="ital">,</span> the word for maiden used in <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a>. The dispute arises because of the varied definitions of the word throughout the OT (“girl,” “young woman,” “young woman of marriageable age, presumably a virgin”). Only context can accurately determine the meaning of <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span> in any given instance. Looking at <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a> from a NT perspective, <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span> is a reference to the virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus (see <a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">Mt 1:23</a>).</p>
<p>Several Greek words are translated as “maiden” in the English NT. The meaning of <span class="greek">korasion</span> is simply “girl,” “little girl,” or “maiden” (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.24-25">Mt 9:24-25</a>). Another word, <span class="greek">paidiske</span><span class="ital">,</span> originally referred to a “young woman” but later came to mean “a female slave,” “a servant-maid” or “a servant girl” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.66">Mk 14:66</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.45">Lk 12:45</a>). It is a diminutive of <span class="greek">pais</span> (a Greek word denoting “a young girl,” “maiden,” or “child”) (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.51,54">Lk 8:51, 54</a>). <span class="greek">Numphe</span> is the Greek word meaning “young wife,” “bride,” and “daughter-in-law” (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.53">Lk 12:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">Rv 21:2</a>). <span class="greek">Parthenos</span> is the usual Greek term for “virgin” and occurs 14 times in the NT.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The name Malachi means “my messenger” or “messenger of the Lord.” Since the word appears in <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">3:1</a>, some scholars think that it is not a proper name at all and does not provide the name of the author of the book. According to one ancient tradition, the “messenger” was Ezra, the priest responsible for the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Yet it would be most unusual for the Jews to preserve a prophetic book without explicitly attaching to it the name of the author. All of the other major and minor prophets—including Obadiah—are named after a particular prophet. Moreover, “messenger of the Lord” would be a most appropriate name for a prophet (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.15-16">2 Chr 36:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.13">Hg 1:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">During the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the struggling Jewish community in Judah was greatly assisted by the return of Ezra and Nehemiah. In 458 <span class="era">BC</span> Ezra was encouraged by King Artaxerxes of Persia to lead a group of exiles back to Jerusalem and to institute religious reform. About 13 years later, in 445 <span class="era">BC</span>, a high-ranking government official named Nehemiah was allowed to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the city walls, a task he accomplished in 52 days (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">Neh 6:15</a>). As governor, Nehemiah led the people in a financial reform that provided for the poor and encouraged tithing to support the priests and Levites (<a href="?bref=Neh.5.2-13">5:2-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.10.35-39">10:35-39</a>). Like Ezra, Nehemiah urged the people to keep the Sabbath and avoid intermarrying with pagan neighbors. After a 12-year term, Nehemiah returned to Persia and the spiritual condition of Judah deteriorated. Perhaps discouraged by their lack of political power, tithing became sporadic, the Sabbath was not kept, intermarriage was common, and even the priests could not be trusted. When Nehemiah came back to Jerusalem sometime later, he had to take firm action to straighten out the situation (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.6-31">13:6-31</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Since Malachi had to deal with the same sins mentioned in <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1-31">Nehemiah 13</a> (see <a href="?bref=Mal.1.6-14">Mal 1:6-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.2.14-16">2:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.8-11">3:8-11</a>), it is likely that the prophet ministered either during Nehemiah’s second term as governor or in the years just before his return. The reference to “the governor” in <a href="?bref=Mal.1.8">Malachi 1:8</a> implies that someone other than Nehemiah was in office, so it may be best to place Malachi just after 433 <span class="era">BC</span>, the year Nehemiah had returned to Persia.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheology">Purpose and Theology</p>
<p class="fl">Malachi was written to shake the people of Judah from their spiritual lethargy and to warn them that judgment was coming unless they repented. The people doubted God’s love (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.2">1:2</a>) and justice (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.17">2:17</a>) and did not take his commands seriously (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.6">1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.14-18">3:14-18</a>). Yet God was “a great King” (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.14">1:14</a>) with a great name that was to be feared even beyond the border of Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Mal.1.5,11">5, 11</a>). Malachi repeatedly urged both the priests and the people to revere God and give him the honor he deserved. God was Israel’s Father and Creator (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.10">2:10</a>), but the nation showed contempt for his name (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.6">1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">3:5</a>). In response to this contempt, God would send his messenger to announce the Day of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">3:1</a>). John the Baptist did call the nation to repentance, and Christ came to cleanse the temple (<a href="?bref=John.2.14-15">Jn 2:14-15</a>) and to establish the covenant (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.1-2">Mal 3:1-2</a>). Most of the work of refining and purifying will take place at the Second Coming, when Christ returns to purify his people (cf. vv <a href="?bref=Mal.3.2-4">2-4</a>) and judge the wicked (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.1">4:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Great Love for Israel (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.1-5">1:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">To introduce the book, Malachi presents a contrast between God’s love for Israel and his hatred for Edom. Yet the assertion of God’s love is greeted with a strange question: “How have you loved us?” God loved Israel by entering into a covenant with the nation at Mt Sinai, just after he had freed them from the prison of Egypt. He had chosen them as his special people (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-6">Ex 19:5-6</a>), whereas the descendants of Esau were not chosen (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.10-13">Rom 9:10-13</a>). Both Israel and Edom endured invasion and destruction, but only Israel was restored and rebuilt after the exile. The people of Edom were driven from their homeland by the Nabateans between 550 and 400 <span class="era">BC</span>, and they never regained their territory. Through the judgment of Edom, God demonstrated that he is the great Ruler over the nations (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.5">Mal 1:5</a>) and that he will not forget Israel.</p>
<p class="h3">The Unacceptable Sacrifices of the Priests (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.6-14">1:6-14</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Although God deserved the honor and reverence of the Israelites, both the people and the priests openly disdained his laws and regulations. Strangely, it was the priests who led the way into disobedience. Sacrifices and offerings were supposed to atone for sin, but the animals offered by the priests only served to pollute or defile the altar (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.7,12">1:7, 12</a>). According to Leviticus, animals with defects were unacceptable as sacrifices, but Malachi mentions that the priests were offering to the Lord animals that were stolen and mutilated, crippled and sick (v <a href="?bref=Mal.1.13">13</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Mal.1.8">8</a>). To emphasize their contempt, the Lord challenged the priests to bring comparable presents to the governor. Would they dare to insult him in this fashion and face sure rejection? Rather than having the priests continue to bring unfit sacrifices to the altar, the Lord asked them to close the temple doors entirely (v <a href="?bref=Mal.1.10">10</a>). Going through the motions never pleased God, either in ancient times (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.1.12-13">Is 1:12-13</a>) or modern. By calling the altar and its sacrifices “contemptible” (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.7,12">Mal 1:7, 12</a>), the priests were no better than the wicked sons of Eli, whose disregard of the rules for sacrifices sent them to a premature death (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.15-17">1 Sm 2:15-17</a>).</p>
<p>In sharp contrast to the attitude of the priests stands the emphasis upon God’s greatness in <a href="?bref=Mal.1.11">Malachi 1:11</a> and 14. God is more powerful than the gods of other nations, and even if Israel’s priests and people dishonor the Lord, eventually pure offerings will be brought to God by believing Gentiles. Perhaps these offerings refer to prayer and praise (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.19.14">Ps 19:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.15">Heb 13:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.8">Rv 5:8</a>), but others interpret the reference more literally (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.56.7">Is 56:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.7">60:7</a>). Peter may be alluding to this verse in connection with the conversion of Cornelius (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.35">Acts 10:35</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Punishment of the Priests (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.1-9">2:1-9</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">One of the functions of the priests was to pronounce blessings upon the people in the name of God, but their disgraceful behavior turned the blessings into curses (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.2">Mal 2:2</a>). Because of the priests’ sinfulness and the poor condition of the animals, their sacrifices were also worthless, and the entrails of the animals will be spread on their faces as a sign that God holds them in contempt. The disgrace heaped upon the priests differs sharply from the honor enjoyed by Aaron and his descendants. Malachi refers to a covenant of life and peace (v <a href="?bref=Mal.2.5">5</a>) made with Levi and more particularly with Aaron’s grandson Phinehas, who courageously took action against the Jews involved in idolatry and immorality (<a href="?bref=Num.25.10-13">Nm 25:10-13</a>). In those days the priests revered the Lord and turned many from sin (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.6">Mal 2:6</a>).</p>
<p>Another responsibility of the priests was to teach the nation the law handed down by Moses (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.10.11">Lv 10:11</a>). Like prophets, they were messengers of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.7">Mal 2:7</a>) who were supposed to walk close to the Lord, but now the priests disregarded the law and were dishonest in handing down judicial decisions (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.9">Mal 2:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.19.15">Lv 19:15</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Unfaithfulness of the People (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.10-16">2:10-16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In light of the attitude of the priests, it is not surprising to discover that the people at large were unfaithful to the Lord. God had formed Israel to be his special people, but the people had broken faith with him. A major factor in their unfaithfulness was intermarriage with foreigners, a sin mentioned in <a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1-2">Ezra 9:1-2</a> and <a href="?bref=Neh.13.23-29">Nehemiah 13:23-29</a>. By marrying pagan women, the men of Israel invariably began to worship pagan gods and turn from the Lord. When such intermarriage occurred, it sometimes followed the divorce of an Israelite wife. In <a href="?bref=Mal.2.14-15">Malachi 2:14-15</a> God underscores the sacred commitment that he himself witnesses when two people marry. If that marriage covenant is shattered by divorce, God is deeply displeased. And it is even more tragic if divorce became an excuse to marry a more attractive or appealing foreigner.</p>
<p class="h3">The Coming of the Messenger of the Covenant (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.17-3.5">2:17–3:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The sins of the priests and the people did not go unnoticed, even though the nation doubted that God would take action (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.17">2:17</a>). But the third chapter opens with the announcement that the messenger of the covenant will indeed come to his temple. His way will be prepared by another messenger—a prophecy of John the Baptist, who prepared the way for the ministry of Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.11.10">Mt 11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.2-3">Mk 1:2-3</a>). When Christ came, he revealed his anger when he cleansed the temple (cf. <a href="?bref=John.2.13-17">Jn 2:13-17</a>) and denounced the scribes and Pharisees (cf. <a href="?bref=John.9.39">9:39</a>), but most of his purifying and refining work awaits the Second Coming. Someday the priests and Levites will bring acceptable sacrifices, as they did in the days of Moses and Phinehas (cf. <a href="?bref=Mal.3.3-4">Mal 3:3-4</a> and <a href="?bref=Mal.2.4-5">2:4-5</a>). Verse <a href="?bref=Mal.3.5">5 of chapter 3</a> broadens the scope of the judgment to include the whole nation, as sorcerers, adulterers, and those who oppress the poor are condemned.</p>
<p class="h3">The Benefits of Faithful Tithing (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.6-12">3:6-12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Another specific weakness of postexilic Judah was the failure of the people to bring their tithes to the Lord. Encouraged by Nehemiah, the nation promised to tithe faithfully (cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.10.37-39">Neh 10:37-39</a>), but apparently their good intentions were short-lived (cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.13.10-11">13:10-11</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Mal.3.8-9">Malachi 3:8-9</a>, the tithes of the nation were so dismal that the people were, in effect, robbing God and were therefore under a curse. In verses <a href="?bref=Mal.3.10-12">10-12</a> Malachi challenges the nation to bring their tithes; then God would pour out his blessing upon them. Just as the opening of the “windows in heaven” meant the end of a famine in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.7.2,19">2 Kings 7:2, 19</a>, so God promises that their crops will be so abundant that they will run out of storage space. The hope of “blessing” in <a href="?bref=Mal.3.10">Malachi 3:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Mal.3.12">12</a> provides welcome relief from the curses mentioned in <a href="?bref=Mal.1.14">1:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Mal.2.2">2:2</a>, <a href="?bref=Mal.3.9">3:9</a>, and <a href="?bref=Mal.4.6">4:6</a>.</p>
<p class="h3">The Day of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.13-4.6">3:13–4:6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Faced with the challenge of <a href="?bref=Mal.3.10-12">Malachi 3:10-12</a>, the people of Israel responded in two different ways. One group denied that serving God brought any benefit (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.13-15">3:13-15</a>), while another segment of the nation bowed low before him with deep reverence (vv <a href="?bref=Mal.3.16-18">16-18</a>). The unbelievers argued that obeying the Lord was useless and that arrogant and evil people were the ones who prospered. In response to their charge, Malachi noted that God would remember who the righteous were in the Day of Judgment. Although all of Israel was included in the promise made to Abraham, only those who genuinely believed would be God’s treasured possession (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.17">3:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.19.5">Ex 19:5</a>), with their names written in the Book of Life (cf. <a href="?bref=Mal.3.16">Mal 3:16</a>). As for the arrogant and evildoers, the Day of the Lord will consume them and they will have no survivors (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.1">4:1</a>). Those who revere the Lord will enjoy spiritual and physical health under the blessing and protection of God, who is called the “sun of righteousness” (v <a href="?bref=Mal.4.2">2</a>). Like calves just released from confinement, the righteous will trample down the wicked and triumph over them (v <a href="?bref=Mal.4.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>In view of the judgment associated with the Day of the Lord, Malachi urged the people to repent. To do this they needed to heed the law of Moses and take seriously the decrees and commands given at Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.4">4:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mal.3.7">3:7</a>). Just as Elijah called on Israel to turn back to God, so a new “Elijah” will preach repentance to a rebellious nation. When John the Baptist prepared the way for Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">Mal 3:1</a>), he ministered “in the spirit and power of Elijah” and begged the Jews to turn from their sin and humble themselves before God (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.17">Lk 1:17</a>). If they refused to listen, the nation faced the prospect of total destruction, the curse placed upon the people of Canaan (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.6.17-19">Jos 6:17-19</a>) and upon the nation of Edom, whose collapse was described in <a href="?bref=Mal.1.2-5">Malachi 1:2-5</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Island in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily. The name Malta occurs only once in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.1">Acts 28:1</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Melita”), in connection with the shipwreck that occurred on Paul’s voyage to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.11-12">25:11-12</a>). This voyage was undertaken during the winter, the season in which storms are most likely to be encountered on the Mediterranean. The ship proceeded cautiously, for contrary winds were blowing (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.4">27:4</a>). With difficulty they reached the harbor of Fair Havens on Crete (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.7-8">7-8</a>). In spite of a warning by Paul, the decision was made to try to reach the Cretan port of Phoenix, which was more suitable for wintering (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.9-12">9-12</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="ShipwreckedatMalta"/>
<p>Caught by a severe storm and driven helplessly by the wind for 14 days, the ship finally neared land during the night. In the morning, the ship tried for the beach but ran aground and was pounded to pieces by the surf. Everyone managed to reach the shore safely. While putting wood on a fire, Paul was bitten by a viper. The natives of the island supposed that he was a criminal whose life was being taken by the bite of a snake. When he did not fall down dead, they radically changed their opinion of him and regarded him as a god (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.6">Acts 28:6</a>).</p>
<p>The island of Malta is about 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) from Sicily and has an area of 95 square miles (246.1 square kilometers). St. Paul’s Bay marks the traditional site of the shipwreck of Acts. The island is essentially agricultural, but production is poor because of the thin calcareous soil. Terracing is practiced in order to utilize the soil to the fullest extent. The island has no rivers and is dependent on rainfall and springs for its water. The climate in general is mild, but in the summer the island is subject to the hot, dust-laden sirocco from the deserts of Libya.</p>

<p class="fl">Aramaic word, meaning wealth or property, transliterated by the Gospel writers in Greek letters. Some English translations preserve the Greek form of the word in English (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>); others translate it with the words “wealth” or “money” (<span class="sc">neb</span>, <span class="sc">tev</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In <a href="?bref=Matt.6.24">Matthew 6:24</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.16.13">Luke 16:13</a>, “mammon” is personified as a rival to God for the loyalty of the disciples: To which master will obedience be given? In <a href="?bref=Luke.16.9-11">Luke 16:9-11</a> the term designates material wealth or property. Mammon itself does not carry a negative value, as the parallel phrasing in <a href="?bref=Luke.16.11">Luke 16:11</a> makes clear: “If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true riches?” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">MAN</p>
<p class="fl">Human being, whether male or female.</p>
<p>The biblical teaching on man begins with a right notion concerning God. The biblical perspective of anthropology (i.e., the study of man) is centrally displayed in the context of an elevated theology (i.e., the study of God). A high and reverent view of God leads to a noble and dignified view of man, whereas a poorly developed concept of God often produces a distorted perspective on man. Hence, man may be viewed more importantly than he ought, or man may be seen less important than is biblical. Either view is subbiblical. The place to begin a study of man (which in this article is used as a generic term for both male and female human beings) is with a view of God, his Creator.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MansOrigin">Man’s Origin</p>
<p class="fl">Against the naturalistic, materialistic theories of origins, the biblical view starts with the assertion that the eternal God has created man, the most significant of all his created works. It is not necessary for one to subscribe to a particular chronological scenario for God’s work in the creation of man. Some Christians believe the Bible teaches a closed chronology in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> made of six literal 24-hour days (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.1.5,8,13">Gn 1:5, 8, 13</a>, etc.), with the stunning, sudden appearance of man coming perhaps just some 6,000 years ago (cf. the chronologies associated with but not limited to Archbishop James Ussher, <span class="ital">Annales,</span> 1650–58). Some who hold this general viewpoint (sometimes called creation science) extend the creation of man to about 10,000 years ago, based on a view of some elasticity in the chronologies of <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-32">Genesis 5</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-32">11</a>.</p>
<p>Others believe the texts of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.2.1-25">2</a> may be interpreted far more broadly to speak of a most remote antiquity for the creation of man (extending to millions of years). They argue that process (under God’s control and direction) may have played a significant role in God’s creative work. This viewpoint is best termed progressive creationism, and is to be contrasted with theistic evolution, in which God is usually viewed as initiating the process but having little involvement once the processes are in motion. In the former approach, the Hebrew term “day” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">yom</span><span class="ital">)</span> in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> may refer to an extended period of time (e.g., the “day-age” theory); thus, the phrasing “an evening and a morning, the <span class="ital">x</span>th day” may be a literary device to present successive scenes in the creative works of God through the processes of time.</p>
<p>Many Christians find themselves somewhere between a conservative and a broad chronology for man’s origin. Yet in spite of individual preferences, one must give assent to God’s creative work in producing man in order to think biblically about man. The essence of faith begins in the words “I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.”</p>
<p>Man is not only God’s creation but also the pinnacle of his creative effort. Long before modern precision in such things, the ancients were aware of man’s anatomical similarities with members of the animal kingdom. Yet despite these similarities, the biblical viewpoint never places man on the same level as animals—man is distinct, the high point of God’s creative work, the apex of his handicraft. The progression of the created things in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> is climactic; all of God’s created work culminated in his fashioning of man.</p>
<p>The distinct behavioral characteristics of man include language, toolmaking, and culture. Distinct experiential characteristics include reflective awareness, ethical concern, aesthetic urges, historical awareness, and metaphysical concern. These factors individually and collectively separate man from other forms of animal life. Man is far more than the “naked ape” of some modern evolutionary theories. But sociology alone does not suffice to explain the full nature of man. That is the subject of divine revelation.</p>
<p>While man bears a continuity with God’s creation (assumed in the words of <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>, being fashioned from the dust of the earth), man is also distinct from all that precedes him because God breathed into him the breath of life so that he became a living soul (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">2:7</a>). Man was created by God as male and female (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.27">1:27</a>), meaning that what is said generally of man must be said of both the male and the female, and that the truest picture of what it means to be human will be found in the context of man and woman together. The commands to multiply and exercise sovereignty over the earth were given to both sexes as shared responsibility. Similarly, it is man as male and female that rebelled against God and bears the consequences of that primeval sin in the postfall world, and it is man as male and female that Christ came to redeem (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Gal 3:28</a>). At the same time, the words “male” and “female” denote true distinctions. Many perceived gender differences may be culturally conditioned, yet the prime sexual distinctions between male (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">zakar</span><span class="ital">,</span> “the piercer”) and female (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">neqeba</span><span class="ital">,</span> “the pierced”) are divinely intended. It takes both male and female to exhibit the full image of God (see <a href="?bref=Gen.1.27">Gn 1:27</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, the most stunning biblical assertion respecting man is that God made man <span class="ital">in his image.</span> Of no other creature, not even the angels, is such a statement found. The words “in God’s image” in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-28">Genesis 1:26-28</a> are the basis for the psalmist’s paraphrase in <a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Psalm 8:5</a>, “for you have made him to lack but little of God” (literal translation; “lower than the angels,” Septuagint translation). The meaning of the phrase “the image of God” (Latin, <span class="ital">imago Dei</span>) has been the subject of much debate. Some have thought the phrase to refer to a physical representation of God, but this is doubtful in that God is spirit (cf. <a href="?bref=John.4.24">Jn 4:24</a>). Others think the phrase refers to man’s personhood, which corresponds to the personality of God (having intellect, sensibilities, and will). Such qualities of man may be found in God’s image; however, these varied aspects of personality are also shared by other members of the animal kingdom and are not unique to the human species.</p>
<p>The basic meaning of the word “image” (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">tselem</span>) is “shadow,” “representation,” or “likeness.” The image of God in man reveals God’s perspective of man’s worth and dignity as a representation or a shadow of himself in the created world. Ancient kings of Assyria were known to have physical images of themselves placed in outlying districts as a reminder to those who might be prone to forget that these areas were a part of the empire. So God has placed in man a shadow of himself, a representation of his presence, in the world that he has made.</p>
<p>This view of God’s image in man seems to be confirmed by the immediate context in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a>. Man, created in God’s image, is to have dominion over all of God’s other works (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26">Gn 1:26</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Ps 8:5</a>). Further, as a representative of the Creator, man is to respond to him. Jesus’ assertion of the spirituality of God results in a response of worship in spirit and in truth (<a href="?bref=John.4.21-24">Jn 4:21-24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="MansNature">Man’s Nature</p>
<p class="fl">One may tend to think of man in parts, but the biblical emphasis is on man as a whole. Debates continue on the tripartite (threefold) nature of man (cf. <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.23">1 Thes 5:23</a>)—spirit, soul, and body—as against a bipartite (twofold) nature of man, material and immaterial. Though the Bible does seem to support both positions, the most important issue respecting the nature of man is his unity rather than the number of his parts. Hence, a biblical view of man begins in the assertion that one is a person made up of physical and nonphysical properties. In the words of Karl Barth, the human person is “bodily soul, as he is also besouled body.” There is no person in body only, nor can one easily think of a bodiless spirit as a person, except in a temporary, transitional state. The Hebrew term <span class="hebrew">nephesh</span><span class="ital">,</span> often translated “soul,” is best rendered “person” in most contexts. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">ruach</span> (“breath,” “wind,” “spirit”) and the Greek words <span class="greek">pneuma</span> (“spirit”) and <span class="greek">psuche</span> (“soul”) often speak of the immaterial part of man. This is no less real than the physical. A purely material, physical view of man is frightfully deficient. At the same time, an overemphasis on the spirit and a deemphasis on the physical is neither realistic nor balanced. One may say, “I am a person whose existence is presently very dependent upon my physical body. But I am more than body, more than flesh. When my body dies, I still live. When my flesh decays, I exist. But one day I shall live in a body again. For the notion of a disembodied spirit is not the full measure of my humanity. God’s ideal for me is to live my life in my [new] body. So in hope of the eternal state, I believe in the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.”</p>
<p>One cannot go far in thinking of the nature of man from the biblical vantage point without first facing the problem of the fall. <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Genesis 3</a> suggests that unfallen man was immortal, that his powers of sexual reproduction were not originally bound in the pain in childbearing, and that his work was not troubled by reversals in nature. After the fall, however, all was changed: within man himself, between the male and the female, in his interaction with nature, and in his relationship with the Creator.</p>
<p>As a result of the fall, man has become profoundly fallen, a fallenness extending to every part of his person. The phrase “total depravity” need not mean that one is as evil as he or she might be, but rather that the results of sin affect one’s whole being. At the time, the image of God in man continues in some way after the fall, providing the divine rationale for salvation (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-21">Rom 5</a>). It is essentially because of God’s estimation of the intrinsic worth of man that the divine justification of salvation may be maintained.</p>
<p>The old debate between the essential goodness and the evil disposition of man finds its quandary and resolution in the Genesis account: God made man to consciously reflect the dignity and nobility of the Creator, yet man, by his own deliberate rebellion, turned against his Creator and continues, except by God’s grace, in the ensuing sin that marks his life. This resultant sin is both a quality of being in the fallen person, as well as numerous, continuing acts of pride and selfishness. Though the image of God in man was marred by the fall, it may be stimulated anew by the effective work of the Spirit of God as one comes to newness of life in Christ. This gracious work of God brings personal renewal, restoration of relationships with others, and fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Man, then, who was created good by God, has become evil by his own devices, yet in God’s power he may recapture the good again. The rediscovery of what it means to be fully human is found in the life of Jesus, whose human life is the new beginning for man. Hence, Jesus is the new Adam; in his model there is a new beginning that replaces the former pattern.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MansDestiny">Man’s Destiny</p>
<p class="fl">A biblical view of man must include a balanced statement respecting his divine origin, his rebellion against the grace of God, his judgment, and his prospect for redemption in the person of the Savior Jesus with the promise of eternal life. Man has a beginning and will live forever. This assertion is in stark contrast to naturalistic theories of origins and destinies. One of the most deceptive tendencies of modern thought is the concept “coming to terms with death.” People with no thought of God and no hope for eternity are encouraging each other to accept the inevitable decline and demise of their bodies as the natural end to human life. The biblical notion is that death in man is not natural at all.</p>
<p>Death is an acquired trait, not the natural destiny of man. Death may be said of the body but not of the spirit. The biblical teaching is that while the body dies and decays, the person lives on in hope of a renewed body. Those who have come to know Christ go to be with him when their bodies die (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>) and anticipate the resurrection of the body for eternal life to come (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-49">1 Cor 15:35-49</a>). Those who die apart from Christ do not cease to exist but rather are assigned an eternal existence of conscious knowledge that they are separated from God and have fallen short of their destiny to enjoy his presence forever. The biblical teaching on the destiny of the lost is quite unpalatable for modern man. Even Christians who have generally high views of biblical inspiration may find themselves blanching at the thought of eternal punishment of the wicked. Yet the biblical doctrine of the final judgment of the wicked is as well established as most teachings in the Bible.</p>
<p>One of the most dramatic truths in Scripture respecting the nature of man is to realize that it was for man that God initiated the salvation work that led to the incarnation of the eternal son of God. After his resurrection and ascension, the Lord Jesus Christ returned to his eternal position of glory and majesty in heaven, where he forever remains the God-man. As God, he shares all the attributes of the Father and the Holy Spirit, and as man, identifies with man. He reveals himself in a physical body, albeit the resurrection body, the firstfruits of the resurrection of all who are his. The incarnation, then, brought about an eternal change in deity. Only a very high view of the worth of man could have brought God to such a fundamental change in himself. As the writer to the Hebrews states, “Because God’s children are human beings—made of flesh and blood—Jesus also became flesh and blood by being born in human form” (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.14">Heb 2:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The final measure of our humanity is that man was made to worship God and to enjoy him forever. Such thoughts are not attributed to any other created being. Even the angels, who have maintained their perfect state and who worship the Father in conscious bliss, do not have quite the same relationship with God as do redeemed men (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.16">Heb 2:16</a>).</p>
<p>What is man? In Christ, man is all God means him to be, in majesty and dignity, and in joy before his throne forever.</p>

<p class="h1">MAN*, Natural</p>
<p class="fl">Expression occurring in <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span> mg). The adjective translated there by “natural” is also found in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">1 Corinthians 15:44</a> (twice), 46; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.15">James 3:15</a>; and <a href="?bref=Jude.1.19">Jude 1:19</a>. This adjective is related to the Greek noun usually translated “soul.” Its meaning, however, is primarily determined by its various contexts, particularly in 1 Corinthians, where all four occurrences are contrasted pointedly with “spiritual,” an adjective occurring frequently in the NT, mostly in Paul’s writings. In almost every instance it refers to the work of the Holy Spirit. Applied to things, “spiritual” means derived from, or produced by, the Holy Spirit (the law—<a href="?bref=Rom.7.14">Rom 7:14</a>; gifts—<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1">1 Cor 12:1</a>; blessings—<a href="?bref=Eph.1.3">Eph 1:3</a>; sacrifices—<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>). When it is applied to persons, it means indwelt, motivated, and directed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.15">1 Cor 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.37">14:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.1">Gal 6:1</a>). “Natural,” then, when contrasted with “spiritual,” generally describes what is devoid of or in opposition to the Holy Spirit and his work. In <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14-15">1 Corinthians 2:14-15</a> “natural man” is set over against “spiritual man” (see <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Within this context the natural man is one who does not accept the things that come from the spirit of God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.14">1 Cor 2:14</a>). Rather, these things are “foolishness” to him. He cannot understand them because they are “spiritually discerned.” This foolishness is the foolishness of unbelief (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.21">1:21</a>), and the discernment lacking is insight produced only by the Holy Spirit. Plainly, Paul has in view someone utterly without and even opposed to the Holy Spirit and God’s revealed truth.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44-46">1 Corinthians 15:44-46</a>, the contrast between spiritual and natural occurs in a different context—that of the “body” in death as compared to the “body” in resurrection. The body of the believer laid in the grave (“sown”) is a natural body (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">44</a>a). The body of the believer raised from the dead will be a spiritual body, that is, a body renewed and transformed by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.11">Rom 8:11</a>). In <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">1 Corinthians 15:44b</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">45a</a>, however, the natural body is traced back by appeal to <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a> to Adam before the fall, at Creation. This shows that biblically what is natural refers to the Creation. Originally, as created by God, the “natural” was “very good” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.31">Gn 1:31</a>) but subsequently it has been subjected to corruption and death by the sin of man. Therefore, the sinful rebellion of the natural man, measured by the original creation, is thoroughly unnatural and abnormal. The opposing work of the Holy Spirit now, in Christ, not only removes this abnormality but brings the original purposes of Creation to their consummation (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-22">Rom 8:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MAN, Old and New</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical terms used to describe the state of man in relation to Christ. Human beings are created in the image of God and are made to have fellowship with him (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-27">Gn 1:26-27</a>). God made known to Adam and Eve his will in a specific situation (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.15-17">2:15-17</a>), yet they used the freedom of their will to disobey God’s command (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-7">3:1-7</a>). So the human race is dead in sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Rom 5:12-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.1-3">Eph 2:1-3</a>). The sin of Adam and Eve has been passed on to all humanity (original sin). Born with the tendency toward sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.5">Ps 51:5</a>), as soon as the age of moral responsibility is reached, individuals begin to commit their own sins. Paul uses the term “old man” to refer to this condition. The old man can keep certain parts of the law and do various good things. But no old man can ever do enough good things to earn his own salvation. The old man must be made into a new man or he will suffer the consequences of his sin. Only God can bring about that radical change. Human beings can only accept by faith God’s gracious gift.</p>
<p>David, in <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Psalm 51</a>, cries out for God to take away the guilt of his sins. In verse <a href="?bref=Ps.51.10">10</a> he pleads, “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). God promises in <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.19">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.31">18:31</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.26">36:26</a> to give repentant sinners a new heart and a new spirit. In <a href="?bref=Rom.6.5-11">Romans 6:5-11</a> Paul shows how the old nature has been crucified with Christ, so he can conclude, “So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.11">6:11</a>). In <a href="?bref=Eph.4.22-24">Ephesians 4:22-24</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.3.9-10">Colossians 3:9-10</a> he shows the believer that he has put off the old man and put on the new man. Jesus speaks of this radical transformation as being born anew—not a second physical birth, as Nicodemus thought, but a spiritual birth (<a href="?bref=John.3.6">Jn 3:6</a>). Only the grace of God can change the old man into the new man. The old man accepts God’s gracious gift by faith, but even that faith is a gift of God (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.8">Eph 2:8</a>). The new man becomes a child of God. He does not immediately become perfect. He must fight against sin throughout this life as he strives to come closer and closer to the ideal of perfect holiness. He will attain that perfection only in the resurrection to come (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.42-45">1 Cor 15:42-45</a>), when all things are made new (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.5">Rv 21:5</a>).</p>

Jacob announced that Manasseh and Ephraim were to be considered his own, not Joseph’s sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.5-6">Gn 48:5-6</a>), and that Manasseh, the firstborn, would have descendants not quite as great as those of Ephraim (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.48.13-20">13-20</a>). This explains why Ephraim and Manasseh (in that order) provided their names for two of the 12 tribes of Israel but Joseph did not, at least in most listings (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.7.6">Rv 7:6</a>). Manasseh also founded the Manassite family (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.43">Dt 4:43</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.33">2 Kgs 10:33</a>).</p>

Thirteenth king of Judah (697–642 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Jesus’ ancestor (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.10">Mt 1:10</a>); notorious for his long and wicked reign, described in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1-26">2 Kings 21:1-26</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.1-20">2 Chronicles 33:1-20</a>.

His 55-year reign (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1">2 Kgs 21:1</a>) is dated from the beginning of his co-regency, so he ruled 11 years as co-regent and 44 years as sole king—longer than any other king in Judah or in Israel. Regrettably, he was the most wicked of all the Judean kings, even resorting to a series of murders, presumably to stay in power (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.16">21:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.4">24:4</a>). In addition to murder, among his sins listed in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.2-9">2 Kings 21:2-9</a> are rebuilding the high places for pagan worship; encouraging Baal, sun, moon, and star worship; and burning his son as a child sacrifice (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.6">21:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.10">23:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.31">Jer 7:31</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text"><a href="?bref=2Chr.33.11-16">Second Chronicles 33:11-16</a> indicates that he was taken as a prisoner of war to Babylon, that he genuinely repented there, that God restored him as king, and that he tried to abolish his former pagan practices and to restore proper worship of God alone. Skepticism about this account is not warranted, even though unparalleled in 2 Kings. Surviving Assyrian records twice mention Manasseh, saying that he faithfully provided men to transport timber from Lebanon to Nineveh for the Assyrian king Esar-haddon (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>) and that he paid tribute to King Ashurbanipal (669–627 <span class="era">BC</span>) after an Assyrian military campaign in Egypt in 667 <span class="era">BC</span>. Though Pharaoh Neco’s similar captivity and release is mentioned, Manasseh’s is not.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Manasseh died in 642 <span class="era">BC</span>, at the age of 67, he was buried in his own garden (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.18">2 Kgs 21:18</a>), rather than with highly regarded kings like Jehoiada and Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.16">2 Chr 24:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.33">32:33</a>). His son Amon reverted to his father’s wicked practices, but reigned only two years (642–640 <span class="era">BC</span>) before being assassinated.

  <title>Manasseh, Tribe of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MANASSEH, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Geographically, the largest of the 12 tribes of Israel, and unique in having two territories, a half-tribe in each. Isolated from each other by the Jordan River valley, they developed separately. The half-tribe west of the Jordan was more important, both in OT and NT times, because it was the main tribe of the northern kingdom of Israel (931–722 <span class="era">BC</span>) and one of the main ancestral stocks of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EarlyHistory">Early History</p>
<p class="h3">Its Roots</p>
<p class="fl">Its families traced their origins back to Joseph’s elder son Manasseh, to Manasseh’s son Makir or grandson Gilead, or to later descendants such as Zelophehad and Jair. A fair harmony can be constructed from the biblical genealogical data in <a href="?bref=Gen.48.5-6">Gn 48:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.28-34">Nm 26:28-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.1-3">Jos 17:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.21-23">1 Chr 2:21-23</a>; and <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.14-19">7:14-19</a>, a text corrupted by several copyists’ errors. The mention of Asriel in <a href="?bref=1Chr.7.14">1 Chronicles 7:14</a> seems to be a copyist’s mistake; otherwise, the accounts are capable of being reconciled, even if each list preserved different data and none is complete in itself.</p>
<p class="h3">Its Size</p>
<p class="fl">One year after the exodus, Manasseh had the smallest army, according to Moses’ first census (<a href="?bref=Num.1.34-35">Nm 1:34-35</a>). On the eve of the conquest of Canaan, after wandering 38 years in the Sinai wilderness and then conquering Transjordan, it had the sixth largest fighting force, according to a second census (<a href="?bref=Num.26.28-34">Nm 26:28-34</a>)—52,700 men.</p>
<p class="h3">Its First Settlements</p>
<p class="fl">The soldiers of the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh settled their families in Gilead, which they captured under Moses’ leadership from the Amorite king Og (<a href="?bref=Num.21.32-35">Nm 21:32-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.32.39-42">32:39-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.1-15">Dt 3:1-15</a>). Then, under Joshua, they crossed the Jordan to help the other tribes conquer Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-32">Nm 32:1-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.1.12-18">Jos 1:12-18</a>). Subsequently, the western half-tribe received its allotment and began to settle in the central hill country (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.1-9">Jos 16:1-9</a>; ch <a href="?bref=Josh.17.1-18">17</a>). After the remaining tribes received their shares of land, the army from the eastern half-tribe returned home (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.1-9">22:1-9</a>). En route to their families in Gilead, they helped to build an altar by the Jordan River. This act was intended to preserve national unity, but it nearly started a civil war (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.22.10-34">10-34</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheEasternHalf-Tribe">The Eastern Half-Tribe</p>
<p class="h3">Its Territory</p>
<p class="fl">Moses allotted the eastern half-tribe nearly 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) of territory in three geographical regions (northern Gilead, Bashan, and Mt Hermon), but it succeeded in controlling only about 800 square miles (2,072 square kilometers)—the half of Gilead north of the Jabbok River (and south of the Yarmuk River)—despite successful initial conquests (<a href="?bref=Num.32.39-42">Nm 32:39-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.12-15">Dt 3:12-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.8-13">Jos 13:8-13</a>) and gradual northern expansion much later (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.23">1 Chr 5:23</a>).</p>
<p>The territory occupied was mostly a high plateau with a mountainous center. It was watered well by rains in winter and by a heavy dew in summer. Olive trees, grapevines, and wheat thrived, and goats and sheep could find adequate pasture on the eastern slopes, which merged gradually into the desert to the east.</p>
<p class="h3">People and Places</p>
<p class="fl">Prominent citizens of the eastern half-tribe included the “judges” Jair and Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.3-5">Jgs 10:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.6-12">11:6-12</a>) and David’s benefactor Barzillai (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.31-39">2 Sm 19:31-39</a>). Principal cities were Jabeth-gilead and Ramoth-gilead, a city of refuge and a Levitical city, respectively (originally in Gad—<a href="?bref=Josh.20.8">Jos 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.38">21:38</a>).</p>
<p>The eastern territory was usually called simply “the half-tribe of Manasseh,” until David (c. 1000–961 <span class="era">BC</span>) made it an administrative district (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.21">1 Chr 27:21</a>). Solomon (970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>) divided and incorporated it into two new districts (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.13-14">1 Kgs 4:13-14</a>). Under Jeroboam I (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>), it joined, on equal terms, with eight other tribes and with the western half-tribe, to form a confederacy of ten tribes—the northern kingdom of Israel—in 930 <span class="era">BC</span>. Syria and Assyria both held eastern Manasseh temporarily, in the ninth and eighth centuries <span class="era">BC</span> (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32-33">2 Kgs 10:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.7">13:7</a> with <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">14:25</a>; and <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a> with <a href="?bref=2Chr.34.6-7">2 Chr 34:6-7</a>). King Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) of Assyria invaded the area, conquered it, deported its people, and scattered them throughout his empire (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.26">1 Chr 5:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29">2 Kgs 15:29</a>) about ten years before the rest of the northern kingdom fell to the Assyrians in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. Most of the western Manassites who were left behind intermarried with the foreigners, began to worship pagan gods, and became ancestors of the Samaritans (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.24-41">2 Kgs 17:24-41</a>). Subsequently, the region was known as Gilead. By NT times the region was partly in the Decapolis and partly in Perea.</p>

<p class="h1">MANGER</p>
<p class="fl">Feeding trough for domesticated animals. The Greek term for manger is found only four times in the NT. Three of these instances are in the Nativity narrative of Luke and are translated with the English word manger (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.7,12,16">Lk 2:7, 12, 16</a>). The fourth occurrence, also in Luke’s Gospel, is translated “manger” in the <span class="sc">rsv</span> and <span class="sc">neb</span>, but “stall” in <a href="?bref=Luke.13.15">13:15</a> in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>.</p>
<p>The most common OT equivalent is the Hebrew term translated “crib” or “stall” in <a href="?bref=Job.39.9">Job 39:9</a>, <a href="?bref=Pr.14.4">Proverbs 14:4</a>, and <a href="?bref=Isa.1.3">Isaiah 1:3</a>. The context of these passages favors the use of the Greek word for manger. In the Septuagint, however, three other Hebrew words are also translated by this same Greek term. They are the Hebrew terms for “a stall,” that is, an enclosure for animals (<a href="?bref=2Chr.32.28">2 Chr 32:28</a>); “a mash” or “fodder” (<a href="?bref=Job.6.5">Jb 6:5</a>); and “pens” or “stalls” (<a href="?bref=Hab.3.17">Hb 3:17</a>).</p>
<p>Through a study of modern Middle Eastern customs and biblical archaeology, two possible locations of the stable and manger area have been determined. In the home of a poor family, the stable was generally a room adjacent to and slightly lower than the living quarters. The stone manger was either located against one of the wooden walls of the stable or carved from a natural outcropping of rock. The other possible location of the stable was in a cave near the house or in the limestone foundation beneath the living quarters of the house. An example of the first of these was found at the ancient site of Megiddo. At Lachish a cave (c. 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>), which seems to have been used as a stable, was discovered beneath the remains of a building.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the manger area in which Jesus was born was a cave stable; it is over such a cave that the present Church of the Nativity was erected. However, the evidence recorded in Luke’s Gospel could as easily refer to an area adjacent to a house. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=JesusChristTeachingsof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jesus Christ, Life and Teachings of</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Miraculous food the Lord provided for the Israelites in the desert. It originally appeared in the form of thin flakes, like frost on the ground, around the Israelite camp (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.14-15">Ex 16:14-15</a>). It is compared elsewhere with coriander seed and bdellium, or resin (<a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Nm 11:7</a>). Its taste is said to have been like that of honey or of fresh oil (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.31">Ex 16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.8">Nm 11:8</a>). Since the experience of taste and color is somewhat subjective, these descriptions do not necessarily conflict. The word comes from the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">man</span><span class="ital">,</span> which means, “what?” When the Israelites saw the manna, they asked, “What is it?” (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.15">Ex 16:15</a>).</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to link manna with substances discovered by modern travelers in Sinai and Arabia. In early summer (June–July) the tamarisk tree in these regions exudes a sweet-tasting liquid, produced as the result of the activity of a tiny insect. This liquid falls to the ground, where it forms small grains that disappear when the sun gets hot. Reference also has been made to an edible lichen that in parts of southwest Asia is used instead of grain in years of famine. But the regularity, periodicity, and abundance of the manna cannot be explained on any but miraculous grounds. The Israelites were to gather it for one day at a time. Anything collected above that measure was subject to spoiling (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.20">16:20</a>). Only the Sabbath day was an exception to that rule. Manna was no longer provided after Israel entered Canaan (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.12">Jos 5:12</a>). When Israel craved other food besides manna, the people were punished with an excess of quail (<a href="?bref=Num.11.4-6,18-20">Nm 11:4-6, 18-20</a>). In poetic literature it was called “the grain of heaven” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.24">Ps 78:24</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.105.40">105:40</a>), and “the bread of angels” (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.25">78:25</a>). Jesus pointed to himself as the true manna, the bread from heaven, which, when eaten, would nourish man unto life everlasting (cf. <a href="?bref=John.6.25-59">Jn 6:25-59</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MARANATHA*</p>
<p class="fl">Aramaic expression used by Paul in <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.22">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>, meaning either “Our Lord, come!” or “Our Lord has come.”</p>
<p>Quite certainly the use of <span class="ital">maranatha</span> (cf. <span class="ital">amen</span> and <span class="ital">abba</span>) originated in the worship services of early Jewish Christians whose mother tongue was Aramaic. Since Paul wrote in the Greek language, he needed to transliterate (writing the Aramaic phrase with Greek letters), a process that sometimes creates ambiguities. In addition, words were not written separately in ancient documents. Therefore, since <span class="ital">maranatha</span> consists of two words, it can be analyzed in different ways.</p>
<p>Most scholars agree that the first word in the phrase is <span class="ital">maran</span> or <span class="ital">marana,</span> meaning “Lord,” or more probably “our Lord,” and that the second word represents the Aramaic verb “to come.” This verb, however, may be taken either as a prayer (imperative <span class="ital">tha</span> or <span class="ital">etha,</span> “come!”) or as a statement (perfect tense <span class="ital">atha</span> “has come”). Five different interpretations are then possible: (1) If the words are considered as a prayer, Paul is praying for either Jesus’ spiritual presence, with possible reference to the Lord’s Supper, or (2) Jesus’ second coming. As a statement, the expression may refer to the Incarnation; it may be translated (3, 4) “Our Lord is present,” either with reference to the Lord’s Supper or to Jesus’ more general promise in <a href="?bref=Matt.18.20">Matthew 18:20</a>; or (5) it may be translated “Our Lord is coming” (the so-called “prophetic perfect,” although some prominent Aramaic scholars argue that this is not really possible).</p>
<p>In support of rendering the expression as a statement (“our Lord has come”) is the fact that the Syriac (a form of Aramaic) version translates the verb in the perfect tense; further, the early church fathers usually interpreted it the same way. A majority of scholars, however, believe that such an interpretation does not fit the context well. Further, if the phrase is understood as a prayer, it can be related to other passages (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.5">Phil 4:5b</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.7">1 Pt 4:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.22.20">Rv 22:20b</a>, which may be a translation of <span class="ital">maranatha</span>).</p>
<p>The fact that <span class="ital">maranatha</span> occurs immediately after Paul’s imprecatory curse (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.22">1 Cor 16:22</a>) has led many to the view that the Aramaic expression is part of the curse itself. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> rendering (“let him be Anathema Maran-atha”) leaves the impression that the two words are a unit, whereas <span class="greek">anathema</span> is a Greek word meaning “curse” and probably ends the sentence. It is nevertheless quite possible, some modern scholars believe, to relate <span class="ital">maranatha</span> very closely to the curse, since the prayer for Jesus to come in judgment reinforces the solemnity and reality of Paul’s imprecation. Interestingly, a church council in the seventh century anathematizes dissidents with the words “anathema maranatha, let him be condemned at the Lord’s coming.”</p>

<p class="h1">MARCION*, Gospel of</p>
<p class="fl">Heretical gospel of the early second century.</p>
<p>Marcion was a native of the Roman province of Pontus who went to Rome about <span class="era">AD</span> 138 and became the founder of a sect called the Marcionites. He seems to have been a member of the Roman church for a time before he went off into heresy. The basic tenet of this later heretical position was that there existed a radical difference between the Old Testament and the New, between the law of the Old and the love and grace of the New, and between the creator God of the Old and the Christian God of the New. For him the God of the Old Testament was the author of evil, which he associated with matter and the world in general, while the God of the New was our Father and the giver of everything good.</p>
<p>This being his belief, Marcion set out to establish for himself a canon of Scripture to support it. This canon included his gospel, which was the Gospel according to Luke, purified of anything connected with the Old Testament, the Jews, the creation of this sinful material world, and anything that related to a true humanity for our Lord. As Irenaeus writes in <span class="ital">Against Heresies</span> (1.17.2), “Besides this, he [Marcion] mutilates the Gospel which is according to Luke, removing all that is written respecting the generation of the Lord, and setting aside a great deal of the teaching of the Lord, in which the Lord is recorded as most clearly confessing that the Maker of this universe is His Father.” Irenaeus goes on to say, “In like manner, too, he dismembered the Epistles of Paul, removing all that is said by the apostle respecting that God who made the world, to the effect that He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and also those passages from the prophetical writings which the apostle quotes, in order to teach us that they announced beforehand the coming of the Lord.” In summary, Marcion’s canon consisted of his gospel, which was a mutilated copy of Luke, and 10 of the Pauline epistles (excluding the Pastoral Epistles).</p>

<p>At Israel’s occupation of Canaan, Mareshah was allotted by Joshua to Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.44">Jos 15:44</a>). Later, at the division of the kingdom, Rehoboam fortified it as a protective outpost covering Jerusalem from the southwest, from which many invaders were to approach (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.8">2 Chr 11:8</a>).

<p class="h1">MARI*</p>
<p class="fl">Influential city-state, located in eastern Syria, which became important in the early second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. It seems to have been settled by Semitic nomads, who adopted the values of city dwellers and progressed so far as to adapt cuneiform to their own Akkadian language.</p>
<p>The importance of this cosmopolitan city, which was an outpost of Sumerian civilization, is highlighted by the fact that it became the capital of an empire extending over a great part of northern Mesopotamia, about 22 miles (35.4 kilometers) along the Euphrates River.</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations at Mari yielded a monumental discovery: archives containing over 20,000 documents. These records virtually rewrite the history of western Asia. In addition to the tablets, a well-preserved palace was also unearthed. Original mural paintings were still intact, as were some kitchen and bath installations. These artifacts and tablets shed a great deal of light on life during the period from 1810 to 1760 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>As one viewed Mari from a distance, a great defensive wall was seen that encircled the city, protecting it from invading forces. One prominent structure rose portentously above the town, probably to an approximate height of 150 feet (45.6 meters). This was the ziggurat, a temple tower built in a lofty pyramidal structure with successive stages. One ascended its heights by means of outside staircases, which led to the shrine at the top. There were smaller temples at its base.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="MariTabletSideFrontAndBack"/>
<p>Not far away, the royal palace commanded about six acres (2.4 hectares) of land. The palace was constructed of extremely thick walls made of brick covered with clay, rising to a height of 16 feet (4.9 meters). An elaborate drainage system was also discovered that effectively carried away rainwater through its bitumen-lined clay pipes, some 30 feet (9.1 meters) underground. The palace at Mari contained nearly 300 rooms. It was not only the royal residence but also the center of business, diplomatic services, and military leadership. It even had room to store merchants’ goods and military equipment, such as battering rams and siege towers. The royal court enjoyed such foods as fish, meat, four varieties of bread, cucumbers, peas, beans, garlic, dates, grapes, and figs. Beverages were beer and wine. The religious observances involved sacrifices and temple prostitution, which was common in the ancient Near East.</p>
<p>The clay tablets of the archives reveal a great deal about the everyday life of the people. Some of the records are bilingual, some literary, but most deal with a period between Jahdun-Lim of Hana, the founder of Mari, to the decline under Zimri-Liom, his son. The recovered information at Mari reveals that the king held court every day, listening to officials and ambassadors presenting affairs of state. He also was called upon to settle certain serious legal disputes. The state religion demanded the daily participation of the king, who visited the temples, officiated at rituals, sacrificed animals, reported to the gods, and attended religious feasts, and who was sometimes considered divine. The king also was responsible for regulating the calendar, which necessitated an extra month every three years.</p>
<p>The commercial and economic records indicate that there were metalworkers, weavers, fullers, gem cutters, jewelers, painters, perfume makers, boatmen, carpenters, leather workers, fishermen, potters, and masons. Payment for services rendered was largely made in goods, though sometimes in gold or silver. Such commodity payments were corn, wool, clothing, wine, or oil.</p>

<p class="h2" id="AuthorDateProvenance">Author, Date, Provenance</p>
<p class="fl">Our most ancient testimony about who wrote the second Gospel comes from Papias (c. 60–130), author of several expositions of Jesus’ teachings, in which he reports various traditions from “the Elder John” (possibly to be identified with the apostle John, although this is by no means certain). At one point Papias states, “The Elder used to say this also: Mark became Peter’s interpreter and wrote down accurately, though not in order, all that [Peter] remembered concerning the things both said and done by the Lord.” (This quotation was preserved by the fourth-century writer Eusebius of Caesarea in his <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span> 3.39.15.) One need not doubt the basic reliability of this statement. Mark—almost surely to be identified with the John Mark of <a href="?bref=Acts.12.12">Acts 12:12</a> (see also <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Pt 5:13</a>)—was a disciple of Peter, and the second Gospel owes its existence, at least in part, to the apostle’s reminiscences. It does not follow, however, that one has adequately characterized Mark’s work if that is all one says. For instance, Papias’s qualification, “though not in order,” indicates that Mark did not intend to write a chronological biography. Furthermore, Papias goes on to comment (according to one interpretation of his ambiguous words) that Mark (or Peter?) adapted the material to the teaching situation and that therefore Mark is absolved from any (implied) charges of inaccuracy. It appears that from the earliest times Christians appealed to the purposes and circumstances of Mark’s writing in order to account for difficulties in harmonizing the material found in the various Gospels.</p>
<p>Other statements from Christian writers in the second, third, and fourth centuries seem dependent on Papias’s testimony, but some additional data they provide may possess independent value. For example, a fairly early document (date uncertain) known as the Anti-Marcionite Prologue asserts that Mark wrote his Gospel somewhere in Italy after Peter’s death (in the mid-60s), and this testimony is considered reliable by many scholars. Still, the possibility that Mark composed his work before Peter’s martyrdom cannot be ruled out completely.</p>
<p>Papias says nothing specific about <span class="ital">when</span> the Gospel was written. A small minority of scholars date Mark shortly after <span class="era">AD</span> 70. Another minority suggest a date in the 40s or 50s on the basis of a papyrus fragment discovered in Qumran called 7Q5. (According to José O’Callaghan, the fragment, which has been dated about <span class="era">AD</span> 50–68, should be identified as <a href="?bref=Mark.6.52-53">Mark 6:52-53</a>.) This fragment contains only 20 letters on one side, making the Markan reconstruction very uncertain. Few scholars are convinced that the text is Mark; some think it is part of 1 Enoch or Zechariah. An impressive majority of scholars date Mark in the 60s, with conservatives usually preferring the early years of the decade. Why this preference? If the theory of Markan priority is accepted, then clearly Mark was written before Luke; and since Luke is normally dated by conservatives about <span class="era">AD</span> 62, Mark can be no later than <span class="era">AD</span> 60 or 61. This line of argument, though strong, is not decisive. In the first place, Luke cannot be dated with complete certainty. Second, the view that Matthew and Luke used Mark (the working assumption of most scholars) is only a hypothesis, and one that is vigorously opposed by some writers. Third, a tradition going back to the second century (see above) asserts that Mark wrote his Gospel <span class="ital">after</span> Peter’s death, no earlier than <span class="era">AD</span> 64. Fourth, one persuasive view regarding the occasion of this Gospel assumes that the Neronian persecution (<span class="era">AD</span> 64) had begun. (According to a different view of the occasion, Mark was written after the beginning of the Jewish revolt in <span class="era">AD</span> 66.) Therefore, while a date in the early 60s remains possible, it does not require committal.</p>
<p>With regard to the authorship of the second Gospel, there seems to be no compelling reason to deny Papias’s report that Mark (no doubt the John Mark of <a href="?bref=Acts.12.12">Acts 12:12</a>) took down Peter’s reminiscences and that these became the basis of his work. Some scholars argue that the Gospel contains geographical inaccuracies (e.g., we have no evidence of a region called Dalmanutha, <a href="?bref=Mark.8.10">Mk 8:10</a>) and that a native of Jerusalem such as Mark would have been more reliable in his information. However, the topographical problems in Mark, though real, need not be interpreted as inaccuracies (present ignorance of a place named Dalmanutha is hardly conclusive proof that it did not exist). Furthermore, in other respects (e.g., <a href="?bref=Mark.14.54,66">14:54, 66</a>) the Gospel reveals an impressive knowledge of local details. Many writers also point out bits of information that support a Petrine background, such as the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.30-31">1:30-31</a>). In short, the internal evidence, while falling short of proof, does not at all undermine the tradition preserved by Papias. A generation ago, the trustworthiness of Papias’s testimony was almost universally accepted. This situation has changed somewhat, but even those scholars who adopt a skeptical attitude toward this tradition concede that it <span class="ital">may</span> be true.</p>
<p>As attention turns to the provenance of the Gospel, the task becomes more difficult. Tradition going back to the second century asserts what may be already implied by Papias—namely, that Mark wrote his Gospel in Rome. Although some scholars have suggested other possibilities, such as Galilee and Antioch, these have not proved satisfactory. Mark did spend some time in Rome, and some characteristics in the Gospel (such as Latinisms in the Greek and the explanation of Jewish customs, as in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.3-4">7:3-4</a>), while proving nothing, are certainly consonant with a Roman origin. Furthermore, one persuasive view of the occasion that gave rise to the Gospel assumes a background of persecution in Rome.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Distinctives">Distinctives</p>
<p class="fl">A number of characteristics of Mark set it apart from the other Gospels. For example, a word usually translated “immediately” occurs more than 40 times in Mark and only a dozen times in the rest of the NT. While this feature could be interpreted as a simple “mannerism,” consonant with Mark’s unpretentious, colloquial style, it certainly adds to the rapid flow of his narrative, which, dwelling more on Jesus’ activity than on his discourses (in contrast to Matthew and Luke), shifts from scene to scene with hardly a pause. Since the Gospel is also quite brief (Luke is nearly twice as long), one may wonder whether the author intended for it to be read at a sitting; even if read aloud, this would take only about one and a half hours. At any rate, there can be little doubt that the work conveys a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Other characteristics, however, prove more significant. Someone unfamiliar with the story of Jesus who happened to read Mark for the first time would no doubt be taken aback by its rather abrupt beginning. After a brief clause that stands as a sort of title (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">1:1</a>), Mark moves on to describe in brief the ministry of John the Baptist. Then he introduces Jesus as coming from Nazareth without telling us anything whatever of his earlier life. Furthermore, over one-third of the book (including the so-called Passion narrative) is devoted to Jesus’ last week. These and other factors lend to the work a note of mystery, accentuated by the fact that at various points Mark calls attention to the fear or amazement gripping those who came in contact with Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.12">2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.41">4:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.15,33,42">5:15, 33, 42</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.51">6:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.6">9:6</a>; and several other passages, especially the strange words of <a href="?bref=Mark.10.32">10:32</a>). In addition, if one assumes that the Gospel originally ended with <a href="?bref=Mark.16.8">16:8</a>, Mark wished to leave his readers with the same sense of awe that the disciples experienced at Jesus’ resurrection.</p>
<p>But how does one account for this fear and amazement? Mark’s clear answer is that Jesus, though truly a man, is also divine. While Mark’s Gospel exhibits the humanity of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.41">1:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.5">3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.12">8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.14">10:14</a>), his chief emphasis is on the Lord’s deity. Indeed, Mark introduces his book by referring to Jesus as “the Son of God” (a phrase omitted in some manuscripts, however), a position that is recognized both by the demons (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.11">3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.7">5:7</a>) and by God himself (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">9:7</a>). What may well be the true climax of the Gospel occurs at <a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">15:39</a>, where Mark writes that a Gentile, a Roman centurion, upon hearing Jesus’ death cry, exclaimed, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”</p>
<p class="h2" id="Structure">Structure</p>
<p class="fl">The author organized his Gospel according to a simple plan. The first eight chapters summarize the nature of Christ’s public ministry by alternating stories that show his growing popularity with stories that stress the disapproval of the Jewish leaders. This first half of the book, while indicating some of the tensions created by Jesus’ coming, gives the basic impression of success and general optimism. A significant shift then strikes the reader toward the end of chapter <a href="?bref=Mark.8.1-38">8</a>, particularly beginning with verse <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">31</a>. At Caesarea Philippi, Peter has just confessed that Jesus is the Messiah, and now for the first time Jesus reveals that as Messiah he must die. The disciples become perplexed and discouraged and their pessimism mounts as this thought is brought home to them repeatedly (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.9,31">9:9, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.32-34">10:32-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.17-25">14:17-25</a>). In the end they desert their master (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.50">14:50</a>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, this pessimistic note is anticipated in the earlier part of the Gospel at three points: <a href="?bref=Mark.3.6">3:6</a> (Jesus’ enemies plot his death); <a href="?bref=Mark.6.6">6:6</a> (faithlessness in Nazareth); and <a href="?bref=Mark.8.21">8:21</a> (lack of understanding in the disciples). Some scholars suggest that Mark used these three verses to indicate the first three divisions of his book. In addition, other scholars note that two healings of blind men (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">8:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-52">10:46-52</a>) seem to provide the opening and the conclusion of a section that emphasizes the spiritual blindness of the disciples. One more structural clue is <a href="?bref=Mark.14.1">14:1</a>, which clearly marks out the final section of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="h2" id="OccasionPurposeTheology">Occasion, Purpose, Theology</p>
<p class="fl">A few scholars think that Mark may have been combating a heretical sect that stressed the miracles of Jesus and viewed him purely as a divine wonder-worker. Although this view has not gained acceptance as originally formulated, a number of writers do see the Gospel as a theological corrective. Ralph Martin, who links Mark very closely with Paul, suggests that the evangelist is opposing some heretical groups who have distorted Paul’s message by placing exclusive stress on Christ as a <span class="ital">heavenly</span> figure (cf. the views that Paul himself opposes in Colossians). Mark responds to these aberrations by emphasizing, in Martin’s words, “the paradox of Jesus’ earthly life in which suffering and vindication form a two-beat rhythm.” Even if one decides that this reconstruction, too, is rather speculative, one may nevertheless retain certain elements in it as valid.</p>
<p>Other scholars, such as H. Kee, place emphasis on the apocalyptic background of Mark. Kee and others tie this element to the Jewish revolt of <span class="era">AD</span> 66, but commitment to this particular historical connection is unnecessary to appreciate the great significance of <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mark 13</a> (Jesus’ apocalyptic discourse) for those original readers of the Gospel who may have been undergoing persecution.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most satisfactory reconstruction links this Gospel to the Neronian persecution in the mid-60s. Mark, for example, is the only Gospel that records that Jesus, after being driven to the wilderness, found himself in the company of wild animals (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.13">1:13</a>). This detail, according to William Lane, “was filled with special significance for those called to enter the arena where they stood helpless in the presence of wild beasts.” This interpretation, while not without difficulties, has the advantage of accounting for most of the available data. First, it is compatible with the strong tradition that assigns the origin of Mark’s work to Rome. Second, Mark speaks distinctly to those suffering persecution by introducing them quickly to John’s imprisonment and several other details. Third, related to this is Mark’s emphasis on discipleship. Christians facing persecution must have been tempted to relax the standards (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.17-19">4:17-19</a>). Fourth, given this general situation, one can hardly doubt the significance of our Lord’s apocalyptic message in chapter <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">13</a>, intended to encourage the disciples in the midst of their trials by reminding them of the glory to follow. Finally, Mark’s clear concern for the Gentile mission fits in with the needs of pagan Rome. The suffering Christians cannot afford to forget the unbelieving society in which they live. In the light of this particular responsibility, Mark assures his readers of what even the Roman centurion began to recognize—surely Jesus <span class="ital">is</span> the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">15:39</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The development of Mark’s narrative can be presented in six major divisions within a twofold structure:</p>
<p class="list-0">Introduction (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1-13">1:1-13</a>)</p>
<p class="list-0">Part I: Popularity and Opposition (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-8.21">1:14–8:21</a>)</p>
<p class="list-1">1. Jesus’ authority and the Pharisees’ enmity (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-3.6">1:14–3:6</a>)</p>
<p class="list-1">2. The people’s response (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-6.6">3:7–6:6a</a>)</p>
<p class="list-1">3. The disciples’ misunderstanding (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.6b-8.21">6:6b–8:21</a>)</p>
<p class="list-0">Part II: Darkness and Death (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-15.47">8:22–15:47</a>)</p>

<p class="list-1">6. The Passion narrative (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.1-15.47">14:1–15:47</a>)</p>
<p class="list-1">Conclusion (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1-8">16:1-8</a>)</p>
<p class="sp">Although one can hardly claim that this outline corresponds exactly to the author’s original plan (Mark may not have consciously worked out a detailed outline), the sixfold division provides a useful starting point for an interpretive summary of the contents.</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus’ Authority and the Pharisees’ Enmity (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-3.6">1:14–3:6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Immediately after the introductory portion (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.1-13">1:1-13</a>), which describes John the Baptist’s ministry as well as Jesus’ baptism and temptation, Mark opens the body of the work with a summary statement (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.1.14-15">14-15</a>). In these two verses he seems to suggest that Jesus’ public ministry, characterized by the proclamation that God’s kingdom is about to be inaugurated, was occasioned by John’s imprisonment. This is followed by the call of the first disciples (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">16-20</a>) and then by a complex of stories (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.1.21-38">21-38</a>), all of which report incidents that took place in Capernaum, apparently within a 24-hour period: synagogue instruction followed by the healing of a demoniac; the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law; numerous other healings in the evening; prayer in a lonely place. The statement that Jesus proceeded to expand his ministry throughout the province of Galilee (v <a href="?bref=Mark.1.39">39</a>) is followed by the story of a leper’s cure (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.1.40-45">40-45</a>). Next are found a very important group of incidents (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.1-3.6">2:1–3:6</a>), all of them focusing on Jesus’ conflicts with Jewish leaders: the healing and forgiveness of a paralytic; the call of Levi, whose dinner (attended by Jesus as well as by the hated tax gatherers) occasioned some disputes, particularly on the issue of fasting; and two significant stories regarding proper behavior on the Sabbath.</p>
<p class="h3">The People’s Response (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-6.6">3:7–6:6a</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Mark opens this second section as he opened the first: a summary statement (Jesus’ healings by the lake—<a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-12">3:7-12</a>) followed by the official appointment of 12 apostles (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.3.13-19">13-19</a>). Then follows a section that focuses on the kinds of charges brought against Jesus by his own family and by the scribes (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.3.20-22">20-22</a>), leading to a response touching on Satan, on blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, and on what constitutes true membership in his family (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.3.23-35">23-35</a>). Most of chapter <a href="?bref=Mark.4.1-41">4</a> is devoted to Jesus’ parables of the kingdom—the sower, the seed growing secretly, the mustard seed—and includes statements on the nature and purpose of his teachings (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.10-12,21-25,33-34">4:10-12, 21-25, 33-34</a>). In the evening Jesus and his disciples set out to cross the Sea of Galilee, leading to the stilling of the storm (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-41">35-41</a>), the healing of the Gerasene demoniac on the other side of the lake (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.1-20">5:1-20</a>), and, on their return to Capernaum, the healing of a hemorrhaging woman and the raising of Jairus’s daughter (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.5.21-43">21-43</a>). The section concludes with Jesus’ visit to his hometown, Nazareth, and the rejection he suffered there (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.1-6">6:1-6a</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Disciples’ Misunderstanding (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.6b-8.21">6:6b–8:21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The third section begins with two introductory passages: the sending out of the 12 (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.6b-13">6:6b-13</a>) and the story of John the Baptist’s death (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.6.14-29">14-29</a>). When the disciples return, Jesus determines to seek some rest, but the crowds follow them; Jesus then teaches and feeds the 5,000 (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.6.30-44">30-44</a>) and, after crossing the lake (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.6.45-52">45-52</a>, which includes Jesus’ walk over the water), he performs numerous cures in and around Gennesaret (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.6.53-56">53-56</a>). Then follows a controversy with the Pharisees regarding the hand-washing ritual (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-8">7:1-8</a>), and this incident leads to Christ’s assertion of the authority of God’s word over human tradition (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.7.9-13">9-13</a>) and to some general instructions on true purity (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.7.14-23">14-23</a>). The next several stories describe Jesus’ withdrawal from Galilee, first to Tyre, where a gentile woman’s daughter is healed (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.7.24-30">24-30</a>), then to the Decapolis, where he cures a deaf-mute (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.7.31-37">31-37</a>) and feeds a crowd of four thousand (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.1-10">8:1-10</a>). The demand of the Pharisees for a sign (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.8.11-12">11-12</a>) leads to Jesus’ warning against the “leaven” of the Pharisees, a statement misunderstood by the disciples (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.8.13-21">13-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Messiah’s Mission and the Disciples’ Blindness (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-10.52">8:22–10:52</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Still away from Galilee, but now in the nearby town of Bethsaida, Jesus heals a blind man (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.22-26">8:22-26</a>). He then leads his disciples north toward Caesarea Philippi, which sets the stage for Peter’s confession (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-30">27-30</a>). This recognition on the part of the disciples (of whom Peter is in effect a representative) leads Jesus to prophesy his death, but Peter’s refusal to accept the prophecy calls forth a rebuke and instruction on discipleship (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.8.31-38">31-38</a>). The failure of the disciples to understand the necessity of Christ’s death provides the background for the Transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.1-8">9:1-8</a>), which assures Peter, John, and James that God’s kingdom will indeed come (note v <a href="?bref=Mark.9.1">1</a>); further, the Father himself enjoins them to believe Jesus’ prophecy (v <a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">7</a>). After some words about the resurrection and about the coming of Elijah (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.9.9-13">9-13</a>), Mark relates the healing of a demoniac boy (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.9.14-29">14-29</a>). Back in Galilee, a second prophecy of Jesus’ death (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.9.30-32">30-32</a>) is followed, sadly, by a trivial discussion among the disciples as to who is the greatest (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.9.33-37">33-37</a>). Appropriately, one finds some further instructions concerning discipleship (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.9.38-50">38-50</a>). Mark next writes that Jesus left Galilee for the last time and began his journey toward the south. During this journey, Jesus delivered teachings on divorce and on the spiritual privileges of children (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.1-16">10:1-16</a>), then met the rich young ruler (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.17-22">17-22</a>), an incident that leads to further words on discipleship (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.23-31">23-31</a>). A third prophecy of Jesus’ death (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.32-34">32-34</a>) is again followed by selfish behavior on the part of the disciples, in this case an ambitious request from James and John (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-40">35-40</a>). The incident produces indignation among the rest of the disciples, thus necessitating another rebuke from their master, who himself came to serve and to die (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.41-45">41-45</a>). The section ends as it began—by reporting the cure of a blind man, Bartimaeus of Jericho in this story (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-52">46-52</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Final Ministry (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.1-13.37">11:1–13:37</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section seems naturally to divide into three balanced subsections. The first one (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.1-26">11:1-26</a>) includes three events: the Triumphal Entry, the withering of the fig tree, and the cleansing of the temple. The second subsection (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.27-12.44">11:27–12:44</a>) is particularly important, for here is found Jesus’ final series of controversies with the Jewish leaders. The topics covered are the source of Jesus’ authority (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.27-33">11:27-33</a>), the parable of the wicked husbandmen (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.1-12">12:1-12</a>), the legitimacy of Caesar’s tax (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.12.13-17">13-17</a>), the Sadducees’ denial of resurrection (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.12.18-27">18-27</a>), the chief commandment (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.12.28-34">28-34</a>), and the question regarding David’s son (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.12.35-37">35-37</a>). This subsection ends with a warning against the scribes and with the story of the widow’s mite (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.12.38-44">38-44</a>). The third subsection (ch <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">13</a>) is devoted completely to the Olivet discourse, with its prophecies of destruction, calamities, persecutions, deceivers, and final vindication. The discourse ends with various admonitions to keep alert.</p>
<p class="h3">The Passion Narrative (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.1-15.47">14:1–15:47</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This final section, which is introduced by a report of the priests’ plot (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.1-2">14:1-2</a>), may be divided into two subsections. The first one relates the events leading up to Jesus’ trial (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-52">3-52</a>). They include the anointing of Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9">3-9</a>), Judas’s betrayal (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.10-11">10-11</a>), the incidents connected with the Last Supper (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.12-31">12-31</a>), the scene at Gethsemane (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32-42">32-42</a>), and the arrest (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.43-52">43-52</a>). The second subsection relates Jesus’ trial before the Jews (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.53-65">53-65</a>), Peter’s denials (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.66-72">66-72</a>), the trial before Pilate (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.1-15">15:1-15</a>), the crucifixion (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.15.16-41">16-41</a>), and the burial (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.15.42-47">42-47</a>).</p>
<p>The Gospel concludes somewhat mysteriously, but no less triumphantly, with the news that Jesus has risen from the dead (<a href="?bref=Mark.16.1-8">16:1-8</a>). The earliest surviving Greek manuscripts, usually regarded as the most reliable, end at verse <a href="?bref=Mark.16.8">8</a>; the majority of manuscripts, however, include an additional 12 verses that report Jesus’ appearances to his disciples.</p>

  <title>Mark, John</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MARK, John</p>
<p class="fl">Cousin of Barnabas; companion to both Paul and Peter; author of the second Gospel.</p>
<p>A member of a Jewish family in Jerusalem who were early believers in Jesus Christ, John Mark had both a Jewish and a Roman name. The Roman name Mark was perhaps a badge of Roman citizenship, as in Paul’s case, or was adopted when he left Jerusalem to serve the gentile church in Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">Acts 12:25</a>). When an angel of the Lord freed Peter from prison, the apostle went directly to “the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.12.12">12</a>, <span class="sc">nrsv</span>). This house, described as having an outer gate, being of adequate size to accommodate a gathering of many believers and served by a slave named Rhoda (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.12.12-13">12-13</a>), was obviously the dwelling of a wealthy family. By the time of this event (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 44), Mark may have already been converted through the personal influence of Peter (<a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Pt 5:13</a>). The fact that he was chosen to accompany Barnabas and Saul (Paul) to Antioch indicates that Mark was held in high esteem by the church in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">Acts 12:25</a>).</p>
<p>John Mark accompanied Barnabas and Saul to assist them on their evangelistic expedition (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.5">Acts 13:5</a>). He soon left the apostles, however, and returned to Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). Scripture does not reveal the cause of this desertion. Perhaps the rigors and hardships of the journey overwhelmed the young man. Another possible explanation was that at Paphos, shortly into the journey, Paul stepped to the front as leader and spokesman (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). Thereafter, Acts (with the natural exception of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.12,25">15:12, 25</a>) speaks of Paul and Barnabas rather than Barnabas and Paul. Perhaps it offended Mark to see his kinsman Barnabas, who had preceded Paul in the faith (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.36-37">4:36-37</a>) and had ushered him into the apostles’ fellowship (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.27">9:27</a>), take second place in the work of the gospel. But there may have been a deeper and more significant cause for Mark’s withdrawal. Like Paul, Mark was “a Hebrew born of Hebrews” (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>, <span class="sc">nrsv</span>). Because of this, Mark may have objected to Paul’s offer of salvation to the Gentiles based only on faith without the prerequisite of keeping the Jewish law. It is noteworthy that the Bible uses only the Hebrew name John when recording Mark’s presence on the gospel journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.5">Acts 13:5</a>) and his departure at Perga in Pamphylia (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). Also important is the fact that John Mark returned, not to the gentile church in Antioch, the site of his former service, but to the Jewish church in Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13">13</a>). Luke’s history records that “the disagreement [between Paul and Barnabas over Mark] became so sharp that they parted company” (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39">Acts 15:39</a>, <span class="sc">nrsv</span>). Nothing stirred Paul’s feelings more than the question of justification by faith, and Barnabas had demonstrated his weakness on this point (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.13">Gal 2:13</a>). Therefore, it may have been the cause of their separation: Barnabas and Mark to Cyprus, and Paul and Silas into Asia Minor to strengthen the new churches (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39-41">Acts 15:39-41</a>).</p>
<p>About 11 years pass before Mark again appears in the biblical record. In <a href="?bref=Col.4.10">Colossians 4:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Philemon 1:24</a>, he is in Rome with “Paul the aged,” who is there as “a prisoner of Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.19">Phlm 1:19</a>). The fracture had been healed, such that Paul says that Mark and others are “the only ones of the circumcision [the Jews] among my co-workers for the kingdom of God” (<a href="?bref=Col.4.11">Col 4:11</a>, <span class="sc">nrsv</span>). Paul, in his last epistle, pays Mark his final tribute. He tells Timothy, “Do your best to come to me soon. . . . Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.9,11">2 Tm 4:9, 11</a>, <span class="sc">nrsv</span>). Although all had deserted Paul in his trial before Caesar Nero (v <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.16">16</a>), Mark, who in his youth had also deserted the apostle, traveled from Ephesus to Rome, endeavoring to come to the beloved Paul with Timothy.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.13">1 Peter 5:13</a>, the apostle Peter sent Mark’s greeting along with that of the church in Babylon (signifying Rome), indicating Mark’s close relationship with the apostle to the circumcision (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>). The most important and reliable extrascriptural tradition concerning Mark is that he was the close attendant of Peter. The early church fathers said this association produced the Gospel of Mark, inasmuch as Mark took account of Peter’s teachings about Jesus and then used them to shape his Gospel, perhaps written in Rome between <span class="era">AD</span> 60 and 68.</p>

<p class="h1">MARKET, MARKETPLACE</p>
<p class="fl">Place for the buying and selling of goods in antiquity. Generally, the marketplaces of the ancient Near East would be much like the open air bazaars one can still see in any city throughout Israel, Greece, and Turkey.</p>
<p>The marketplace of NT times known as the <span class="greek">agora</span> was a place for buying and selling goods (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.4">Mk 7:4</a>); a place for children to play (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.16">Mt 11:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.32">Lk 7:32</a>); a place for idlers and for men seeking work (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.3">Mt 20:3</a>); a place where public events, including healings, occurred (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.56">Mk 6:56</a>); the center of public life and debate (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.17">Acts 17:17</a>); and a place where trials were held (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.19">16:19</a>).</p>

  <title>Mark of God*, Mark of the Beast</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MARK OF GOD*, MARK OF THE BEAST</p>
<p class="fl">Ensignia placed on people either by God or by the Antichrist. Though the phrase is limited to the book of Revelation, a mark was used in <a href="?bref=Ezek.9.4-6">Ezekiel 9:4-6</a>. In his vision Ezekiel saw the inhabitants of Jerusalem slain for their wickedness, except those upon whose foreheads God had put a mark. The mark was one of identification for the purpose of protection.</p>
<p>The usage in the book of Revelation is quite similar. The idea begins in <a href="?bref=Rev.7.3">Revelation 7:3</a> (though the word does not occur here), where the 144,000 servants of God are sealed on their foreheads to protect them from the coming wrath of God. This sealing is referred to again in <a href="?bref=Rev.9.4">Revelation 9:4</a>, where it is noted that the demonic locusts of the fifth trumpet are not to harm those with the seal of God.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-18">Revelation 13</a> the specific phrase “the mark of the beast” is used. The context is John’s vision of the two beasts. The one from the sea (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.1-10">13:1-10</a>) symbolizes the Antichrist with political power over the inhabitants of the earth. The beast from the earth (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.13.11-18">11-18</a>) symbolizes the Antichrist’s assistant, which is the religious leadership dedicated to securing universal worship of the Antichrist. This false religious leader causes all to receive upon their right hand or their forehead the mark (of the Antichrist), or the name (cf. v <a href="?bref=Rev.13.12">12</a>), or the number of the name of the antichrist (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.13.16-17">16-17</a>). This mark of the beast is necessary for a person to engage in business or economic transactions involved in physical survival. Perhaps it also serves to identify such people for martyrdom (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.13.7-10">7-10</a>). It stands in sharp contrast to the seal of God marking out the servants of God in chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-8">7:1-8</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1">14:1</a>). Thus mankind as depicted in this vision is divided into two classes—those belonging to Christ and those belonging to the Antichrist.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rev.13.18">Revelation 13:18</a> contains a challenge to the church to have wisdom and to recognize what that mark or number of the beast is. Two things are stated. First, it is of a man or refers to a man. Second, his number is 666 (or 616, according to some manuscripts).</p>
<p>The interpretation of this number has been discussed at length by biblical scholars without reaching a general consensus. Many think that it was a first-century cryptic (Hebrew) reference to Nero. In that context of preliminary fulfillment, it would have simply been an appeal for Christians to recognize the true nature of the godless Nero as having the character of Antichrist and to refuse to give him their allegiance. Perhaps this identity indicates that the number or mark of the beast is an expression of one’s allegiance to the Antichrist as expressed in the cult of emperor worship. Thus it would be this activity of worship and not a literal number on one’s body that is intended.</p>
<p>When the prophecy is completely fulfilled by the Antichrist, believers must be wise and refuse to give their loyalty to him through whatever form or test of allegiance this takes.</p>
<p>The importance of believers’ steadfastness is shown in <a href="?bref=Rev.14.1-20">Revelation 14</a>, where the faithful 144,000, with the name of Christ and God on their foreheads, are seen standing victoriously with the Lamb on Mt Zion. This steadfastness is spoken of as keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.12">14:12</a>). A similar vision of those who overcome the beast is given in <a href="?bref=Rev.15.2-4">15:2-4</a>. Here they are pictured as standing before God singing the song of Moses and the song of the Lamb.</p>
<p>There are four further references in Revelation to the mark of the beast. The angel warns that those who receive the mark of the beast and worship him will drink the cup of God’s wrath (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.9-11">14:9-11</a>). When the first angel pours out the first bowl of wrath, this falls on those who have the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image (<a href="?bref=Rev.16.2">16:2</a>). At the destruction of the beast and the false prophet, the latter is described as deceiving those who received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.20">19:20</a>). Finally, those who reign with Christ during the millennium are those who did not worship the beast or receive his mark (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.4">20:4</a>).</p>
<p>In summary, the phrase “mark of the beast,” or the number 666, is a way of referring to the identity of the followers of the Antichrist in the book of Revelation. Believers are warned not to become a part of those who are deceived but rather to remain steadfast and faithful to the Lamb and to own his name upon their foreheads.</p>

<p class="h1">MARRIAGE, MARRIAGE CUSTOMS</p>
<p class="fl">The joining together of male and female in matrimony, as practiced by various cultures.</p>
<p>The idea of marriage was ordained by God in his instruction to Adam that a man should leave his father and mother, and that he and his wife should be as one flesh (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>). </p>
<p>Several forms of marriage are referred to in the OT, the earliest of which seems to be based on a matrilineal principle. Although there appears to be some evidence for this in the middle Bronze Age and in the early monarchy, it is difficult to be certain about the matter, despite the importance in Egypt, and perhaps elsewhere, of the role of the mother in determining descent.</p>
<p>Generally, the bride left her parents when she married and went to live with her husband’s clan, as Rebekah did (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.58-59">Gn 24:58-59</a>). The phrase “to marry a wife” is from a root meaning to “become master” (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.13">Dt 21:13</a>), and the wife frequently treated her husband as, and referred to him as, master.</p>
<p>Hebrew genealogical lists indicate that descent was reckoned through the male line (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.10">Gn 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.9-43">36:9-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.1.1-15">Nm 1:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.18-22">Ru 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-9">1 Chr 1:1-9</a>). The important right of naming a child, indicating power and authority over that child, was exercised almost equally between father and mother in biblical references (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.4.1,25-26">Gn 4:1, 25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.5.29">5:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.18">35:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.20">1 Sm 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.21">4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.3">Is 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.1.4-9">Hos 1:4-9</a>). Sons were frequently named after their fathers and were identified with them.</p>
<p>The father was the authority figure in the home in a patriarchal society. His wife and children were regarded as his possessions in somewhat the same way as his fields and livestock (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.21">Dt 5:21</a>). He had the right to sell his daughters (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.7">Ex 21:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.5.5">Neh 5:5</a>), and even had the power of life and death over his children.</p>
<p>The ease with which a man could terminate a marriage by divorcing his wife also shows the measure of his authority in the family (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.1-4">Dt 24:1-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.22.13-21">22:13-21</a>).</p>
<p>A levirate marriage was instituted to preserve a family name and inheritance. When a man died, the responsibility for maintaining his widow and any children that she might have fell upon her husband’s closest male relative. The order of responsibility is set out in <a href="?bref=Deut.25.5-10">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. Normally, the brother of the deceased husband living with the clan was expected to enter into a levirate marriage with the widow. If she was childless, the firstborn of the new marriage was regarded as a child of the deceased. Levirate marriage was also known to the Canaanites, Assyrians, and Hittites.</p>
<p>The most familiar levirate situation in the OT, although not conforming strictly to the law of <a href="?bref=Deut.25.1-19">Deuteronomy 25</a>, is described in the book of Ruth. It was essential for Ruth to find some close male relative to marry her so that the family name and property could be preserved. The closest male relative declined the responsibility, feeling that it was a double imposition, first, to have to purchase the land and support Ruth, and second, to know that the first son would be regarded as her dead husband’s child, bearing his name and inheriting the land. Boaz agreed to undertake the responsibility (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.20-4.10">Ru 2:20–4:10</a>).</p>
<p>Despite numerous examples of polygamy cited in the OT, there is no doubt that the vast majority of the Israelites were monogamous. There are no examples given of large polygamous marriages in the families of commoners.</p>
<p>The original instruction to Adam was that a “man . . . cleaves to his wife” (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>). Hebrew laws generally imply that a marriage with one wife is the most acceptable form of marriage (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.21.5">21:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.18.8,16-20">Lv 18:8, 16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.10">20:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.5.12">Nm 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.21">Dt 5:21</a>). Although this seems to have become the norm by the time of the monarchy, a king such as Solomon did not follow Hebrew traditions in this matter. In the postexilic period marriages were predominantly monogamous, although they were being terminated increasingly by divorce. In the NT period monogamy seems to have been the rule, although persons such as Herod the Great were polygamous. Christ taught that marriage should last the lifetime of the partners, and if a man divorced his wife and married another woman during his previous spouse’s lifetime, he committed adultery (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.31-32">Mt 5:31-32</a>).</p>
<p>Marriage generally took place with those who were close to the immediate family circle, and it was imperative, therefore, that limits on acceptable consanguinity should be imposed. In patriarchal times a man could marry his half sister on his father’s side (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.12">Gn 20:12</a>), and this continued to be the case even under David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.13">2 Sm 13:13</a>), although it was specifically forbidden in <a href="?bref=Lev.20.17">Leviticus 20:17</a>. As there is some contradiction between the marriage laws of Deuteronomy and those in the Law of Holiness (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5">Dt 25:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.18.16">Lv 18:16</a>), it is possible that there was some modification of the stricter Levitical regulations. Marriages between cousins, such as Isaac with Rebekah, and Jacob with Rachel and Leah, were common. When a close relative was interested in marriage, it was almost impossible to refuse (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.6.13">Tb 6:13</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.7.11-12">7:11-12</a>). Moses was the offspring of a marriage between nephew and aunt (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.20">Ex 6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.59">Nm 26:59</a>), which would have been forbidden in <a href="?bref=Lev.18.12-13">Leviticus 18:12-13</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.20.19">20:19</a>, as would Jacob’s marriage with two sisters at the same time (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.30">Gn 29:30</a>).</p>
<p>When the Israelites settled in Canaan, many of them married Canaanite women, much to the consternation of those who desired to maintain the purity of the Hebrew religion (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.4">1 Kgs 11:4</a>). Such intermarriage was prohibited under Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.15-16">Ex 34:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.3-4">Dt 7:3-4</a>), although many Israelites ignored these regulations and continued to indulge in mixed marriages. If a woman was captured in war and was prepared to abandon her native country, an exception could be made (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.10-14">Dt 21:10-14</a>). By contrast, Samson married a Philistine woman who remained with her own people, but who received conjugal visits from her husband periodically (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.8-15.2">Jgs 14:8–15:2</a>).</p>
<p>The danger of intermarriage affecting the purity of Hebrew religion was considered so great that in the postexilic period wholesale divorce was ordered where Jews had married foreign wives (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.2">Ezr 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.3,16-17">10:3, 16-17</a>). The intent was that the national religion should remain pure, even though homes and families were destroyed. Even in NT times, Paul denounced marriage with non-Christians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-15">2 Cor 6:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate at what age young people married. A boy was considered to be a man by his early teens, and late in Jewish tradition this transition was celebrated by the bar mitzvah, which generally occurred when the boy was 13.</p>
<p>Normally the young man’s parents chose the bride. The resulting discussion about the marriage occurred between the groom’s parents and the bride’s parents, and often neither of the young people was consulted. It was not essential for the eldest in the family to be married first (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.26">Gn 29:26</a>). When Abraham decided that Isaac should be married, a servant was sent to choose a bride from among Abraham’s relatives in Mesopotamia. The servant made contact with the bride’s brother and mother (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.33-53">24:33-53</a>), and it was only afterward that Rebekah was asked to give her consent (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.24.57-58">57-58</a>). Her father was possibly incapacitated; otherwise, it would have been unlikely that her consent would have been asked at all.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why the average young man would not have been able to afford more than one wife was the practice of the bride-price, which had to be paid to the bride’s father. It was possible to substitute service for the bride-price (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.15-30">Gn 29:15-30</a>), or the completion of an appointed task (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.25-27">1 Sm 18:25-27</a>). A specific sum is mentioned for the bride-price in the case of a virgin who had been raped and who had to be purchased by her seducer. The price was set at 50 shekels, but this was considered to be a punishment; it is probable that the normal amount was between 10 and 320 shekels (<a href="?bref=Lev.27.4-5">Lv 27:4-5</a>).</p>
<p>At the time of the second temple, a virgin bride was considered to be worth 50 shekels, and a widow or divorced woman about half that sum. During this period, a virgin bride was normally married in midweek so that, if her husband found her not to be a virgin, he could bring proof to the court the following day, which would still be in advance of the Sabbath. A widow or a divorced woman normally married on the equivalent of a Thursday, giving her a full day with her husband before the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Marriage was a covenant or alliance between two families. It thus united them, and by extending the kinship, the overall size of the group was increased. This was important in a society where responsibilities for relatives, however distant, were accepted unhesitatingly. The covenant concept also could have political overtones, as with the marriage between Solomon and the Egyptian princess (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1">1 Kgs 11:1</a>) or Ahab of Israel and Jezebel of Tyre (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">16:31</a>).</p>
<p>The sealing of the covenant included the transfer of gifts, which would establish the wealth and status of the donor and of the bride (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.12">Gn 34:12</a>). In the ancient Near East, the giving of a gift was thought to include a part of the donor, so that the giver was actually offering a portion of himself. The gift that sealed the covenant also established the donor’s authority over the bride.</p>
<p>The next stage in the marriage procedure was the betrothal. First mentioned in <a href="?bref=Exod.22.16">Exodus 22:16</a>, the term is used several times in Deuteronomy (<a href="?bref=Deut.20.7">Dt 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.23-24">22:23-24</a>). The betrothal had the legal status of a marriage (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.30">Dt 28:30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.14">2 Sm 3:14</a>), and anyone violating a betrothed virgin would be stoned, according to the law of Deuteronomy, for violating his neighbor’s “wife” (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.23-24">Dt 22:23-24</a>). The meaning of a betrothal involved taking possession, in a manner similar to that of receiving tribute. Nevertheless, there remained a distinction between betrothing a woman and taking her as a wife (<a href="?bref=Deut.20.7">20:7</a>). During the period of betrothal, the prospective groom was exempt from military service. It was assumed that the betrothal was a formal part of a permanent relationship (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18">Mt 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.27">Lk 1:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.5">2:5</a>).</p>
<p>A man who was to marry another’s daughter was already regarded as a son-in-law at the time of betrothal (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.14">Gn 19:14</a>). Mary, as Joseph’s betrothed, was actually considered his wife, although he did not have intercourse with her until after the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>The first biblical record of a wedding being celebrated by a feast is in the story of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.22">Gn 29:22</a>). There was no actual marriage contract recorded until its mention in the book of Tobit (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.7.12">Tb 7:12</a>). This contract was not considered valid until the couple had cohabited for a week (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.27">Gn 29:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.12,18">Jgs 14:12, 18</a>). When Samson left his bride before the end of the seven-day period, the bride’s parents considered the marriage void and gave her to another man (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.20">Jgs 14:20</a>).</p>
<p>The wedding was an occasion of great family rejoicing. The special clothing of the bride and groom (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.10">Is 61:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.9-13">Ez 16:9-13</a>) included for the bride a fine dress often adorned with jewels (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.14-15">Ps 45:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.10">Is 61:10</a>) and other ornaments, while the bridegroom had fine clothing and wore a diadem (<a href="?bref=Song.3.11">Sg 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.10">Is 61:10</a>). The bride wore a veil (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.65">Gn 24:65</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.3">Sg 4:3</a>), which was removed in the bridal chamber. This would account for Rebekah’s need to veil herself in the presence of Isaac, her fiancé (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.65">Gn 24:65</a>), and also for the ease with which Laban was able to replace Rachel with Leah on Jacob’s wedding night (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.23-25">29:23-25</a>).</p>
<p>Symbolic ceremonies may sometimes have been included as part of the betrothal or wedding ceremonies, such as Ruth’s request that Boaz spread his skirt over her to indicate that he was taking her to wife (<a href="?bref=Ruth.3.9">Ru 3:9</a>). Another ritual may have been the ceremonial removal of the bride’s girdle by the groom in the nuptial chamber, which was a room or tent specially prepared for the newly married couple. The marriage was normally consummated on the first night (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.23">Gn 29:23</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Tb.8.1">Tb 8:1</a>), and the stained linen would be retained as evidence of the bride’s virginity.</p>
<p>In a contrast to the elaborate procession and feasting of the marriage, divorce was simple. A man could divorce his wife if he found fault with her in any particular matter, and this right was not abolished until the 11th century <span class="era">AD</span>. Divorce was discouraged, however, and gradually the procedure became more complex, being hedged about with a number of deterrents.</p>
<p>As the laws regarding divorce became more complex, so the procedure became increasingly expensive. At a later time a lawyer, or sometimes a rabbi, would give advice, especially on such matters as the return of property rightly belonging to the bride or her family.</p>
<p>If a bride was found to have committed adultery, the husband was thought to be entitled to a divorce. This was also the case if he even suspected her of infidelity. He could also divorce his wife if he felt that she had violated normal morality, had become apostate, or had been less than efficient in the management of her household. If a woman refused her husband his conjugal rights for a period of at least one year, she could be divorced. Other grounds for divorcing a wife included insulting behavior to a husband or his relatives, contracting an incurable disease, or refusing to accompany her husband when he moved the domicile to a new area.</p>
<p>In general, the status of the wife was low. Despite the fact that she gave advice, managed the household, educated the young children, and worked alongside her husband when necessary, he was still her master, and her role was to obey. She was little more than a servant, although better than a slave, for she could not be sold even though she could be divorced.</p>
<p>In the frequent figurative uses of marriage in the OT, the Hebrew people and God are referred to in terms of bride and bridegroom (<a href="?bref=Isa.62.4-5">Is 62:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.2">Jer 2:2</a>). The desolation that is about to overtake Judah is contrasted by Jeremiah with the celebration of a wedding feast (<a href="?bref=Jer.7.34">Jer 7:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.9">16:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.10">25:10</a>). Figurative forms are used again in Hosea, where God rejects the relationship with his wife, Israel (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.2">Hos 2:2</a>), but is prepared to accept her again if she resumes her faithful practices (vv <a href="?bref=Hos.2.19-20">19-20</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, John the Baptist compares his sense of joy with that of a friend of the groom at a wedding (<a href="?bref=John.3.29">Jn 3:29</a>), while Jesus himself made reference to the wedding preparations in the parable of the wise and foolish virgins (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.1-12">Mt 25:1-12</a>). In the story of the marriage feast (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">22:1-14</a>) Christ mentions quite incidentally the fact that wedding robes were provided for the guests at such ceremonies. The theme of the Christian church as the bride of Christ occurs in such books as 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Revelation.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusTeachingsonMarriageandAdultery">Jesus’ Teachings on Marriage and Adultery</p>
<p class="fl">In the realm of civil law there are changes of emphasis in Jesus’ teaching over against the OT. For example, the OT did not regard infidelity by a husband as adultery against his wife. When challenged by the Jews, Jesus said that originally God had made one wife for a man; therefore, there should be no divorce (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.2-9">Mk 10:2-9</a>). Further, he stated if a man does divorce his wife and marry again, he “commits adultery against her” (v <a href="?bref=Mark.10.11">11</a>). Thus, Jesus made man and woman equal as regards adultery. An unfaithful husband is just as adulterous as an unfaithful wife. This revolutionary teaching struck the disciples as severe (see <a href="?bref=Matt.19.10">Mt 19:10</a>), but it illustrates what Jesus meant when he said their righteousness must be greater than that of the Jewish leaders (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">5:20</a>).</p>
<p>There is a slight difference in Matthew’s account of Jesus’ teaching, which has led some scholars to argue that Jesus was not quite as strict as the above summary suggests. According to <a href="?bref=Matt.19.9">Matthew 19:9</a>, a wife’s “unchastity” (probably some sexual misconduct) allows an aggrieved husband to divorce her and marry again. If this remark concluded the passage, this interpretation would be the simplest. However, from the context it is more likely that Jesus allowed innocent spouses to separate from their wives but not to remarry. This explains why the disciples were so shocked and why Jesus went on to speak about some who refuse to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.12">Mt 19:12</a>). This was also the way the church interpreted the passage for the first five centuries. They allowed Christians to separate but not to remarry (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.11">1 Cor 7:11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MARTHA</p>
<p class="fl">Sister of Mary and Lazarus, and friend of Jesus. Martha’s family lived in Bethany, a small town on the eastern slope of the Mt of Olives.</p>
<p>Luke gives an account of an incident concerning Martha when she was busy preparing and serving food while her sister, Mary, was listening to Jesus. Martha complained to Jesus that Mary was not helping her; Jesus corrected Martha gently: “My dear Martha, you are so upset over all these details! There is really only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it—and I won’t take it away from her” (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.41-42">Lk 10:41-42</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In saying this, Jesus challenged Martha’s anxiousness by pointing out that fellowship with him was life’s highest and most rewarding priority.</p>
<p>In John’s account of the death and resurrection of Lazarus, it is Martha who, upon Jesus’ arrival, goes out to meet him while Mary remains in the house (<a href="?bref=John.11.20">Jn 11:20</a>). Once again, Martha complains to Jesus, this time saying that if he had come earlier Lazarus would not have died (v <a href="?bref=John.11.21">21</a>). When Jesus replied that her brother would rise again, Martha naturally assumed that Jesus was speaking of the future resurrection. Jesus reassured Martha that he was the resurrection and the life and that she must trust in him (vv <a href="?bref=John.11.23-26">23-26</a>). Martha then confessed her belief that Jesus was the Christ (v <a href="?bref=John.11.27">27</a>). When Jesus asked that the tomb be opened, Martha protested that the smell would be unpleasant. Jesus replied firmly to her doubts, “Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” (v <a href="?bref=John.11.40">40</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus then proceeded to raise Lazarus from the dead.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=John.12.1-11">John 12:1-11</a> Martha is again serving a meal for Jesus and Lazarus; this time she does not protest Mary’s elaborate show of affection for Jesus.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">MARY</p>
<p class="fl">Popular feminine name among first-century Jews, borne by six (or seven) women in the NT.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Mary, the mother of Jesus. According to the infancy narratives of Matthew and Luke, Mary was a young Jewish virgin, probably from the tribe of Judah, who during her engagement to Joseph (of Davidic descent from the tribe of Judah) was discovered to be pregnant. This was due to her submission to the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-25">Mt 1:18-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-38">Lk 1:26-38</a>). The couple married and lived first in Nazareth of Galilee, then traveled to Bethlehem (Joseph’s hometown) for a census, where Jesus was born (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1">Mt 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Lk 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.4-5">2:4-5</a>). Matthew informs us that shortly after the birth the family had to flee to Egypt to escape Herod (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-14">Mt 2:13-14</a>). Later, the family resided again in Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.23">Mt 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.39">Lk 2:39</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">We have little other information about Mary. She was certainly a concerned mother (as her scolding of Jesus in <a href="?bref=Luke.2.48">Lk 2:48</a> shows), and she later had a high estimate of Jesus’ ability (as at the wedding in Cana, <a href="?bref=John.2.1-4">Jn 2:1-4</a>). She had several other sons and daughters to care for. She appeared at the foot of the cross, where Jesus asked “the beloved disciple” to care for her in her grief (<a href="?bref=John.19.25-27">Jn 19:25-27</a>). After the resurrection she and Jesus’ brothers were among the disciples who experienced the outpouring of the Spirit on Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.14">Acts 1:14</a>). No further mention is made of her.</p>
<p class="list-text">Mary’s song of praise, “The Magnificat” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Lk 1:46-55</a>) displays her sterling humility and trust in God’s will. She is truly “blessed among women” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.42">42</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph. This woman goes by several names, but in each account she appears among Jesus’ faithful female disciples, standing by the cross and witnessing the empty tomb. Matthew calls her “Mary the mother of James and Joseph” or just “the other Mary” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.56,61">27:56, 61</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.1">28:1</a>); Mark names her “Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses,” “Mary the mother of Joses,” or “Mary the mother of James” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.40,47">15:40, 47</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">16:1</a>); in John’s Gospel, she is “Mary wife of Clopas” (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">19:25</a>), though she may possibly be a separate Mary. Tradition has it that this Mary was Jesus’ aunt, as Clopas was Joseph’s brother (Eusebius’s <span class="ital">Ecclesiastical History</span> 3.11).</p>
<p class="list">3. Mary Magdalene. We know little about this woman other than that her name indicates that she was from Magdala in Galilee. Somewhere in Galilee she met Jesus, who cast seven demons out of her. She then joined the band of disciples and followed Jesus wherever he went (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.2">Lk 8:2</a>), ending up in Jerusalem at the foot of the cross when all the male disciples had fled (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mk 15:40</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>). She observed Jesus’ burial (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.47">Mk 15:47</a>) and witnessed the events surrounding the resurrection. <a href="?bref=Matt.28.1">Matthew 28:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mark 16:1</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.24.10">Luke 24:10</a> group her with the other women who went to the tomb. John says that she was the first among these women to discover the empty tomb, the first to report to the disciples, and the first to see the risen Christ as she lingered by the tomb after all the others had left (<a href="?bref=John.20.1-2,11-18">Jn 20:1-2, 11-18</a>). This faithful disciple, however, was not allowed to touch her Lord (v <a href="?bref=John.20.17">17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Mary of Bethany. This Judean Mary was the sister of Martha and Lazarus. We know three facts about her. First, she was such a devoted follower of Jesus that she neglected her household duties to listen to him (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">Lk 10:38-42</a>; Jesus approved this). Second, she was apparently upset with Jesus when he did not come to heal her brother before he died (<a href="?bref=John.11.20,28-33">Jn 11:20, 28-33</a>). Finally, before Jesus died, she anointed him with an expensive ointment while he feasted at her home in Bethany (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">Mt 26:6-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.3-9">Mk 14:3-9</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.1-8">Jn 12:1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Mary, mother of John Mark. This woman appears only once in Scripture (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.12">Acts 12:12</a>). Her house was the meeting place of the persecuted church. Since it was apparently large and she had servants, she was a wealthy woman, probably a widow (since no husband is mentioned). In her house the church prayed for Peter, and Peter came there after being released from prison. Her son John Mark accompanied Paul and probably Peter as well.</p>
<p class="list">6. Mary of Rome. In <a href="?bref=Rom.16.6">Romans 16:6</a> Paul greets a woman in Rome named simply “Mary, who has worked hard among you.” At some time she had been in Greece or Asia Minor, perhaps being expelled from Rome with Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>; c. <span class="era">AD</span> 49). While there she had met Paul, perhaps being converted by him, and had worked hard with him in his work of evangelism or caring for the church. By <span class="era">AD</span> 56 (a probable date for the book of Romans), she had returned to Rome. She was distinguished by the praise Paul heaped upon her and his other coworkers living in Rome.</p>

<p class="h1">MASADA*</p>
<p class="fl">Rock fortress on the western shore of the Dead Sea, opposite the Lisan, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) south of En-gedi where the Jewish Zealots made their last stand against the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 73. Today it is called in Arabic Qasr es-Sebbe, and in Hebrew, Metsada.</p>
<p>The rock rises some 1,400 feet (426.7 meters) above the Dead Sea, about 2,000 feet (609.6 meters) from north to south, and about 980 feet (298.7 meters) from east to west, with sheer cliffs on all sides. The top, which slopes gently toward the south and west, is almost flat, about 20 acres (8.1 hectares) in area, or the equivalent of about two large city blocks. It is situated about two miles (3.2 kilometers) west of the shore of the Dead Sea.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfMasada"/>
<p>According to Josephus (<span class="ital">Wars</span> 7.8-9), this almost impenetrable rock was first fortified by Jonathan the high priest, who gave it the name Masada (“mountain stronghold”). The “Jonathan” mentioned by Josephus, long the subject of scholarly debate, is probably to be identified as Alexander Janneus (103–40 <span class="era">BC</span>) on the basis of scores of coins found at Masada. It was Herod the Great who expended a great amount of effort to build and fortify the place, partly out of fear that the Jews might overthrow him and restore the former kings, and partly because he was afraid that Cleopatra would convince Antony to cut him off and give the kingdom of Judea to her.</p>
<p>Present knowledge of Herodian Masada comes not only from Josephus but also from the excavations of Yigael Yadin in 1963–65. The archaeological discoveries confirm many of the statements found in Josephus.</p>
<p>Herod installed his family at the stronghold during the period when he was in Rome to claim his kingdom (40–39 <span class="era">BC</span>). Subsequently, he built palaces, a Roman bath, storerooms, an elaborate water supply system, and a wall. The wall entirely surrounded the top of the rock, a length of 4,250 feet (1,295.4 meters), with 30 towers and 8 gates, and was of casemate construction—that is, it consisted of an outer and an inner wall, between which were about 110 rooms. The space between the walls was 13½ feet (4.1 meters). The water supply consisted of drains from the wadis in the west, designed to collect water in the rainy season, and 12 cisterns in two rows on the northwest side of the fortress, having a capacity of 10.5 million gallons (39.7 million liters). A three-tiered palace villa was built in a spectacular location on the northern end of the rock. Other palaces, administrative buildings, and storerooms were located on the top of the rock, at the northern end, at the western side, and in the central region toward the southern end. It is possible that Josephus is correct in reporting that crops were raised, since there was a layer of soil toward the southern end of the rock. The royal buildings contained fine mosaic floors and frescoed walls, and the bath was a typical Roman bath with a caldarium (hot or steam room), tepidarium (warm room), and frigidarium (cold room). The entire bath complex was 33 feet by 36 feet (10.1 by 11.0 meters) with walls six feet (1.8 meters) thick.</p>
<p>When the first Jewish revolt began in <span class="era">AD</span> 66, a number of Zealots led by Menahem took over Masada, which had been occupied by a small Roman garrison. The Zealots made a number of alterations, building a synagogue and two ritual baths and converting the palaces and administrative buildings into living quarters. Coins struck in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth years of the Jewish revolt (i.e., <span class="era">AD</span> 66–70) have been found, putting the date of occupation beyond question. Included in the discoveries were fragments of scrolls, including portions of Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, the Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach (Ecclesiasticus), the book of Jubilees, and a portion containing the words “the song of the sixth sabbath sacrifice on the ninth of the second month.” These words, and the calendar system used, connected the scroll with one found in cave 4 at Qumran. This led Yadin to conclude that some of the Qumran Essenes joined the Zealots in the revolt against Rome, bringing scrolls from Qumran with them to Masada.</p>
<p>After the destruction of Jerusalem (<span class="era">AD</span> 70), the Romans removed all pockets of Jewish resistance until only the fortress of Masada remained. When Flavius Silva became the Roman procurator, he determined to bring to an end the last of the revolt. The Zealots at Masada, 960 in number, according to Josephus, were led by Eleazar. Silva surrounded the stronghold with eight camps and a wall six feet (1.8 meters) thick and 11,400 feet (3,474.7 meters) long, with 12 towers at intervals of 240 to 300 feet (73.2 to 91.4 meters). The camps could hold about 9,000 troops, but it is estimated that Silva had about 15,000 men, including a large number of Jewish prisoners, to mount the siege. It seems obvious that his intent was to prevent a single Zealot from escaping to stir up a new revolt.</p>
<p>There were two routes to Masada, the “snake path” up the eastern side and a path on the western side. The snake path is tortuous and narrow, requiring about 50 minutes of dangerous climbing. The Zealots had amassed a supply of large boulders near the top, apparently expecting an attack at this point. Silva selected the western approach, ordering his soldiers to build an earthen ramp, about 180 feet (54.9 meters) in height, about 645 feet (196.6 meters) in length, and about the same width at the base as the length. It did not quite reach to the top of the fortress, ending about 60 feet (18.3 meters) below the casemate wall.</p>
<p>By means of a battering ram and missile catapult, Silva breached the wall, but the Zealots repaired it overnight with timbers and earth. Silva then burned the timbered repair. When Eleazar ben-Ya’ir saw that the Romans were about to capture Masada, he delivered a stirring speech, given at length (and probably with considerable imagination) in Josephus. Some excerpts may be quoted: “It is still in our power to die bravely, and in a state of freedom. . . . Let our wives die before they are abused, and our children before they have tasted of slavery; and after we have slain them, let us bestow that glorious benefit upon one another mutually, and preserve ourselves in freedom, as an excellent funeral monument for us. But first let us destroy our money and the fortress by fire . . . and let us spare nothing but our provisions, for they will be a testimonial when we are dead that we were not subdued for want of necessaries; but that, according to our original resolution, we have preferred death before slavery.”</p>
<p>There was reluctance to perform this mass suicide, and Eleazar had to follow the speech with a second, both shaming them and encouraging them. While he was still speaking, they cut him off and began the bloody work: “The husbands tenderly embraced their wives and took their children into their arms, and gave the longest parting kisses to them, with tears in their eyes.” Then the men killed their wives and children, and laid all their possessions in a heap and set fire to them. After that, they chose ten men by lot to slay the rest, “every one of whom laid himself down by his wife and children on the ground, and threw his arms about them, and they offered their necks” to those chosen to slay them. Finally, the ten remaining cast lots “that he whose lot it was should first kill the other nine, and after all, should kill himself.” Yadin tells of finding 11 ostraca (pottery sherds) each with a single name inscribed on it, which he suggests may have been the means used to select the one to put the others to death. One of the sherds bore the name “ben-Ya’ir,” quite likely that of Eleazar ben-Ya’ir.</p>
<p>The plan was carried out almost to the last detail. Two women, however, hid themselves and five children in one of the caverns. The Romans entered the fortress the next day, expecting to meet some kind of resistance, but all they found was silence and the ashes of a great fire, plus vast stores of food in the storehouses. The women who had hidden in the caverns told the story to the Romans.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">MASORA*, MASORETES*</p>
<p class="fl">Oral tradition concerning the pronunciation and accuracy of the Hebrew text of the OT, and the scholars who were responsible for putting those traditions into writing.</p>
<p>At the background of the work of the Masoretes lay the efforts of the Sopherim, or scribes, who, from about 400 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 200, tried to establish and maintain the true text of the OT. In connection with this effort they made a practice of counting the verses, words, and letters of each Bible book and appending this information in order to give future copyists some standard against which to check the accuracy of their copies. The traditional Hebrew text, called the Masoretic Text, achieved its standard form early in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>. It was based on and substantially agreed with a much earlier textual tradition, as the Dead Sea Scrolls demonstrate. But the text of the scribes or custodians of the Bible was still only consonantal; it had no vowels or accent marks.</p>
<p>The work of the Masoretes picked up where that of the Sopherim left off. They are called Masoretes because they preserved in writing the oral traditions (Masora) concerning the biblical text. These Jewish scholars lived primarily in Tiberias on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee during the period <span class="era">AD</span> 500 to 950. Most prominent among them were the learned Moses ben Asher and his son Aaron; the present text of the Hebrew Bible is based on a ben Asher text.</p>
<p>The Masoretes sought not only to determine the exact text handed down to them but to pass it on to future generations without change. To protect against copyists’ errors and alterations, they filled the side margins with all sorts of data concerning how often and where various words and phrases appearing in a given line of the text could be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>The special contribution of the Masoretes was to provide the text with vowels and accent marks. They achieved this with a system of dots and strokes. Their task was not to invent pronunciations but to pass on received or accepted pronunciations and to decide between debatable ones. Of course, the issue was not merely correct pronunciation, because a slight change in vowel pointing or pronunciation would, for instance, turn a noun into a participle.</p>
<p>As the Masoretes sought to vocalize, determine, and protect the true text, they had to engage in a certain amount of textual criticism. But their reverence for the text would not permit making changes in it, so they worked out an ingenious system of editorial notes. Where it appeared to them that a copyist’s error had occurred, they left the error written in the text (a <span class="ital">kethib</span> working—that which is written) but put vowel markings with it for a preferred wording (<span class="ital">qere</span>—that which is to be read) and inserted the consonants for that reading in the margin. They also indicated a limited number of words that probably should be omitted altogether.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting of the <span class="ital">qere</span> readings involved the pronunciation of God’s name. As early as the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Jews began to grow uneasy about pronouncing God’s covenant name, properly vocalized as Yahweh. So they substituted the vowel markings for Adonai (Lord), indicating that Adonai was to be uttered instead of Yahweh. This substitute vowel marking of the Masoretes has led to the modern pronunciation of Jehovah (using the vowels of Adonai).</p>
<p>The meticulous efforts of the Masoretes and the Sopherim before them resulted in a marvelously successful preservation of the OT text. What the Masoretes passed on to later centuries was meticulously copied by hand until the advent of the printing press. So it may be confidently asserted that, of ancient Near Eastern literature, the OT is unique in the degree of accuracy of preservation.</p>

He was a native of Jerusalem who settled in Modein and became the father of the nationalistic leaders, the Maccabeans, who led the Jewish revolt against the Syrians (167 <span class="era">BC</span>). In his attempt to wipe out Judaism and establish Hellenism, Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, outlawed Jewish sacrifices, built pagan altars (including one to Zeus in the temple), and executed anyone who possessed the law (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.1-49">1 Macc 2:1-49</a>). Mattathias ignited the revolt against this oppression when Greek officers set up a pagan altar at Modein and ordered that sacrifices be offered to heathen gods. Mattathias refused, killed the Jew who volunteered, killed the Greek officer, destroyed the altar, and fled to the hills with a band of followers. He led guerrilla warfare against the Syrians, continued to circumcise children, and made strenuous efforts to preserve the law. His motto was “Let everyone who is zealous for the law come after me.”</p>
<p class="list-text">He led the revolt for about a year and died, probably in 167 <span class="era">BC</span>. His last bequest to his sons was “Obey the ordinance of the law.” He was succeeded in military leadership by his son Judas, and the Hasmonean dynasty of priests were his descendants. He is remembered in special Hanukkah prayers because of his zeal in fighting for religious freedom.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">MATTHEW (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Alphaeus; a tax collector by occupation; chosen by Jesus to be one of the 12 apostles; credited with the authorship of the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p>Matthew is listed in each of the four rosters of the 12 (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Mt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mk 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Lk 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>). Aside from these lists, Matthew is mentioned only in the account of his calling (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.9">Mt 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.13-14">Mk 2:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27">Lk 5:27</a>). Before his apostolic call, the Gospels refer to Matthew as Levi (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mk 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27">Lk 5:27</a>; compare <a href="?bref=Matt.9.9">Mt 9:9</a>). The identity of Levi as Matthew is beyond all doubt. It is improbable that Matthew was the brother of James the Less whose father was also named Alphaeus (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Mt 10:3</a>), since this fact would have been mentioned in the record of Scripture, as it is in the cases of Peter and Andrew and the sons of Zebedee.</p>
<p>Matthew served King Herod Antipas in Capernaum of Galilee, collecting tariffs on goods passing on the road from Damascus to the Mediterranean Sea. To function in this capacity Matthew would have been an educated man, acquainted with the Greek language as well as the native Aramaic, thus qualifying him to write the Gospel of Matthew. As a tax collector, Matthew may have been a man of wealth, but this occupation also caused him to be despised by the Jews and to be considered among the lowest of people. The Pharisees consistently spoke of tax collectors in the same breath with sinners (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.19">Mt 11:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.16">Mk 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.34">Lk 7:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.1">15:1</a>).</p>
<p>Matthew was called while he was working at his tax booth. Jesus passed by on the road and said to him, “Follow me” (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mk 2:14</a>). Matthew left everything and did so (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.28">Lk 5:28</a>). Immediately he gave Jesus a great banquet at his house, and a large crowd of his fellow tax collectors and others were there to enjoy it. It was at this feast that the Pharisees and their scribes made the well-known complaint “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.30">Lk 5:30</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg).</p>
<p>It is not certain when Matthew was called, but it is probable that the first six disciples were present on that day, since the Pharisees complained to Christ’s disciples during Matthew’s feast. Unlike the first men Jesus called, Matthew was not originally a follower of John the Baptist.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Nowhere does the text of Matthew itself clearly identify the author. Yet, as did the ancient church, we may ascribe authorship to Matthew the apostle. He was otherwise known as Levi (see <a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mk 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27,29">Lk 5:27, 29</a>). Before Jesus called him, he was a tax collector (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-38">Mt 9:9ff</a>.). It is interesting to note that Matthew called himself a tax collector, while none of the other Gospel writers did. Perhaps he did this to show how great an ascendancy he had been granted when the Lord called him, for tax collectors were despised and considered the lowest of people. The Gospel itself bears the impress of one knowledgeable of currency, for the Gospel writer speaks quite specifically about a two-drachma tax (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.24">Mt 17:24</a>), a four-drachma coin (v <a href="?bref=Matt.17.27">27</a>), and the various talents (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.24">18:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.15-46">25:15ff</a>.).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateandProvenance">Date and Provenance</p>
<p class="fl">Scholars are divided about the date when Matthew was written primarily because there is still debate about which Gospel was first written: Matthew or Mark. If Mark was written before Matthew, then Matthew was very indebted to Mark for a great deal of material, and vice versa. Those who argue for Matthew’s priority do so on the basis that Matthew’s Gospel was (1) recognized in the early church as the first Gospel, (2) written to those who first needed a written account—the Jews, and (3) placed first in the NT canon. Whether it preceded or followed Mark, most scholars are certain that it was written before the destruction of Jerusalem (<span class="era">AD</span> 70) because the temple is spoken of as still standing (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.15">Mt 24:15</a>). Irenaeus indicated that Matthew wrote this Gospel while Peter and Paul were in Rome. This would make the time of writing in the 60s.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="h3">Apologetics</p>
<p class="fl">Matthew wrote to a community of Greek-speaking Jewish Christians, located in a center such as Antioch in Syria. The community was surrounded and beset by Jews hostile to the claims of Jesus and the Christian community.</p>
<p>Matthew wrote as a Jew for Jews. In Jesus of Nazareth, Matthew contends, the OT reached its appointed goal. Jesus is the Messiah of Israel’s expectation. In the opening chapter Matthew identifies him as “the son of David, the son of Abraham” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">1:1</a>), indeed as “God with us” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">23</a>). In later chapters Jesus is revealed as the Son of Man of <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Daniel 7</a> and the Suffering Servant of <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>. Throughout the book (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.22-27.10">Mt 1:22–27:10</a>) the events of Jesus’ life are represented as the “fulfillment” of OT prophecies. He comes to offer Israel salvation from sin (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">1:21</a>). Nevertheless, the Jews have rejected him as their Messiah, and have thus placed themselves in the most perilous position (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.20-24">11:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.33-46">21:33-46</a>). One explanation for Israel’s rejection of Jesus is the failure of the Jewish religious leadership to prepare the people for his coming. In the strongest language, Matthew denounces the teachers of the law and the Pharisees. They have forsaken the Word of God in favor of their own traditions (ch <a href="?bref=Matt.15.1-39">15</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Teaching the Church</p>
<p class="fl">Matthew also wrote as a Christian for Christians. He presents Jesus as a new Moses, indeed as Yahweh incarnate, expounding his own law for his people (ch <a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-48">5</a>), now newly constituted around his person under the leadership of the apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2-4">10:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18-19">16:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.8-10">23:8-10</a>). If the Christian church is to function properly, the teaching of the Messiah on a host of moral and spiritual issues must be taken with utmost seriousness (chs <a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">5–7</a>, <a href="?bref=Matt.18.1-35">18</a>). To aid this purpose, Matthew takes the form of a theological textbook or a handbook for the church, to instruct the people of God concerning the person and work of Jesus. That these teachings may be more readily and firmly grasped, Matthew presents them in a highly organized and memorable way. To facilitate the learning of the material, he arranges Jesus’ teachings in five major discourses (interlocked with narrative portions) in which teachings of the same kind are clustered together (e.g., ch <a href="?bref=Matt.10.1-42">10</a> consists of a charge to missionaries, and ch <a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-58">13</a> consists of seven parables of the kingdom). Matthew’s leading theological themes may be identified as the <span class="ital">Son</span> of God (Jesus is Yahweh incarnate, “God with us”), the <span class="ital">kingdom</span> of God (in Jesus, God is invading history to inaugurate his final rule), the <span class="ital">salvation</span> of God (as the servant-king, Jesus has come to “save his people from their sins,” <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">1:21</a>), and the <span class="ital">people</span> of God (Jesus has come to build his church, a redeemed community consisting of both Jews and Gentiles).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The Coming of the Savior (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-2.23">1:1–2:23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">His name reveals his mission: “Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">1:1</a>) means “Yahweh saves.” He is “the son of Abraham,” who comes to fulfill God’s ancient promises to Jews and Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>). He is “Christ [or Messiah],” the son of David (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>), who comes to inaugurate the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17">4:17</a>). More than that, as evidenced both by prophecy (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.22-23">1:22-23</a>) and by the nature of his conception (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-20">18-20</a>), he is “God with us”—now come to “save his people from their sins” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">21</a>). As the son of David, and in accord with prophecy, he is born in Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-6">2:1-6</a>). Drawn by the star of Israel’s Messiah (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Nm 24:17</a>), Gentiles come to worship him (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-12">Mt 2:1-12</a>). When Herod seeks to destroy him, Jesus finds sanctuary in a gentile land; God’s calling his Son from Egypt marks the beginning of a mighty saving work—nothing less than a new exodus under Jesus, the new Moses (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-20">13-20</a>). Having been born in the humblest of circumstances, Jesus now comes to live in Nazareth (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.2.21-23">21-23</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Beginnings of Ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.1-4.25">3:1–4:25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In face of the judgment that Jesus is about to execute (as evidence of the kingdom’s arrival), John the Baptist calls Israel to repentance (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.1-12">3:1-12</a>). Jesus’ submission to John’s baptism, and the voice from heaven, show him to be a King who serves his subjects by taking their sins upon himself (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.3.13-17">13-17</a>). Like Israel at the exodus, Jesus is led into the wilderness for a period of testing (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1">4:1</a>). When the devil seeks to turn him away both from God and from his appointed mission, Jesus gains victory by depending upon God and his Word (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.4.1-11">1-11</a>). Returning to Galilee, Jesus deliberately settles in territory with both Jewish and Gentile inhabitants (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.4.12-16">12-16</a>) and begins a ministry of preaching (like John, he calls for repentance in face of the dawning kingdom), teaching (he calls his first disciples), and healing (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.4.17-25">17-25</a>).</p>

<p class="h3">The Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">5:1–7:29</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Just as Moses ascended Sinai to receive God’s law for Israel, so Jesus—as both the new Moses and as God incarnate—ascends the mountain to set forth his instruction for the citizens of the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-2">5:1-2</a>). He begins with <span class="ital">gospel</span> (not law), declaring that God shall surely save those who—beset by sin—trust in God’s mercy, obey his commands, and long for him to establish his righteous rule in the earth (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">3-12</a>). Toward that end, disciples are a preservative (salt) and a witness (light) in a sinful society (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.5.13-16">13-16</a>). As the one who has come not to abolish the Law and the Prophets but to bring them to completion (i.e., to usher in the new age to which the OT pointed— v <a href="?bref=Matt.5.17">17</a>), Jesus calls his disciples to steadfast obedience to God’s law as now expounded by the Lawgiver himself (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.5.18-20">18-20</a>). God’s commands embrace inner desires as well as outward actions, must not be watered down or rationalized, and call for more radical obedience than ever before, now that the end has come (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.5.21-48">21-48</a>). In their giving, praying, and fasting, disciples are to combat hypocrisy by God-centeredness and self-forgetfulness (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.1-18">6:1-18</a>). The Lord’s Prayer (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.6.9-13">9-13</a>) calls upon God to honor his name by establishing his rule on earth, and to pardon, protect, and provide for his children. Given this prayer, and given the disciples’ God-centered view of reality (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.6.19-24">19-24</a>), there is no cause for anxiety (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.6.25-34">25-34</a>). Disciples must be discerning without being judgmental (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.1-6">7:1-6</a>), and depend on God for the power needed to love others (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.7-12">6:7-12</a>). Having completed his exposition of the law (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.21-7.12">5:21–7:12</a>), Jesus now calls would-be disciples to follow him (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.13-14">7:13-14</a>), warns against false teachers (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.7.15-20">15-20</a>), and insists that true disciples do God’s will (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.7.21-23">21-23</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Authority of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-9.38">8:1–9:38</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Having given his authority <span class="ital">verbal</span> expression in teaching (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.28-29">7:28-29</a>), Jesus now gives it <span class="ital">visible</span> expression in a series of healing miracles, again revealing himself as the servant of Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.17">8:17</a>). He heals a leper, a centurion’s servant, and a bleeding woman by his word (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-13">8:1-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.20-22">9:20-22</a>). His touch dispels a fever and raises a dead person (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.14-15">8:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.23-25">9:23-25</a>). A combination of word and touch cures the blind (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.27-31">9:27-31</a>). As “God with us,” Jesus calls for unqualified allegiance (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.18-22">8:18-22</a>). Though lacking even the natural protection enjoyed by animals (v <a href="?bref=Matt.8.20">20</a>), he demonstrates his sovereignty over the natural world—and thus his deity—by calming the storm (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.8.23-27">23-27</a>). In direct confrontations with demons, he shows his superiority over them (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.28-34">8:28-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.32-33">9:32-33</a>). Exercising God’s own authority, he declares sins forgiven (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.1-8">9:1-8</a>) and calls sinners to repentance and to discipleship (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-13">9-13</a>). Joy over the kingdom’s inauguration is mingled with longing for its consummation (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.9.14-17">14-17</a>). The summary of <a href="?bref=Matt.9.35-38">9:35-38</a> echoes <a href="?bref=Matt.4.23-25">4:23-25</a>, recalls chapters <a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">5–7</a>, and prepares for the next major discourse.</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus’ Charge to the Missionaries (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.1-42">10:1-42</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In response to the prayers that he has commanded, Christ now invests 12 disciples with apostolic authority and sends them out into his harvest field (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.37-10.4">9:37–10:4</a>). The discourse speaks both of the apostles’ immediate mission (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.5-15">10:5-15</a>) and of the church’s broader mission (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.10.16-42">16-42</a>). For now, the apostles are to concentrate on evangelizing Jews (v <a href="?bref=Matt.10.6">6</a>), in preparation for the mission to Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">28:19</a>). The “worthy” are those who welcome the apostles and their message; the “unworthy,” those who reject them (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.11-15">10:11-15</a>). In the broader mission, there is sure to be persecution (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.10.16-19,24-25">16-19, 24-25</a>), but this will actually aid the witness (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.10.17-23">17-23</a>). God will save his faithful missionaries (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.10.19-23">19-23</a>) but judge those who oppress them and who disown Christ (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.10.26-39">26-39</a>). A sure reward awaits both the herald and the recipient of the message (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.10.37-42">37-42</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Christ the Lord (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.1-12.50">11:1–12:50</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The judgment John predicted is already under way; one’s stand in the last judgment would be determined by his response to the words and works of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-6">11:2-6</a>). Like his herald, Jesus meets with widespread hostility and indifference (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.11.7-19">7-19</a>). Given the finality of the grace attending his ministry, those who reject him will suffer the severest judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.11.20-24">20-24</a>). Yet there are others—the lowly, the burdened, the teachable—who learn (by revelation from God the Father and God the Son) that the “Lord of heaven and earth” is also the “gentle and humble” God who comes to give rest to those who trust in him (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.11.25-30">25-30</a>). As the one who ushers in the new age (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.6">12:6</a>), Jesus claims that he is the Lord of the Sabbath (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-8">1-8</a>). True rest (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29">11:29</a>) comes to those who come to Jesus.</p>
<p>Viewing Jesus as the destroyer of the Sabbath, the Pharisees ascribe his miraculous powers to Satan (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.22-24">12:22-24</a>). On the contrary, says Jesus, the rule he is inaugurating is crushing Satan’s empire (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.12.25-29">25-29</a>). To reject this truth in the full awareness of what one is doing is to commit the unforgivable sin against the Holy Spirit (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.12.30-32">30-32</a>); the words of Jesus’ accusers expose them as persons destined for condemnation (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.12.33-37">33-37</a>). The requested sign from heaven will not be given. Jesus’ resurrection is the only sign they need.</p>
<p class="h3">The Parables of the Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-58">13:1-58</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This, the third of Matthew’s five great discourses, contains seven parables. In the parable of the sower, four kinds of soil—hard, shallow, cluttered, and fruitful—illustrate the various responses to Jesus’ preaching (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.3-9,18-23">13:3-9, 18-23</a>). As those who have received Jesus’ proclamation of the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17">4:17</a>), the disciples are given more light, but the crowds must accept that initial proclamation before further light is given (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.10-17,34-35">13:10-17, 34-35</a>). In both the parable of the weeds (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.13.24-30,36-43">24-30, 36-43</a>) and the parable of the net (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.13.47-50">47-50</a>), Jesus assures his disciples that the final judgment will separate true believers from false, and warns against hasty, premature judgments (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.7.1-5">7:1-5</a>). The parables of the mustard and the yeast (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.31-33">13:31-33</a>) contrast the smallness of the kingdom’s inauguration with the fullness of its consummation. The parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.13.44-46">44-46</a>) depict the kingdom as a value far surpassing all others (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">6:33</a>). Thus illuminated by Jesus, disciples have new treasures to add to their old (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.51-52">13:51-52</a>). The people of Nazareth, on the contrary, echo the crowds’ lack of understanding and the Pharisees’ hostility (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.13.53-58">53-58</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Spiritual Conflict (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-16.12">14:1–16:12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-12">14:1-12</a> the preaching of John exposes the weakness of Herod, and the beheading of John anticipates the crucifixion of Jesus (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.17.12">17:12</a>). The true king is not Herod but Jesus. He is sovereign over nature itself (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.13-36">14:13-36</a>)—God incarnate, “God with us,” who feeds the hungry multitude in the wilderness (as God once provided manna) and walks upon and calms the sea (see <a href="?bref=Ps.89.9">Ps 89:9</a>). Peter models Christians’ faith, fear, and utter dependence on Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.28-31">Mt 14:28-31</a>). The Pharisees and teachers of the law appear to worship God but in fact are devoted to their own traditions, which they offer not as supplements but as <span class="ital">rivals</span> to the Word of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.1-9">15:1-9</a>). In verses <a href="?bref=Matt.15.10-20">10-20</a> Jesus teaches both that ceremonial law apart from moral law becomes empty ritual, and that the old distinction between clean and unclean foods (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">Lv 11</a>) is now as obsolete as the distinction between Jews and Gentiles. To underscore the point, Jesus enters pagan territory, heals a Canaanite (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.21-28">15:21-28</a>) and feeds a Gentile multitude (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.15.29-39">29-39</a>). Pharisees and Sadducees, for all their differences, are united in their opposition to Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.1-12">16:1-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Coming Salvation (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-17.27">16:13–17:27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Going beyond the crowds’ respectful but inadequate estimates, Peter confesses Jesus to be “the Christ, the Son of the living God”—a recognition of Jesus’ deity granted by divine revelation (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-17">16:13-17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.11.25-26">11:25-26</a>). As it is God the Son who possesses and builds the church, Satan and death are victims rather than victors. Jesus will build his church on Peter’s confession that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The apostles’ prohibiting and granting entry into the church (“binding” and “loosing,” respectively) depends upon the prior decision of heaven (i.e., God’s revelation of apostolic teaching). In face of Peter’s confession and the persistent false notions of messiahship (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.20,23">16:20, 23</a>), Jesus now (for the first time) predicts his sufferings and coming glory (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.16.21-28">21-28</a>). In anticipation of that glory, Jesus is transfigured before certain disciples; Moses and Elijah join God the Father in bearing witness to the unique splendor of God the Son (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-8">17:1-8</a>). Jesus then demonstrated his power by combating demonic powers (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.17.14-18">14-18</a>) and exhibited his authority by choosing to pay the temple tax using miraculous means (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.17.24-27">24-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Greatness in the Kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.1-35">18:1-35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In this, the fourth of Matthew’s five great discourses, Jesus concentrates on the character and attitudes of church members. He calls upon his followers both to <span class="ital">become</span> and to <span class="ital">welcome</span> the lowliest (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.1-5">18:1-5</a>). Leaders especially are enjoined to deal harshly with themselves but gently with those under their care (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.18.6-9">6-9</a>). Remembering the Father’s love for sinners, Christians are to make every effort (both by prayer and by personal initiative) to restore offending brothers, with excommunication being the last resort (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.18.10-20">10-20</a>). Church members who really understand the Father’s amazing grace will never stop offering forgiveness and compassion to those who wrong them (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.18.21-35">21-35</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Instructions on the Way to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.1-20.34">19:1–20:34</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Given God’s creation ordinances, says Jesus, divorce itself is never <span class="ital">commanded;</span> it is only <span class="ital">permitted</span> in the case of sin—that is, where the marital bond has already been severed through infidelity (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.1-9">19:1-9</a>). As in <a href="?bref=Matt.5.17-48">5:17-48</a>, Jesus calls his followers to radical obedience (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.10-12">19:10-12</a>). Besides instructing disciples to become like children (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.1-4">18:1-4</a>), Jesus embraces children themselves with his love (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.13-15">19:13-15</a>). He appeals likewise to the rich young man (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.19.16-22">16-22</a>); but the man, while faithful to the commands about love of neighbor, is too bound by his wealth to give himself unreservedly to loving God. Yet those who abandon all to follow Jesus will receive wealth untold in the coming kingdom (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.19.27-30">27-30</a>). The basis for such blessings lies not in human merit but in the astonishing generosity of the gracious God (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.1-16">20:1-16</a>). None—not even the rich—are beyond the power of his grace. But God offers free salvation at great cost to himself (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.20.17-19">17-19</a>). Confronting competitiveness and ambition among his followers, Jesus teaches them that true greatness lies not in lording it over others but in serving them (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.20.20-34">20-34</a>), as shall be supremely demonstrated in his death as “a ransom for many” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">28</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Confrontations in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.1-22.46">21:1–22:46</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">As the Servant-King (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">3:17</a>), and as the Messiah destined for suffering (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16-21">16:16-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.28">20:28</a>), Jesus enters Jerusalem not upon a war horse but upon a donkey’s colt, for he purposes not to declare war on his enemies but to hand himself over to them—and thus achieve his triumph through defeat (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.1-11">21:1-11</a>). As Lord of the temple, he demands that its commerce be halted and that it become (as God ordained) a place of worship for everyone, including the sick, the young, and the alien (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12-17">21:12-17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.11.17">Mk 11:17</a>). He outwits those who refuse to acknowledge the heavenly source of his and John’s authority (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.23-27">Mt 21:23-27</a>). In dramatic and devastating fashion, first visibly (by cursing the fig tree—vv <a href="?bref=Matt.21.18-22">18-22</a>) and then verbally (in the three parables of <a href="?bref=Matt.21.28-22.14">21:28–22:14</a>), Jesus pronounces judgment upon those Jews who have refused to acknowledge him as Messiah and Son of God. Henceforth, the true people of God are those who believe in Jesus, whether Jews or Gentiles. He calls upon his people to pledge their supreme allegiance to God. In the resurrection what will matter most is one’s relationship to God (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.23-33">22:23-33</a>). Indeed, he who loves God with his whole being and his neighbor as himself has kept the two foundational commandments of the OT (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.22.34-40">34-40</a>). Henceforth, submitting to God means rightly recognizing Jesus; he is indeed David’s son (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>), but he is supremely David’s Lord—the exalted Son of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.41-46">22:41-46</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">16:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Woes upon the Scribes and Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-39">23:1-39</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Five reasons are stated for Jesus’ denunciation of the Jewish religious leaders. First is their hypocrisy: their practice contradicts their teaching (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-4">23:1-4</a>), their external purity conceals inner rottenness (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.23.25-28">25-28</a>), and they appear to champion God’s cause but are really enemies of God’s servants (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.23.29-36">29-36</a>). Second is the pride that prompts their hypocrisy (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5-12">23:5-12</a>). Third is their exploitation of, and their baleful influence upon, those under their charge (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.23.13-15">13-15</a>). Fourth is their preoccupation with the minutia of the law to the neglect of its weightier matters (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.23.16-24">16-24</a>). Fifth is their responsibility for the dreadful judgment that the whole nation is about to experience (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.23.33-39">33-39</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Coming of the End (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">24:1–25:46</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The introduction to this, the fifth and last of Matthew’s great discourses, makes it plain that there is the closest connection (for both Jesus and his disciples) between the coming destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the age (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-3">24:1-3</a>). Jesus first characterizes the time between his first advent and his return: there will be natural catastrophes, international warfare, the rise of false messiahs, the persecution of God’s people, and the universal proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.24.4-14">4-14</a>). Then Jesus speaks of the catastrophe that is soon to befall the Jewish nation in particular (as already foretold in <a href="?bref=Matt.22.7">22:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.38">23:38</a>), culminating in the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.15-25">24:15-25</a>). Sometime thereafter (but after an interval known only to God the Father—v <a href="?bref=Matt.24.36">36</a>), the Son of Man will return in great glory, amid apocalyptic signs, to gather his people (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.24.26-31">26-31</a>). The present generation will not pass away before judgment falls upon Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.24.15-25">15-25</a>), so let listeners take heed (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.24.32-35">32-35</a>). The same warning applies to the more remote coming of the Son of Man (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.24.36-51">36-51</a>): both the certainty of the event and the uncertainty of its time call for vigilance and faithfulness in the interval, for that event will bring both salvation and judgment. To drive the lesson home, Jesus tells the parables of the wise and foolish virgins (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.1-13">25:1-13</a>) and the talents (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.25.14-30">14-30</a>). The concluding parable of the sheep and the goats (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">31-46</a>) speaks of the urgent necessity of making the right response to the “brothers”—that is, the messengers—of Christ; those who feed, clothe, and otherwise care for the messengers of Christ thereby testify to their reception of the apostles’ message and their Lord (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.10.40-42">10:40-42</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Road to Golgotha (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.1-27.26">26:1–27:26</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">As though in response to Jesus’ own prediction, the chief priests and the elders hatch their murderous plot (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.1-5">26:1-5</a>), soon to be aided by Judas (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.14-16">14-16</a>). The anointing at Bethany (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">6-13</a>) testifies to the extravagance of love and the imminence of death. At the Passover meal (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.17-30">17-30</a>), signaling at what sacrifice the new exodus comes about (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.2.15">2:15</a>), Jesus interprets his forthcoming death as an atoning sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.26-28">26:26-28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">1:21</a>) and anticipates the day of final victory over sin and death in the consummated kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.29">26:29</a>). Jesus’ agony in Gethsemane (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.36-46">36-46</a>) expresses his horror over taking his people’s sins upon himself. By a stupendous act of filial obedience, he submits his will to the Father, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.54">26:54</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Is 53</a>). As the servant of God destined to suffer, Jesus resists attempts to thwart his arrest (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.47-56">26:47-56</a>). The Jews’ supreme court (the Sanhedrin) and their loftiest religious official (the high priest) condemn Jesus as a blasphemer because he dares to identify himself as “the Christ, the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.57-68">26:57-68</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">16:16</a>). As though joining the court’s repudiation, Peter—in fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.31-35">26:31-35</a>)—disclaims knowledge of Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.69-75">69-75</a>). Judas’s disillusionment finds expression in suicide (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-10">27:3-10</a>). The Jews hand Jesus over to Pilate the Roman governor (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.27.1-2">1-2</a>), he alone having the authority to pronounce the death sentence. Knowing that the charge of blasphemy will carry no weight with Pilate, the Jews now represent Jesus as a threat to Caesar. In the end, Pilate responds not to specific charges and evidence but to pressure from the crowd and the threat of riot (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.27.11-25">11-25</a>). He releases Barabbas and delivers Jesus to be crucified (v <a href="?bref=Matt.27.26">26</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Death of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.27-66">27:27-66</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Following his humiliating treatment at the hands of the Roman soldiers, Jesus is led to the place of execution; weakened by the beatings, he requires assistance (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.27-32">27:27-32</a>). He refuses the proffered narcotic so that he might keep his head clear (v <a href="?bref=Matt.27.34">34</a>). His being executed with malefactors (v <a href="?bref=Matt.27.38">38</a>) testifies to the purpose of his death (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">1:21</a>). A steady stream of abuse is hurled at him, in blasphemous disregard of the truth of the superscription “This is Jesus the King of the Jews” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.37-44">27:37-44</a>). Finally, out of the darkness Jesus utters the cry of dereliction; now is revealed the ultimate horror (that from which his soul shrank in Gethsemane), the sin-bearer’s supreme agony—the beloved Son’s abandonment by the Father (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.27.45-49">45-49</a>). Having cried out with a loud voice (cf. <a href="?bref=John.19.30">Jn 19:30</a>), Jesus dies (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.50">27:50</a>). Immediately, the saving effects of his death become evident (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.27.51-53">51-53</a>): sinners, now forgiven, have access to the holy God (the veil of the temple is rent asunder), and there is hope of resurrection for those who have died. As at the beginning (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-12">2:1-12</a>), Gentiles instead of Jews confess Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.54">27:54</a>; contrast <a href="?bref=Matt.26.63-65">26:63-65</a>). Joseph’s careful attentiveness to Jesus’ burial contrasts with the ongoing attempts of the chief priests and Pharisees to resist Jesus’ power (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.57-66">27:57-66</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Triumph of the Savior (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-20">28:1-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Amid great glory and power and joy, the Savior’s victory over death is announced and attested (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1-7">28:1-7</a>). The risen Jesus appears first to the women who stayed with him during his crucifixion (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.8-10">28:8-10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.61">27:61</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.1">28:1</a>). The Jews’ response to the guards’ report signals their growing desperation before irresistible reality (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.11-15">28:11-15</a>). Meeting with the 11 disciples on the mountain in Galilee (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.28.16-20">16-20</a>), Jesus, the new Moses, continues his instructions. He now reveals the evangelistic purpose for which Matthew has been preparing readers from the very threshold of his Gospel. The apostles are to disciple all peoples by baptizing them into the name of the triune God and by teaching them to obey all that Jesus has commanded. The apostles go forth in the assurance that Jesus—as the Lord—stands over them, and that Jesus—as Immanuel—stands with them until the very end of the age.</p>

<p>Shortly after Jesus’ ascension, Peter voiced the need for another apostle, the stipulations being that the candidate must have been a follower of Jesus from his baptism to his ascension and have been a witness to his resurrection. The assembly put forward two men who met these criteria: Joseph called Barsabbas, surnamed Justus, and Matthias. They then cast lots (some scholars believe they cast ballots). Whatever the method, Matthias was chosen. Later, the apostolate was widened to include others such as Paul, Andronicus, and Junias. Scripture never mentions Matthias again, though tradition says that he preached in Judea and was finally stoned to death by the Jews.</p>

  <title>Meals, Significance of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEALS, Significance of</p>
<p class="fl">The meal played a significant role in family, social, and religious life. The evening meal was the time when all family members normally were gathered together, and was thus an important time of fellowship. Providing food for the traveler was both a social and a religious responsibility, while the ideal of a quiet social life was realized by having friends break bread with the family and discuss the problems of the day by the light of small oil lamps. The significance of the meal retains its central focus both in the Jewish religion with the Passover meal and in Christianity with the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>In the ancient Near East two meals were normally eaten during the day. The first was the noonday meal, usually consumed by laborers in the field and consisting of such items as small cakes or flat loaves, figs or olives, and possibly cheese or curds of goats’ milk. This was considered a small meal, eaten for sustenance and refreshment at a time of relaxation and respite from the heat of the sun and the labor of the day (<a href="?bref=Ruth.2.14">Ru 2:14</a>). Breakfast was considered unnecessary, and biblical references to any such form of early morning meal are very few (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.5">Jgs 19:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.12">Jn 21:12</a>).</p>
<p>Whereas in Egypt the main meal was served at noon, among the Hebrews the evening meal was the most important social occasion of the day. Then the exhausted field workers could return home to relax after their day’s work and enjoy the feeling of communal warmth as the family gathered together for their principal meal. This occasion coincided with the arrival of darkness, a time when there was insufficient light for fieldwork to continue.</p>
<p>The laborer’s meal consisted of bread or cakes made of hand-ground grain, goats’ cheese or curds, vegetables (especially beans, lentils, leeks, and peas, which were popular for the sake of variety although not always plentiful), and figs, olives, raisins, and dates. Meat was usually available, but for the majority was a luxury item. Food was cooked in olive oil, and honey was used for sweetening.</p>
<p>The meal was eaten together by the entire family. There was no separate dining room in the average house, and during the patriarchal period, meals were consumed while the family was seated on the floor, a mat often serving as a table (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25">Gn 37:25</a>). Canaanite seating habits were adopted subsequently, and chairs and small tables were used (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.20">1 Kgs 13:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.23.5">Ps 23:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.41">Ez 23:41</a>). Eating in the Egyptian fashion in a reclining position became popular and continued throughout the Roman period. Musical entertainment, dancing, and riddles were sometimes provided on festive occasions for family and guests, since the meal period was the normal time for entertainment in Near Eastern society.</p>
<p>By NT times, a separate upper room often served as a dining room. Guests reclined by leaning on the left elbow so that they were close enough together on their couches to facilitate easy conversation. There was a strict hierarchy to the seating arrangements (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.43.33">Gn 43:33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.9.22">1 Sm 9:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.6">Mt 23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.39">Mk 12:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.8">Lk 14:8</a>) at all formal meals, the “highest” place being that to the right of the servants as they entered the room and the lowest to their left.</p>
<p>Guests washed their hands before and after meals, and normally partook of a form of meat and/or vegetable stew from a common bowl placed in the center of the table. Instead of cutlery, pieces of bread held in the fingers were made into the shape of a small scoop and dipped into the bowl. There would usually be only one main dish requiring preparation, so that the woman who had cooked the meal could partake of it with her guests, thus fulfilling the ideals of community at mealtimes.</p>
<p>On several occasions in the NT Jesus is mentioned as eating meals with disciples and friends. He and his followers were guests at the wedding feast held in Cana of Galilee (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-10">Jn 2:1-10</a>), and also at a dinner given by Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.10">Mt 9:10</a>), as well as at another given by Simon the Pharisee (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">Lk 7:36-50</a>). Jesus also was entertained at dinner somewhat unexpectedly by Zacchaeus (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.6-7">19:6-7</a>). On several occasions Jesus was a guest at a family gathering held at the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus in Bethany (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">Lk 10:38-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.2">Jn 12:2</a>). Following the customs of smaller towns and villages, passersby may well have called into the house to greet Jesus and perhaps converse with other guests.</p>
<p>There are two important meals described in Scripture, one involving the old covenant and the other the new, in which meals had a redemptive meaning for the people of God. The first was the institution of the Passover at the time of Israel’s departure from Egypt under Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-51">Ex 12</a>). The second was the institution of the Lord’s Supper. Both are discussed in detail in separate articles.</p>

<p>Here the Amorites defeated Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.21.30">Nm 21:30</a>). Later, Israel defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, at Medeba and assigned it to Reuben’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.9,16">Jos 13:9, 16</a>). At this place David routed an Aramean army hired by the Ammonites to attack his forces (<a href="?bref=1Chr.19.7">1 Chr 19:7</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Moabite Stone, the town was once controlled by Omri and Ahab of Israel; however, when Mesha reasserted Moabite dominance in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, he rebuilt Medeba and other Moabite cities. Medeba is named in Isaiah’s prophecies against Moab (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.2">Is 15:2</a>). In later times Joram and Jehoshaphat made unsuccessful attempts at capturing this city.</p>

  <title>Medes, Media, Median*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEDES, MEDIA, MEDIAN*</p>
<p class="fl">Indo-European-speaking people appearing in the highland area of the ancient Asian country called Media. They were closely related to the Persians, with whom they are often identified or confused by writers who referred to the people of the area by the almost generic term “Medes.” In fact, the Medes inhabited a defined area in the Zagros Mountains positioned between 3,000 and 5,000 feet (914.4 and 1,524 meters) above sea level in a mountainous region divided by valleys. The capital, Ecbatana (now Hamadan), was on the major trade route from Mesopotamia. The elevation provided a temperate summer climate that encouraged the use of Ecbatana as a summer retreat for Persian kings.</p>
<p>As no texts are extant in the Median language recording the history and culture of the Medes, information must be obtained from references to them in contemporary writings of the Greeks, Neo-Babylonians, and Assyrians. As the Medes and Chaldeans were instrumental in bringing down the Assyrian Empire, it is understandable that they should figure prominently in the Neo-Babylonian texts. Valuable additional information is available from Herodotus, possibly from cuneiform sources.</p>
<p>The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III recorded the activity of the Medes in the area around Ecbatana in the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>, but historians are uncertain exactly how long before that date they had migrated into the region.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser organized a raid into the plains controlled by the Medes in order to steal herds of carefully bred horses, the reputation for whose excellence was already deservedly high. Over generations, Assyrian kings continued this type of raid, not only for the purpose of obtaining fresh supplies of horses but also to ensure the free passage of traders on this major route. During the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Assyrian kings such as Adad-nirari (810–781 <span class="era">BC</span>), Tiglath-pileser III (743 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Sargon II (716 <span class="era">BC</span>), all claim to have conquered Media. The OT records that the Israelites were transported there at the time of Sargon’s incursions (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.6">2 Kgs 17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.11">18:11</a>).</p>
<p>When Esar-haddon was king of Assyria (681–669 <span class="era">BC</span>), he expected the Medians to acknowledge his overlordship and pay tribute according to their treaty, but taking advantage of the declining strength of Assyria, the Medians joined forces with the Scythians and Cimmerians in 631 <span class="era">BC</span>. The ebbing strength of the Assyrians was further eroded under a series of attacks led by Phraortes culminating in the fall of Nineveh in 612 <span class="era">BC</span> and of Haran in 610 <span class="era">BC</span>. Under the leadership of Cyaxares of Media, who organized a strong, disciplined army, the Median forces and their allies, having gained control of the major cities, extended their sphere of influence to the northern part of Assyria, negotiating peace with Lydia in 585 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The Elamites, also a people involved in the ebb and flow of the power struggle in the region over the centuries, came into the ascendency in 550 <span class="era">BC</span> when Cyrus of Anshan overcame Astyages. Cyrus was of half-Persian, half-Median ancestry. Ecbatana, capital of Media, was captured, and the entire area was controlled by Elam. Cyrus took on the additional title “king of the Medes.” The laws and the heritage of the Medes were incorporated with those of the Persians (<a href="?bref=Dan.6.8,15">Dn 6:8, 15</a>). Medes were entrusted with high office in the administration. The Medes and the Persians were referred to in almost synonymous terms (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.19">Est 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.8.20">Dn 8:20</a>). They were also involved in the capture of Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.17">Is 13:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.51.11,28">Jer 51:11, 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.28">Dn 5:28</a>). Being of Median heritage (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.1">Dn 9:1</a>), Darius, son of Ahasuerus, was referred to as “the Mede” (<a href="?bref=Dan.11.1">Dn 11:1</a>) from the time he took over as ruler of Babylon. His administration was not altogether peaceful, however, and restlessness led to outright rebellion both in his reign and during that of Darius II (409 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>A description of the sumptuous feasting and luxurious appointments of the court apartments are described in the book of Esther (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.3-7">Est 1:3-7</a>). The Medians subsequently were subjected to the control of the Syrians (Seleucids) and the Parthians. In the NT there is a single combined reference to Parthians, Medes, and Elamites (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.9">Acts 2:9</a>), but thereafter Media seems to have become only a geographical term, the people no longer appearing in history as a group in their own right.</p>

  <title>Mediate, Mediator</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEDIATE, MEDIATOR</p>
<p class="fl">The act of an intermediary, go-between, or expert in divine things, not to negotiate agreement or compromise but to approach God on behalf of others, and so to convey desired knowledge and reassurance with divine authority.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Job voices longing for such a mediator (translated here from the LXX): “God is not a mortal like me, so I cannot argue with him or take him to trial. If only there were a mediator who could bring us together, but there is none. The mediator could make God stop beating me, and I would no longer live in terror of his punishment. Then I could speak to him without fear, but I cannot do that in my own strength” (<a href="?bref=Job.9.32-35">Jb 9:32-35</a>).</p>
<p>More familiar is the mediation of instruction concerning the divine character and will.

The terms of the covenant law were expounded by prophets who “stood in God’s council,” and by priests who communicated God’s mind by oracle, sacred lot, and pronounced blessing (<a href="?bref=Deut.10.8">Dt 10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.33.8-10">33:8-10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.3">2 Chr 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.10-11,18-22,31-34">Jer 23:10-11, 18-22, 31-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.11">Mi 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.2.7">Mal 2:7</a>).</p>
<p>Most familiar is the liturgical mediation of the priest, whether by Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.4-8">Ex 24:4-8</a>) or by an appointed person trained in the rituals of worship (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.1">28:1</a>). Because of Israel’s emphasis upon the holiness of God, sacrificial expiation, or “covering,” of sin figured largely in priestly mediation. The priest represented before God the people’s penitence, confession, and prayers for forgiveness, bearing the tribes’ names on shoulders and breastplate, and represented God, in turn, assuring his favor, forgiveness, and protection (see <a href="?bref=Heb.5.1-4">Heb 5:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.27-10.11">7:27–10:11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">It was natural that the mission of Jesus should be described in mediatorial terms, and first as that of a prophet speaking for God to humans, making God known (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.15">Mk 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.28">8:28</a>). Where applied to Jesus, the actual title “mediator” refers mainly to his institution of a new covenant, establishing God’s new relationship with people (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6">Heb 8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.24">12:24</a>). The one other instance is <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.5">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, where the unity of God requires a sole, unrivaled mediator, namely, Christ.</p>
<p>This last reference mentions Christ’s giving himself as “a ransom for all.” This essentially priestly function is the theme of Hebrews. Christ as Son of God, divinely appointed, sinless, suffering, tempted, sympathizing, and obedient, is uniquely qualified to be High Priest of his people. As priest, he offers a perfect sacrifice and lives forever to intercede for those who draw near to God through him. This mediatorial ministry places Jesus at “the right hand of God.” His intercession for people is mentioned also in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.34">Romans 8:34</a> and probably in <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 John 2:1</a>, where ancient Greek commentators, <span class="sc">neb</span>, and other authoritative sources so understand “paraclete,” here applied to Jesus. His mediatorial sacrifice is mentioned in Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>), John (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">Jn 1:29</a>), Romans (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>), and 1 John (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.10">4:10</a>).</p>
<p>Still more significant is the insistence, everywhere in the NT, that man’s knowledge of God, salvation, and hope come through Christ alone. Made poor for our sakes, he died and rose “for us”; our peace, access to God, reconciliation, expiation of sin, grace, truth, prayer, and “all spiritual blessings” are “through him,” “in him,” “through his blood,” and “in his name.” The purpose of God focuses in him; he mediated at Creation and at redemption (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15,22">Col 1:15, 22</a>); in him all the fullness of God dwells, and the face of Christ reveals God’s glory. No one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son reveals him; no one comes to the Father but by him; neither is there salvation in any other.</p>
<p>Christ’s mediation is the fulfillment and end of all mediation between God and humankind. The book of Hebrews opens with the assertion that Christ surpasses all other mediators—angels, Moses, the Aaronic priesthood. His is a timeless priesthood, like Melchizedek’s. His sacrifice is unrepeatable, “once for all time,” and by it we have been consecrated to God “for all time.” The covenant he established between God and people offers better promises, sacrifice, sanctuary, and hope (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.19">Heb 7:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.6">8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.1,11-15">9:1, 11-15</a>). Christ’s mediation so far excels all others that it can never be superseded; he is priest without rival and forever (cf. <a href="?bref=1Tim.2.5">1 Tm 2:5</a>).</p>
<p>Without using the priestly analogy, John emphasizes the same truth. The gulf between divine and human has been crossed, decisively and finally, by the Incarnation. Instead of standing between God and man, Christ unites both within himself by becoming man. Mediating in the beginning at Creation, Christ is himself the Word, which from God’s side mediates God’s mind, embodies God’s message, and conveys God’s power. No one has seen God at any time, but as unique Son and divine, Jesus “expounds” God (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">Jn 1:18</a>). From the human side, Jesus prays for the disciples (ch <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">17</a>), offers perfect obedience, lays down his life for his flock, and offers the unblemished sacrifice that bears away the sin of the world.</p>

  <title>Medicine and Medical Practice</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEDICINE AND MEDICAL PRACTICE</p>
<p class="fl">The field of knowledge dealing with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, as well as the actual substances used to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.</p>
<p>Medicine as a branch of knowledge received little attention from the Hebrew people of OT times, in contrast to the surrounding cultures found in Mesopotamia and Egypt, where medical knowledge had a prominent place. Extant in the library of Assyrian king Ashurbanipal are 800 tablets relating to medicine. From these writings it can be seen that medicine at that time was a mixture of religion, divination, and demonology. Their pharmacopeia was extensive and included agents such as dog dung and human urine. Surgical operations were performed by some physicians. An unusual method of diagnosis practiced in Babylon was to inspect the liver of a freshly killed animal and compare it with a clay model of a liver from a normal animal. Differences between the two were used to diagnose the condition of the patient. An interesting example of this, and divination, is found in <a href="?bref=Ezek.21.21">Ezekiel 21:21</a>.</p>
<p>The art of medicine was more advanced in Egypt than in Mesopotamia, depending more upon logic and observation. The Edwin-Smith papyrus is the oldest surgical treatise known. It discusses a variety of fractures, dislocations, wounds, tumors, and ulcers. Adhesive plaster, surgical stitching, and cauterization were used in treatment. The heart was recognized as the center of the circulatory system, and the pulse was observed. The Ebers papyrus deals with problems of internal medicine and their treatment. Enemas were a popular form of therapy, and their <span class="ital">materia medica</span> contained an assortment of remedies ranging from castor oil to animal fat to hot sand. Other papyri deal with gynecological problems and contain formularies and many magical incantations. Mummification was a highly developed art; Joseph had his father Jacob embalmed (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.2">Gn 50:2</a>).</p>
<p>The outlook of the Hebrew people in OT times toward disease was entirely different from that of their heathen neighbors. They did not believe in the heathen superstitions or gods and, consequently, did not develop a medical knowledge similar to the Egyptians and Babylonians. Instead, the Hebrews regarded sickness as a judgment from God (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.26">Ex 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.22,35,60-61">Dt 28:22, 35, 60-61</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.2">Jn 9:2</a>) and recovery also was attributed to God (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.26">Ex 15:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.3">Ps 103:3</a>). In accordance with this philosophy, King Asa’s reliance on physicians instead of on God is referred to in a reproachful way in <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.12">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>. Therefore, while medical treatment was available in Israel, its use and development was less advanced than in neighboring lands.</p>
<p>The most significant contribution the Hebrews gave to medicine was in the hygienic measures outlined in the Law, particularly <a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-15.33">Leviticus 11–15</a>. While these had primarily a religious significance, they undoubtedly improved the general level of health and physical well-being of the people. The Hebrew priest was not the counterpart of the physician-priest found in other cultures. Although the Hebrew priest was expected to determine what physical conditions rendered a person ceremonially unclean, there is no intimation in Scripture that he treated diseases.</p>
<p>The only surgical operation mentioned in Scripture is circumcision. This was performed by the Hebrews for religious rather than medical purposes, and it was not done by a physician but by the head of the house or someone else (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.25">Ex 4:25</a>). In <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.21">Ezekiel 30:21</a> reference is made to treating a fracture of the arm by immobilizing and splinting it with a roller bandage.</p>
<p>Obstetrical care was given by women who were experienced midwives (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.17">Gn 35:17</a>). In <a href="?bref=Gen.38.27-30">Genesis 38:27-30</a> there is an account of the birth of twins complicated by a transverse presentation. This is a difficult problem for even the most skilled obstetrician, and the fact that the mother and both babies survived speaks highly for the skill of this midwife. In <a href="?bref=Exod.1.15-21">Exodus 1:15-21</a> the use of birth stools for delivery is mentioned. This was a device to hold the laboring woman in a position favorable for delivering the baby.</p>
<p>In NT times, Greek medicine had a dominant influence in the Mediterranean world. Although the practice of medicine was still in a primitive state, Hippocrates and other Greek physicians of his day laid the basis for modern medicine by rejecting magical explanations of diseases and through careful observation attempted to give a rational basis for medical treatment. From <a href="?bref=Mark.5.26">Mark 5:26</a> it is known that physicians were available in Israel. Indeed, the rabbis ordained that every town must have at least one physician, and some rabbis themselves practiced medicine.</p>
<p>Specific medical remedies are occasionally mentioned in the Bible. Mandrakes were used as an aphrodisiac (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.14">Gn 30:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.7.13">Sg 7:13</a>). When Job was afflicted with generalized boils, he removed the devitalized skin with a piece of pottery and sat in ashes (<a href="?bref=Job.2.7-8">Jb 2:7-8</a>). The ashes would have a drying effect on the draining sores, giving this treatment a rational basis for its use. Jeremiah refers in a rhetorical way to the balm in Gilead, indicating its medicinal use (<a href="?bref=Jer.8.22">Jer 8:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.11">46:11</a>). The exact nature or use of this balm is not known. When Hezekiah was mortally ill, he was instructed by Isaiah to put a lump of figs on the boil (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.7">2 Kgs 20:7</a>). This probably should not be considered a treatment, however, any more than the dipping seven times in the Jordan by Naaman or the application of mud to the eyes of the blind by the Lord. The therapeutic effect of merriment on the mind found in <a href="?bref=Pr.17.22">Proverbs 17:22</a> is in accord with modern mental health beliefs.</p>
<p>Medicinal use of wine is recorded several times in Scripture. Its mood-changing ability is alluded to in <a href="?bref=Pr.31.6">Proverbs 31:6</a>, and apparently the sour wine offered to the Lord on the cross was intended to ameliorate his suffering through its analgesic property (<a href="?bref=John.19.29">Jn 19:29</a>). Paul suggests to Timothy that he use a little wine for his stomach and other infirmities (<a href="?bref=1Tim.5.23">1 Tm 5:23</a>). It is significant that Paul said “a little” because pharmacologists today agree that wine in moderate amounts aids digestion and helps blood circulation; however, excessive amounts are deleterious to the health in numerous ways. The good Samaritan used oil and wine to treat the wounds of the injured man (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.34">Lk 10:34</a>). Because of its alcoholic content, the wine would have an antiseptic action, but at the same time it would tend to coagulate the surface of the raw wound and permit bacteria to thrive under the coagulum. The oil, by its emollient effect, would tend to nullify this latter undesirable side effect of wine and would also be soothing due to its coating action. A dressing was then applied, and the patient was taken to a resting place.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rev.3.18">Revelation 3:18</a> the Laodicean church is admonished to use eye salve. Since Laodicea was famous for a powder used for weak and ailing eyes, this illustration is uniquely appropriate to use in warning this church concerning its lack of spiritual vision.</p>

  <title>Mediterranean Sea</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEDITERRANEAN SEA</p>
<p class="fl">Body of water often called the Great Sea, bordering Palestine on the west (<a href="?bref=Num.34.7">Nm 34:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1">Jos 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.10,15">Ez 47:10, 15</a>). The sea is approximately 2,196 miles (3,533.4 kilometers) long, from Gibraltar to Lebanon, varies in width from 600 miles to 1,000 miles (965.4 to 1,609 kilometers), and has a maximum depth of 2.7 miles (4.3 kilometers). Its various subdivisions consist of the Adriatic, Aegean, Ionian, Ligurian, and Tyrrhenian seas.</p>
<p>From the Bay of Iskenderun on the north to el-Arish on the south, a distance of about 450 miles (724.1 kilometers), the eastern coastline is rather straight, with a few deep bays or headlands. Along the Syrian coast as far south as Beirut, the coastline contains rocky formations rising sharply from the water. At Acco the coast recedes and the land slopes gently upward toward the plain of Esdraelon. South of this, the sharp ridge of Mt Carmel projects into the water. From the southern slope of Carmel, the vale of Sharon spreads southward to merge with the plains of Philistia. From there the coast is an almost unbroken curve to the Nile Delta.</p>
<p>Several good harbor areas indented the Syrophoenician coast in antiquity, and the sea played an important role in the development of that region. Byblos was a sea power prior to 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Tyre and Sidon were known for their maritime prowess after 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Following their conquest of Palestine under Pompey (63 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Romans made extensive use of the sea and referred to it as “Our Sea.”</p>
<p>Although located on the Mediterranean Sea, and having neighbors who were seafaring people, the Israelites never developed any extensive commercial or military use of it. Various reasons have been given for this. First, Israel was a pastoral and agricultural people whose roots were in the soil rather than the sea and who, therefore, looked inland for their development. Second, the primary efforts of Israel in Palestine were directed toward conquest and retention of the lands taken, and this left little time to develop maritime interests. Third, the sea was controlled by Phoenicia, and to a lesser degree by Philistia. From the time of the exodus, the Phoenicians had established themselves at points along the coast and formed an essentially maritime confederation extending from the Orontes on the north to Joppa on the south. South of this point, the Philistines controlled the coastline during much of Israel’s history. At one time Solomon had a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber on the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.26-27">1 Kgs 9:26-27</a>), and Jehoshaphat also had a fleet in that vicinity (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.48">22:48</a>). Finally, there were no natural harbors along the Israelite-occupied coastline. A few harbors existed, such as Ashkelon, Dor, Joppa, and Acco, but the only port to which Israel had access apparently was Joppa during the monarchy. When Solomon was building the temple, lumber from Lebanon was shipped to Joppa and transported to Jerusalem from there.</p>
<p>The NT records one visit by Jesus to the coastal area, when he went to “the district of Tyre and Sidon” (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.21">Mt 15:21</a>) and healed the demon-possessed daughter of the Syrophoenician woman. The apostle Paul in his missionary journeys had many contacts with the Mediterranean Sea from Caesarea on the Palestinian coast to Puteoli on the coast of Italy. Under Roman rule, the Mediterranean was widely traveled by merchants, government officials, soldiers, and teachers. Paul and other early Christians took advantage of the Roman roads of land and sea to spread the gospel throughout the world surrounding the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="fl">City standing at the southwest edge of the plain of Esdraelon on the main route between Mesopotamia and Egypt. It overlooks the historic route where a pass through the Mt Carmel range led from the plain of Sharon into the plain of Jezreel. This strategic position made Megiddo one of the most important commercial and military centers of Palestine in the second millennium and the early first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. From earliest times, the environs have been the scene of major battles. Great military men, such as Thutmose III of 15th-century <span class="era">BC</span> Egypt, Napoleon in 1799, and General Allenby during World War I, have fought for mastery there.</p>
<p>At the time of the conquest, Joshua defeated the king of Megiddo but did not take the city (<a href="?bref=Josh.12.21">Jos 12:21</a>). In the subsequent allotments to the tribes of Israel, Megiddo was assigned to Manasseh, but they could not conquer it from the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.11-12">Jos 17:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>). During the days of the judges, Deborah and Barak defeated the forces of Hazor under the command of Sisera near Megiddo (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.15">Jgs 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.19">5:19</a>) but did not take the city either. Perhaps David conquered it as part of his program for establishing the kingdom. At any rate, by the time of Solomon, Megiddo served as the headquarters of one of his 12 administrative regions (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). Solomon rebuilt it to serve as one of his chariot and garrison cities (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15-19">9:15-19</a>).</p>
<p>King Ahaziah of Judah died there (841 <span class="era">BC</span>) after being wounded by Jehu while on a visit to the northern kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.27">2 Kgs 9:27</a>). King Josiah of Judah met and intercepted Pharaoh Neco of Egypt (609 <span class="era">BC</span>) at Megiddo in a vain effort to prevent him from going north to aid the Assyrians; he was mortally wounded in the battle (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.29-30">23:29-30</a>). The plain of Megiddo (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “valley of Megiddon”) is referred to in Zechariah’s prophecies of restoration for Israel and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Zech.12.11">Zec 12:11</a>). Revelation predicts a great future war that will take place at Armageddon (Har Megiddon, the “mount of Megiddo,” <a href="?bref=Rev.16.16">Rv 16:16</a>).</p>

It is probably not a settlement; Jarkon seems to be the name of the river (el-’Awjah) flowing across the coastal plain from the springs at Aphek to the coast four miles (6.4 kilometers) north of Joppa. It was a formidable obstacle to north–south travel, but the numerous ancient sites along its banks testify to its importance as an entryway from the sea to the interior of the country.</p>

<p class="h1">MELCHIZEDEK</p>
<p class="fl">Mysterious biblical personality whose name means “king of righteousness.” The historical record about this priest-king is contained in <a href="?bref=Gen.14.18-20">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, and he is spoken of in <a href="?bref=Ps.110.4">Psalm 110:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.5.10">Hebrews 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.20">6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-17">7:1-17</a>.</p>
<p class="h2">In <a href="?bref=Gen.14.18-20">Genesis 14:18-20</a></p>
<p class="fl">Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, with three other Mesopotamian kings, raided a vassal confederacy of five kings near the shores of the Dead Sea. In the ensuing massacre and rout by the Mesopotamian confederacy, Abraham’s nephew Lot and his family and possessions were captured (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-12">Gn 14:1-12</a>). Abraham led an attacking force in pursuit of Lot’s captors, achieved victory, retrieved the plunder, and secured the release of Lot and his family (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.14.13-16">13-16</a>).</p>
<p>Upon his return, Abraham was greeted not only by the grateful kings of the Dead Sea confederacy but also by Melchizedek, king of Salem, who gave Abraham bread and wine along with his blessing as “priest of the most high God” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">’El ‘Elyon</span><span class="ital">)</span> (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18">Gn 14:18</a>). Salem is Jerusalem (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.76.2">Ps 76:2</a>). El Elyon is not the pagan deity of Canaanite worship by the same name but rather the title of the true God who created heaven and earth—an idea foreign to Canaanite religion (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.14.22">Gn 14:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.7.17">Pss 7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.47.2">47:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.2">57:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.56">78:56</a>). Melchizedek correctly viewed Abraham as worshiping this same God (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.22">Gn 14:22</a>) and praised God for giving victory to Abraham. Abraham identified himself with the worship of the one true God represented by Melchizedek in that he received his gifts and blessing and gave him a tenth of everything, thus recognizing Melchizedek’s higher spiritual rank as a patriarchal priest. In contrast, Abraham disassociated himself from Canaanite polytheism by declining gifts from the king of Sodom.</p>
<p>It is interesting to speculate whether Melchizedek’s knowledge of the true God was received by tradition from the past ages closer to the Flood, or whether he, like Abraham, had been uprooted from paganism to monotheism by direct divine revelation. It is at least clear from <a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">Hebrews 7:3</a> that his priesthood was isolated and not received through a priestly pedigree.</p>
<p class="h2">In <a href="?bref=Ps.110.4">Psalm 110:4</a></p>
<p class="fl">In this messianic psalm, David envisioned one greater than himself whom he called “Lord” (v <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1">1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.12.35-37">Mk 12:35-37</a>). Thus the perfect messianic king was not an idealization of the present ruler but someone to come. Also, he was to be not merely a man but more than this. The Messiah would be the Son of God as well as the son of David. The divine oracle of <a href="?bref=Ps.110.4">Psalm 110:4</a> is addressed to the Messiah: “You are a priest forever in the line of Melchizedek.” The significance of this statement is left for the inspired author of the letter to the Hebrews to develop.</p>
<p class="h2">In <a href="?bref=Heb.5.6-11">Hebrews 5:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.20-7.28">6:20–7:28</a></p>
<p class="fl">The argument of the writer of Hebrews is that the priesthood of Aaron has been superseded by the superior priesthood of Christ and that the superiority of Christ’s priesthood is demonstrated by its Melchizedekian character. First, both Christ and Melchizedek are kings of righteousness and kings of peace (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.1-2">Heb 7:1-2</a>). Second, both have a unique priesthood that does not depend on family pedigree (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">3</a>). Third, both exist as priests continually (v <a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>Melchizedek was superior to Abraham, the father of Levi, because Melchizedek gave gifts to and blessed Abraham, and received tithes from him (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.4-10">7:4-10</a>); David predicted the succession of the Melchizedekian priesthood over the Levitical priesthood, showing the imperfection of the latter (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.11-19">11-19</a>); the Melchizedekian priesthood of the Messiah was confirmed by a divine oath, which was not true of the Levitical priesthood (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.20-22">20-22</a>); and the Melchizedekian priesthood possessed an unchangeable and permanent character (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.23-25">23-25</a>).</p>
<p>Certain scholars have thought that Melchizedek was an appearance of the preincarnate Christ in the OT (technically called a Christophany). They argue this on the basis of <a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">Hebrews 7:3</a>, which says that there is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors—no beginning or end to his life. However, this statement is simply to be understood in the sense that his priesthood was not connected to any priestly family line. Melchizedek had a priestly office by special divine appointment, and was thus a type of Jesus Christ in his priesthood. The writer of Hebrews says that Melchizedek was one “resembling the Son of God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.3">7:3</a>); this clearly indicates that he was not himself the Son of God.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Memorial">
  <title>Memorial</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEMORIAL</p>
<p class="fl">Something that keeps remembrance vivid. The ideas represented by the words “remember,” “remembrance,” and “memorial” are closely connected in common parlance as well as in biblical usage. The Hebrew and Greek words translated as “memorial” in the OT and NT are nominal derivatives of the verbal roots meaning “to remember.” It is for this reason that one cannot fully grasp the significance of the term “memorial” without first understanding something of the usage and meaning of the term “to remember.”</p>
<p>Although “remember” is usually understood as simply recalling to the mind something from the past, and “memorial” as that which serves to preserve the memory of something from the past, there is often another dimension to these terms in biblical usage. In the Bible, the verb “to remember” often represents a broader idea than simply to recall something from the past because it implies and includes resultant action as well. It is not just recalling, but recalling in a way that affects one’s present feeling, thought, or action. For example, when it is said in <a href="?bref=Gen.8.1">Genesis 8:1</a> that God “remembered Noah,” this does not mean that God merely recalled that Noah was in the ark. It includes this idea to be sure, but more than this it means that God is acting on Noah’s behalf. In a similar way, when <a href="?bref=Gen.30.22">Genesis 30:22</a> says that God “remembered Rachel,” the meaning is that after a long period of barrenness God is going to answer Rachel’s prayer for a child.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent uses of the idea to remember in the OT is the exhortation to the Israelites to remember the mighty acts of the Lord on their behalf in the past (<a href="?bref=Ps.77.11">Pss 77:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.7">78:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.5">105:5</a>). This also means much more than simply recalling events from past history. It means to live in the present in the light of God’s past actions. By drawing consequences for the present from the acts of God in the past, Israel’s faith is to be strengthened for the challenges and difficulties encountered in the present. Israel’s failure to remember in this way repeatedly led to apostasy and disobedience (<a href="?bref=Ps.78.11,42">78:11, 42</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.7,13,21-22">106:7, 13, 21-22</a>).</p>
<p>A brief survey of the usage of the term “memorial” demonstrates that it also often carries this added dimension of meaning. Here one notices in particular its use in connection with the Passover. <a href="?bref=Exod.12.14">Exodus 12:14</a> says that the Passover “shall be for you a memorial day” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). It is to be an observance that causes the Israelites to live in the present in the light of God’s past action in delivering them from sin and bondage in Egypt. This is much more than simply recalling the exodus as a historical occurrence.</p>
<p>In a similar way <a href="?bref=Josh.4.7">Joshua 4:7</a> describes setting up a monument of 12 stones in the midst of the Jordan River as a “memorial” to the miraculous provision for Israel’s crossing and entering Canaan. This memorial is to be “for the people of Israel for ever.” It is to remind them of God’s past deliverance so that they may take courage in their present circumstances.</p>
<p>Another usage of the term is found in connection with the “stones of remembrance” attached to the front of the ephod worn by the high priest (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.12,29">Ex 28:12, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.39.7">39:7</a>). The significance of these stones was that they were to bring the names of the sons of Israel before the Lord. This is not simply in order for the Lord to recall their names but to assure the Israelites of his present concern for their well-being.</p>
<p>The term “memorial” is used with a somewhat different connotation in connection with the grain offering in <a href="?bref=Lev.2.2,16">Leviticus 2:2, 16</a>. The “memorial of the grain offering” is that portion that the priest offers upon the altar. The remainder is used for the sustenance of the priests themselves. The memorial is that which represents the whole: it does not serve just to remind God of the entire offering, but is viewed as an embodiment of it. A memorial in this sense may be viewed as embodying something of that which it represents.</p>
<p>In the NT the words “memorial” or “remembrance” occur rather infrequently, but in one instance with particular significance. When Jesus instituted the observance of the Lord’s Supper, the NT counterpart to the OT Passover, he said, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance [or memorial] of me” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.19">Lk 22:19</a>). The Lord’s Supper is observed as a remembrance of the suffering and death of Christ. It is much more, however, than simply recalling a historical fact; it is remembering in a way that fills the believer with thanksgiving and determines how he lives and acts in the present.</p>

  <title>Memphis</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MEMPHIS</p>
<p class="fl">City located about 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) southwest of Cairo, once the sprawling capital of Egypt; now, for all practical purposes, it does not exist.</p>
<p>When the city was founded about 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was known as “White Wall” and was later called Men-nefru-Mine or Menfe in Egyptian. From the latter the Greeks got the name Memphis. Though one Hebrew reference follows the Greek (<a href="?bref=Hos.9.6">Hos 9:6</a>), Memphis is commonly called Noph in the OT (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.13">Is 19:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.16">Jer 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.1">44:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.14,19">46:14, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.13,16">Ez 30:13, 16</a>); presumably this is a corruption of the middle part of the Egyptian name.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoryofMemphis">History of Memphis</p>
<p class="fl">According to the fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> Greek historian Herodotus, King Menes founded the city of Memphis and built the temple of Ptah there shortly after unifying the country. Whether or not Menes was a historical person, it is commonly concluded today that shortly after the unification of Egypt (c. 3100 <span class="era">BC</span>) a new capital was built on the border between Upper and Lower Egypt. Although the rulers of the first two dynasties after Egypt’s unification had come from Thinis, north of Thebes, the fact that they were buried at Saqqara west of Memphis seems to indicate that they made Memphis their capital.</p>
<p>Memphis continued as the capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom period (c. 2700–2200 <span class="era">BC</span>). And Memphis, or the nearby city of It-Towy, continued as capital during much of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2050–1775).</p>
<p>During the New Kingdom or Empire period (c. 1580– 1100), the capital was moved to Thebes. But Memphis was Egypt’s second capital during most of that period, and some rulers lived there because of its central geographical location. Ramses II moved his residence to Tanis in the Delta during the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>, but he built a number of structures at Memphis and engaged in large-scale renovation and restoration there. As early as the 16th or 15th century <span class="era">BC</span>, Memphis began to take on a cosmopolitan character. Syrians, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Jews eventually established separate residential quarters there.</p>
<p>Though some decline set in at Memphis during the invasions and uncertainties of the first millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, the city remained virtually intact. Even after the founding of Alexandria in the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the city maintained its greatness; some of the Ptolemies were crowned there instead of at the primary capital of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Memphis lost its importance as a religious center after the Christian emperor Theodosius closed its temples and ordered them torn down in the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ProphecyagainstMemphis">Prophecy against Memphis</p>
<p class="fl">As noted above, the only places Memphis is referred to in the OT are in the Prophets. Of course, Memphis shared in the general condemnation of Egypt, but it was signaled out for special attention. Ezekiel declared that God would destroy the idols of the city (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.13">Ez 30:13</a>) and bring great distress upon it (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.16">16</a>). Jeremiah went further, prophesying that Memphis would be utterly destroyed and without inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.19">Jer 46:19</a>).</p>
<p>Evidently, there are several reasons for this judgment. First, the punishment will come on all nations for their sinfulness and idolatry. Second, they will be punished for their animosity and cruelty to the Jews. In the generations before the exodus the Egyptians made their name hated by the Hebrews. After the death of Solomon and the division of the Hebrew kingdom, Shishak of Egypt invaded Palestine in the fifth year of King Rehoboam and wrought considerable destruction there (926 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25">1 Kgs 14:25</a>). Then in 609–608 <span class="era">BC</span> Pharaoh Neco held Israel under tribute.</p>
<p>Fulfillment of prophecies against Memphis occurred especially in connection with two major events. The Christian Roman emperor Theodosius (<span class="era">AD</span> 379–395), in his campaign against paganism, ordered destruction of the temples of Memphis and desecration of its statues. Then in the seventh century Muslim monotheists conquered Egypt and likewise tried to obliterate evidences of ancient polytheism. After the Arabs began to build Cairo in 642, Memphis became a quarry for the new city. Gradually the ruins have been carted away until virtually nothing is left. A fallen 40-foot statue of Ramses II, one of his sphinxes, a few column bases, and other minor ruins lie among the palm trees and cornfields at the site. The largest remaining portion sits in a lake because the breaching of the ancient dikes has permitted the place to be inundated.</p>

  <title>Menahem</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MENAHEM</p>
<p class="fl">King of Israel who ruled from 752–742 <span class="era">BC</span>. He was the son of Gadi, a name not attested in the OT except in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.14-22">2 Kings 15:14-22</a>.</p>
<p>Virtually everything that the OT records about the career of Menahem is contained in a few brief verses in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.1-38">2 Kings 15</a>. Three important points may be noted from these verses.</p>
<p>First, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.14">2 Kings 15:14</a> records the assassination of Shallum, which enabled Menahem to seize the throne. Verse <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.16">16</a> then recounts the actions of Menahem against the town of Tappuah (Tiphsah). The entire verse is troublesome but may be translated as follows (<span class="sc">nlt</span>): “At that time Menahem destroyed the town of Tappuah and all the surrounding countryside as far as Tirzah, because its citizens refused to surrender the town. He killed the entire population and ripped open the pregnant women.” Two things are unusual. First, the actions of Menahem are quite without precedent in Israelite history. Second, the location and identity of the town that Menahem attacked are uncertain. The Hebrew text reads “Tiphsah” (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), using the spelling of a town normally identified as Thapsacus on the Euphrates. Menahem’s reasons for attacking a town this far away from his own territory and interests would be difficult to determine. Accordingly, some scholars have followed the Lucianic version of the Greek Bible that reads the Hebrew letters as if they were “Tappuah,” a town 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) southwest of Menahem’s hometown of Tirzah. If this reading is correct, and the textual evidence for it is limited to the one version, the meaning of <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.16">2 Kings 15:16</a> is that Menahem began just outside the boundaries of his hometown (Tirzah) and put to the sword the entire population of a neighboring town (including its citizens who lived outside the city proper) that failed to support his bid to become king.</p>
<p>Second, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19-20">2 Kings 15:19-20</a> provides the biblical view of the way in which Menahem dealt with the Assyrian crisis posed by the campaign of Tiglath-pileser III into the Syro-Palestinian region (c. 744). Evidently hoping to persuade the Assyrians to support his claims to the throne in Israel, Menahem levied a stiff tax upon the wealthy citizens of his nation to be used to pay tribute to Tiglath-pileser (called by his Babylonian name “Pul” in v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19">19</a>). Evidently Menahem hoped this payment would convince the Assyrian king “to gain his support in tightening his grip on royal power” (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.19">19</a>). Politically at least, Menahem appears to have guessed correctly, because the Assyrians withdrew (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.20">20</a>) and Menahem was left in power.</p>
<p>Finally, the reign of Menahem is introduced (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.17">2 Kgs 15:17</a>) and concluded by the standard literary forms employed throughout the books of Kings. Despite the fact that Menahem was judged to be just as sinful as the original apostate (Jeroboam I) had been, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.22">2 Kings 15:22</a> appears to attest an unusual fact about his death. Of the last six kings of Israel, only he died a peaceful death.</p>

<p class="fl">Mysterious prophetic words in <a href="?bref=Dan.5.25">Daniel 5:25</a> pointing to the judgment of God against Babylon and her king. A decade or so following the death of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (562 <span class="era">BC</span>), a man of lesser moral stature, Belshazzar, became monarch of the empire. The fifth chapter of Daniel tells of a great banquet that Belshazzar made to which 1,000 of his nobles and their wives had been invited. Under the influence of wine, Belshazzar ordered his servants to bring the gold and silver vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar a generation earlier. The sacred vessels, kept in storage until then, were distributed to the guests at the feast and sacrilegiously used to offer praise to the gods of Babylon (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.4">Dn 5:4</a>).</p>
<p>In the midst of the revelry, the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and wrote upon the plaster of the banquet room wall. The king’s composure was altogether shattered by the event and he cried out for someone to interpret the writing. None of his wise men were able, however, to discern the meaning of the words. Finally, the queen proposed a solution to the dilemma: Daniel the prophet—a gifted man in matters such as these—could be summoned to interpret the writing.</p>
<p>Daniel was brought in before the king and immediately rebuked him for his foolish and godless arrogance. His sermon before Belshazzar (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.17-23">Dn 5:17-23</a>) powerfully proclaimed the judgment of God against all sinful pride, a message decisively revealed in the enigmatic words that Daniel then proceeded to interpret.</p>
<p>The words, given in the Aramaic script, are transliterated into English as <span class="ital">“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin”</span> (<span class="ital">“Upharsin,”</span> <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The mystery of the words lay not in the decipherment of the language but in the significance attached to each of the words. Superficially, they simply denoted a series of weights or monetary values. In truth they prophesied the immediate judgment of God against Babylon and its king.</p>
<p>Daniel’s explanation of the inscription is recorded in <a href="?bref=Dan.5.26-27">Daniel 5:26-27</a>. <span class="ital">Mene</span> means “numbered” and its double entry indicated that God had both numbered the days of Belshazzar’s kingdom and had reckoned its termination. <span class="ital">Tekel</span> means “weighed.” Applied to Belshazzar, it signified his moral and spiritual inadequacy. He was, as it were, too light to balance out on the scales of God’s standard of righteousness. The final participle, <span class="ital">parsin</span> means “broken” or “divided.” Daniel gives the singular form of the word in his interpretation <span class="ital">peres,</span> indicating that Belshazzar’s kingdom was about to be divided between the Medes and the Persians. There is a bit of wordplay in that the noun for Persians <span class="ital">(paras)</span> is virtually the same as the root used here. <a href="?bref=Dan.5.30-31">Daniel 5:30-31</a> notes that the words of this prophecy were fulfilled later that evening.</p>

<p class="fl">Lamp or lampstand in the tabernacle. It refers to the seven-branched lamp (candelabrum) that was to lighten the tabernacle: these seven lamps gave light in front of the lampstand (<a href="?bref=Num.8.2">Nm 8:2</a>). In Solomon’s temple there were ten such lampstands, five on each side before the inner sanctuary (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.49">1 Kgs 7:49</a>). The design of the original lamp was conceived by Bezalel, the son of Uri and the grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, a man filled with the Spirit of God who was an excellent craftsmen (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.1-4">Ex 31:1-4</a>). Bezalel was also responsible for designing the other utensils for the tabernacle.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Exod.25.31-40">Exodus 25:31-40</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.37.17-24">37:17-24</a> provide us with details regarding the lamp and its decorations. Made of a single piece of pure gold and ornamented with almond flowers and knobs in the shape of apples, it consisted of a central shaft branching out into three arms on either side. Each branch was surmounted with a cup narrowed into a lip to hold the wick and the special olive oil.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheGoldenLampstand"/>
<p>Archaeologists have dug up clay bowls with seven spouts, which date back to the middle Bronze Period. According to Josephus, the central shaft was fixed to a base, and from it extended slender branches placed like prongs of a trident—with the end of each one forged into a lamp. Josephus’s account of the temple lamp tallies well with that of Zechariah in his vision of the restored temple after the exile (<a href="?bref=Zech.4.2-3">Zec 4:2-3</a>). Several facsimiles have come down to us from archaeological finds, as well as the famous sculpture of the menorah with some of the other temple vessels on the Arch of Titus in Rome. The menorah on the panel in Rome differs from Josephus’s description, being a massive object with thick arms carried by five men on either side.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Exod.37.24">Exodus 37:24</a>, the weight of the menorah was one <span class="hebrew">kikar</span> in pure gold. This equals a Babylonian talent, which is computed to weigh 34 kilograms (or 75 pounds). But from <a href="?bref=Exod.25.39">Exodus 25:39</a> it would appear that this weight included accessories, such as snuffers, trays, etc. (cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.4.22">2 Chr 4:22</a>). There is also another discrepancy regarding the base of the lamp. On the panel of Titus’s Arch the pedestal consists of two tiers and is rectangular, whereas archaeologists have uncovered ancient designs of the lamp that end in a tripod. Scholars are undecided which is the more original, and there are several theories to explain the difference. In Jewish mystical lore the menorah symbolizes the tree of life, the seven planets, and the seven days of creation.</p>
<p>In the NT the lampstand in the book of Revelation is a carryover of the temple tradition, with special reference to <a href="?bref=Zech.4.2,11">Zechariah 4:2, 11</a>. By an association of ideas it refers to the witness of the seven churches, to Christ who is the Light of the World, and to God, who is the source of all light (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.12-13,20">Rv 1:12-13, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1">2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.11.4">11:4</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MEPHIBOSHETH</p>
<p class="list">1. Son of Jonathan, David’s friend. The original form of the name was undoubtedly Merib-baal (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.34">1 Chr 8:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.40">9:40</a>), but when the word <span class="hebrew">baal</span> became predominantly associated with the chief male deity of the Canaanite fertility cult, it was replaced, in some instances, by the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">bosheth</span> (meaning “shame”). As the grandson of Saul, Mephibosheth was born into a situation of privilege, which changed dramatically when the Philistines attacked. Saul, Jonathan, and two of his brothers were killed in the battle on Mt Gilboa (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-6">1 Sm 31:1-6</a>). When news of the catastrophe reached the Israelite palace at Jezreel, the five-year-old Mephibosheth was snatched up by his nurse. In a panicked scramble for safety, she fell, dropping Mephibosheth, whose legs or ankles were broken. The lack of adequate medical attention meant that he became completely crippled (<a href="?bref=2Sam.4.4">2 Sm 4:4</a>). Eventually, he found refuge at Lo-debar in Transjordan, with Makir, who later on befriended David himself (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.4">9:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.27">17:27</a>). Mephibosheth’s uncle, Ishbosheth (Saul’s only surviving son), who had been made Israel’s puppet king (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-10">2:8-10</a>) was murdered (ch <a href="?bref=2Sam.4.1-12">4</a>). Mephibosheth, although apparently next in succession, appears not to have been considered. When David was established on the throne of a now united kingdom and wished to show kindness to any surviving members of Jonathan’s family, he was informed of Mephibosheth’s existence by Ziba, once an influential steward in Saul’s palace (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.1-13">9:1-13</a>). Summoned to Jerusalem, Mephibosheth was naturally apprehensive, probably fearing that David might want to eliminate all possible rivals (see <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.28">19:28</a>). But David’s generous nature showed itself in restoring to Mephibosheth all of Saul’s original land, with Ziba and his family continuing to manage the estate, and in granting the cripple a permanent place at the royal table.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Absalom’s rebellion broke out, Ziba met the fleeing David and supplied him with welcome provisions, taking the opportunity to curry favor at the expense of his master. Mephibosheth, he suggested, even entertained hopes of gaining the kingdom for himself. David, in the stress of the crisis, was taken in by this unlikely story and promised Ziba all Mephibosheth’s property (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.1-4">2 Sm 16:1-4</a>). The civil war over, Mephibosheth himself came to David with clear evidence of his grief at the latter’s exile and therefore of Ziba’s duplicity. But David, not willing to alienate Ziba and probably grateful for his earlier gift, compromised, dividing the land between the two. Mephibosheth’s genuine joy at the king’s restoration was such that the loss of his land was of no account in comparison (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.24-30">19:24-30</a>). Later, when seven descendants of Saul were slain to appease the Gibeonites, David’s continuing remembrance of Jonathan resulted in Mephibosheth’s being spared (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.7">21:7</a>). Mephibosheth’s son, Mica (<a href="?bref=2Sam.9.12">9:12</a>), became the head of a considerably large family (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.35">1 Chr 8:35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.41">9:41</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Rizpah, Saul’s concubine. Unlike his better-known namesake, he was one of Saul’s seven descendants who had to be hung in order to appease the Gibeonites, whose ancient treaty with Israel had been violated by Saul, causing a three-year famine (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.8">2 Sm 21:8</a>; see <a href="?bref=Josh.9.3-27">Jos 9:3-27</a>). In the sequel (<a href="?bref=2Sam.21.10-14">2 Sm 21:10-14</a>), Rizpah’s untiring vigil over the corpses prompted David to give them a decent burial, together with the remains of Saul and Jonathan, in the family sepulcher.</p>

<p class="h1">MERARI, MERARITE</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning “bitter,” “bitter drink,” or “to be bitter.” It means the same in Arabic and Akkadian, but in Ugaritic it means “to strengthen, to bless.” Traditionally, the word has been understood to be derived from the Hebrew and thus to mean “gall” or “bitterness.” But the Ugaritic root meaning “to strengthen, to bless” is not foreign to the Hebrew way of thinking. When used as a person’s name, it probably should be understood to mean “strength” or “blessing.” Such an understanding may be preferred in many biblical references. In the case of Merari, the third son of Levi, this understanding is preferable in noting his importance and that of his family. It is inconsistent for the youngest son to have a name meaning “gall” or “bitterness” and then to have the greatest responsibility and the greatest reward for his service.</p>
<p>The Bible makes numerous references to Merari the son of Levi. He was the youngest of Levi’s three sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.11">Gn 46:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.6.16-19">Ex 6:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.17-20,33">Nm 3:17-20, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.1">1 Chr 6:1</a>). He was the father of two sons, Mahli and Mushi (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.19">Ex 6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.20">Nm 3:20</a>), who had the responsibility of carrying the frames (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “boards”), bars, pillars, bases (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “sockets”), vessels, and accessories of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Num.3.36-37">Nm 3:36-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.31-33">4:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.7.8">7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.17">10:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.7,34,40">Jos 21:7, 34, 40</a>).

<p class="h1">MERCY</p>
<p class="fl">A divine quality by which God faithfully keeps his promises and maintains his covenant relationship with his chosen people despite their unworthiness and unfaithfulness (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.1-6">Dt 30:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.1">Is 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.25-29">Ez 39:25-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.15-16,23">Rom 9:15-16, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.32">11:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4">Eph 2:4</a>).</p>
<p>The biblical meaning of mercy is exceedingly rich and complex, as evidenced by the fact that several Hebrew and Greek words were used to express the concept. Consequently, there are many synonyms employed in translation to express the dimensions of meaning involved, such as “kindness,” “lovingkindness,” “goodness,” “grace,” “favor,” “pity,” “compassion,” and “steadfast love.” Prominent in the concept of mercy is the compassionate disposition to forgive offenders or adversaries and to help or spare them in their sorry plight.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalSignificance">Theological Significance</p>
<p class="fl">At the heart of the concept of mercy is the love of God, which is freely manifested in his gracious saving acts on behalf of those to whom he has pledged himself in covenant relationship. In the OT it was his chosen people Israel whom he elected to be his own and to whom he showed mercy (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.19">Ex 33:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.10">Is 54:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.9">63:9</a>). God persistently puts up with his disobedient and wayward people and continuously seeks them out to draw them back to himself. The psalmist describes God as a father who pities his children who revere and trust him (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.13">Ps 103:13</a>). Hosea pictures God as a loving father who looks down from heaven with a yearning heart of compassion upon his rebellious and wayward people (<a href="?bref=Hos.11.1-12">Hos 11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.31.20">Jer 31:20</a>). He also regards Israel as an unfaithful and adulterous wife whom God loves as a faithful husband in spite of her apostate and sinful condition (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.1-3.5">Hos 1–3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.54.4-8">Is 54:4-8</a>). Isaiah depicts God as a mother who has compassion on the son of her womb (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.15">Is 49:15</a>). These pictures reveal God’s mercy in rich and different ways. Other dimensions include forgiveness and restoration to favor (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.23">2 Kgs 13:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.8">Is 54:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.18-32">Jl 2:18-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.18-20">Mi 7:18-20</a>), and deliverance from distress and perils (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.19-21">Neh 9:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.11-17">Pss 40:11-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.16-36">69:16-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.79.8-9">79:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.10">Is 49:10</a>).</p>
<p>Because of what Israel as a covenant nation had learned about the steadfast love and faithfulness of God, devout Jews instinctively lifted their voices in petition for divine mercy and forgiveness in times of need, eloquently expressed in the penitential psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.6.1-10">Pss 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.38.1-22">38</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">51</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.102.1-28">102</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.130.1-8">130</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.143.1-12">143</a>), as well as other OT passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Ex 34:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.17">Neh 9:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.1-11">Pss 57</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.79.1-13">79</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.1-17">86</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.123.1-4">123</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.1-6">Is 33:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.3-19">Dn 9:3-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.13">Jl 2:13</a>). It is the remembrance of God’s mercy that gives the repentant person the hope and assurance of divine favor and of reconciliation with the offended Lord.</p>
<p>In the NT a very descriptive Greek word is used for Jesus’ mercy toward the needy (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.36">Mt 9:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.14.14">14:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.20.34">20:34</a>). It expresses his pity and compassion by means of an intense verb literally translated “to be moved in one’s bowels.” The Hebrews regarded the bowels as the center of the affections, especially that of the most tender kindness. Jesus was described as being deeply moved in his inner feeling of benevolence toward the needy and spontaneously acting to relieve their suffering—to heal (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.34">Mt 20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.41">Mk 1:41</a>), to raise the dead (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.13">Lk 7:13</a>), and to feed the hungry (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.32">Mt 15:32</a>).</p>
<p>The OT concept of God’s mercy expressed in his faithfulness to the covenant people is found also in the NT (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.50,54,72,78">Lk 1:50, 54, 72, 78</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4">Eph 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.2">1 Tm 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3">1 Pt 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.10">2:10</a>). The most characteristic use of mercy in the NT is that of God’s provision of salvation for mankind in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.30-32">Rom 11:30-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4">Eph 2:4</a>). God is “the Father of mercies” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.3">2 Cor 1:3</a>), which he bestows on those who believe in his Son. It is because he is “so rich in mercy” that he saved those who are spiritually dead and doomed by their sins (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.4-6">Eph 2:4-6</a>). It is out of God’s mercy that one is forgiven and granted eternal life (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.13-16">1 Tm 1:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PeoplesResponsibilitytoShowMercytoOthers">People’s Responsibility to Show Mercy to Others</p>
<p class="fl">Because God has freely extended his mercy irrespective of worthiness or faithfulness, people are to respond by showing mercy to others, even though they do not deserve it or seek it. Indeed, people are commanded to be merciful, especially to the poor, the needy, widows, and orphans (<a href="?bref=Pr.14.31">Prv 14:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.19.17">19:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">Mi 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.9-10">Zec 7:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>). God regards mercy more than the ritual sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.13">Mt 9:13</a>). God’s mercy in Christ actually puts people under obligation to act toward others as God himself has acted toward them. The Lord made mercy a foundation for his teaching (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.7">Mt 5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.13">9:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.7">12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23">23:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.36">Lk 6:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.37">10:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.17">Jas 3:17</a>). His coming was anticipated and announced in the context of the mercy that would characterize his mission (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.50,54,72,78">Lk 1:50, 54, 72, 78</a>).</p>
<p>Members of the Christian church are to show compassion and practical concern for each other. They are to give aid and relief, love and comfort to one another, as Christ freely gave to them in their need. The apostle James teaches the essential nature of such good works as being of the very essence of genuine faith (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">Jas 2:14-26</a>). It was the mercy that the good Samaritan had toward the man who was beaten and robbed that was singled out by the Lord for special commendation (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.36-37">Lk 10:36-37</a>). To be full of mercy is a distinguishing virtue of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.7">Mt 5:7</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MERCY SEAT*</p>
<p class="fl">Gold slab placed on top of the ark of the covenant with cherubim attached to it on either end, termed the “mercy seat” in many English versions of the Bible (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.25.17-22">Ex 25:17-22</a>). The Hebrew word for which “mercy seat” is the translation is technically best rendered as “propitiatory,” a term denoting the removal of wrath by the offering of a gift. The significance of this designation is found in the ceremony performed on the Day of Atonement, held once a year, when blood was sprinkled on the mercy seat to make atonement for the sins of the people of Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lv 16</a>). Because of the importance of this covering on the ark and the ceremony associated with it, the Holy of Holies in which the ark was housed in the temple is termed the “room for the mercy seat” in <a href="?bref=1Chr.28.11">1 Chronicles 28:11</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The term “mercy seat” came into English use from Luther’s German rendering of the Hebrew term, which is difficult to translate appropriately from the Hebrew (cf. <span class="sc">niv</span> “atonement cover” and <span class="sc">nlt</span> “Ark’s cover”).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheMercySeatALidOrCoverOnTheArkOfTheCovenant"/>
<p>The mercy seat measured two and a half cubits (45 inches, or 114.3 centimeters) by one and a half cubits (27 inches, 68.6 centimeters). The cherubim on each end were also made of gold and faced each other with their wings spread upward over the ark. It was in this space above the ark that the Lord’s presence with his people was localized in a special sense, and from which the Lord made his commandments known to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.22">Ex 25:22</a>; cf. also <a href="?bref=Lev.16.2">Lv 16:2</a>). Because of the close association of the Lord’s presence with the space above the ark, he is said to be enthroned between the cherubim (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.4">1 Sm 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.2">2 Sm 6:2</a>). The ark itself contained the tables of stone inscribed with the Ten Commandments that summarized the covenantal obligations of the Israelites to their divine King. When the children of Israel fell short of their covenant obligations by sinning against God and breaking his commands, the blood of the sacrifice sprinkled on the mercy seat made atonement for their sin and reconciled them with God.</p>
<p>The propitiatory or mercy seat points forward to Jesus, who is termed by Paul (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>) the “means of propitiation” through faith in his blood for all who have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Here in <a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Romans 3:25</a> the Greek term translated “propitiation” is the same Greek word consistently used in the Septuagint and in <a href="?bref=Heb.9.5">Hebrews 9:5</a> to translate the Hebrew word for mercy seat in the OT.</p>

<p class="list">1. Noun meaning “strife,” named for a place at Horeb, near Rephidim (Wadi Feiran), where Israel contended with Moses for water near the beginning of the wilderness wanderings (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.7">Ex 17:7</a>). This is the place probably alluded to in <a href="?bref=Deut.33.8">Deuteronomy 33:8</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.95.8">Psalm 95:8</a>, and is alternately called Massah.</p>
<p class="list">2. Another place, near Kadesh-barnea in the wilderness of Zin, where Israel also quarreled with Moses for water, and God again provided it from a rock (<a href="?bref=Num.20.13,24">Nm 20:13, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.27.14">27:14</a>); alternately called Meribath-kadesh in <a href="?bref=Deut.32.51">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>. This episode took place toward the close of the desert wanderings. The waters of Meribah were waters of contention. Here God’s anger was provoked against Moses and Aaron because they did not listen to him and sanctify him before Israel. Instead of speaking to the rock as God commanded, Moses—angered at Israel’s hardness of heart—struck the rock twice with his rod. The psalmist records that here God tested Israel (<a href="?bref=Ps.81.7">Ps 81:7</a>), and Israel’s subsequent rebellion prodded Moses to sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.32">106:32</a>).

<p class="fl">Name meaning “Marduk has given a son!” <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12-19">Second Kings 20:12-19</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-8">Isaiah 39</a> present a parallel account of Merodach-baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sending envoys to King Hezekiah of Judah.</p>
<p>Shalmaneser V, king of Assyria, captured Samaria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> and threatened King Hezekiah in Jerusalem but then died within a year’s time. Sargon II succeeded him in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. At that time Merodach-baladan, living south of Babylon in the land called Bit-Yakin, formed an alliance with the Elamites and seized the throne of Babylon, referred to as the second jewel of the Assyrian crown. Sargon II immediately made efforts to regain Babylon as a province in the Assyrian Empire. He must not have been successful initially, for Merodach-baladan reigned over Babylon for 10 years. In 710 <span class="era">BC</span> Sargon succeeded in defeating him and captured the Babylonian fortresses. Merodach-baladan escaped. After Sargon died in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>, Merodach-baladan, in 703 <span class="era">BC</span>, was able to recapture and hold the throne of Babylon for a short period. It is considered most plausible that during this short reign Merodach-baladan sent envoys to Hezekiah in Jerusalem, as he also is thought to have sent them to Edom, Moab, Ammon, and others, seeking to form an alliance against Assyria. The Arabian desert between Babylon and Palestine made such an alliance ineffective, and the new king of Assyria, Sennacherib, thoroughly destroyed Merodach-baladan and then turned to the nations on Palestinian soil.</p>
<p>Isaiah rebuked Hezekiah for receiving the envoys from Babylon, the province that had broken away from the Assyrian Empire and that in a very short time was again forced into the Assyrian Empire. In Isaiah’s rebuke lies the prediction that Babylon would become the invading and despoiling nation in the future. Hezekiah, knowing Assyria’s power and Babylon’s inability to cope with it at that time, felt quite safe as far as Babylon was concerned (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.19">2 Kgs 20:19</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Site of Joshua’s victory over Jabin, king of Hazor, and his allies, mentioned only twice in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.5-7">Jos 11:5-7</a>). Jabin’s allies included Jobab, the king of Madon, and the kings of Shimron, Achshaph, and the northern hill country, as well as those of the lowland south of the Sea of Galilee. The site of the battle is not clear but a likely place for “the waters of Merom” is near the foot of Har Merom (on modern Israeli maps), or on older maps, Jabel Marun—the highest mountain in Israel (3,962 feet, or 1,207.1 meters). Near the base of the mountain is the town of Merom, where several roads leading into northern Galilee converge. It is on the road between Hazor and Acco on the coast; hence, it was a convenient place for Joshua’s enemies to rendezvous. Merom is about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) southwest of Hazor. The “waters of Merom,” therefore, would be the springs that emerge from the mountain to flow down Wadi Leimun into the Sea of Galilee. Merom is mentioned in Egyptian texts of the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span> associated with the campaigns of Thutmose III. The Assyrian monarch Tiglath-pileser III also reported his expedition into this region in 733–732 <span class="era">BC</span>, at the time when he conquered Damascus. The allied forces defeated by Joshua fled northwest, in the direction of Sidon, suggesting an attack by Joshua from the southeast, from the area west of the Sea of Galilee, the natural approach from the south.</p>

  <title>Mesopotamia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MESOPOTAMIA</p>
<p class="fl">Name given by the Greeks to the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, an area today called al-Jazira, “the island,” by the Arabs. Mesopotamia, which means literally “between the rivers,” is applied to the land between and near those rivers down to the Persian Gulf. Much of it is included in Iraq, but some of it is in Syria, and a small part in Turkey.</p>
<p>Mesopotamia played a significant role in OT history. Much of the tightly compressed account of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-11.32">Genesis 1–11</a> was centered here. The Garden of Eden was situated in this area, for two of the rivers of <a href="?bref=Gen.2.10-14">Genesis 2:10-14</a> are identified as the Euphrates and the Tigris.</p>
<p>The prehistoric cultures of Mesopotamia are unknown. The historical periods are labeled by the names of various cities that dominated them, such as Ur and Isin-Larsa, or by the names of dynasties established in those places, for example, Ur III.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="Mesopotamia"/>
<p>The southernmost part of Mesopotamia is known as Sumer and was populated by the Sumerians, who had a distinctive culture and a non-Semitic language, which was written in cuneiform script, as were most of the other languages of Mesopotamia. Farther north was the district called Akkad, which was also named Agade and had a Semitic population. Still farther north, along the Tigris, was the land that became Assyria, while to the far west was Syria, or Aram, and in between was Mitanni (c. 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>). As portions of Mesopotamia slipped from hand to hand, various sections became parts of different empires, such as Hittite, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek or Hellenistic, and Roman.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew OT the name for Mesopotamia is Aram-naharaim, “Aram of the two rivers.” Abraham sent his servant, Eliezer, to Aram-naharaim to find a wife for Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.10">Gn 24:10</a>). In this context it has been suggested that the two rivers were the Euphrates and the Khabur. The account of the adventures of Jacob in this area does not use the term Aram-naharaim but employs instead the name Paddan-aram, “the field [or garden] of Aram” (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.2">28:2</a>).</p>
<p>Balaam, the son of Beor, was from Pethor in Mesopotamia (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.4">Dt 23:4</a>). During the period of the judges, Cushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia, oppressed Israel for eight years, but the Lord brought deliverance through Othniel (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.8-10">Jgs 3:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>When the Ammonites expected David to invade their territory because they had insulted his ambassadors, they hired chariotry from Mesopotamia and elsewhere to bolster their forces (<a href="?bref=1Chr.19.6">1 Chr 19:6</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT Mesopotamia is mentioned only twice. People from Mesopotamia were present on the day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.9">Acts 2:9</a>). Stephen, in his defense before the Sanhedrin, states that Abraham lived in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.2">Acts 7:2</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.11.31">Gn 11:31</a>).</p>

  <title>Messenger</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MESSENGER</p>
<p class="fl">One who carries a message, a herald. The word “messenger” is used in the Bible in four ways.</p>
<p class="list">1. The word is used of messengers carrying messages from one person to another. Such messengers might bring news (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.22">2 Sm 11:22</a>), requests or demands (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.3">1 Sm 11:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.19">16:19</a>), or act as envoys of one nation to another (<a href="?bref=Isa.37.9">Is 37:9</a>). In the NT we read of messengers of the churches (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.23">2 Cor 8:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.25">Phil 2:25</a>). The blessing of a good messenger is spoken of in <a href="?bref=Pr.25.13">Proverbs 25:13</a>: “Faithful messengers are as refreshing as snow in the heat of summer. They revive the spirit of their employer” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="list">2. The word is used of messengers bringing messages from God. Israel was intended to be God’s messenger but often showed herself blind and deaf (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.19">Is 42:19</a>). Prophets (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.13">Hg 1:13</a>) and priests (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.7">Mal 2:7</a>) were God’s messengers. God sent many such messengers to his people, even though they were often unheeded (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.15-16">2 Chr 36:15-16</a>). In <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</a> we have the prophecy of a special messenger, “Look! I am sending my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger of the covenant, whom you look for so eagerly, is surely coming” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This verse is quoted in the NT in <a href="?bref=Matt.11.10">Matthew 11:10</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.1.2">Mark 1:2</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.7.27">Luke 7:27</a> as fulfilled in John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="list">3. In both the OT and NT the most common word for “messenger” is also that for “angel.” God’s angels are distinctively his messengers. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Angel_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Angel</a>.</p>
<p class="list">4. The word is used in a metaphorical sense, as in <a href="?bref=Pr.16.14">Proverbs 16:14</a>, “The wrath of a king is as messengers of death” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), and in <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.7">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>, where Paul’s constant physical ailment is called “a messenger from Satan to torment” him.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Messiah">
  <title>Messiah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MESSIAH</p>
<p class="fl">Title derived from the Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">mashiach</span><span class="ital">,</span> a verbal adjective meaning “anointed one.” Along with its NT equivalent, <span class="greek">christos</span> (Christ), it refers to an act of consecration whereby an individual is set apart to serve God and then anointed with oil. The verbal root <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">mashach</span><span class="ital">)</span> conveys this idea as well.</p>
<p>Israel’s practice of ceremonially anointing with oil is present in several contexts. Priests were regularly anointed prior to their divinely given service at the altar of sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.3">Lv 4:3</a>). While there is evidence for a literal anointing of prophets (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16">1 Kgs 19:16</a>), this does not appear to have been a standard practice. The anointing of Saul and David by Samuel established the act as a significant prerequisite for Hebrew kings before they assumed their positions of royal leadership. The king was especially considered to be the Lord’s anointed and as such was viewed to hold a secure position before men (<a href="?bref=1Sam.12.14">1 Sm 12:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.21">2 Sm 19:21</a>) and God (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.2">Pss 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.20.6">20:6</a>). Along with numerous messianic prophecies, these proceedings helped inform the Jews of the Anointed One, par excellence, who would eventually come to bring salvation to Israel.</p>
<p>Concluding the 13 articles of Hebraic faith attributed to Moses Maimonides (13th century <span class="era">AD</span>) is the statement still found in many Hebrew prayer books: “I believe with a perfect heart that the Messiah will come; and although his coming be delayed, I will still wait patiently for his speedy appearance.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="MessiahintheOldTestament">Messiah in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish hope for the advent of the Messiah developed dynamically from the period of David’s reign, when it was prophesied that his kingdom would endure to the end of time (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sm 7:16</a>). Israel was told that, through David’s descendants, his throne would exert a never-ending dominion over all the earth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.48-51">2 Sm 22:48-51</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.1-26">Jer 33</a>). It is with this aspect of messianic salvation that Jewish minds have traditionally been preoccupied (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.1.6">Acts 1:6</a>).</p>
<p>Among Orthodox rabbis there has never been a lack of conjecture respecting the details of the Messiah’s ministry. At one time the rabbis applied no less than 456 passages of Scripture to his person and salvation. Preoccupation with the Messiah is evident in the tractate <span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> (Babylonian Talmud), where passages state that the world was created for him and that all the prophets prophesied of his days (<span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 98b, 99a). By and large, Orthodoxy still retains its time-worn belief in the Messiah’s reign in Jerusalem, the rebuilding of the temple, and the reestablishment of both priesthood and sacrifice.</p>
<p>While later Judaism looked for the Messiah as an eschatological figure who will reign at the end of time, modern Jewish thought has largely jettisoned the traditional notion of a personal Messiah in favor of belief in a messianic age. Prevalent liberal Judaism envisions the world ultimately perfected through the influence of the twin Judaic ideals of justice and compassion. Such conviction, ignoring the plight of fallen humans and the teaching of Scripture, substitutes humanistic thinking for miraculous heavenly intervention.</p>
<p>While the Messiah’s origin is linked firmly to the house of David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.14">2 Sm 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.3.5">Hos 3:5</a>), the promise for a Messiah was given long before David lived. In fact, the hope for the Messiah is implicit in the first promise of the establishment of the kingdom of God. Addressed to Satan, <a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Genesis 3:15</a> declares that God will place hostility between the serpent and the woman until, in the fullness of time, the “seed” of the woman inflicts a fatal blow to the head of the serpent.</p>
<p>The nature of messianic prophecy is progressive; each prophecy casts more light on the subject. This occurs, for example, respecting the concept of the “seed”: Messiah is to be born of a woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>), through the line of Shem (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.26">9:26</a>) and specifically through Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.18">22:18</a>). Yet even as late as <a href="?bref=Gen.22.18">Genesis 22:18</a>, the “seed” is not clearly presented as a person, since <span class="hebrew">zerah</span> (seed) may indicate a singular or plural object. Still less apparent in these early stages of messianic prophecy is the nature of the “bruising” that is to occur. Yet the idea of the Messiah being crushed for sin is implicit in the Genesis pronouncement, as is the violence associated with that act. Chief among the messianic prophets, Isaiah gives full range to the axiom that the Anointed One must endure extensive suffering (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.1">Is 53:1</a>). Under the figure “the Servant of the Lord,” four “servant songs” delineate the mission of the future deliverer (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-7">Is 42:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-9">49:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.4-11">50:4-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>). While it is true that Isaiah does not explicitly link the title Messiah with the Servant of the Lord, identifying both figures as one and the same person is justifiable. Both figures are uniquely anointed (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">61:1</a>); each brings light to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Isa.55.4">55:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">49:6</a>); neither is pretentious in his first appearance (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14-15">7:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">11:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.42.3">42:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1">53:1</a>); and the title of Davidic “branch” rests upon them both (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-4">11:1-4</a>). Equally significant are the dual facts of their humiliation and exaltation (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.7">49:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-15">52:13-15</a>). Jewish scholars of the early Christian era in the Aramaic Targum on the prophets paraphrase <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1">Isaiah 42:1</a>, “Behold my Servant Messiah” and begin <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>, “Behold my Servant Messiah will prosper.” While Cyrus may be spoken of as “anointed,” no final salvific work is attributed to him (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.1-5">45:1-5</a>). Israel, although elect and loved by God (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.8">41:8</a>), is ill-equipped as God’s servant to bring his redeeming work to mankind (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.18">42:18</a>). The collapse of David’s dynasty points eloquently to Israel’s need for an anointed monarch who will heal the apostasy and disobedience (<a href="?bref=Exod.33.5">Ex 33:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.1">Hos 4:1</a>). More and more, OT history presents Israel’s comprehensive moral failure. Her problem, which she shares with mankind, can only be solved by the making of a covenant whose surety and focal point is both a personal Savior and sovereign Lord (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>). The advent of such a champion lives in the recorded promise of a shoot from the stump of Jesse’s fallen tree, who will bring the light of life to God’s benighted people (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.2">Is 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">11:1</a>).</p>
<p>It is difficult to get away from the idea that the concept of servanthood and lowliness belongs within the sphere of royalty (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zec 9:9</a>). The concept of the Messiah filling the complementary offices of priest and king is incontrovertible (<a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-4">Ps 110:1-4</a>); a suffering priest-king is far less obvious. Some among the Talmudic writers apparently recognized the likelihood that the Messiah would have to suffer. In the Babylonian Talmud, tractate <span class="ital">Sanhedrin</span> 98b, the Messiah is said to bear sicknesses and pain. Among the prayers for the Day of Atonement may be found the words of Eleazar ben Qalir (perhaps as late as <span class="era">AD</span> 1000): “Our righteous Messiah has departed from us; we are horror-stricken, and there is none to justify us. Our iniquities and the yoke of our transgressions he carries, and is wounded for our transgressions. He bears on his shoulders our sins to find pardon for our iniquities. May we be healed by his stripes.” In a similar vein Rabbi Eliyya de Vidas writes, “The meaning of ‘He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities,’ is that since the Messiah bears our iniquities, which produce the effect of His being bruised, it follows that whosoever will not admit that the Messiah thus suffers for our iniquities must endure and suffer for them himself.” For all this, it is highly doubtful that anyone imagined the Messiah would accomplish his salvational work by means of his own death (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">Is 53:12</a>). When rabbinic speculation failed to satisfactorily harmonize the paradoxical facts of humiliation and exaltation, some hypothesized that God would send a Messiah to suffer as well as a Messiah to reign. Biblically, it is evident that the Anointed One’s terrible ordeal of suffering is but the necessary prelude to infinite glory. He is pictured not only as a great king (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13">52:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">53:12</a>) but also as humble (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.2">53:2</a>), humiliated (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.14">52:14</a>), rejected (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.3">53:3</a>), and bearing the consequences of mankind’s rebellion (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.53.5-6">5-6</a>). Yet he is raised up to intercede for, and richly bless, his people (v <a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">12</a>). The Messiah, having accomplished that full obedience that Adam and Israel failed to achieve, will bring Israel and the nations back to God (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.18-19">42:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.3,6">49:3, 6</a>).</p>
<p>The writings of Daniel contain important messianic data. Daniel is unique in that he boldly speaks of “Messiah the Prince” (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.25">Dn 9:25</a>), identifies him as the “Son of Man” (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">7:13</a>), and says he suffers (“cut off,” <a href="?bref=Dan.9.26">9:26</a>). This statement of the cutting off (i.e., death) of the Messiah makes possible his work of atonement (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.24">9:24</a>). The doctrine of a vicarious substitutionary atonement is the only doctrine of atonement found in the Bible (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.17.11">Lv 17:11</a>). Israel understood that to bear sin meant enduring the consequences, or penalty, for sin (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.14.33">Nm 14:33</a>). The same penal substitution is evident in the working principle of the Messiah’s atoning sacrifice. He is the victim’s substitute to whom is transferred the suffering due the sinner. The penalty having been thus borne vicariously, the suppliant is fully pardoned.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Ps.22.1">Psalm 22:1</a> records the plaintive cry of the Messiah bearing man’s penalty for sin (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Mt 27:46</a>) as he becomes sin on behalf of his people (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>). Yet his cry, “My God,” indicates an intimate relationship that cannot be radically severed. Once again the motif of messianic humiliation prior to great exaltation is in view (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.27">Ps 22:27</a>). In the so-called “royal psalms” (e.g., 2; 72; 110) it is the priestly intercessor who is also ordained to function as monarch and judge.</p>
<p>Jeremiah brings the portrait a step further. The one who will enable humans to enter into a salvational covenant with God conveys God’s imputed righteousness: the Messiah, God’s righteous branch, becomes “the Lord our Righteousness.” Paradoxically, under the law no one could be crucified who was not guilty of sin (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.22">Dt 21:22</a>). But it is Christ the righteous one who was crucified, thereby forever undermining any supposed legalistic confidence (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.23">Dt 21:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>). More than forgiven, believers are deemed righteous in him (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jer 23:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>While the birthplace of the Messiah was well established (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Mi 5:2</a>), his deity was a hotly contested matter. Although few in ancient Israel disputed the belief in a superhuman Messiah, it is doubtful that anyone imagined him to be “God with us” in the fullest sense of the expression (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="MessiahintheNewTestament">Messiah in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT writers present the picture that he who was the child of supernatural origins (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Is 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Mi 5:2</a>) carried the full weight of divinity (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">Is 9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6">Phil 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.19">Col 1:19</a>). He is the Son of God, worthy to receive the worship of all people (<a href="?bref=Ps.45.6-7">Ps 45:6-7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.1.8-9">Heb 1:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>The Jews of first-century Palestine knew that the messianic promise would be fulfilled in the coming of one like Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.18">Dt 18:18</a>). Parallels between Jesus and Moses are abundant. As mediators, innovators, and propagators of new phases of spiritual life for the people, they are unexcelled. Specifically, both are miraculously spared in infancy (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.1-25">Ex 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-23">Mt 2:13-23</a>); both renounce a royal court for the sake of serving the people of God (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.5-8">Phil 2:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.24-28">Heb 11:24-28</a>); both exhibit intense compassion for others (<a href="?bref=Num.27.17">Nm 27:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.36">Mt 9:36</a>); both commune “face to face” with God (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.29-30">Ex 34:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.7">2 Cor 3:7</a>); and each mediates a covenant of redemption (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.1">Dt 29:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.6-7">Heb 8:6-7</a>). But, as Luther observes, “Christ is no Moses.” In the final analysis Moses is but a household servant; the Messiah is the maker and master of all things (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.3-6">Heb 3:3-6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.1.1-2,18">Jn 1:1-2, 18</a>).</p>
<p>Family genealogies are important in Scripture. Rabbis agreed upon the absolute necessity of the Messiah’s Davidic lineage based on <a href="?bref=Hos.3.5">Hosea 3:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.30.9">Jeremiah 30:9</a>. The angelic announcement immediately establishes the correct lineage for Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.32-33">Lk 1:32-33</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.2.4">2:4</a>), as does Matthew’s (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-17">Mt 1:1-17</a>). The Lukan list, like that of Matthew, sets forth the exclusive kingly descent verifying Jesus as Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.23-38">Lk 3:23-38</a>). Although variations occur between the two genealogies, there is a firm solidarity emphasizing an ancestry within the unique messianic stock. Fully aware of the messianic focus of Scripture (<a href="?bref=John.5.46">Jn 5:46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.56">8:56</a>), Jesus acknowledged himself to be the Christ on numerous occasions. He accepted the title from blind Bartimaeus (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.46-48">Mk 10:46-48</a>); from the crowds when he entered Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.9">Mt 21:9</a>); from the children at the temple (v <a href="?bref=Matt.21.15">15</a>); and in other contexts as well (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16-18">Mt 16:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.61-62">Mk 14:61-62</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.21">Lk 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.25-26">Jn 4:25-26</a>). Nonetheless, he warned his disciples not to broadcast his mighty acts as Messiah prior to his resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.9">Mt 17:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.9.20-21">Lk 9:20-21</a>). Owing to the commonly held (but false) notion that the Messiah’s role was primarily that of a political liberator, Jesus actually avoided use of that term and preferred to identify himself as “the Son of Man.” It was by no means assumed that both designations referred to the same person (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.14.61-62">Mk 14:61-62</a>). Borrowing essentially from Daniel’s vision of a heavenly conqueror (<a href="?bref=Dan.7.13-14">Dn 7:13-14</a>), Jesus consistently employed this less-known title and filled it with the true character and scope of messianic salvation. Jesus’ teaching in this regard enabled his disciples to correct their erroneous views concerning his mission (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21-23">Mt 16:21-23</a>). In the fullness of time they would come to see him not only as Messiah but also as the theme of the entire OT (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.17">Mt 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.27,44">Lk 24:27, 44</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.39">Jn 5:39</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.10.7">Heb 10:7</a>). When Jesus expounded the Scriptures beginning with the Torah (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.27">Lk 24:27</a>), he did so as the living exegesis of God, the Word made flesh (<a href="?bref=John.1.14,18">Jn 1:14, 18</a>). Legitimate messianic exposition is found in a host of texts, such as <a href="?bref=Ps.2.1-12">Psalms 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-7">110</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">9:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.10-11">40:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.6">50:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">61:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.1-6">63:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.14-16">33:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.34.23">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.25">37:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.24-27">Daniel 9:24-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1">Hosea 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.2">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.9">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.11.13">11:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.10">12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.7">13:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1">Malachi 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.2">4:2</a>.</p>
<p>The messiahship of Jesus is firmly proclaimed by all four evangelists (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mk 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.26">Lk 24:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.31">Jn 20:31</a>). Peter on Pentecost, Philip before the Ethiopian eunuch, and Apollos in open debate all argue convincingly that Jesus is the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.36">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.35">8:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.28">28:28</a>). Peter says he was “made” both Lord and Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.36">2:36</a>), signifying that the resurrection rightfully confirms him as such. Similarly, the apostle Paul speaks of Jesus’ resurrection as a patent declaration of his inalienable right to the title (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>). For the ex-Pharisee and former persecutor of the church, “Jesus the Christ” is the very heart and soul of Paul’s preaching. Nothing is worthy to be compared to the glory of the Messiah; everything pales by comparison (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.5-10">Phil 3:5-10</a>). The apostle’s all-consuming passion is for others to know the fullness of God in the person of his only Son (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.14-19">Eph 3:14-19</a>).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in Scripture speaks of Jesus with wide-ranging appellatives—Holy One, Judge, Righteous One, King, Son of God, and Lord—but these are not exhaustive. In him all the lines of messianic prediction converge; he is the touchstone whereby their validity is firmly established. The Lord Jesus Christ is himself the heart and substance of that covenant through which sinful people may be reconciled to a holy God (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.6">Is 42:6</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.6">Jn 14:6</a>). That Jesus is the Messiah of Israel, God incarnate, exhaustively fulfills prophecy, type, and symbol—all shadows of his coming. Therefore, all should trust in him, the source of all grace, the only abiding treasure (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.21">Mt 12:21</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.16-17">Jn 1:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.3">Col 2:3</a>). Anointed as prophet, he leads us into all truth (<a href="?bref=John.6.14">Jn 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.16">7:16</a>); as priest he intercedes for us (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.21">Heb 7:21</a>); and as king he reigns over us (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.9-10">Phil 2:9-10</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">People living in Edom (Mt Seir, <a href="?bref=1Chr.4.41-42">1 Chr 4:41-42</a>) who were dispossessed of their rich pasturelands by the Simeonites. Later, Meunites from Edom attacked Judah’s King Jehoshaphat (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.1">2 Chr 20:1</a>); later still, King Uzziah of Judah defeated them (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.7">26:7</a>). Their original land possession, association with Arabs and Ammonites, and prolonged hostility recall <a href="?bref=Judg.10.11-12">Judges 10:11-12</a>, where “Maonites” are named oppressors of Israel. This word, by Hebrew rules of vocalization, could well become “Meunites,” suggesting Maon (Ma’in, Maan) in the Edomite area south of the Dead Sea as their home.</p>
<p>The Meunim are listed among the families of temple servants returning to Jerusalem following the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.50">Ezr 2:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.52">Neh 7:52</a>). However, because ancient enemies seem unlikely temple servants, some suggest that these Meunim were descendants of the Caleb clan within Judah to whom another town named Maon, west of the Dead Sea and south of Hebron, was allotted (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.20,55">Jos 15:20, 55</a>). This Maon gave David refuge and another wife (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.24-28">1 Sm 23:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.25.1-44">25</a>).</p>
<p>This reconstruction involving two groups, two Maons, and temple servants with very foreign names, is tentative. An alternate view holds that hostile foreigners, formerly captured to become temple slaves (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.9.7">Jos 9:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.6-8">Ez 44:6-8</a>), attained freedom during the exile and temple-guild status on returning.</p>

<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Mic.1.1">Micah 1:1</a> says that the word of the Lord came to Micah of Moresheth. Micah was God’s spokesman to the people of his day. Micah is not called a prophet in his book. There is no account of God’s call for him to be a prophet, but he does claim to be God’s witness (v <a href="?bref=Mic.1.2">2</a>). Five times in the book some form of the messenger formula, “thus says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,” is used (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.3">2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.5">3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.6">4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.1,9">6:1, 9</a>), asserting that the message is from God. Micah, like a true prophet, claims, “As for me, I am filled with power and the Spirit of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>. I am filled with justice and might, fearlessly pointing out Israel’s sin and rebellion” (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.8">3:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Micah’s name was common in ancient Israel. At least seven different individuals in the OT are called Micah or Michaiah. The prophet is mentioned by name only in <a href="?bref=Mic.1.1">Micah 1:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.26.18">Jeremiah 26:18</a> in the OT.</p>
<p>The superscription of Micah (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.1">Mi 1:1</a>) gives his hometown as Moresheth, which may be identified with the modern village of Tell el Judeideh about 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem on the road from Azekah to Lachish. Moresheth, in Micah’s time, was a frontier village near the Philistine border city of Gath. As a border town, Moresheth often took the brunt of enemy attacks on Judah from the south and west (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.15">1:15</a>). Such an attack may be reflected in verses <a href="?bref=Mic.1.10-16">10-16</a>, where 12 towns in southwest Judah are named as being in the path of an invader. Moresheth-gath is ninth in that list. Because Micah lived in this border town, he seems to have developed an international concern with “the peoples” (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.2">1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-5,11">4:1-5, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.7-15">5:7-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.16-17">7:16-17</a>). As a citizen of a small town, Micah could identify with peasants and small land holders who were often victims of foreign aggressors and of the politicians and greedy land grabbers in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>). Although Micah may have left Moresheth to live and preach in Jerusalem, he had harsh words for cities (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.5-6">1:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.12">3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.10">4:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.11,14">5:11, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.9">6:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The date for Micah’s ministry was sometime during the reigns of three kings of Judah: Jotham (c. 750–735 <span class="era">BC</span>), Ahaz (c. 735–715 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Hezekiah (c. 715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>). The maximum period covered by the reigns of these three kings was over 60 years (750–686 <span class="era">BC</span>), but it is not likely that Micah was active as a prophet during all of that time. Jeremiah dates Micah’s ministry in the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.18">Jer 26:18</a>). Some of Micah’s oracles seem to predate the fall of Samaria (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.2-7">Mi 1:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.16">6:16</a>), an event that took place in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Assyrians appear to be Israel’s primary enemy in Micah’s time (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.5-6">5:5-6</a>), a situation that prevailed during the reigns of the three kings listed above. Some striking parallel passages between Micah and Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-4">Mi 4:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">Is 2:2-4</a>) and between Micah and Amos (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.10-11">Mi 6:10-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.5-6">Am 8:5-6</a>) make it probable that Micah’s ministry was in the last part of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Audience">Audience</p>
<p class="fl">Micah’s message was universal. It was addressed first in a broad sense to “all the people of the world” (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.2">Mi 1:2</a>), but the focus narrows quickly to the capital cities of Jerusalem and Samaria (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.1">1:1</a>). Other cities in Judah are the object of one oracle (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.10-16">1:10-16</a>). A group of wealthy land grabbers (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.1">2:1</a>), false prophets (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.6-11">2:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.5-7">3:5-7</a>), judges, prophets, priests, and dishonest merchants (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.1,11">3:1, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.10-12">6:10-12</a>) are the objects of other messages.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">In order to understand the book of Micah properly, one needs a knowledge of the Assyrian crisis in the history of ancient Israel. During the early part of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the northern and southern kingdoms of Israel and Judah experienced a period of peace and prosperity under the long and stable reigns of Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Uzziah (792–740 <span class="era">BC</span>). Radical changes in the economic structure occurred within Israel and Judah during this long period. There was a rise of cities and a new wealthy class. Commerce grew enormously. The rich got richer and abused their power over the poor, the priests, and the judges. A class system appeared that struck at the heart of OT covenant religion.</p>
<p>During the reigns of Jeroboam II and Uzziah, Israel and Judah were relatively free from outside intervention. But in 745 <span class="era">BC</span> Tiglath-pileser III became king of Assyria and set out to create an empire. He captured Damascus in 732 <span class="era">BC</span> and made vassals of the small states of Israel, Judah, and Philistia. Tiglath-pileser III died in 727 <span class="era">BC</span> and was succeeded by Shalmaneser V. In 724 <span class="era">BC</span> Hoshea, the last king of Israel, withheld tribute from Assyria and incurred the wrath of the Assyrians. Shalmaneser V began his siege of Samaria in 724 <span class="era">BC</span>, but the people were not subdued until 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. By that time, Sargon II was the king of Assyria. Many of the wealthy and influential people of Samaria were carried into captivity to Assyria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.29-30">2 Kgs 15:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.1-41">17:1-41</a>). Judah did not escape the crisis. Although a fragmentary government of Judean kings was left in Jerusalem by the Assyrians, practically all of their liberties were taken away (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10">2 Kgs 16:10</a>). Judah never fully recovered politically nor religiously from the Assyrian crisis.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandMessage">Purpose and Message</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Micah is made up of about 20 separate sections or oracles. There is a variety of material in the book about different subjects, coming perhaps from different periods. With such variety in the book, it is difficult to speak of <span class="ital">the</span> message of the book. However, certain themes are prominent in the book, the most prominent being judgment. It is coming on Samaria (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.2-6">Mi 1:2-6</a>) and on Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.9-12">3:9-12</a>). It is coming on guilty land grabbers (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.3-5">2:3-5</a>), on false prophets, corrupt judges, and hireling priests (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.5-12">3:5-12</a>). Judgment is coming on the cheater, the violent, the liar, and the deceiver (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.9-12">6:9-12</a>). Judgment is coming on the nations (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.11-13">4:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.5-9,15">5:5-9, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.16-17">7:16-17</a>). Judgment is due to sin (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.5">1:5</a>). Sin takes many forms in Micah, ranging from idolatry (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.7">1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.13">5:13</a>), to practicing the occult (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.12">5:12</a>), to theft (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.11">6:11</a>), to lying (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.12">6:12</a>), to contempt for parents (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.6">7:6</a>), to murder (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.2">7:2</a>).</p>
<p>What is Micah’s remedy for sin? For the nations it is a knowledge of and obedience to the ways of God (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.2">4:2</a>). For Israel it is “to do what is right, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God” (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.8">6:8</a>). All of this is possible because God pardons iniquity and is not always angry. He is a God of compassion who treads iniquities underfoot, casts sins into the depth of the sea, and keeps his covenant with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.18-20">7:18-20</a>). Micah caught a glimpse of the future kingdom of God when he saw that a future ruler of Israel would be born in Bethlehem. He will stand and feed his flock in the strength of the Lord. He will provide security because he will be great to the ends of the earth (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.2-4">5:2-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">Some scholars divide the book into two parts. The first part (chs <a href="?bref=Mic.1.1-5.15">1–5</a>) is addressed primarily to the nations, while the second (chs <a href="?bref=Mic.6.1-7.20">6–7</a>) is addressed primarily to Israel. The first part ends with a threat of judgment on the nations (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.15">5:15</a>) and the second ends with a hymn to the compassion of God. That outline seems too simple, however, and does not cover the diverse materials in the two parts. Other scholars divide the book into three parts: chapters <a href="?bref=Mic.1.1-3.12">1–3</a> (judgment); chapters <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-5.15">4–5</a> (hope); and chapters <a href="?bref=Mic.6.1-7.20">6–7</a> (judgment and hope). Again, this outline is too simple because all three sections contain both judgment and hope. Perhaps it is better to divide the book into three parts beginning with chapters <a href="?bref=Mic.1.1-16">1</a>, <a href="?bref=Mic.3.1-12">3</a>, and <a href="?bref=Mic.6.1-16">6</a>. Each section begins with words of judgment (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.2-2.11">1:2–2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.1-12">3:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.1-7.6">6:1–7:6</a>) and ends on a note of hope (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.12-13">2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-5.15">4:1–5:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.7-20">7:7-20</a>). Such an outline can be valuable in attempting to see the book as a whole, but a closer look at each oracle or unit is needed to interpret the book properly. This discussion marks off each of the 20 units by chapter and verse, identifies its literary form, and determines its major motif or theme.</p>
<p>The first unit, “The Lord Is Coming,” consists of <a href="?bref=Mic.1.2-7">1:2-7</a>. Its form is that of a lawsuit and a theophany. The peoples of the world are called to listen to what the Lord will witness against them. He is described as leaving his heavenly temple to come to earth to tread on top of the mountains that melt under him (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.2-4">1:2-4</a>). God’s coming is due to the sins of the people. Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, is to be destroyed primarily because of idolatry (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.1.5-7">5-7</a>).</p>
<p>The second passage is “The Prophet’s Lament” (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.8-16">1:8-16</a>). The prophet sees an enemy army coming from the southwest. Twelve cities are in its path. Desolation, refugees, and hostages are the result. There is a wordplay on the name of each of the cities except Gath, designed to express the fate of each city. Some of the cities are well known, such as Lachish, Jerusalem, Moresheth-gath, and Adullam. Others cannot be identified. This passage indicates that even though the first oracle was addressed to the nations and specifically announced the fall of Samaria, Judah was the real concern of Micah.</p>
<p>The third passage is “Woe to the Wealthy Wicked” (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.1-5">2:1-5</a>). It is a woe oracle, meaning that it is a message of judgment. This time, judgment is on a certain group of wealthy men who wickedly devise schemes at night to seize houses and lands from unsuspecting farmers. Micah says their plans will boomerang. Their own lands will be snatched from them.</p>
<p>“Micah and the Wealthy Wicked” is the theme of the fourth section (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.6-11">2:6-11</a>). This passage records a dispute between Micah and those who snatched houses and fields from unsuspecting victims. Micah’s wicked listeners could not accept his message of judgment. They found it offensive and commanded him to stop preaching such things. They did not believe that evil would overtake them because they thought God would not do such things (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.2.6-7">6-7</a>). But Micah enumerates a number of crimes of these wicked men, such as taking the robes off travelers’ backs and driving women and children from their homes (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.2.8-9">8-9</a>). Such wicked men follow false prophets (v <a href="?bref=Mic.2.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>The fifth passage is “A Remnant to Be Restored” (<a href="?bref=Mic.2.12-13">2:12-13</a>). The Lord will gather a remnant of his people like sheep in a fold (v <a href="?bref=Mic.2.12">12</a>), then the Lord as their king will lead them out through the gate ahead of them (v <a href="?bref=Mic.2.13">13</a>). This section is open to various interpretations. The passage does not indicate the place where the Lord will gather the remnant. Some assume the place is Babylon and take the passage as a reference to the exile. Others believe the place is Jerusalem and relate the incident to refugees fleeing to Jerusalem before Sennacherib’s invasion in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The sixth passage is about “Guilty Rulers” (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>). Micah charges that the heads and leaders of his people act like cannibals. They should know justice but they hate the good and love evil. They will cry to the Lord, but he will not hear them.</p>
<p>“Peace Prophets and Micah” is another disputation passage (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.5-8">3:5-8</a>). Micah accuses the false prophets of preaching for money and asserts that they have no vision or message from God. By contrast, Micah claims to speak in the power and Spirit of God.</p>
<p>“Corrupt Leaders and Zion’s Fall” is the subject of the eighth passage (<a href="?bref=Mic.3.9-12">3:9-12</a>). This oracle seems to be a summary of all Micah has been saying to the various groups of leaders in Jerusalem. Because of their sins and crimes, Jerusalem and the temple will be destroyed.</p>
<p>“Zion’s Future Exaltation,” the ninth section, contains the surprising announcement of Zion’s fall and the temple’s destruction (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-5">4:1-5</a>). This oracle of salvation was probably deliberately placed after the previous oracle of judgment to indicate that even though the temple might be destroyed, it would be restored in grander style to be the worship center for all nations. A parallel to this passage is found in <a href="?bref=Isa.2.1-4">Isaiah 2:1-4</a>.</p>
<p>“Restoration of a Remnant and Zion” is the subject of the tenth section (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.6-8">4:6-8</a>). The opening phrase, “in that coming day,” indicates that this is an eschatological oracle in that the Lord is seen as reigning over his restored flock in Zion.</p>
<p>The next three passages (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.9-10">4:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.11-13">4:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>) all begin with the word “now” (in the Hebrew) and end with an assertion that the present evil situation will be changed for the better. The first of the three is “From Distress to Deliverance” (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.9-10">4:9-10</a>); the second is “From Siege to Victory” (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.4.11-13">11-13</a>); and the third is “From Helpless Judge to Ideal King” (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>). The last passage in this series is one of the most familiar passages in Micah. It contains the promise of the birth of a new king in Bethlehem who will be great to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>The fourteenth section, “Peace and the Overthrow of Assyria” (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.5-6">5:5-6</a>), is followed closely by “The Remnant among the Peoples” (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.5.7-9">7-9</a>). The remnant is portrayed as dew on plants and as a lion among sheep. Dew on plants is usually taken to signify a blessing, but in <a href="?bref=2Sam.17.12">2 Samuel 17:12</a> it is a metaphor for judgment as a lion is among sheep.</p>
<p>The sixteenth passage is “Purge of the Military and False Religions” (<a href="?bref=Mic.5.10-15">5:10-15</a>). The expressions “cut off,” “throw down,” “cause to perish,” “root out,” and “destroy” suggest radical surgery. It is an oracle on those things that might take the place of God in people’s minds.</p>
<p>“God’s Lawsuit” (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>) is probably the most familiar passage in Micah. It is one of the great summaries of true religion.</p>
<p>The next passage presents “More Charges and the Sentence” (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.9-16">6:9-16</a>). The further charges are dishonest business practices, lying, and acts of violence. The sentence is a life of futility, frustration, scorn, and destruction.</p>
<p>The nineteenth pericope in Micah is a “Lament over a Decadent Society” (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.1-6">7:1-6</a>). The prophet begins with a woe because he seems to be the only godly or righteous man left (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.7.1-2">1-2</a>). He cannot trust anyone. Everyone may be setting a trap for another. People do evil with both hands. Even the members of families rise against each other. Jesus applied the words of <a href="?bref=Mic.7.6">7:6</a> to his own times (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.21,35-36">Mt 10:21, 35-36</a>).</p>
<p>The last section of Micah (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.7-20">Mi 7:7-20</a>) is a prophetic liturgy. It is made up of a psalm of trust (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.7.7-10">7-10</a>); a prophetic promise of restoration (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.7.11-13">11-13</a>); a prayer for God to bless Israel and judge their enemies (vv <a href="?bref=Mic.7.14-17">14-17</a>); and a hymn or a doxology declaring God incomparable in “grace and truth,” showing faithfulness to Jacob and steadfast love to Abraham (v <a href="?bref=Mic.7.20">20</a>).</p>

  <title>Michal</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MICHAL</p>
<p class="fl">Younger daughter of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.49">1 Sm 14:49</a>). She fell in love with David after his defeat of Goliath (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.20">18:20</a>). Saul, jealous of David, offered his first daughter, Merab, to David, but the recent victor graciously declined. When Michal’s love became known to Saul, he renewed his offer of a wife, providing David produce evidence of having killed 100 Philistines—a condition Saul felt would surely lead to David’s death.</p>
<p>David met Saul’s condition in double measure and married Michal. Saul’s jealousy was only fanned, and he plotted to have David murdered. Michal heard of the plot and assisted in her husband’s escape (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.8-17">1 Sm 19:8-17</a>). During David’s exile, Saul gave Michal to Palti (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.44">25:44</a>).</p>
<p>Following Saul’s death, Abner negotiated with David, part of the agreement being the return of Michal to David’s household. This was done despite Palti’s remorse (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.12-16">2 Sm 3:12-16</a>). But youthful ardor had apparently suffered strain. When David returned with the ark to Jerusalem, dancing before it, Michal voiced her harsh criticism. David’s reply was equally severe. Michal would remain childless as punishment for her candidness. (The <span class="sc">kjv</span>, using inferior manuscripts, reports Michal as the mother of five sons in <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.8">2 Samuel 21:8</a>. Adriel, however, was the husband of Merab—a correction reflected in modern versions.)</p>
<p>David’s overwhelming popularity should not overshadow the courage and passion displayed by Michal. She let her love be known when women hardly took the initiative in courtship, saved David’s life at the risk of her own, was emotionally victimized by her forced marriage and separation from Palti, and voiced her critical convictions against the tide of public opinion.</p>

  <title>Michmash*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MICHMASH*</p>
<p class="fl">Town in southern Mt Ephraim near the edge of the wilderness that descends eastward toward the Jordan Valley. Though it must have been an Israelite settlement in the territory of Benjamin, it is absent from the list of Benjamite towns (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.21-28">Jos 18:21-28</a>). The ancient name is preserved in that of the Arab village of Mukhmas, situated on a narrow ridge to the east of Wadi Suweinit (valley of Zeboim) overlooking the deep canyon through which it runs. It is about two miles (3.2 kilometers) northeast of Geba (Jaba’), which stands on the western side of the same valley. A lateral road passed by Michmash to Jericho, and a longitudinal road also followed the watershed beside it. The latter route was of only secondary importance but still could serve as an alternate to the main route, the highway west of Bethel.</p>
<p>The town played its best-documented role in biblical history during the reign of Saul. When he mustered his troops, part were with him in Michmash while the rest were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.2">1 Sm 13:2</a>). After Jonathan had smitten the Philistine commissioner at Geba, the Philistines came out in force and encamped at Michmash (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.5">5</a>) since Saul had withdrawn to Gilgal to assemble the rest of his forces. Then he went back to Geba, on the opposite side of the valley from the enemy. Using their base at Michmash (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.11,16">11, 16</a>), the Philistines sent out raiding parties north to Ophrah, west to Beth-horon, and southeast along the edge of the valley of Zeboim (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.17-18">17-18</a>); this passage serves to illustrate the value of Michmash as a strategic crossroads.</p>
<p>An outpost south of Michmash was manned by Philistines facing the Israelites on the opposite ridge (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.23">1 Sm 13:23</a>). Jonathan went out to the canyon where the two cliffs Bozez (on the side of Michmash) and Seneh (beside Geba) face one another. He and his armor bearer made a surprise attack on an outpost of soldiers, who then fled to Michmash. The resultant confusion among the Philistines was taken advantage of by Saul and his troops (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.1-23">14:1-23</a>). The Philistines withdrew under heavy Hebrew harassment by way of the lateral road via the Aijalon Valley (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.31">31</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MIDIAN, MIDIANITE</p>
<p class="fl">Person, place, or people, the latter living on the eastern edge of Gilead, Moab, and Edom south into northwest Arabia. They had few, if any, permanent settlements.</p>
<p>Midian and his descendants figure prominently only in the early history of Israel, in connection with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.1-6">Gn 25:1-6</a>), Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-36">37:25-36</a>), Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.15-3.1">Ex 2:15–3:1</a>), Balaam (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-6">Nm 22:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">25</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.1-20">31:1-20</a>), and Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-8.28">Jgs 6:1–8:28</a>).</p>
<p>Midian was Isaac’s younger half brother, the fourth of six sons born to Keturah, whom Abraham married as an old man (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.1-2">Gn 25:1-2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-2">23:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.24.67">24:67</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.32">1 Chr 1:32</a>). By calling Midian and his full brothers “the sons of Keturah” (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.4">Gn 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.32-33">1 Chr 1:32-33</a>), the Bible carefully distinguishes them from Isaac, the son of Sarah, who was the one through whom God’s promise to Abraham would be fulfilled (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-21">17:15-21</a>). In fact, Abraham and the Israelites regarded these other sons as having no more inheritance rights than a concubine’s sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.5-6">Gn 25:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.31">1 Chr 1:31</a>).</p>
<p>Expelled from Abraham’s family, for Isaac’s sake, they became seminomadic peoples of the deserts east and south of Palestine (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.5-6">Gn 25:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLandofMidian">The Land of Midian</p>
<p class="fl">Of uncertain location, Midian was probably far south of Edom on the eastern side of what is today called the Gulf of Aqaba. The Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy (second century <span class="era">AD</span>) mentions a city named Modiana on the coast and a Madiana 26 miles (41.8 kilometers) inland (modern el-Bed’) in this region, an identification supported by the Jewish historian Josephus (first century <span class="era">AD</span>) and the Christian church historian Eusebius (early fourth century).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="MosesFleesfromEgypttoMidian"/>
<p>In early OT times Midian seems to have been the land on the edge of the deserts bordering Gilead, Moab, and Edom south even into eastern Sinai.</p>
<p>In Joseph’s day, some Midianite clans must have lived in the northern Transjordanian desert adjacent to Gilead or Bashan because they were part of an Ishmaelite caravan traveling the trade route from Damascus across Gilead past Dothan to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.17,25-28,36">Gn 37:17, 25-28, 36</a>).</p>
<p>When Moses fled from Pharaoh, he settled in Midian and eventually married Zipporah, the daughter of a Midianite priest (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.15-22">Ex 2:15-22</a>). Moses asked his Midianite relative Hobab to act as a guide from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.19">Dt 1:19</a>); Hobab was familiar with the wilderness of Paran (<a href="?bref=Num.10.11-12,29-31">Nm 10:11-12, 29-31</a>), even though his own land and relatives were elsewhere (v <a href="?bref=Num.10.30">30</a>).</p>
<p>In the Balaam episode and its bloody aftermath (<a href="?bref=Num.22.31">Nm 22:31</a>), a substantial group of Midianites appears to have been living on the eastern frontier of Moab. The Moabite king Balak, who was subject to the Amorite king named Sihon (<a href="?bref=Num.21.26-30">21:26-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.45">Jer 48:45</a>), discussed the Israelite threat with the elders of Midian, and a joint delegation was sent to Balaam (<a href="?bref=Num.22.2-7">Nm 22:2-7</a>). At Acacia in the plains of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1">Nm 22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.25.1">25:1</a>), an Israelite met and married a Midianite princess (<a href="?bref=Num.25.6-18">Nm 25:6-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.8">31:8</a>). The Midianite kings were considered puppet kings of King Sihon (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.21">Jos 13:21</a>). All the indications are that Midianite clans lived nearby, on the borders of Moab. Since Moab is north of Edom, the reference to an Edomite victory over Midian (<a href="?bref=Gen.36.35">Gn 36:35</a>) might indicate a northern encroachment by the Midianites on Edomite territory.</p>
<p>The Midianite invasion that Gideon repulsed had all the appearances of an invasion from the east. It would therefore seem that while “the land of Midian” is a term that may refer to a territory south of Edom, Midianites were living over a much wider area—on marginal land—east of Moab and Edom and south of Edom into east Sinai and northwest Arabia.</p>

  <title>Midrash*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MIDRASH*</p>
<p class="fl">Transliteration into English of a Hebrew word that occurs twice in 2 Chronicles. <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.22">Second Chronicles 13:22</a> refers to the literary source used for recording the reign of King Abijah of Judah (913–910 <span class="era">BC</span>) as the “midrash” of the prophet Iddo. <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.27">Second Chronicles 24:27</a> mentions, in connection with the reign of King Joash of Judah (835–796 <span class="era">BC</span>), the “midrash” of the book of the kings.</p>
<p>Although these are the only times that midrash is mentioned in Chronicles, they do fall into a pattern of appeals to literary sources. For instance, Chronicles often cites <span class="ital">The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah</span> or the like (e.g., <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.11">2 Chr 16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.34">20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.27.7">27:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.18">33:18</a>). It is probable that the title in <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.27">2 Chronicles 24:27</a> incorporating the term “midrash” is just a variant title of a main source. Again, Chronicles often alludes to various prophetic sources; the otherwise unknown prophet Iddo features also in a work called <span class="ital">The Visions of Iddo the Seer</span> in connection with the reign of Jeroboam I of Israel (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.29">2 Chr 9:29</a>), and also <span class="ital">The Record of Shemaiah the Prophet,</span> with reference to King Rehoboam of Judah (930–913 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.15">2 Chr 12:15</a>). Here, too, it is probable that a single prophetic work is labeled with different names.</p>
<p>But what did the term “midrash” mean, precisely, to the author of Chronicles? The ancient Greek version translated it simply as “book, writing,” and it is likely that it meant nothing more than that. The underlying Hebrew verb means to inquire or study, and accordingly the noun could signify “a result of research, a study.” Alternatively, it may mean “commentary” in the sense of a presentation of history from a certain perspective.</p>
<p>Apart from these instances in Chronicles, the other usage of importance for the OT is its meaning as a procedure or product of interpretation of the biblical text, which was eventually incorporated into the Jewish commentaries called Midrashim. In the literature of Qumran, midrash appears in the general sense of “interpretation of the law.” But in later rabbinic literature it became a technical term for a collection of traditional teachings of the rabbis arranged in order of chapter and verse of biblical books. The overall aim of these studies was to apply the ancient text to contemporary circumstances in a variety of ways.</p>

Some scholars who think the exodus route must have taken the Israelites south into the Sinai Mountains think these three sites were somewhere near Suez. Others who think the Serbonitic Lake is the Reed Sea accept the identification of this Migdol with that mentioned by Jeremiah as the dwelling place of exiled Jews in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.1">Jer 44:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.14">46:14</a>).

Not all scholars agree on whether Migdol is a single location or two separate locations. Nonbiblical sources refer to Migdol—for example, Papyrus Anastasi 5.19, where it appears in association with Succoth in a message about runaway slaves. It also appears on the wall relief of Seti I as a fortress between Sillo (Sele) and the other northern Sinai forts. The Antonine Itinerary places Magdolo between Pelusium and Sele, which would make the equation with Tell el-Heir, 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) north, most likely.</p>

<p class="h1">MILETUM*, MILETUS </p>
<p class="fl">Important Greek city located at the mouth of the Meander River. It was settled by Crete as early as 1339–1288 <span class="era">BC</span>. Miletus had contact with the Hittite Empire. Her king, in fact, was claimed as a vassal by the Hittite ruler. Excavations indicate that Miletus, once destroyed by fire, was later surrounded by a defensive wall (13th century <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Miletus was attacked by the kingdom of Lydia around 650 <span class="era">BC</span> and ruled by a military dynasty headed by King Gyges. Its citizens still managed, however, to colonize Abydos on the narrows of the Dardenelles. Over 70 such colonies were founded by the merchants of Miletus along the Black Sea, the most important being Sinope. Miletus became an important city, therefore, in the ancient world. Her traders carried the furniture and woolens for which she was known to many foreign ports.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientTheaterInMiletus"/>
<p>The city had its own poet, like many other Greek centers, famous in his own time but known today only in a few verses. Phocylides wrote: “A little city on a rock, with order, is better than madness in Nineveh.” Again, “all virtue is summed up in justice.”</p>
<p>Miletus was also the birthplace of philosophy and scientific speculation. The philosopher Thales predicted an eclipse in 585 <span class="era">BC</span>, and his disciple, Anaximander, propounded evolution from sea creatures. Much of the city’s strength, however, was wasted on bitter civil strife. Two parties, known as the rich and the workers, kept the city torn by inner feuding. In approximately 495 <span class="era">BC</span>, the city was sacked by the Persians and never again regained world importance, though it was retaken by Alexander.</p>
<p>Miletus was, of course, well known in NT times, though it was not an important center to early Christianity. The apostle Paul stopped there on the last missionary journey recorded in the book of Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.15-17">Acts 20:15-17</a>). While there, he called for the Ephesian elders and exhorted them to care for the flock in their charge (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.20.28-35">28-35</a>). From Miletus he sailed for Tyre. <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.20">Second Timothy 4:20</a> says that Paul left Trophimus in Miletus (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Miletum”) because he was sick.</p>

<p class="h1">MILL</p>
<p class="fl">Two circular stones (millstones) used in the grinding of grain. The grinding of grain as depicted in ancient art is attested in archaeological excavations in the Middle East from at least the Neolithic period (c. 8300–4500 <span class="era">BC</span>) in the shape of various concave stones with flat grinding pieces accompanying them. These were essentially handmills. Over the centuries improvements in technique took place. But two elements were always necessary, the lower one on which the grain was spread and the upper one, which was moved over the surface of the lower one under pressure, to grind the grain into flour. The Hebrew term for “mill” is grammatically a dual—that is, it refers to two elements.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Millstone"/>
<p>The earliest mill, the saddle quern, consisted of a rough base stone, slightly concave, and a convex rubbing stone. The base stone varied from 18 to 30 inches (45.7 to 76.2 centimeters) across with one end a little thicker than the other. It was known in Hebrew as “the underneath portion” (<a href="?bref=Job.41.24">Jb 41:24</a>). The upper stone, called the “rider portion” (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.53">Jgs 9:53</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.21">2 Sm 11:21</a>), varied from 6 to 15 inches (15.2 to 38.1 centimeters) in length and was flat on one side and convex on the other. It could be held easily in the hand. Grinding was done by pushing the upper stone backward and forward over the grain, which lay on the lower stone. Only a small quantity of grain could be ground at one time using this method (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.6">Gn 18:6</a>).</p>
<p>A second type of handmill consisted of two round stones. The lower one could be either convex or concave on top and the upper one was either concave or convex so as to fit nearly over the lower stone. Some examples of this type of mill have a funnel-shaped hole in the center of the top stone through which grain was poured. The upper mill was turned on the lower one by means of a wooden peg inserted on its outside edge. As the grain was crushed, it escaped along the edges of the upper stone. Commonly the stone used was black basalt because its rough and porous surface provided good cutting edges. The normal type of handmill could be operated by one person, but sometimes two persons were required (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.41">Mt 24:41</a>).</p>
<p>So important was the handmill in the life of the people that it was prohibited by law to take a man’s millstone as a pledge against the payment of a debt, for this would deprive his family of the means of making flour for bread (<a href="?bref=Deut.24.6">Dt 24:6</a>). These stones were heavy enough to kill a man when thrown on his head, as in the case of Abimelech (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.53">Jgs 9:53</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.21">2 Sm 11:21</a>).</p>
<p>Normally, the grinding of grain was the task of servants (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.5">Ex 11:5</a>) or of women (<a href="?bref=Isa.47.2">Is 47:2</a>). The noise of grinding could be heard each day in every village in Palestine. When that sound ceased, the village had come to an end (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.10">Jer 25:10</a>).</p>
<p>There seems to have been larger community mills that required animal power. A heavy round stone, perhaps four to five feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) in diameter, was rolled on its edge by means of a pole through its center. This pole rotated around a vertical post in much the same way as one finds in some Eastern lands even today. It may have been a large mill of this type that Samson was forced to use to grind grain for the Philistines (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.21">Jgs 16:21</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">MILLENNIUM*</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical term (taken from the Latin word meaning “a thousand”) referring to the thousand-year reign of Christ. The primary biblical context for the doctrine of the millennium is found in <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-6">Revelation 20:1-6</a> (where the Greek word for thousand is used five times). The idea of a thousand-year reign may also be supported by passages such as <a href="?bref=Acts.3.19-21">Acts 3:19-21</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23-26">1 Corinthians 15:23-26</a>, which speak of a future restoration and reign of Christ. This doctrine, however, is explicitly taught only in the book of Revelation, and is characterized by differences of interpretation, as well as considerable uncertainty about its importance.</p>
<p>The <span class="ital">a</span>millennial (<span class="ital">no</span> millennium, at least of a visible, earthly nature) interpretation stresses the symbolism of Revelation and holds that now, during the present age, Satan is bound and the church is experiencing the millennium. Perhaps the most serious difficulty with the amillennial view is that it interprets the two resurrections of <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a> differently. Though the same Greek word is used for both, the first (v <a href="?bref=Rev.20.4">4</a>) is interpreted as a spiritual resurrection, and the second (v <a href="?bref=Rev.20.5">5</a>) as a physical resurrection, while the passage itself does not indicate that the writer intended a difference of meaning. Hence, the amillennial position is often accused of improperly spiritualizing the meaning of the Bible. Another perspective on the <span class="ital">a</span>millennial position is that the thousand-year reign of Christ is a symbolic expression of Christ’s unlimited rule—as opposed to an actual reign of 1,000 years.</p>
<p>The <span class="ital">post</span>millennial (Christ will return <span class="ital">after</span> the millennium) view sees the progress of the gospel as producing the millennium. The essential idea in this interpretation is progress. It may be held that this era of peace is yet future or that it began with the first advent of Christ and is continuing on until the gospel triumphs over the world, with the majority being won to Christianity. However, the variant forms of postmillennialism stress that Christ does not return until <span class="ital">after</span> the millennium. It is not the second coming of Christ and his visible presence that brings about the millennium.</p>
<p>Different from the above two views is the <span class="ital">pre</span>millennial (Christ returns <span class="ital">before</span> the millennium) interpretation, which maintains that Christ will return to earth and establish his peaceful reign in a visible and powerful manner.</p>
<p>The premillennialist emphasizes that the visions of the book of Revelation must be interpreted sequentially. First is the return of Christ in chapter <a href="?bref=Rev.19.1-21">19</a>, followed by the binding of Satan for a thousand years and the first resurrection of the saints to reign with Christ for the thousand years (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-6">20:1-6</a>). This, in turn, is followed by a release of Satan and the battle of those deceived—“Gog and Magog”—against Christ and his people and the final destruction of the devil (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.20.7-10">7-10</a>). Next is the account of the final judgment and the last resurrection (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.20.11-15">11-15</a>), followed by the new heaven and new earth (ch <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">21</a>).</p>
<p>The premillennialist strongly affirms that this sequence demands that the millennium, the reign of Christ, be understood as a real, future event following Christ’s return. None of the variations of amillennialism or postmillennialism that see the millennium in the present church age before Christ returns or even in the future before Christ comes again, adequately accounts for the sequence of events in Revelation.</p>
<p>In addition to the literary argument, there is the theological point that the premillennial position places the real triumph of Christ within history. That is, the victory that the church believes was accomplished through Christ’s death on the cross will be made visible to the world and the forces of evil at Christ’s return and reign on earth. This is not faith in a merely spiritual or heavenly triumph, but faith that God will genuinely intervene in the course of the world to bring justice and peace.</p>
<p>However, implicit within this is the greatest weakness of the premillennial viewpoint. The Bible does not explain the details of how Christ and his resurrected saints will reign over an earth not yet made new and over nations still living in their natural state. This unresolved problem has led many interpreters to explain <a href="?bref=Rev.20.1-15">Revelation 20</a> by one of the other interpretations.</p>

<p class="h1">MIND</p>
<p class="fl">One’s intellectual processes in a narrow sense or, more broadly, the sum total of a person’s mental and moral state of being. To the Hebrew way of thinking, there is no distinctive terminology for the concept of the mind. To the Greek world, the mind plays a very important role in the understanding of humans.</p>
<p>Since in the OT there was no separate word that could be used for the human mind, translators of the English versions have supplied other words (“soul,” “spirit,” or “heart”), as the context dictates. Thus, precise distinctions among these terms are hard to define. A person is a soul, having a spirit and a heart. Any of these terms may represent the mind. This means that the widely held distinction between the mind as the seat of thinking and the heart as the seat of feeling is alien to the meanings these terms carry in the OT.</p>
<p>While the “mind” denotes a person’s thoughts, the prominent idea of “mind” in the OT is that it denotes the heart (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.35">1 Sm 2:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.11.5">Ez 11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.32">20:32</a>). The heart is often intended to include the entire inner person and thus often relates especially to the mind. In these instances it relates primarily to the functions of will and memory (<a href="?bref=Isa.46.8">Is 46:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.65.17">65:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.3.16">Jer 3:16</a>).</p>
<p>The basic patterns of Hebrew reasoning continue in the Gospel accounts. The conception of mind appears quite rarely. When used, it is mostly in connection with the heart—for example, the imaginations of the heart (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.51">Lk 1:51</a>). The only other occurrences of the word “mind” come in the statement of the great commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind” (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.22.37">Mt 22:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.30">Mk 12:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.27">Lk 10:27</a>). The Gospel writers are unanimous in their agreement that Jesus added “with all your mind” to <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>. In Mark, however, the questioner repeats the command of Jesus but with a word for “understanding” in place of the word for “mind” (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.33">Mk 12:33</a>).</p>
<p>With the writings of Paul, one moves into the Greek world. Paul understood the mind as distinct from the spirit of man. It possesses the ability to understand and to reason (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.14-19">1 Cor 14:14-19</a>); it is the seat of intelligence. In other places, “mind” is used in a broader sense that includes the entire mental and moral process or state of being of a human (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.23">Eph 4:23</a>). A human’s actions flow from the inclinations of his or her mind. Whether a person is good or evil depends on the state of the mind.</p>
<p>The state of a person depends upon what or who controls the mind. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.6-7">Romans 8:6-7</a> speaks of a person’s mind being controlled either by the flesh or by the Spirit. The person whose mind is controlled by the flesh is evil. The mind controlled by the Spirit leads to good. Other passages refer to the inclination of a person’s mind being controlled by the god of this world (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4">2 Cor 4:4</a>). People whose minds are controlled by the “god of this world” will have their minds darkened and will not be able to understand the world as it really is (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.14">3:14</a>). It is as a veil over one’s understanding. But the Lord can open people’s minds. For example, Jesus opened the minds of the disciples who walked the Emmaus road with him so that they might understand the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.45">Lk 24:45</a>).</p>
<p>For Paul, the action of conversion is considered to be a “renewing of the mind” (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.2">Rom 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.23">Eph 4:23</a>). In both cases, the process is one whereby God takes control of the mind of a person through the Holy Spirit and leads the thoughts of that person into proper channels. Thus, the renewed person is given power to make proper value judgments. Such people have new minds with which to make spiritual discernments (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.15-16">1 Cor 2:15-16</a>).</p>

  <title>Minerals* and Metals</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MINERALS* AND METALS</p>
<p class="fl">A “mineral” is a naturally occurring substance, normally an ore that must be mined and treated before the metal can be extracted. A “metal” is a chemical element such as iron or copper, which is free from contamination by other materials. Metals in a pure form generally do not occur in nature, though there are exceptions.</p>
<p>In Palestine, mining and smelting are ancient arts, practiced long before the Israelites arrived. The quarrying of suitable stones, such as flint, for toolmaking goes back to the Stone Age; the quarrying of stone for building is also an ancient craft. In particular, metals, native gold, copper, and meteoric iron were known and used in the Middle East before 4000 <span class="era">BC</span>. From 4000 to 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>, native silver became known as well as copper and lead ores. The art of smelting was discovered probably almost by accident, resulting in the production of alloys like bronze. Then the reduction of oxidized iron was discovered. From 3000 to 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>, important advances were made. Copper sulfides and tin oxides were reduced to metal, and metallic tin and copper became important items of trade.</p>
<p>In the years 2000 to 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>, bellows came into use for furnaces, and iron was reduced from its ores and forged. The art of making brass from copper and zinc was discovered about 1500 <span class="era">BC</span> but did not become significant till somewhat later. Bronze, known for many centuries, was made sometimes with a high tin content to form speculum for mirrors. By this time the Israelites were settled in the land and the kingdom was established. From 1000 <span class="era">BC</span> to the start of the Christian era, the production of metals, especially iron, greatly expanded. A form of steel was made and used for weapons and tools.</p>
<p>By the time of David and Solomon, the Israelites had learned many skills in the preparation and working of metals. Under David, Edom, with its rich copper and iron deposits, was conquered (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.13-14">2 Sm 8:13-14</a>) and there was a lot of activity in the casting of metals in the Jordan Valley (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.13-14,45-46">1 Kgs 7:13-14, 45-46</a>). In this activity Solomon had the assistance of Hiram, a Phoenician artisan. Israelite tradition associated the origins of metallurgy with Tubal-cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.22">Gn 4:22</a>), who is said to have forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. <a href="?bref=Deut.8.9">Deuteronomy 8:9</a> refers to the presence of iron and copper in the land to which Israel was going.</p>
<p>While the Israelites eventually undertook their own metalworking processes, it is evident from <a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-22">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a> that on at least one occasion, in the days of Philistine domination, they were obliged to have their agricultural tools made by their enemies. Similarly, the manufacture of cult vessels for Solomon’s temple was supervised by Phoenician artisans (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.13-50">1 Kgs 7:13-50</a>).</p>
<p>Minerals, metals, and precious stones were also important items of trade. Israel was never a land rich in these commodities and was obliged to import a wide variety of them. The visit of the queen of Sheba was partly diplomatic and partly for trade (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2,10-11">1 Kgs 10:2, 10-11</a>).</p>
<p>Metals and precious stones featured also among the booty carried off by invaders, notably—but not only—by the Egyptians and Assyrians. These items were in constant demand as they were needed for agriculture and making weapons of war, and for the manufacture of jewelry and items of personal adornment.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Minerals">Minerals</p>
<p class="fl">A mineral is an inorganic substance with a definite chemical composition and structure, sometimes occurring alone or sometimes combined with others. “Ore” refers to any mineral or mineral aggregate containing chemical compounds of metals in sufficient quantity and grade to make the extraction of the metal commercially profitable. The essential element, the metal, occurs in nature as a chemical compound, such as a sulfide, an oxide, a carbonate, or some other compound, though the sulfides and oxides are the most common. Minerals exhibit a variety of properties, such as color, luster, crystal form, cleavage, fracture, hardness, and density, which help in their identification and exercise control on the commercial and industrial uses of the particular mineral.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Metals">Metals</p>
<p class="fl">A metal in its pure form is a chemically pure element with its own fixed physical properties, such as density, tensile strength, crystalline structure, melting point, ductility, conductivity, and the like. Metals form alloys with other metals, but this process destroys their purity. In both the ancient world and the modern world the alloy is extremely important.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a pure metal, the ore in which the metal is contained must be smelted—a process known as metallurgy. In ancient Israel pure metals were widely used—among them were gold, silver, iron, and lead. Yet alloys such as bronze and brass were even more widely used.</p>
<p class="h3">Metallurgy and Metal Extraction</p>
<p class="fl">The method of producing hard wrought iron was discovered by the Hittites of Asia Minor about 1300 <span class="era">BC</span>, and was taken up by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-20">1 Sm 13:19-20</a>). At first, the iron obtained from simple furnaces was drawn off and hammered to drive out slag (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.20">Dt 4:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.51">1 Kgs 8:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.4">Jer 11:4</a>). Later, the addition of carbon produced an early form of steel.</p>
<p>The lead sulfide ore is heated with lime in a flow of air. A slag with rock particles forms. The air is then cut off and the temperature is raised. Finally, the lead flows free.</p>
<p>The OT refers to the mining of silver (<a href="?bref=Job.28.1">Jb 28:1</a>), the refining of the metal (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.9">Zec 13:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.3">Mal 3:3</a>), the melting of scrap metals or jeweler’s remnants (<a href="?bref=Ezek.22.20-22">Ez 22:20-22</a>), and of multiple refinings in a crucible (<a href="?bref=Pr.17.3">Prv 17:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.27.21">27:21</a>) to produce refined silver (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.4">1 Chr 29:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.12.6">Ps 12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.20">Prv 10:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Specific Metals</p>
<p class="fl">Although several OT passages suggest that the science of metallurgy was known in biblical times, comparatively little archaeological evidence is available. The processing plants were small and were used for the treatment of copper and iron. The archaeological record is far from complete, but the general impression is that metallic ores were comparatively rare in Palestine; imports must have been considerable. However, numerous molds for casting agricultural and military tools have come to light in excavations. Evidently, some refined metal was available locally, but perhaps most of it was imported. The metal was then heated and poured into the appropriate earthenware or pottery mold.</p>
<p>There are many references to metals in the Bible, but especially to gold, silver, iron, and lead. While copper was widely used, it was normally in the form of its alloys, bronze and brass. There are comparatively few references to tin as such, though it was used in manufacturing bronze. Similarly zinc, though used in the manufacture of brass, is not mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p>Gold is referred to hundreds of times in the OT and NT, more frequently than any other metal. It is often mentioned together with silver, and in the majority of cases silver is mentioned first, reflecting a time when gold was less valued.</p>
<p>Gold was used in the manufacture of ornaments for personal use (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.53">Gn 24:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">41:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.22">Ex 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.11.2">11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.35">12:35</a>). Gold was important in worship both in Israel and among the non-Israelites. References to pagan gods occur in several passages (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.23">Ex 20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.32.2-4">32:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.115.4">Ps 115:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.20">Is 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.22">30:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.31.7">31:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.40.19">40:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.6">46:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.4">Hos 8:4</a>). It seems that the gold was melted down and later engraved so that the replicas could be called both molten images (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.24">Ex 32:24</a>) and graven images. The tabernacle and the temple used a great deal of gold. The wooden ark was covered inside and outside with gold (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.11">25:11</a>). Other timber pieces were overlaid with gold (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.11">25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.20-22,30">1 Kgs 6:20-22, 30</a>).</p>
<p>The vessels and utensils used in the tabernacle and temple were made of “pure gold”: the cherubim (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.18">Ex 25:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.7">37:7</a>), the mercy seat (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.17">25:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.6">37:6</a>), the candlestick (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.31">Ex 25:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.4.2">Zec 4:2</a>), various vessels (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.38">Ex 25:38</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.13">2 Kgs 24:13</a>), chains to carry the ephod (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.14">Ex 28:14</a>), and the bells on the high priest’s robe. The high priest’s crown, ephod, and breastplate were also of gold (<a href="?bref=Exod.39.2-30">39:2-30</a>). The offerings collected for the manufacture of such articles in the wilderness include golden dishes weighing 120 shekels (<a href="?bref=Num.7.86">Nm 7:86</a>). The more lavishly adorned temple apparently used more gold than the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.20-28">1 Kgs 6:20-28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.2-7">1 Chr 29:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.4-4.22">2 Chr 3:4–4:22</a>). The number of specific references to gold in the tabernacle and temple is far too great to mention all of them here. The large amount of gold used in the temple was attractive to invaders, who would strip the temple of its gold and carry it off as booty (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.26">1 Kgs 14:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.8">2 Kgs 16:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.14">18:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.13">24:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.15">25:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.9">2 Chr 12:9</a>).</p>
<p>Gold had commercial value. It was imported in Solomon’s day, and up to 666 talents were brought to Israel annually (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.14">1 Kgs 10:14</a>). Hiram of Tyre gave Solomon 120 talents of gold (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.14">9:14</a>), possibly as a loan. Certainly Solomon used a lot of gold in the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.16-17">10:16-17</a>). Gold was useful, too, for buying off an enemy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.8">2 Kgs 16:8</a>) or simply as tribute (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.14">18:14</a>). Evidence of this comes also from the Assyrian annals, where the tribute taken from various lands often included gold.</p>
<p>The possession of gold was not in itself an evil thing, but preoccupation with its accumulation was condemned (<a href="?bref=Job.28.15-17">Jb 28:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.14">Prv 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.8.10,19">8:10, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.16">16:16</a>). The possession of wisdom and the knowledge of God was of greater value than the possession of much gold (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.10">Pss 19:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.72,127">119:72, 127</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.15">Prv 20:15</a>). Job rejected trust in gold (<a href="?bref=Job.31.24">Jb 31:24</a>). Gold would not save a man in the day of judgment (<a href="?bref=Zeph.1.18">Zep 1:18</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT gold was regarded as perishable (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.3">Jas 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18">1 Pt 1:18</a>) and as an unnecessary burden to carry (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.9">Mt 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.6">Acts 3:6</a>). The wearing of a gold ring was certainly no measure of a man’s worth (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.2">Jas 2:2</a>); indeed, both Paul and Peter forbade it (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.9">1 Tm 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.3">1 Pt 3:3</a>).</p>
<p>The use of gold in itself was no measure of piety. The elders of <a href="?bref=Rev.4.4">Revelation 4:4</a> wore golden crowns, but the great harlot was “bedecked with gold” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.4">Rv 17:4</a>), as was the harlot city Babylon (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.16">18:16</a>). By contrast, there are some positive statements in the NT about the value of gold (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.18">3:18</a>). The wise men brought gold to the infant Jesus as a symbol of his kingly character (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.11">Mt 2:11</a>), and the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, was a city of gold, clear as glass (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.18">Rv 21:18</a>).</p>
<p>In the OT, silver is mentioned in several connections. Being a precious metal, once considered more precious than gold, it was regularly used in commerce for the payments of debts. Small pieces of silver were weighed into a balance against a standard weight. Abraham bought the cave at Machpelah as a burial place for Sarah for 400 shekels of silver and weighed out the “money” according to the weight’s current value with the merchant (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.15-16">Gn 23:15-16</a>). Joseph’s brothers received 20 pieces of silver in payment for Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.28">37:28</a>), and Benjamin was given a money gift by Joseph in pieces of silver (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.22">45:22</a>).</p>
<p>There are other examples of payment in silver for commodities or services (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.16">Gn 20:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.21.32">Ex 21:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.27.16">Lv 27:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.17.10">Jgs 17:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.24">2 Sm 24:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.72">Neh 7:72</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.28.15">Jb 28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.23">Is 7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.6">46:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.6">Am 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.6">8:6</a>). Silver was a measure of a man’s wealth (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.2">Gn 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.24.35">24:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.25.3">Ex 25:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.22.18">Nm 22:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.25">Dt 7:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.18">Zep 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.8">Hg 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.11">Zec 6:11</a>). An unusual comment in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.21">1 Kings 10:21</a> notes that in Solomon’s day “it was not considered as anything,” apparently because it was so plentiful. It was regularly taken as booty (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.19">Jos 6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.21">7:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.18">1 Kgs 15:18</a>). Sometimes the drinking cup of an important man was made of silver (<a href="?bref=Gen.44.2">Gn 44:2</a>). Sometimes, too, a royal crown was made of gold and silver (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.11">Zec 6:11</a>). It was important in the manufacture of personal ornaments (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.53">Gn 24:53</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.22">Ex 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.35">12:35</a>), and one example is given of ornaments of gold studded with silver (<a href="?bref=Song.1.11">Sg 1:11</a>).</p>
<p>The process of refining silver was used as a metaphor for the trying of people’s hearts (<a href="?bref=Ps.66.10">Ps 66:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.48.10">Is 48:10</a>), and the tarnishing and deterioration of silver was a picture of the disintegration of one’s character (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.22">Is 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.30">Jer 6:30</a>). God’s Word is pictured as “pure” silver refined and purified in a furnace. Despite silver’s great value, wisdom excels it (<a href="?bref=Job.28.15">Job 28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.14">Prv 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.8.19">8:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.10.20">10:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.16.16">16:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.22.1">22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.25.11">25:11</a>).</p>
<p>Native copper is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Deut.8.9">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>, though the reference may be to one of its ores. More commonly, biblical references are to brass, the alloy of copper and zinc. However, the chemical analysis of copper-based tools and implements during the middle and late Bronze Ages (c. 2000–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>) shows that the material was bronze. References to brass in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> are therefore to bronze.</p>
<p>By NT times, copper in the form of alloys (bronze and brass) was widely used. Bronze coinage was well known and this may be the sense of <a href="?bref=Matt.10.9">Matthew 10:9</a>. The widow’s mite was a tiny bronze coin, the lepton. Bronze utensils and vessels were well known (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.20">Rv 9:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.12">18:12</a>). The reference to “sounding brass” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) in <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a> may actually be to brass, which was a bright, shining alloy, and was used in musical instruments. In the vision of John in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.15">Rv 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.18">2:18</a>), the Son of Man had feet of fine brass (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “bronze”).</p>
<p>The Iron Age began in Palestine about 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>, that is, in the days of the judges, though native iron had been known in Egypt in the predynastic period. Archaeological evidence suggests that the smelting of iron ore was discovered by the Hittites about 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Philistines seem to have introduced iron to Palestine about 1300 <span class="era">BC</span>. In the days of Moses an encounter with the Midianites produced much tribute, among which iron is mentioned (<a href="?bref=Num.31.22">Nm 31:22</a>). When Israel captured Jericho, the spoils included iron (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.24">Jos 6:24</a>). Manasseh’s half-tribe also took booty including iron (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.8">22:8</a>). In the days of the judges the Canaanites were equipped with chariots of iron (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.16-18">Jos 17:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.19">Jgs 1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.3">4:3</a>).</p>
<p>These early references point to the arrival of iron at the start of the Iron Age. The Philistines enjoyed a local monopoly in its use (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.19-21">1 Sm 13:19-21</a>), and their mighty warrior Goliath was armed with an iron spear (<a href="?bref=1Sam.17.7">17:7</a>). It was not long, however, before Israel learned the use of iron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.31">2 Sm 12:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.23.7">23:7</a>). Evidently, by Solomon’s time, iron was widely used, because builders of the temple were forbidden to use iron tools (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.7">1 Kgs 6:7</a>). The false prophet Zedekiah in Ahab’s day used the horns of iron to thrust toward Syria as he spoke of their defeat (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.11">22:11</a>).</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> referred to iron (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.34">Is 10:34</a>), and Jeremiah later spoke of the metal in several places (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.18">Jer 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.28">6:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.4">11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.12">15:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.13-14">28:13-14</a>). Ezekiel made use of an iron plate in one of his symbolic actions (<a href="?bref=Ezek.4.3">Ez 4:3</a>), referred to iron in his description of smelting (<a href="?bref=Ezek.22.18,20">22:18, 20</a>), and listed it as a commodity for trade (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.12,19">27:12, 19</a>). The prophet Amos spoke of threshing instruments of iron (<a href="?bref=Amos.1.3">Am 1:3</a>). Micah used iron as a symbol for military might (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.13">Mi 4:13</a>). The book of Daniel makes several references to it (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.33-35,40-45">Dn 2:33-35, 40-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.15,23">4:15, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.7,19">7:7, 19</a>).</p>
<p>By Roman times, iron weapons were the regular implements of war. Gates of iron were used to close prisons (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.10">Acts 12:10</a>), and in a symbolic usage powerful rulers were said to rule with a rod of iron (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.27">Rv 2:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.9">9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.5">12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.15">19:15</a>).

  <title>Miracle</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MIRACLE</p>
<p class="fl">A divine act by which God reveals himself to people. The classical definition of miracle assumes that it is contrary to natural law, but this is a misnomer for two reasons. First, many of the miracles of the Bible used nature rather than bypassed it (e.g., the wind that parted the Red Sea, <a href="?bref=Exod.14.21">Ex 14:21</a>). Second, there no longer is a concept of “absolute natural laws”; rather, a phenomenon that is not readily explainable may reflect laws that scientists do not yet fully understand. In Scripture the element of faith is crucial; a natural approach cannot prove or disprove the presence of “miracle.” The timing and content of the process can be miraculous, even though the event may seem natural. The revelatory significance is also important. In every case God performed the miracle not merely as a “wonder” to inspire awe but as a “sign” to draw people to himself.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheVocabularyofMiracles">The Vocabulary of Miracles</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT the two main terms are “sign” and “wonder,” which often occur together (e.g., nine times in Dt alone, <a href="?bref=Deut.4.34">4:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1">13:1</a>; etc.). More than one Hebrew term is used for “wonder”—one referring to it as an act of supernatural power and another as being beyond man’s understanding. On the whole, they are used synonymously for God’s providential acts within history. The “sign” refers to an act that occurs as a token or pledge of God’s control over events and as a revelation of God’s presence with his people.</p>
<p>The NT uses the same basic idiom, “signs and wonders,” with the same general thrust (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.24.24">Mt 24:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.22">Mk 13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.48">Jn 4:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.43">Acts 2:43</a>). A third term is that for “power” or miracle, and this becomes the predominant term in the synoptic Gospels. It signifies the mighty act itself by which God is revealed in Christ. A fourth term is “work,” which along with “sign” is preferred in the Gospel of John. This term is used in John to show that in Jesus the work of the Father is revealed. While the terms are often synonymous (the first three occur together in <a href="?bref=Rom.15.19-20">Rom 15:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.9">2 Thes 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.4">Heb 2:4</a>), they designate three different aspects of miracles. “Signs” point to the theological meaning of miracle as a revelation of God; “power,” to the force behind the act; “work,” to the person behind it; and “wonder,” to its awesome effect on the observer.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MiraclesintheOldTestament">Miracles in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">To the Hebrew, a miracle was nothing more nor less than an act of God. Therefore, nature herself was a miracle (<a href="?bref=Job.5.9-10">Jb 5:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.6">Pss 89:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.2">106:2</a>), and an act of kindness or victory over one’s enemies is so described (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.12-27">Gn 24:12-27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.23">1 Sm 14:23</a>). The natural order is totally under Yahweh’s control, so a miracle was observable not because of its supernatural nature but because of its character as part of the divine revelation. This connection with salvation history is crucial, for Israel at all times tried to guard against a desire for the spectacular. <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-4">Deuteronomy 13:1-4</a> warns against accepting a wonder as authenticating a prophet; rather, the authentication must come from the fact that he worships Yahweh.</p>
<p>Miracles in the OT are restricted to critical periods of redemptive history. Many have discussed the act of Creation as the first miracle, but in actuality it is not presented as such in the Genesis account. A miracle is signified by its revelatory significance and/or its connection with crucial points in the history of God’s people—the exodus, the conquest of Jordan, the battle against the insidious Baal worship of the prophetic period. Creation is characterized by one major theme: a chronicle of the beginnings. The miracles of Genesis—striking blind the inhabitants of Sodom, the Flood, Babel—all signify the wrath of God upon those who have turned against him. This is the other side of redemptive history, the judgment of God upon those who are not his people.</p>
<p>The miracles of the exodus account have two foci: The plagues represent the absolute power of Yahweh over the gods of Egypt, and the miracles of the wilderness show God’s absolute care and protection of his people. The plagues are particularly interesting because each one is directed at one of the gods of Egypt and reveals Yahweh as the only potentate. The basic theme is found in <a href="?bref=Exod.7.5">Exodus 7:5</a> and is repeated throughout the account (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.7.17">7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.8.6,18">8:6, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.9.14-16,29">9:14-16, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.12">12:12</a>): “When I show the Egyptians my power and force them to let the Israelites go, they will realize that I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). In this regard they were directed not only at the Egyptians but also to the Israelites, who needed to know that their God would vindicate them against the Egyptians. This is borne out in the major miracle, the crossing of the Red Sea. The plagues themselves show a gradual increase in severity.</p>
<p>The wilderness miracles are intimately connected to the basic theme of the wandering narratives, the trial of Israel in times of desperate need and God’s providential protection of his people when they turn to him. The basic organization of the stories concerns the need itself, which leads to Israel’s complaint; this is followed by Moses’ intercession and then by God’s sovereign intervention. The miracles are interspersed with other stories that tell of God’s punishment when the people’s murmuring tries him too far. The miracle is God’s self-revelation regarding his involvement in the needs of his own; Israel must then respond, and her response determines her blessing or punishment at the hands of Yahweh.</p>
<p>Miracles are conspicuously absent in the period of the united monarchy. This was a time of self-sufficiency, when God worked through the monarchy and did not intervene directly in the life of the nation. The reason is that Israel’s eschatological hopes had been realized and made concrete in the presence of the Holy City and the temple.</p>
<p>It was different during the prophetic period. In the lives of Elijah and Elisha, miracles were predominant. This was a time of apostasy, and under the reign of Ahab and Jezebel the nation turned to paganism and the worship of Baal. The very existence of the Hebraic religion seemed to be threatened, and so the times called for extraordinary measures. Here the wondrous nature of the miracles is more evident than anywhere else in the OT. There are conscious allusions to the exodus miracles, perhaps looking to Elijah as a new Moses reinstituting the true worship of Yahweh. Parallels are seen in the challenge to the priests of Baal (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1-46">1 Kgs 18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-25">Ex 7</a>); the revelation of God on Mt Horeb with the wind, earthquake, and fire (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-21">1 Kgs 19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-25">Ex 19</a>); and the parting of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.10-14">2 Kgs 2:10-14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.14.1-31">Ex 14</a>). Many of the miracles were intended to demonstrate the impotence of Baal, such as the drought, the contest on Mt Carmel, and the miraculous sustenance supplied by God. Again, God’s actions within history were part of his self-revelation, the vindication of his messengers, and the punishment of his enemies.</p>
<p>Miracles are infrequent in the writing prophets, perhaps due to the proclamation form of the writings (i.e., they dealt with message rather than deeds). The two major exceptions (apart from the recovery of Hezekiah chronicled in <a href="?bref=Isa.38.1-22">Is 38</a>) are Jonah and Daniel. In Jonah, the miracle is addressed not to the Ninevites but to the Israelites, who are called back to their covenant obligations as the spokesmen for Yahweh. In Daniel the direction is reversed, and the situation is the same as that in Exodus or Kings. The miracles are directed to the Babylonians and Persians and have the same foci as the earlier events of the exodus and Elijah-Elisha chronicles, that is, the supremacy of Yahweh over the foreign gods and the vindication of his messengers. This is the third and final time of crisis and illustrates the major theological use of miracles in the OT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MiraclesintheNewTestament">Miracles in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The presence of the miraculous has a similar purpose in the NT; it occurred at a crisis point in salvation history to authenticate the presence of God in historical acts. It differs, however, in that it is transcended by the presence of the very Son of God, who himself is the greatest miracle of all. God now has not only acted in history; he has entered history and has turned it to himself. The parallels with the exodus events are obvious and show that the miracles of Jesus paved the way for the entrance of the new covenant in the same way that the exodus miracles prepared for the old.</p>

<p class="h3">Jesus’ Understanding</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus stressed the connection between his miraculous ministry, especially the casting out of demons (exorcism), and the coming of the kingdom of God. As in the OT, the miracles signify the presence of God, but here it is more direct and also signals the inauguration of his kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.28">Mt 12:28</a>). As such, then, the exorcism miracles mean the binding of Satan and the institution of the reign of God (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.23-27">Mk 3:23-27</a>). At the same time all the miracles signify the dawning of the age of salvation, as expressed in Jesus’ inaugural address at Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-21">Lk 4:18-21</a>, from <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-2">Is 61:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>Yet these miracles are not automatic signposts to the act of God; they must be interpreted by faith. Jesus was well aware of the presence of other miracles in his day (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.27">Mt 12:27</a>) and so stressed the presence of faith in the healing miracles (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.32">Mk 5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.52">10:52</a>). This faith must be directed to the presence of God in the event and in Jesus himself. The necessity of faith also helps to understand Jesus’ refusal to provide his contemporaries with a “sign” (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.11-12">Mk 8:11-12</a>); miracles could never “prove” the presence of God. For a better understanding of the connection between faith and miracles, it is best to note each Evangelist’s individual portrait of the theological use of miracles.</p>
<p class="h3">Miracles in Mark</p>
<p class="fl">Mark, the first of the four Gospels to be written, has often been called the “action Gospel” because of its emphasis on Jesus’ deeds rather than his teaching. This is also true regarding Jesus’ miracles, for Mark contains more proportionately than any of the others. There are five groups or five kinds of miracles in Mark. The first group centers on Jesus’ authority over demons (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.21-39">Mk 1:21-39</a>). The second concerns Jesus’ authority over the law and conflict with his opponents (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.40-3.6">1:40–3:6</a>). They result in fame but occasion his refusal to allow his true identity as Son of God to be known. The third group (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-30">3:7-30</a>) contains exorcisms and the Beelzebub controversy, centering on his power over Satan. The fourth group (<a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-6.43">4:35–6:43</a>) contains especially powerful miracles (stilling the storm, the Gaderene demoniac, the raising of Jairus’s daughter) and probably centers on the disciples, as Jesus thereby reveals to them the meaning of the kingdom and seeks to overcome their own spiritual dullness. The fifth and final group (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.30-8.26">6:30–8:26</a>) continues the theme of the disciples’ misunderstanding and prepares the way for the Passion, with the message regarding the bread, blindness, and the judgment of God.</p>
<p>The miracles in Mark center on conflict, first with Jesus’ opponents and then with his own disciples. While the miracles are harbingers of God’s kingdom, their purpose is to force an encounter with Jesus’ true significance. They do not show Jesus as a Hellenistic wonder worker; in fact, they lead only to amazement and then disbelief in those who do not have faith. Jesus’ personhood has been hidden and can only be understood in light of the cross. The miracles are not proofs but powers; God does not authenticate himself through them but shows himself to those with eyes to see.</p>
<p class="h3">Miracles in Matthew</p>
<p class="fl">Matthew’s is the teaching Gospel, where dialogue takes precedence over action. Matthew compresses Mark’s narrative in order to make room for didactic material. Therefore, his stress is on the theological implications of faith rather than on the results they contain. Matthew’s groups of miracles are isometric to teaching passages, in keeping with his general practice of combining narrative portions and organizing them around didactic sections. The first group (chs <a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-9.38">8–9</a>) combines miracles from Mark’s first, second, and fourth groups and stresses Jesus’ significance as the servant of Yahweh who exercises sovereign power and forgives sins. The secondary theme teaches discipleship and shows the awakening faith of the disciples and their involvement in Jesus’ ministry. The second group (ch <a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-50">12</a>) centers on his authority over the law (the man with the withered hand) and over Satan (the Beelzebub controversy). The third group (chs <a href="?bref=Matt.14.1-15.39">14–15</a>) parallels Mark’s fifth group but has a different purpose. Rather than arousing conflict, the disciples are seen in positive guise, actively involved in the Master’s work. So the disciples become the means by which Jesus’ ministry is continued. Therefore, the disciples are involved as “learners” (the meaning of “disciple”) in his miraculous ministry.</p>
<p class="h3">Miracles in Luke</p>
<p class="fl">Luke-Acts is remarkable and extremely important because it establishes beyond dispute the early church’s belief that it was in absolute continuity with Jesus and was continuing the work of God in the world. Luke’s major stress is on salvation history, and so one of his major stylistic methods for showing this direct connection is miraculous deeds. Especially enlightening here is <a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-42">Acts 9:32-42</a>, where in two healing miracles Peter duplicated the Lord’s miracles (the paralytic Aeneas, <a href="?bref=Luke.5.18-26">Lk 5:18-26</a>; the raising of Dorcas, <a href="?bref=Luke.8.49-56">Lk 8:49-56</a>).</p>
<p>From this respect also Luke returns to Mark’s interest in the deed more than the teaching. However, Luke goes even further than Mark, for the miracles validate Jesus more directly. The first group follows the inaugural address (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-22">4:18-22</a>), which itself presents the miraculous deeds as authenticating signposts to Jesus’ personhood. They center on Jesus’ power and authority (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.4.31-41">31-41</a>) and validate God’s power in Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.17">5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.39">8:39</a>) as well as faith in Jesus (seen in the “praise” motif, <a href="?bref=Luke.5.25">5:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">7:16</a>; etc., but especially in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.35">Acts 9:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.12">13:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.17">19:17</a>). The presence of “fear” at the miracles is a human response to having witnessed God’s power (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.26">Lk 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.35-37">8:35-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.5">24:5</a>). The call to the disciples occurs in the presence of miracles (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1-11">5:1-11</a>, at the miraculous catch of fish; vv <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27-28">27-28</a>, after the healing of the bedridden paralytic).</p>
<p>Therefore, Luke views miracles as having redemptive significance. However, this is not contrary to Mark’s picture. Luke still avoids picturing Jesus as a mere wonder worker; Jesus still refuses to satisfy people’s curiosity for an external sign (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.29-32">Lk 11:29-32</a>; cf. also <a href="?bref=Luke.9.9">9:9</a>), and in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">16:19-31</a>) he teaches that the unbelieving heart can never be convinced by such events. Nevertheless, they can lead to repentance (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.13-16">10:13-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Miracles in John</p>
<p class="fl">John is the most directly theological of the Evangelists, and miracles are characteristically given a distinctive Johannine coloring. In the Synoptics, miracles are “acts of power” signifying the entrance of God’s reign into this world via Jesus; thereby, Jesus establishes Satan’s defeat and God’s sovereign control of history. John, however, contains no exorcisms, and the miracles are seen as “signs.” At the same time miracles are part of the larger category of “works” (the other term for miracles used in John), by which Jesus shows the Father’s presence in himself (<a href="?bref=John.10.32,37-39">Jn 10:32, 37-39</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.10">14:10</a>) and they give witness to Jesus as the sent one (<a href="?bref=John.5.36">5:36</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.25,38">10:25, 38</a>).</p>
<p>John selects only seven “sign miracles” from many others (<a href="?bref=John.20.30">20:30</a>) and uses them as part of the thematic development in the respective section of each. For instance, changing the water into wine is a messianic act, signifying the outpouring of the kingdom blessing in the ministry of Jesus, the Messiah (ch <a href="?bref=John.2.1-25">2</a>); the multiplication of the loaves builds upon the “bread of life” and points to the messianic banquet as spiritually present in Jesus (ch <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">6</a>).</p>
<p>The paradoxical nature of miracles in the Synoptics is even greater in John. He gives more stress to the wondrous nature of the events by providing such details as the stupendous amount of water changed into wine (<a href="?bref=John.2.6">2:6</a>, approximately 120 gallons, or 454.2 liters); the distance over which Jesus’ healing power works (<a href="?bref=John.4.46">4:46</a>, almost 20 miles, or 32.2 kilometers); the length of time the man of Bethesda had been lame (<a href="?bref=John.5.5,38">5:5, 38</a> years; cf. <a href="?bref=John.9.1">9:1</a>, where the man had been born blind); the amount of bread needed to feed the 5,000 (<a href="?bref=John.6.7">6:7</a>, where Philip said 200 denarii, or days’ wages, would not have bought enough); and the proof of Lazarus’s death (<a href="?bref=John.11.39">11:39</a>; he had already begun to decay). John has a great interest in the miraculous. Yet at the same time there is even greater stress on the inadequacy of miracles for faith. The miracles as “signs” have saving value and point to the true significance of Jesus but are related to an awakening faith and in themselves are insufficient (<a href="?bref=John.2.11">2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.50">4:50</a>). They have christological force, looking to Jesus’ sonship and the Father’s authentication of him but are based on the soteriological decision of the individual. As “signs,” they contain the very presence of God in Jesus, the spiritual reality of the “sight” and “life” he brings (<a href="?bref=John.9.35-38">9:35-38</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.24-26">11:24-26</a>). Yet their purpose is to divide the audience and confront it with the necessity of decision. Two camps result—those seeking understanding and those considering only the outward aspects. Some refuse to consider the signs, and thus they reject them (<a href="?bref=John.3.18-21">3:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.47-50">11:47-50</a>), while others see them shallowly as mere wonders and fail to see in them the true significance of Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.2.23-25">2:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.45">4:45</a>). On the other hand, some view them with the eye of faith and go on to a realization of his personhood (<a href="?bref=John.2.11">2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.36-46">5:36-46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.42">11:42</a>). In John the highest faith of all is that which does not need external stimulation (<a href="?bref=John.20.29">20:29</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Miracles in the Rest of the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Apart from Acts, several passages in the NT speak of the value of miracles. Paul in <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a> and <a href="?bref=Rom.15.18-19">Romans 15:18-19</a> considered them as “sign-gifts,” which authenticated the divine authority of the “true apostle.” He listed healing and miracles as specific “gifts of the Spirit” in <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.9-10">1 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>. In <a href="?bref=Gal.3.5">Galatians 3:5</a> he considered them evidence for the presence of the Spirit. The author of the letter to the Hebrews in <a href="?bref=Heb.2.4">2:4</a> said “God bore witness” to the true message of salvation via miracles. Therefore, in the apostolic age the miracles of God’s servants were seen more directly as authenticating signs of God’s action in his messengers.</p>

<p class="h1">MIRIAM</p>
<p class="list">1. Daughter of Amram and Jochebed and the sister of Aaron and Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.59">Nm 26:59</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3">1 Chr 6:3</a>). Miriam first appears in Scripture as a young girl commissioned with the task of watching her infant brother’s cradle hidden in the reeds of the Nile River (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.4">Ex 2:4</a>)—the result of a scheme conceived by her parents (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.23">Heb 11:23</a>)—to escape the pharaoh’s edict that all Hebrew males be drowned at birth (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.22">Ex 1:22</a>). Miriam evidences not only courage and concern, but also displays a certain wisdom when her brother is discovered by the Egyptian princess (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.5-6">2:5-6</a>). Taking the initiative, she offers to secure a nurse for the child, and when this plan is accepted, she gets her mother (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.2.7-8">7-8</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Miriam first appears by name after the Israelites have crossed the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>). She is given the title of “prophetess” and is, with her brothers, appointed a leader in the nation (<a href="?bref=Mic.6.4">Mi 6:4</a>). Following the death of the Egyptian charioteers she leads the women of Israel in an anthem of praise accompanied with dancing and instrumental music (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.21">Ex 15:21</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Miriam appears in disgrace after her jealousy of and rebellion against Moses. With Aaron she murmurs against Moses because of his superior influence in the nation and because of his marriage to a Cushite woman (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-2">Nm 12:1-2</a>). For this attack against God’s chosen spokesman, she is struck with leprosy (v <a href="?bref=Num.12.10">10</a>). Moses, however, intercedes on her behalf (<a href="?bref=Num.12.9-13">Nm 12:9-13</a>), and she was restored, but only after seven shameful days spent outside the camp while Israel waits to resume its march (<a href="?bref=Num.12.14-15">Nm 12:14-15</a>). This sad incident is the last recorded event in Miriam’s public life. She died near the close of the wilderness wanderings at Kadesh and was buried there (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1">20:1</a>).</p>

  <title>Mirror</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MIRROR</p>
<p class="fl">Smooth surface for reflecting images. The word does not occur in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, but the idea is there, translated from the Hebrew or Greek as “glass,” “glasses” or “looking glass.” Modern translations use the word “mirror.”</p>
<p>In the biblical era, mirrors were made of copper, bronze, silver, gold, or electrum. They were highly polished so as to reflect the face as clearly as possible. Glass was in existence but was usually opaque (except Roman glass) and was not used for mirrors until after the biblical period.</p>
<p>The Bible first mentions mirrors in the time of Moses in relationship to the building of the tabernacle in the wilderness of Sinai just after the exodus from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.38.8">Ex 38:8</a>). When Alexander the Great spread Greek culture, the use of mirrors became even more widespread in the biblical world. Until that time, they were the possession of either court ladies or prostitutes.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientBronzeMirrors"/>
<p>Archaeological excavations have unearthed bronze mirrors in Palestine along with various items of women’s jewelry and clothes. Most of these date from the postexilic era up through Roman times. The mirrors are usually circular in shape with handles of wood or ivory, if they have handles at all.</p>

<p class="h1">MISCARRIAGE</p>
<p class="fl">Spontaneous abortion of a nonviable fetus. It occurs in both human (<a href="?bref=Job.3.16">Jb 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.14">Hos 9:14</a>) and animal (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.38">Gn 31:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.21.10">Jb 21:10</a>) pregnancies. The major problem is not in being unable to conceive or to become pregnant but in carrying the pregnancy to full term. The curse of a “miscarrying womb” results in not being able to have children (<a href="?bref=Hos.9.14">Hos 9:14</a>), while the blessing of God results in successful pregnancies and long life (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.26">Ex 23:26</a>).</p>
<p>The time factor is the key abnormality as indicated by premature delivery or “untimely birth” (<a href="?bref=Ps.58.8">Ps 58:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.3.16">Jb 3:16</a>). While miscarriages occur for many reasons, Scripture mentions two: improper care (in animals) (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.38">Gn 31:38</a>) and trauma to a pregnant woman (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.22">Ex 21:22</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Num.5.1-31">Numbers 5</a> gives the test for an unfaithful wife. If she is guilty of adultery, then “her abdomen will swell and her thigh waste away” (v <a href="?bref=Num.5.27">27</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). These phrases may be euphemisms for miscarriage or for sterility (see <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Paul underscores his inherent unworthiness to be an apostle by comparing his spiritual birth to an untimely physical birth (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8">1 Cor 15:8</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MISHNAH*</p>
<p class="fl">Series of interpretations of the meaning of the law; according to rabbinic tradition, they were given when Moses received the law from God on Mt Sinai, and they were to be passed down in oral form. This “oral tradition” was the “law” to which Jesus referred, for example, in <a href="?bref=Matt.15.1-9">Matthew 15:1-9</a>. By about <span class="era">AD</span> 200, under Rabbi Judah, the work begun by Rabbi Akiba around 120 was completed, and the oral tradition was finally written down. This written material is called the Mishnah. The word is derived from a verb that reflects the way the material had been repeated orally from teacher to disciple for many generations.</p>
<p>The Mishnah is divided into six “orders”; each order is divided into sections called “tractates,” which in turn are divided into chapters. The orders deal with specific areas of legal concerns as follows:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. <span class="ital">Seeds</span> is concerned with agricultural laws, and is introduced with a tractate dealing with daily prayers.</p>
<p class="list">2. <span class="ital">Festivals</span> deals with feasts, fast days, and Sabbath regulations.</p>
<p class="list">3. <span class="ital">Women</span> records marriage and family laws.</p>
<p class="list">4. <span class="ital">Injuries</span> deals with civil/criminal law and ethical standards.</p>
<p class="list">5. <span class="ital">Holy Things</span> concerns the ritual laws and the activities of the priesthood.</p>

<p class="list-space">1. Place in Gilead where Jacob and Laban made a covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.49">Gn 31:49</a>) and set up a heap of stones to mark the borders between their territories.</p>

<p class="list">4. Place in the tribal area of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.26">Jos 18:26</a>). It was here that the Israelites gathered to war against the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.1">Jgs 20:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.21.1">21:1</a>) after the men of Gibeah had abused and killed the concubine of a visiting Levite. It was here that Samuel called all Israel together to pray for victory over the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.5-8">1 Sm 7:5-8</a>). Later, Samuel called for an assembly at Mizpah to publicly designate Saul as king and to instruct the people and king in the ways of the kingdom (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.17-25">10:17-25</a>). In the time of Asa, Mizpah was a fortified town on the border between Israel and Judah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.22">1 Kgs 15:22</a>). After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> to the Babylonians, Mizpah became the residence of Gedaliah the governor (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.23-24">2 Kgs 25:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.40.10">Jer 40:10</a>), who was murdered there by Ishmael of the “royal seed” (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.3">Jer 41:3</a>). Two days later Ishmael murdered a company of pilgrims who were going to Jerusalem to bring their offerings at the ruined temple, and he cast their bodies into a cistern that had been constructed centuries earlier by Asa.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the intertestamental period Mizpah continued to be an important religious center. Judas Maccabeus called the people together at Mizpah “because Israel formerly had a place of prayer in Mizpah” (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.46">1 Macc 3:46</a>).</p>

  <title>Moab, Moabites</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MOAB, MOABITES</p>
<p class="fl">Name of a small kingdom in central Transjordan and also its inhabitants. The land of Moab was situated on the high plateau immediately east of the Dead Sea; the escarpment of the Jordan Rift formed an effective boundary between Moab and Judah. Moab’s northern boundary shifted in accordance with the kingdom’s military might, with the Heshbon vicinity forming the northern limit of Moab in periods of strength, and the Arnon River (modern Wadi el-Mojib) functioning as the northern border in times of weakness. The kingdom’s eastern boundary was formed by the fringe of the Syrian desert, since the latter demarcated Moab’s agricultural zone. On the south, Moab was separated from Edom by the Zered River (modern Wadi el-Hesa). Thus, even at its peak, ancient Moab encompassed a relatively small territory, measuring only about 60 miles (96.5 kilometers) north-south by about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) east-west.</p>
<p>Most of Moab is gently rolling tableland that is divided by numerous ravines. Running through the heart of Moab is the King’s Highway, a route that probably had military and commercial importance throughout this region’s history (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-22">Nm 21:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.17">Jgs 11:17</a>). The plateau has always been famous for its abundant pasturage (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4">2 Kgs 3:4</a>), and Moab’s soil and climate are quite suitable for growing wheat and barley.</p>

<p class="h2" id="OriginandHistory">Origin and History</p>
<p class="fl">According to <a href="?bref=Gen.19.37">Genesis 19:37</a>, the Moabites descended from Moab, the son of Lot and his oldest daughter. <a href="?bref=Deut.2.10-11">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a>, a passage whose context relates to the Moabites at the time of the Hebrew invasion, says that the pre-Moabite inhabitants of this region were the Emim, but the connection between Lot’s descendants, the Emim, and the occupants of Moab at the time of the Hebrew invasion is not identified. There is thus far no specific information concerning the establishing of the Moabite kingdom proper, which existed from around 1300 <span class="era">BC</span> to 600 <span class="era">BC</span>. Knowledge of this period of Moabite history and culture is derived from archaeological and textual sources, including Egyptian, Assyrian, and OT texts.</p>
<p>Prior to the Israelites’ passage through Transjordan, the Moabites had lost control of the land north of the Arnon and were dominated by Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon (<a href="?bref=Num.21.13,26">Nm 21:13, 26</a>). Having been refused permission to travel through Edom and Moab along the King’s Highway, the Hebrews defeated Sihon in one of their most celebrated military campaigns. Fearing that Israel might conquer his land, King Balak of Moab waged war against the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Num.22.6">Nm 22:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.9">Jos 24:9</a>) and hired the Mesopotamian diviner, Balaam, to pronounce a curse upon his enemies (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Nm 22–24</a>). The tribes of Reuben and Gad settled in Sihon’s territory, and the Arnon formed the border between Israel and Moab (ch <a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">32</a>). From the time of the Israelites’ apostasy at Shittim onward (ch <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">25</a>), the Moabite tableland north of the Arnon was a source of contention between Moab and Israel.</p>
<p>Until his assassination by Ehud, the Moabite king Eglon oppressed the Hebrew tribes on both sides of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-30">Jgs 3:12-30</a>). By Jephthah’s day, northern Moab was once again under Israelite control (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.26">11:26</a>). Obviously, as the book of Ruth indicates, there were also periods in which Moab and Israel lived in peace.</p>
<p>During the reigns of Saul and David, from the late-11th until the mid-10th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, Moab and Israel were at war, with the latter usually holding the upper hand (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.47">1 Sm 14:47</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.8.2">2 Sm 8:2</a>). Solomon’s harem included Moabite women, and he also built a high place for Chemosh, the chief god of the Moabites (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1,7">1 Kgs 11:1, 7</a>). Following the division of the Israelite monarchy in 930 <span class="era">BC</span>, Moab experienced a brief period of independence, but this ended when Omri and Ahab dominated the Moabites and their king, Mesha, during the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>. (The famous Moabite Stone, which describes Mesha’s conflict with the Omride dynasty, and several shorter texts demonstrate that the language of Moab was closely related to OT Hebrew.) Conflict between Moab and her neighbors (e.g., Israel, Judah, Edom, and most importantly, Assyria) continued until the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Moabite kingdom early in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.8-11">Ez 25:8-11</a>). This conflict is documented in the Assyrian literature, which indicates that Moab became an Assyrian vassal in the late eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, and in the OT (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.1-27">2 Kgs 3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32-33">10:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.20">13:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.2">24:2</a>). Indeed, the enmity between Moab, Israel, and Judah is especially evident in a series of prophetic oracles leveled against the Moabites (<a href="?bref=Isa.15.1-16.14">Is 15–16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.9.25-26">Jer 9:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.1-47">48</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.1-3">Am 2:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.2.8-11">Zep 2:8-11</a>). These passages call attention to some of the major towns in ancient Moab (Nebo, Medeba, Heshbon, Dibon, Ar, Kir, and Horonaim).</p>
<p>Following the Babylonian conquest, the region of Moab fell under Persian control and was occupied by various Arab peoples, most notably the Nabateans. Although a Moabite state was never reestablished, people of Moabite ancestry were recognized in late OT times (<a href="?bref=Ezra.9.1">Ezr 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.13.1,23">Neh 13:1, 23</a>), since the postexilic Jewish community was concerned about observing the law recorded in <a href="?bref=Deut.23.3-6">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>. In <span class="era">AD</span> 106 the region of Moab became part of the Roman province of Arabia. Archaeological research has added much to the body of information that relates to Moabite history and culture from the prehistoric through Ottoman periods.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Religion">Religion</p>
<p class="fl">During the third and second millennia <span class="era">BC</span>, Moabite religion was probably similar to that practiced by the Canaanites, though the religion of Moab eventually developed into a relatively distinct system. Although other deities were worshiped by the Moabites, Chemosh was their national god. The OT refers to the Moabites as “people of Chemosh” (<a href="?bref=Num.21.29">Nm 21:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.46">Jer 48:46</a>), and the frequent appearance of “Chemosh” in Moabite personal names points to this god’s elevated status. In general, the Moabite Stone’s dozen references to Chemosh portray him as a god of war who leads his people against their enemies.</p>
<p>Divine guidance and favor were sought, and diviners and oracles were respected (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Nm 22–24</a>). A priesthood (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.7">Jer 48:7</a>) and sacrificial system (<a href="?bref=Num.22.40-23.30">Nm 22:40–23:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-5">25:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.27">2 Kgs 3:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.35">Jer 48:35</a>) were important aspects of Moabite religion. No Moabite sanctuary has been discovered, but their existence is mentioned in the Moabite Stone and the OT (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.7">1 Kgs 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.13">2 Kgs 23:13</a>). Elaborately furnished tombs, like those found at Dibon, point to the Moabites’ belief in the afterlife.</p>

<p class="h1">MOABITE STONE*</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="DrawingOfMoabiteStone"/>
<p class="fl">Longest literary source outside the OT dealing with the history of the region of Palestine and Transjordan during the period of 1300–600 <span class="era">BC</span>. It is a particularly important source for the history of the Moabites, a people who lived in an area east of the Dead Sea. The stone was discovered in the 1860s and has a fairly complete narrative of the reign of Mesha, a Moabite king in the middle of the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>. When found, the stone was a hard slab with rounded top and 39 lines of Hebrewlike writing three feet, ten inches (1.2 meters) high by two feet (.6 meter) wide by two and a half inches (6.4 centimeters) thick.</p>
<p>On August 19, 1868, F. Klein, a German employed by the Church Missionary Society, saw the stele and reported its existence. When the German and French consuls showed an interest in the stone, the Arabs who had discovered it wanted to get the best price they could from the two governments. The Arabs then began to quarrel among themselves over how much to charge the foreigners, and the dispute became so bitter that one group heated the stone over a fire and then poured water on it, causing the stone to break into pieces. The Arabs then distributed the various pieces among the granaries of the countryside. There they were to act as a blessing or offering for a good harvest. Fortunately, a messenger from the French Consulate had obtained an impression of the writing on the stone. But the impression began to break apart as the messenger returned to the consulate on horseback. Impressions were also taken of the larger sections when they could be gathered at a later date. Finally, many of the other, smaller pieces were located, and the whole stone was put back together as closely as possible. Although parts were missing, the stone did contain a clear description of the history of the Moabites.</p>
<p>The text begins with a dedication to Chemosh, the god of the Moabites. Mesha, the king of the Moabites for 30 years, states that in gratitude for being delivered “from all the kings and letting” him see his “desire over all . . . enemies” he had erected a high place for the god. The place where the stele was found may also have been the location of the high place.</p>
<p>As the text continues, a short sketch of the history of the Moabites appears that can be related to the OT narrative. “Omri, king of Israel,” had oppressed Moab for many days because Chemosh was angry with his land [Moab]. Omri’s son “succeeded him and he too said, ‘I will oppress Moab.’ In my [Mesha’s] time he said [this] but I triumphed over him and over his house, while Israel has perished for ever.” The 40-year domination of Israel over Moab must involve the reigns of Omri (885–874 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1-34">1 Kgs 16</a>), his son Ahab (874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>), Ahaziah (853–852), and the first half of Jehoram’s reign (852–841). Thus the son mentioned in the text would be Omri’s grandson. That would be more consistent with Scripture, which states that Jehoram (<span class="sc">nlt</span>, <span class="sc">niv</span> “Joram”) had tried to destroy Moabite rebels (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4-27">2 Kgs 3:4-27</a>). The rest of the text describes the victories over the Israelites, Mesha’s public works, and the call of the god Chemosh for Mesha to fight the Hauranites.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">MONEY</p>
<p class="fl">Medium of exchange, measurement of value, means of payment.</p>
<p>Money was developed as a convenient medium of exchange to supplement and later to replace bartering, although the two systems operated concurrently for many centuries. From the patriarchal period to the present day, wealth has been measured in terms of goods and precious metals, particularly gold and silver, which remain universally acceptable mediums of exchange. <a href="?bref=Gen.13.2">Genesis 13:2</a> describes Abraham as “very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.”</p>
<p>Wealth in a nomadic or seminomadic society was frequently measured by the number of cattle a person possessed, and because of this, cattle were a readily acceptable and easily valued, if rather large, medium of exchange. The degree to which cattle were commonly recognized as the standard for value, wealth, and exchange is reflected in the Latin form for money, <span class="ital">pecunia,</span> which is derived directly from <span class="ital">pecus,</span> meaning “cattle.” For religious purposes, taxes or donations paid in cattle were most acceptable, and this not only increased the general recognition for this medium but also made the temple a repository for large herds of cattle, as well as smaller animals and produce, which, if they could not be used directly in the temple rituals, could be bartered for whatever commodities were required. Perishable foods were less popular for purposes of exchange than animals such as sheep and asses, although timber, wine, and honey were regularly used as a form of currency (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.15">1 Sm 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4">2 Kgs 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.13-16">Ez 45:13-16</a>). Both public and private taxes, tribute, and debts of all kinds were settled by this means. Solomon paid Hiram, king of Tyre, in wheat and olive oil for his assistance in the construction of the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.11">1 Kgs 5:11</a>), and in the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span> taxes were commonly paid in jars of wine or olive oil. Tribute in the form of sheep and wool is recorded in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4">2 Kings 3:4</a>.</p>
<p>All the means of exchange mentioned represented goods that could be measured or counted, and attempts were made to establish a standard rate of exchange for them in relation to each other.</p>
<p>Silver was the precious metal most readily available in the ancient Near East and was therefore the one most frequently mentioned in connection with purchases by weight, and at a later period by coin. The first recorded instance in the Bible of silver being used as a medium of exchange occurs in <a href="?bref=Gen.20.14-16">Genesis 20:14-16</a>, where Abraham received a payment of 1,000 shekels by weight of silver, as well as animals and slaves. Abraham also purchased the field and cave of Machpelah for 400 shekels of silver (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.15-16">Gn 23:15-16</a>), which according to the custom of the day had to be weighed out in front of the vendor and checked by witnesses (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.32.9-10">Jer 32:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>As these events occurred about the beginning of the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, the term “shekel” would not represent the coin familiar from later periods but rather a certain weight of silver. At a later time the brothers of Joseph sold him to traveling merchants for 20 shekels of silver (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.28">Gn 37:28</a>). <a href="?bref=Gen.33.19">Genesis 33:19</a> mentions another unit of weight for metal, <span class="ital">the kesitah</span> (<span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), in connection with the purchase of a field by Jacob; the term occurs again in <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Joshua 24:32</a> and <a href="?bref=Job.42.11">Job 42:11</a>. This unit may have represented an amount equivalent to the currency value for a lamb.</p>
<p>In time large animals and material objects came to be considered extremely cumbersome as a means of exchange, and metal became increasingly popular. Transportation of large quantities of precious metal remained a problem, however, and a method had to be devised for easy recognition, accessibility, and storage of particular metals of value.</p>
<p>Over the years, fairly uniform shapes were designed for metals used in transactions. Silver could be piled or tied in bundles, as shown in Egyptian bas-reliefs, and the sons of Jacob took advantage of a similar method in transporting the purchase price of the grain they were buying from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.35">Gn 42:35</a>). About 1500 <span class="era">BC</span>, pieces of metal shaped in the form of ingots, bars, tongues, or heads of animals were in use, as well as gold discs and rings of gold wire. Perhaps the most popular pieces acceptable as currency were those that had also been designed as jewelry. The valuables listed among the spoil of the Midianites included gold chains, bracelets, signet rings, and earrings (<a href="?bref=Num.31.50">Nm 31:50</a>). The bracelets and rings in particular probably represented a standardized weight, and could therefore be used easily as currency. Rebekah received gifts from her fiancé that were in the form of jewelry of specific weight: a gold ring weighing half a shekel and two bracelets weighing ten gold shekels (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.22">Gn 24:22</a>). Job was given a fine ring of gold by a number of relatives, and it is unlikely that they would all have given him the same gift if it did not in fact represent a certain monetary value (<a href="?bref=Job.42.11">Jb 42:11</a>).</p>
<p>The requirement in <a href="?bref=Deut.14.25">Deuteronomy 14:25</a> to “bind up your money” would again imply either thin strips of silver that could be bundled together or rings that could be strung. In either event, transportation would be facilitated.</p>
<p>The value for weights of silver mentioned in Mosaic times can best be understood in terms of purchasing power. A ram could be bought for two shekels, while fifty shekels was the price of about four bushels of barley (<a href="?bref=Lev.27.16">Lv 27:16</a>). In the time of Elisha, during a good year, one and one-half pecks of fine flour or three pecks of barley could be bought for one shekel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.7.16">2 Kgs 7:16</a>). Needless to say, monetary valuations of this kind would be affected by such economic considerations as supply and demand.</p>
<p>Estimation by eye was an inaccurate means of judging the value of currency, and there is no doubt that cheating was prevalent in the weighing and examination of metal. The weighing, an essential part of every major transaction, was also very time-consuming. In order to ensure the correct value of the weights, which were usually pieces of bronze, iron, or dressed stones, they carried some sort of stamp. Once this practice was generally established, it was a short step to the stamping of the individual pieces of metal, whether tongues, bars, or bracelets, being used as currency. The next logical development was stamping a piece of silver to authenticate its value for purposes of currency. This was the precursor of the coin, which was not known in the ancient Near East prior to the exilic period. Therefore, any reference to money before that time indicates bars, bracelets, rings, or other metal objects, stamped or unstamped.</p>
<p>The earliest minted coins came from the kingdom of Lydia in Asia Minor, being credited traditionally to Croesus (560–546 <span class="era">BC</span>), the fabulously wealthy ruler of that land. The coins from Lydia were made of electrum, a natural alloy of silver and gold, and they depicted a lion and a bull. Like most of the early coins, the reverse simply contained a punch mark.</p>
<p>Originally a coin not only represented a value, but also its weight was worth the amount of silver or gold of its face value. Thus many of the early coins were slashed heavily by some ancient skeptics, who wished to be sure that the coin was of pure silver and not a less valuable metal coated with silver.</p>
<p>The purity of silver or gold was also a factor in the popularity and acceptance of particular coins. Thus in Greek and Roman times the tetradrachma from Tyre was one of the most widely accepted silver coins because of the purity of its metal content.</p>
<p>The use of coins did not eliminate the necessity for weighing, because the fraudulent clipping of the edges of coins was prevalent from their introduction in the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>. This particular problem plagued all subsequent issues of coinage, and it was only in the late 18th century in Britain that it was surmounted by a process involving the milling, or reeding, of the edges of the more valuable coins.</p>
<p>In the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, when the Jews returned from exile in Babylonia, coins were donated for the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, as well as silver and gold in other forms. The gold coin mentioned is a “daric.” The term, apparently derived from the name of the great Persian king Darius I (521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>), was in wide current use and even appears in biblical passages written at a later date but referring to a period before the reign of Darius (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.7">1 Chr 29:7</a>).</p>
<p>Few craftsmen with the skills required for the manufacture of coins would have been available before the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>, so the earliest gold darics were probably minted at Sardis. The mint itself was taken over by the Persians when they occupied the territory, with production continuing as before.</p>
<p>Western sections of the Persian Empire probably used silver coins more frequently than gold. According to some traditions, coinage developed in Greece at Aegina about the time that the Lydians first adopted the concept. The earliest of these silver coins to be excavated so far dates from the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span> and was minted in northern Greece.</p>
<p>Also in current use were the popular fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> tetradrachmas from Athens, which had dies on both sides of the coin. These depicted the head of the goddess Athena and the sacred owl.</p>
<p>Although the silver content of many coins in contemporary use was lowered, that of the Athenian tetradrachma remained consistently at its original high standard of purity. This circumstance naturally increased its acceptability, especially in areas caught up in political turmoil where the purity of the local currency was particularly questionable. Because of the stability of the silver content of the coin and the rapidity with which the Greek Empire was expanding, the Athenian tetradrachma was minted and used almost unchanged over a period of 200 years. Many of these coins have been found in hoards all over the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that by the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> there was a local mint in Judea, for silver coins imitating the Athenian tetradrachma, but also bearing the legend “Jehud,” have been excavated there.</p>
<p>Because of the extent of trade in Greek and Roman times, the coins from the larger centers had a general acceptance in all the Mediterranean coastal areas. They were also favored in the inland areas, especially in those traversed by trading routes or those that were part of a larger empire.</p>
<p>Mints in Gaza, Joppa, and Tyre were established about the end of the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> to produce local currency. At this period Sidon continued to be an important supplier of silver coins, as it had been since the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>As the Seleucids gained control of Judea in 198 <span class="era">BC</span>, a period of political turmoil commenced when the Syrians tried to Hellenize the Jewish people. Resentment toward Greek culture and resistance to all tampering with the traditional Jewish faith increased steadily until it found an outlet in the leadership of Mattathias, father of the Maccabees, who began a guerrilla uprising in 167 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>When the fortunes of war shifted temporarily to the Maccabeans, King Antiochus of Syria granted Simon Maccabeus the right to mint his own coins (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.6">1 Macc 15:6</a>), but before he could take advantage of this prime symbol of independence, the balance of power changed once more. Judea returned to its status as a tributary, and the permission to mint coinage was hastily withdrawn.</p>
<p>Simon’s son, John Hyrcanus, succeeded in overcoming the weakened Syrians and declared independence in 129 <span class="era">BC</span>. The small bronze coins minted about 110 <span class="era">BC</span> showed a wreath on the obverse bearing the inscription “Johanan the high priest and the community of the Jews.” The reverse displayed a double cornucopia with a poppy head, both of which were Greek symbols of plenty. These were the first genuinely Jewish coins.</p>
<p>With the lack of skilled craftsmen and of a good mint it is hardly surprising that the resulting coins were simple and unpretentious. In consequence they were quite unlike the elaborate, and often delicate, designs of many contemporary coins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, silver coins continued to be struck in the Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon on the orders of the Seleucids, and they remained the most popular silver coins in everyday use in Palestine until Roman times. Even then they continued to circulate side by side with the Roman coinage.</p>

<p class="h1">MONEY CHANGER</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient profession that undertook many of the services performed by the modern banker, particularly in the area of exchanging the currency of one country or province into that of another, or of exchanging small coins for coins of greater value or vice versa. Naturally, a fee was charged for such a service.</p>
<p>Standardized coinage as such does not go back beyond the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span>. In earlier periods pieces of silver were weighed out in payment for commodities (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.16">Gn 20:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.37.28">37:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.17.2">Jgs 17:2</a>). Once the standardized coin was adopted in Asia Minor the idea was copied in other lands, but since coins differed from country to country, equivalents had to be worked out by the money changers.</p>
<p>The need for such procedures was particularly important in Palestine, where every adult male Jew had to pay a half-shekel offering (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.11-16">Ex 30:11-16</a>). Jews from various countries who came to pay this sum might bring a variety of types of coinage. Temple authorities had to authorize a coin appropriate for the purpose. This was the silver Tyrian half-shekel or tetradrachma (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.17.27">Mt 17:27</a>, where Peter was told to pay the temple tax for Jesus and himself with the coin he found in the mouth of a fish). The Mishnah states (<span class="ital">Sheqalim</span> 1:3) that money changers operated in the provinces on the 15th of the month of Adar (the month before the Passover) to collect this tax. Ten days before the Passover the money changers moved to the temple courts to assist Jews from foreign countries.</p>
<p>Jesus encountered the money changers in the temple courtyard when he “cleansed the temple” (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12-13">Mt 21:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.15-16">Mk 11:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.45-46">Lk 19:45-46</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.13-22">Jn 2:13-22</a>). The reason for this action has been a matter of debate. Worshipers needed to procure the half-shekel to pay their tax. But they needed also to purchase birds, animals, or cake offerings in some cases. This wholesale activity in buying and money changing seemed inappropriate in the temple precincts, which constituted a sacred area (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.11.16">Mk 11:16</a>), although Jesus evidently approved the payment of the temple tax as such (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.4">Mt 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.24-26">17:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.44">Mk 1:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.14">Lk 5:14</a>). There is also the possibility that the charge made by money changers and by those who sold sacrificial birds and animals was exorbitant, whether for their own profit or for the profit of the temple authorities. Such operations could be carried on at a suitable distance from the sacred area so that the haggling and noise associated with such activities in an Eastern setting did not unnecessarily disturb the prayer and the offering of sacrifices carried on in the temple courts (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.7.11">Jer 7:11</a>).</p>

  <title>Monotheism*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MONOTHEISM*</p>
<p class="fl">Belief that there is only one God. It is distinguished from polytheism, which posits the existence of more than one god; from henotheism, which worships one god without denying the existence of other gods; and from atheism, which denies the existence of any God. The three great monotheistic religions of the world are, in their historic order, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.</p>
<p>If there is only one God, it follows that the deity is personal, sovereign, infinite, eternal, perfect, and almighty. This is, in fact, what Scripture declares of God in his essential being. It is only in the biblical revelation that we can know clearly and certainly who God is and what he is like. He must be distinct from the world (thus avoiding pantheism) in such a way that he is the only Creator and sustainer of the universe and the Lord of history. He is above and beyond his creation (divine transcendence), and yet he enters into time and human affairs (divine immanence). The biblical doctrine of monotheism is known both through historical events involving “the God who acts” for the salvation of the human race and through his verbal communication as “the God who speaks” to chosen servants for the instruction and edification of those who believe. It is in such dimensions that monotheism embraces the possibility and reality of direct encounter between the eternal and infinite God and the finite, sinful creature. The NT makes it clear that this is accomplished through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, man was originally a monotheist. No other conclusion is possible from the Genesis records (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-3.24">Gn 1–3</a>). Polytheism developed later as a sinful corruption of the pristine belief in one true God, the God of Creation, revelation, and redemption. This corruption had set in at least by the time of Abraham, for God’s call of Abraham to leave Ur of the Chaldees and journey toward Canaan, the land God had promised him and his posterity, undoubtedly involved a break with the polytheism of his ancestors in the area of Ur (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31-12.9">11:31–12:9</a>).</p>
<p>When Abraham reached Canaan, the Promised Land, he and his family found people worshiping a multitude of gods. Each ethnic grouping in Palestine had its own god or many gods (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.3-35">Gn 31:3-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.11.24">Jgs 11:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.2-5">1 Sm 5:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.33">1 Kgs 11:33</a>). In their disobedience, the sons of Abraham were continually losing faith in God and lusting after the gods of the Canaanites or diluting the true worship of God with the heathen practices associated with the worship of the Canaanite gods (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.2-4">Gn 35:2-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.24.2">Jos 24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">1 Kgs 16:30-33</a>). One of the major roles of the prophets was to call the Jews back to true worship and faith in the one God, “the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6,15-16">Ex 3:6, 15-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.17-18">1 Kgs 18:17-18</a>). This reminder of their monotheistic heritage was constantly needed because of the ever-present danger of losing it through contact with the polytheistic beliefs and practices of their idolatrous neighbors. Such reminders were necessary even for leaders like David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.26.19">1 Sm 26:19</a>), and certainly for Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-7">1 Kgs 11:1-7</a>) and later kings (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.28-32">12:28-32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.31">2 Kgs 10:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.17">22:17</a>).</p>
<p>The early prophets did not clearly delineate a formal doctrine of monotheism; rather, they showed the importance and unreality of the pagan gods (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.24">1 Kgs 18:24</a>). It was the eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophets who asserted a monotheistic faith in the face of a persistent polytheism. It was not until the time of the exile that the Jews were cured of their idolatrous polytheism, when their enemies took away their idols and demonstrated their impotence (<a href="?bref=Ps.115.1-18">Ps 115</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.1-13">Is 46</a>). Then Israel learned that God alone was their refuge and help in the time of trouble, because he only is the true and living God who can save his people when they repent of their sins and obey the divine will.</p>

  <title>Moon</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MOON</p>
<p class="fl">Lesser luminary of the heavens (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.16">Gn 1:16</a>). Many Semitic languages use the same word for moon as the Hebrew. In three passages in the Hebrew OT (<a href="?bref=Song.6.10">Sg 6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.23">Is 24:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.26">30:26</a>), the moon is called “the white one,” and paired with “the hot one,” the sun. Another term, “crescent,” is used in other languages such as Aramaic and Arabic, and “crescent ornaments” (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.21,26">Jgs 8:21, 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.18">Is 3:18</a>) are mentioned.</p>
<p>In the creation account, it is said concerning the functions of the two luminaries: “They will be signs to mark off the seasons, the days, and the years” (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.14">Gn 1:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>)—that is, “times” are determined by their movements. For this reason, when telling about the mighty deeds of the Lord in Creation, the poet says, “You made the moon to mark the seasons” (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.19">Ps 104:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The ancient Hebrew calendar was lunar (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.43.6-7">Ecclus 43:6-7</a>), the months beginning with the new moon, marked by special rituals (<a href="?bref=Num.10.10">Nm 10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.11-14">28:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.4">2 Chr 2:4</a>). Two great festivals, Passover and Tabernacles, began in midmonth when the moon was full (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.5-6">Lv 23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.81.3-5">Ps 81:3-5</a>; and <a href="?bref=Lev.23.34">Lv 23:34</a>, respectively). The seven-day week is a division of the 28-day lunar cycle into logical and convenient units, so the moon may be said to provide the basis for the significance of the number seven. As a corollary, the beginning of the seventh month, the Festival of Trumpets (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.24">Lv 23:24</a>), marked the climax month of the sacred feasts; it also signified the New Year for regnal years and for agriculture (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 1.1.3; Mishnah, <span class="ital">Rosh Hashanah</span> 1:1).</p>
<p>One verse in the creation story speaks of the sun’s dominion over the day and the moon’s over the night (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.16">Gn 1:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.136.9">Ps 136:9</a>). The moon is also mentioned (alongside the sun) in the general order of creation when the spheres of the universe were established (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.35">Jer 31:35</a>). From this the luminaries symbolize the continuity of the world order (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.5">Pss 72:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.37-38">89:37-38</a>). The darkening of the moon (and the sun) is a sign of the change of the order in creation in the latter days (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.10">Is 13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.7">Ez 32:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.10">Jl 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.3.11">Hb 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.29">Mt 24:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.24">Mk 13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.12">Rv 6:12</a>; the converse is stated in <a href="?bref=Isa.30.26">Is 30:26</a>). Since the moon resembles the sun, it also has the power to smite (<a href="?bref=Ps.121.6">Ps 121:6</a>) and to influence the growth of crops in the field (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.14">Dt 33:14</a>). In the book of Deuteronomy, the Israelites were warned against worshiping the moon and the rest of the host of heaven (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.19">Dt 4:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.3">17:3</a>), but this foreign worship made its inroads into the Judean kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.3">2 Kgs 21:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.4-5">23:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.7.18">Jer 7:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.8.2">8:2</a>).</p>
<p>To keep an accurate control over the calendar and the feasts, the new moon was carefully observed seven times during the year in Jerusalem. This assured that the major feasts fell on the proper days. The Sanhedrin would gather early in the morning on the last day of the preceding month, and watchmen were posted to observe the moon’s first appearance. When the evidence became clear, the sacred word was pronounced and the day became the first of the new month. Fire signals beginning from the Mt of Olives announced the new moon; later they were replaced by messengers because the Samaritans had set up false signals along the way.</p>

  <title>Mordecai</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MORDECAI</p>
<p class="list">1. Jewish leader during the exile. Our knowledge of Mordecai comes exclusively from the book of Esther, which, according to some rabbinic sources, Mordecai himself wrote. Mordecai’s activities are set against the period in which Xerxes (Ahasuerus) reigned over ancient Persia, a vast empire stretching over 127 provinces. Mordecai was a Benjamite descendant of Kish, the father of King Saul. His relatives were among those Jews who left Palestine during the captivity of Nebuchadnezzar. While his name reveals a Babylonian etymology, his heart burned with love for his countrymen who, notwithstanding the decree of Cyrus permitting their return to the Holy Land (538 <span class="era">BC</span>), determined to colonize in dispersion rather than face the hardships of resettling in Palestine.</p>
<p class="list-text">His remarkable life’s drama is intertwined with Hadassah (Esther), his cousin, who became his ward following the death of her parents. Esther’s sudden, unexpected exaltation to the position of queen following Vashti’s deposition was an essential link to the deliverance of her people; Mordecai’s forceful influence upon this beautiful Jewess was another. Behind them both, however, moved their sovereign God, whose love for Israel provided protection against the malevolent designs of Xerxes’ prime minister, Haman.</p>
<p class="list-text">Haman, the very incarnation of evil, had determined to exterminate the Jews of Persia because of Mordecai’s unwillingness to pay him homage. Mordecai, learning of the plot, communicated the matter to Esther by way of Hathach, one of the king’s officers. Her initial hesitancy to intervene on behalf of her people was met with her cousin’s concise and stern answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?” (<a href="?bref=Esth.4.13-14">Est 4:13-14</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Several days elapsed during which Haman erected an enormous gallows upon which to hang Mordecai. On the evening of its completion, Xerxes, being unable to sleep, ordered the book containing the record of his reign to be read to him. Upon hearing of the actions of Mordecai in frustrating an earlier assassination attempt against him, he inquired as to what honors Mordecai had received in recognition of his service. Finding he had not been rewarded, Xerxes summoned Haman and asked him what fitting thing should be done for the man the king had purposed to honor. Haman, thinking that he was the object of the king’s query, responded with three grand ideas (<a href="?bref=Esth.6.7-9">Est 6:7-9</a>). Ironically, Haman was chosen to carry out his recommendations on behalf of Mordecai. A final touch of irony is seen in the execution of Haman on the very instrument he had prepared for Mordecai.</p>
<p class="list-text">Following Haman’s death, Mordecai and Esther had to act quickly to counteract the irrevocable edict directed against the Jews at Haman’s instigation. Xerxes, now solicitous of the Jews’ well-being, issued another edict allowing the Jews the freedom both to defend themselves and to retaliate against any aggressors. Apparently, the Persian officials to whom Mordecai forwarded this follow-up directive cooperated fully in protecting the Jews from their adversaries, thousands of whom were slain.</p>
<p class="list-text">Consequently, Mordecai instructed all Jews to celebrate the time of their deliverance annually on the 14th and 15th days of Adar (roughly, March). The name of the festival, Purim, is derived from the word <span class="hebrew">pur</span> (“lot”), which was cast by Haman to determine the day for the Jews’ annihilation.</p>

<p class="h1">MORESHETH-GATH</p>
<p class="fl">Town in the lowland country of Judah included in Micah’s lament (<a href="?bref=Mic.1.14">Mi 1:14</a>); perhaps the same as Moresheth, Micah’s hometown. The “gath” in Moresheth-gath suggests that the town was in close proximity to the major Philistine city by that name. Its exact location is uncertain. Jerome (a fourth-century <span class="era">AD</span> church father) suggested that Moresheth-gath was situated a short distance east of Eleutheropolis, identifiable with modern Khirbet el-Basel. Another possible site is Tell ej-Judeideh, six miles (9.7 kilometers) southeast of Gath.</p>

  <title>Moriah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MORIAH</p>
<p class="fl">Name used twice in the OT. Abraham was sent to sacrifice his son Isaac in “the land of Moriah” (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.2">Gn 22:2</a>). Because in the narrative it is said that the ram was “provided” in the place of Isaac when God “appeared” to Abraham, it has been suggested that the form of the name “Moriah” may be connected with this. (The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">ra’ah</span> can have the meanings “see,” “provide,” and “appear,” and the ending <span class="hebrew">-iah</span> is the shortened form of the name of the Lord that is found in many Hebrew names.)</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.1">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>, Mt Moriah is the place of Solomon’s temple, specifically identified with the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-25">2 Sm 24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1-30">1 Chr 21</a>), but not explicitly with the place of Abraham’s sacrifice. Some, however, see in the description of the Lord’s appearing to David a reminder of his appearing to Abraham there. The Jewish historian Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 1.13.2; 7.13.4) clearly connects the place of the temple with the place where Isaac was offered up, as does the second-century <span class="era">BC</span> book of Jubilees (Jubilees 18:13). Samaritan tradition linked Moriah with Mt Gerizim. Muslim tradition connects the Dome of the Rock that stands today on the site of the Jerusalem temple with Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac on the great rock under the dome of the mosque.</p>

  <title>Morning Star</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MORNING STAR</p>
<p class="fl">Literally, Venus. The phrase is closely related to the idea of the “dayspring” (<a href="?bref=Job.38.12">Jb 38:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.78">Lk 1:78</a>) and the “daystar” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.1.19">2 Pt 1:19</a>). The identity of the star is settled when Christ says, “I am the morning star” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.16">Rv 22:16</a>). It is another way of saying, “I am the light of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">Jn 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.5">9:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.46">12:46</a>). The central concept found in the symbol is that of Christ as light shining in darkness (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.32">Lk 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.4,7-9">Jn 1:4, 7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.19">3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.35">12:35</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.4.6">2 Cor 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.14">Eph 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.8">1 Jn 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.23">Rv 21:23</a>). With the birth of the Messiah, the morning star arose—the gospel light dawned (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-2">Is 9:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.4.15-16">Mt 4:15-16</a>). The phrase points to Christ’s glory, as the source of light, and to his grace in the sharing of life. Christ not only described himself as the morning star but also declared that he gives the morning star to those who overcome (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.28">Rv 2:28</a>).</p>

  <title>Moses</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MOSES</p>
<p class="fl">Great leader of the Hebrew people who brought them out of bondage in Egypt to the Promised Land in Canaan; also the one who gave them the law at Mt Sinai that became the basis for their religious faith through the centuries. Focused in this one person are the figures of prophet, priest, lawgiver, judge, intercessor, shepherd, miracle worker, and founder of a nation.</p>
<p>The meaning of his name is uncertain. It has been explained as a Hebrew word meaning “to draw out” (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.10">Ex 2:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.22.17">2 Sm 22:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.16">Ps 18:16</a>). If, however, it is an Egyptian name given him by the daughter of Pharaoh who found him, it is more likely from an Egyptian word for “son” (also found as part of many well-known Egyptian names such as Ahmose, Thutmose, and Ramses). No one else in the OT bears this name.</p>
<p>Without question, the greatest figure in the OT (mentioned by name 767 times), his influence also extends to the pages of the NT (where he is mentioned 79 times). The first 40 years of his life were spent in the household of Pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.23">Acts 7:23</a>), where he was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. The next 40 years he spent in Midian as a fugitive from the wrath of Pharaoh, after killing an Egyptian who was mistreating a Hebrew. His last 40 years were devoted to leading the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt to the land God had promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>). He died at the age of 120 after leading the Israelites successfully through 40 years of wandering in the wilderness to the very edge of the Promised Land on the east side of the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.7">Dt 34:7</a>). He is one of the great figures in all of history, a man who took a group of slaves and, under inconceivably difficult circumstances, molded them into a nation that has influenced and altered the entire course of history.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The only source of information for the life of Moses is the Bible. Archaeology confirms the credibility of the events associated with Moses, but it has never provided any specific confirmation of his existence or work. His story begins with the arrival in Egypt of Jacob, his sons, and their families during a time of famine in Canaan. Invited by Joseph and welcomed by Pharaoh, the family settled down in northeast Egypt in an area known as Goshen, where they remained for 430 years (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Ex 12:40</a>). With the passing of time, their numbers grew rapidly, so that the land was filled with them (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.7">1:7</a>). A new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. The biblical account does not give the name of this pharaoh, and there has never been agreement as to his identity. He has most frequently been identified as Thutmose III (1504–1451 <span class="era">BC</span>), Seti I (1304–1290 <span class="era">BC</span>), or Ramses II (1290–1224 <span class="era">BC</span>). Out of fear that their growing numbers might become a threat to the security of his nation, Pharaoh determined to take measures to reduce their number. He put them to work building the store cities of Pithom and Rameses, but the severity of the work did not diminish them. He next tried to enlist the cooperation of the midwives to destroy the male babies, but they would not carry out his orders. He then ordered his own people to drown the male infants in the Nile River. Against the background of this first-known Jewish persecution, the baby Moses was born.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheFirst40YearsInEgypt">The First 40 Years—In Egypt</p>
<p class="h3">Birth and Early Life</p>
<p class="fl">A man of the family of Levi named Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.20">Ex 6:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.2.1">2:1</a>). Their first son, Aaron, three years older than Moses, was born before the command to drown the Hebrew babies was given, as there is no indication that his life was in danger. However, the cruel order was in force when Moses was born, and after three months, when his mother could no longer hide him, she took a basket made of bulrushes and daubed it with bitumen and pitch. She put the baby into the basket and placed it among the reeds along the banks of the river. An older sister, Miriam, stayed near the river to see what would happen. Soon the daughter of Pharaoh (identified by Josephus as Thermuthis and by others as Hatshepsut, but whose actual identity cannot be determined) came to the river to bathe, as was her custom. She discovered the baby, recognized it as one of the Hebrew children, and determined that she would raise the child as her own. Miriam emerged from her hiding place and offered to secure a Hebrew woman to nurse the child, an arrangement that was agreeable to the princess. Miriam took the baby to his own mother, who kept him for perhaps two or three years (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.19-24">1 Sm 1:19-24</a>). Nothing is recorded of those formative years. Whether his mother continued seeing him during his later childhood and young manhood or revealed his true identity to him or taught him the Hebrew faith are matters of speculation. Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, as would befit a member of the royal household, and he became mighty in his words and deeds (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.22">Acts 7:22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Identification with His Own People</p>
<p class="fl">Just when Moses became aware that he was a Hebrew rather than Egyptian cannot be known, but it is clear that he knew it by the time he was 40 years old. One day he went out to visit his people and to observe their treatment, for the cruel measures taken against them by Pharaoh at the time of Moses’ birth had not been lifted. Seeing an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, Moses in great anger killed the Egyptian and buried him. He thought the deed had gone unnoticed until the next day when he encountered two Hebrews fighting with each other. When he tried to act as peacemaker, they both turned on him and accused him of murder: “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you mean to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.14">Ex 2:14</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). <a href="?bref=Acts.7.25">Acts 7:25</a> adds: “He supposed that his brethren understood that God was giving them deliverance by his hand” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Aware that being a member of Pharaoh’s household would not exempt him from punishment now that the deed was known, Moses fled for his life to the land of Midian.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSecond40YearsInMidian">The Second 40 Years—In Midian</p>
<p class="h3">Marriage into the Family of Jethro</p>
<p class="fl">Soon after arriving in Midian, Moses sat down by a well, where he observed the seven daughters of the priest of Midian who had come to the well to draw water for their father’s flock. Shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses intervened and helped them water their animals. When Jethro (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">Ex 3:1</a>; also called Reuel, <a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">2:18</a>; Hobab, <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>) learned what had happened, he invited Moses to stay with his family and gave him Zipporah as his wife. (There is some disagreement among scholars regarding the identity of Hobab in <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Numbers 10:29</a>; some think he was Moses’ father-in-law, while others maintain that Hobab was Moses’ brother-in-law. <span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="?item=Hobab_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Hobab</a>). Two children, Gershom (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.22">Ex 2:22</a>) and Eliezer (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.4">18:4</a>), were born to Moses and Zipporah during the years in Midian. Forty years passed, and Moses’ thoughts about his former life in Egypt must have faded into the past. He could not have foreseen that God would soon thrust him back into the midst of the court in Egypt, where he would confront the son of the now-dead pharaoh with the demand to release the Hebrew people from the bondage they had endured for so many years. God had not forgotten his people and was now ready to deliver them.</p>
<p class="h3">Encounter with God at the Burning Bush</p>
<p class="fl">One day, while Moses was taking care of the flocks of his father-in-law, he led them to Mt Horeb (known also as Sinai), where God appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush that burned but was not consumed. Moses approached to observe the strange sight more closely and heard God speak to him out of the bush, “Moses, Moses!” Moses replied, “Here am I.” Before he could come any nearer to the bush, God said, “Do not come near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.4-5">Ex 3:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). He further identified himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He assured Moses that he was aware of the cruel afflictions of his people and had heard their cries. Then he told of his plan to send Moses to Egypt to deliver his people from their bondage.</p>
<p>Faced with a challenge that seemed beyond his capabilities, the aged Moses began making excuses for not accepting the task. God assured Moses that he would be with him (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.11-12">Ex 3:11-12</a>). To his excuse that he would not be able to give an answer if the people asked him the name of the God he represented, God revealed his name in the cryptic statement, “ ‘<span class="divine-name">I Am the One Who Always Is</span>’ . . . Just tell them, ‘I <span class="divine-name">Am</span> has sent me to you’ ” (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.3.13-14">13-14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Many interpretations have been proposed for the name. Whatever else it means, it undoubtedly suggests the self-existence and all-sufficiency of God. Moses then argued that the people would not believe him when he told them that God had sent him to deliver them from Egypt. In response God gave him three signs: When he cast his shepherd’s rod to the ground, it became a serpent. When he put his hand to his bosom, it became leprous. He was also told that when he would pour water from the Nile on the ground, it would become blood (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.1-9">Ex 4:1-9</a>). Even armed with these powerful evidences of the presence of God with him, Moses raised still another objection, “O Lord, I’m just not a good speaker. I never have been, and I’m not now, even after you have spoken to me. I’m clumsy with words” (v <a href="?bref=Exod.4.10">10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). God told him that he would teach him what to say, but despite such assurance, Moses asked God to send someone else. In anger mingled with compassion, God made Moses’ brother, Aaron, the spokesman, but said his instructions would still be given directly to Moses.</p>
<p class="h3">Return to Egypt</p>
<p class="fl">Moses took his wife and sons and set out for Egypt, telling his father-in-law only that he wanted to go back to Egypt to visit his kinsmen there (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.18">Ex 4:18</a>). The biblical account says he put his wife and sons on the same donkey to journey back to Egypt (v <a href="?bref=Exod.4.20">20</a>). The fact that all three rode the same animal indicates that both children were quite young and had not been born in the early years of Moses’ marriage. At a lodging place along the way a strange thing happened. The Lord met him and sought to kill him (v <a href="?bref=Exod.4.24">24</a>), apparently because Moses had failed to circumcise the baby before leaving Midian. When Zipporah realized that Moses’ life was in danger, she performed the rite herself and said to her husband, “What a blood-smeared bridegroom you are to me!” (v <a href="?bref=Exod.4.25">25</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Whatever else may have been involved in this unusual encounter with God, it was a solemn reminder that the one who was to be the leader of the covenant people must not himself neglect any part of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.10-14">Gn 17:10-14</a>).</p>
<p>God told Aaron (who was still in Egypt) to go to the mountain where Moses had encountered God at the burning bush and meet his brother there. Moses told Aaron everything that had happened, and together they went to Egypt, gathered the elders together, and informed them of these matters. When Moses and Aaron performed the signs in the presence of the people, they believed these leaders had been sent by God to deliver them from their affliction (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.30-31">Ex 4:30-31</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheThird40YearsFromEgypttoCanaan">The Third 40 Years—From Egypt to Canaan</p>
<p class="h3">The Encounter with Pharaoh</p>
<p class="fl">Soon after his return to Egypt, Moses, accompanied by Aaron, went to Pharaoh and repeated the demands of the Lord, “Let my people go, for they must go out into the wilderness to hold a religious festival in my honor” (<a href="?bref=Exod.5.1">Ex 5:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Pharaoh rejected the demand with the observation that he had never heard of this God of Moses. When one realizes that Egyptian kings considered themselves to be gods, the affront to Pharaoh becomes even more acute. Not only did he reject Moses’ demands, but he intensified the burdens of the Hebrews. Their work had up until then required them to make brick using straw provided for them, but now Pharaoh said they would have to gather their own straw and still produce the same number of bricks. The Hebrews turned in anguish and anger to Moses and blamed him for making them offensive in the sight of Pharaoh. Even Moses could not understand the turn of events and complained bitterly to God. God reassured Moses that he would deliver the Hebrews from their bondage, and moreover, he would bring them into the land he had promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He then instructed Moses to return to Pharaoh and repeat the demand to release the Hebrews upon threat of severe reprisal if the demand were ignored.</p>
<p>Ushered again into Pharaoh’s presence, Moses repeated his request for release of the Israelites. He attempted to impress Pharaoh by turning his rod into a serpent, but the Egyptian wise men, through their secret arts, were able to duplicate the miracle, so Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened and he would not listen to Moses. In rapid succession Moses brought nine plagues upon the land of Egypt to show the omnipotence of God to force the compliance of Pharaoh. These included a plague in which the water of the Nile turned to blood, a plague of frogs, one of gnats, then of flies, a plague on the livestock, boils on the people, plagues of hail, locusts, and complete darkness. During the plagues of the frogs, flies, hail, locusts, and darkness, Pharaoh was distraught and would temporarily relent and agree to Moses’ demands, but as soon as the plague was lifted, his heart hardened and he would retract his promise. The outcome of the first nine plagues was terrible devastation of the land of Egypt, but the Israelites were not released. There was yet one more plague in store, the most terrible of all.</p>
<p class="h3">The First Passover</p>
<p class="fl">God told Moses that there remained one more plague in store for the Egyptians: “All the firstborn sons will die in every family in Egypt, from the oldest son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the oldest son of his lowliest slave. Even the firstborn of the animals will die” (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.5">Ex 11:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Furthermore, he assured Moses that the plague would not touch a single household of the Hebrews, “Then you will know that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> makes a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites” (v <a href="?bref=Exod.11.7">7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>God instructed the people through Moses and Aaron to make their preparations for leaving the land in haste. They were to go to the Egyptians and ask them for their jewels of silver and gold (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.2-3">Ex 11:2-3</a>), a request to which the Egyptians agreed, perhaps out of fear of the Hebrews and in the belief that the gifts would bring about an end of the terrors that had struck the land. The Hebrews were also instructed to prepare a lamb for each family—small families could share—for the last meal to be eaten in the land of Egypt (a rite that became the pattern for the Jewish observance of the Passover for many centuries). Blood of the lamb was to be put on the doorposts and lintels of the houses in which the Passover meal was being eaten that night. The Hebrews were promised that wherever the blood was on the door, no harm would come to that household. They were also instructed to prepare unleavened bread. At midnight the death angel of the Lord killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh himself to the lowest captive in a dungeon; not a single house of the Egyptians escaped tragedy. When Pharaoh saw what had happened, he ordered Moses and the people to leave the land at once (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.31-32">12:31-32</a>). The biblical record says that about 600,000 Hebrew men left Egypt. Together with women and children, the total would have been in excess of 2 million people.</p>
<p class="h3">The Exodus from Egypt</p>
<p class="fl">The exodus is the central event of the OT and marks the birth of Israel as a nation. The Jewish people still look back to that event as the great redemptive act of God in history on behalf of his people, much as Christians look upon the cross as the great redemptive act of their faith.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="MosesLeadstheIsraelitestoMountSinai"/>
<p>The exact route taken by the Hebrews out of Egypt cannot be determined today, though many possibilities have been proposed. They did not take the shortest, most direct route to Canaan (which would have been about a 10 days’ journey along the Mediterranean coastline), but set out in the direction of Mt Sinai, where Moses had earlier met God at the burning bush. As a sign that Moses had been sent to deliver the people, God told Moses he would bring them to that same spot, where they would worship God (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.12">Ex 3:12</a>). The Hebrews did not forget the request of Joseph to carry his bones with them when they returned to their own land (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.25">Gn 50:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.19">Ex 13:19</a>).</p>
<p>As the people journeyed, they were preceded by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night. The cloud represented the presence of God with his people and guided them along the route they should travel.</p>
<p>Back in Egypt, Pharaoh was having second thoughts about letting the Hebrews leave the land and decided to pursue them with his army and bring them back. When the Hebrews saw the approaching cloud of dust and realized that the Egyptian army was pursuing them, they were terrified. The sea lay ahead of them and the Egyptians were behind; there seemed to be no way of escape. The people turned on Moses, blaming him for bringing them out of Egypt. God again assured them that they did not need to be afraid or do anything to defend themselves. He promised to fight the battle for them and give them victory (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.14">Ex 14:14</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord parted the water of the Sea of Reeds (traditionally but erroneously referred to as the Red Sea) by a strong east wind and allowed the Israelites to pass through the sea on dry ground to the other side. The Egyptians rushed after the Israelites, following them into the dry bed of the sea. But before they reached the other side, the waters rushed back together, destroying the Egyptian army in the midst of the sea and leaving the Israelites safe on the other side. The people celebrated their great deliverance in song (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>) and then continued their journey. The narrative that follows describes the struggle of the Israelites to survive in the desert—problems of food and water, internal dissension, murmurings against Moses, and battles with enemies. Through all their experiences, Moses towers as the unifying force and great spiritual leader.</p>
<p>In spite of having seen God’s great act of deliverance so recently, the faith of the Israelites was not strong. Three days later they came to a place where the water was not fit to drink, and they began complaining against Moses. The Lord showed Moses how to purify the water, and the people’s needs were satisfied (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.22-25">Ex 15:22-25</a>). When they reached the wilderness of Sin, they complained again, this time because of lack of food. God met their need by supplying manna, a breadlike substance that would serve as their food until they came to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.1-21">16:1-21</a>). Later, camped at Rephidim, the people complained again, this time for lack of water. Once again God met their needs by supplying water from the rock at Horeb (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.1-7">17:1-7</a>). The Amalekites attacked them while they were still camped at Rephidim, but God gave a great victory to the Israelites (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-13">8-13</a>).</p>
<p>Moses and the people reached Sinai and camped there. Jethro came to visit, bringing Moses’ wife and sons. Zipporah had apparently decided to return with her children to stay with her father rather than to go on to Egypt with Moses. It was a joyful reunion, and Jethro made a burnt offering and sacrifices to God (an act that has evoked the suggestion that Jethro was a true worshiper of God, though nothing is known of his links to the Hebrew faith). When Jethro observed Moses trying to settle all the disputes and problems of the Hebrews unaided, he proposed that Moses delegate responsibility for some of the lesser matters to able men chosen from among the people. Moses accepted the suggestion, and shortly afterward Jethro returned to his own land. He did not remain at Sinai to participate in the ratification of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-27">Ex 18:13-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Giving of the Law at Sinai</p>
<p class="fl">God had kept his promises to Moses. He had delivered the Hebrews from their Egyptian bondage and brought them to the very place where he had commissioned Moses to be their leader. He was now ready to enter into a covenant relationship with Israel. Amid a spectacular and terrifying scene of lightning, thunder, thick clouds, fire, smoke, and earthquake, God descended to the top of Sinai and called Moses to come up the mountain, where he remained 40 days to receive the law that would become the basis of the covenant.</p>
<p>At Sinai, God was revealed as the God who demands exclusive allegiance in all areas of life and, at the same time, as the God who desires personal fellowship with his people.</p>
<p class="h3">Apostasy of the People</p>
<p class="fl">While Moses tarried on Mt Sinai, the people below became impatient and skeptical about his return, so they went to Aaron and asked him to make idols for them to worship. They contributed the gold earrings they were wearing. “Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and molded and tooled it into the shape of a calf. The people exclaimed, ‘O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of Egypt!’ ” (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.4">Ex 32:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The next day they joined in the worship of the idol with sacrifices and revelry. God told Moses what was taking place below and angrily declared that he was going to destroy the people but would make a great nation of Moses and his descendants. Moses immediately interceded on behalf of the people, and God’s wrath abated. Moses descended the mountain, carrying the two tablets of stone on which the law had been written, but when he entered the camp and saw what was taking place, he could not restrain his anger. He threw the stone tablets to the ground, ground the golden calf to powder, mixed it with water, and forced the people to drink it. He turned angrily to Aaron and demanded an explanation for the great sin that had been committed. Aaron lamely tried to shift the blame by minimizing his own role: “I threw them [the gold] into the fire—and out came this calf!” (v <a href="?bref=Exod.32.24">24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Moses called for volunteers to carry out God’s judgment on the people for the great sin they had committed. Men of the tribe of Levi responded and executed about 3,000 men. Later they were commended and rewarded (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.9-10">Dt 33:9-10</a>). Moses again interceded for the people, requesting that he be destroyed with the rest if God could not forgive them. God relented and promised Moses that the angel of the Lord would go with them still (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.34">Ex 32:34</a>).</p>
<p>Then Moses made a special request that he might be allowed to see the glory of the Lord. God instructed Moses to hew out two more tablets of stone like the ones he had destroyed and to return to the top of the mountain the next day. There the Lord passed before him and proclaimed his name: “I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the merciful and gracious God. I am slow to anger and rich in unfailing love and faithfulness” (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Ex 34:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Moses remained on the mountain another 40 days, where he received renewed warnings against idolatry and further instructions from the Lord, together with another copy of the Ten Commandments on tablets of stone. When Moses came down from the mountain, he was not aware that the skin of his face shone as a result of talking with God. At first the people were afraid to come near him, but he called them together and repeated all the Lord had said to him on the mountain. Afterward, he covered his face with a veil, which he removed only when he went into the presence of the Lord. Paul said the purpose of the veil was to prevent the people from seeing the heavenly light gradually fade from Moses’ face (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.13">2 Cor 3:13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Tabernacle and Establishment of the Priesthood</p>
<p class="fl">When Moses went up to the mountain the first time to receive the law from God, he was instructed to collect materials to be used in the construction of the tabernacle or tent. Gold, silver, bronze, blue and purple and scarlet yarn, fine twined linen, goats’ hair, tanned rams’ skins, goatskins, and acacia wood would be needed, along with oil for the lamps, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, onyx stones, and stones for setting (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.3-7">Ex 25:3-7</a>). The pattern for construction was also given to him, together with the ritual to be used for the consecration of the priests. A man named Bezalel was put in charge of the construction of the tabernacle, assisted by Oholiab (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.1-6">31:1-6</a>). The tabernacle was portable like a tent so that it could be taken down and moved from place to place as the Hebrews continued their journey toward Canaan.</p>
<p>In addition to giving Moses directions for the tabernacle, God also instructed him concerning the sacrifices that were to be brought: the burnt offering, grain offering, peace offering, sin offering, and guilt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-7.38">Lv 1–7</a>). The solemn ceremony for ordaining Aaron and his sons as priests and for inaugurating the worship practices were to be performed by Moses (chs <a href="?bref=Lev.8.1-9.24">8–9</a>).</p>
<p>Sometime after this solemn inauguration of the religious ritual actually took place, Nadab and Abihu, two of Aaron’s four sons, offered unauthorized fire before the Lord. A fire came out from the Lord and destroyed them. Moses forbade Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar to express grief because of the sinfulness of the act (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-7">Lv 10:1-7</a>). The nature of their sin is difficult to determine, but it surely involved a violation of God’s holiness. Therefore, it is appropriate that a large part of the remainder of the book of Leviticus gives regulations that stress the holy living that God expected from his people.</p>
<p class="h3">From Sinai to Kadesh</p>
<p class="fl">A year had elapsed from the time the Israelites left Egypt until the census was taken (<a href="?bref=Num.9.1">Nm 9:1</a>). God reminded the people that it was time to observe the Passover, which they did, and a month later they set out from Sinai and came to the wilderness of Paran. Along the way they complained about the unvarying diet of manna and they longed for the fish, cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic they had eaten in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Num.11.4-6">11:4-6</a>). In anger God sent quail in abundance, but even while the people were devouring the meat, God sent a great plague that killed many Israelites. The complaining attitude of the people was shared even by Miriam and Aaron. They began to speak against the Cushite woman Moses had married (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1-2">12:1-2</a>). It is not certain whether the Cushite was an Ethiopian or whether this was another way of referring to Zipporah. If Moses did marry a second time, no mention is made of it elsewhere in the OT. Moses made no reply to the accusations of his brother and sister. It was not necessary, for God intervened in defense of his servant. He smote Miriam with leprosy for her part in speaking against Moses, and when Aaron saw what had happened to Miriam, he acknowledged that they both had sinned. Miriam’s leprosy was removed in response to Moses’ fervent intercession.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="MosesLeadstheIsraelitestowardthePromisedLand"/>
<p>While the people were encamped at Kadesh (also called Kadesh-barnea—<a href="?bref=Num.32.8">Nm 32:8</a>) in the wilderness of Paran, Moses sent 12 men into Canaan, one from each tribe, to spy out the land in preparation for the Israelite entry. After 40 days the spies returned and, though they acknowledged that the land was fertile and inviting, 10 of them were afraid of the Canaanite inhabitants and advised against going into the land. Only Joshua and Caleb were willing to go ahead and occupy the territory. The entire congregation joined the protest against going in and determined to choose a new leader and return to Egypt rather than risk death by the sword in Canaan. They threatened to stone Moses and Aaron. At that moment God intervened and would have destroyed all the people on the spot except for the intervention of Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.13.1-14.19">13:1–14:19</a>). He declared that, if God did not bring the people into Canaan, the nations round about would conclude that the God of the Israelites was unable to bring them into the land. Once again God acquiesced to Moses’ request to pardon the people but said that none of them 20 years and older who had complained against him would be allowed to enter the land. All the people would wander in the wilderness for 40 years until that generation died, and then their children would be allowed to enter Canaan (<a href="?bref=Num.14.29-33">14:29-33</a>). When they heard the Lord’s sentence upon them, the people quickly decided to lift the sentence of judgment by entering the land at once, but God was not with them, and they suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Amalekites and Canaanites.</p>
<p class="h3">Forty Years in the Wilderness</p>
<p class="fl">Very little is known about events during the 40 years of wilderness wanderings. In spite of the judgment that had already come upon them, the people did not seem to change their ways. A man named Korah led another rebellion against the authority of Moses and Aaron. God would not listen to the pleas of Moses and Aaron on behalf of these dissidents (<a href="?bref=Num.16.22-24">Nm 16:22-24</a>), but told the congregation to separate itself from the tents of Korah and his conspirators. While the people watched, the ground split open and swallowed up the rebellious factions together with their households and all their possessions. Though the rest of the Israelites witnessed the fate of the rebels, it did not deter them from again turning on Moses and Aaron. At this, God told Moses to remove himself from the murmuring congregation in order that he could take vengeance. Though Moses offered atonement for the people’s sins, 14,700 died by plague before the punishment was ended. To demonstrate further to the people that Moses was his chosen leader, the Lord instructed Moses to take rods, one for each tribe, and to deposit them in the tent of meeting. God would cause the rod of the man chosen by him to sprout, and so silence the murmurings of the people. The rod belonging to Aaron sprouted and budded and bloomed, but the people only complained more.</p>
<p>As the people neared the end of their years of wilderness wanderings, Miriam died in Kadesh and was buried there (<a href="?bref=Num.20.1">Nm 20:1</a>). Soon after, the people began to complain once more for lack of water. God instructed Moses to speak to a rock that would bring forth water to satisfy the needs of the people. Instead of speaking to the rock, Moses struck it twice with his rod. The water came forth, but God rebuked Moses and Aaron: “Because you did not trust me enough to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel, you will not lead them into the land I am giving them!” (v <a href="?bref=Num.20.12">12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The nature of the sin is not clear, but Moses and Aaron were apparently taking to themselves honor that belonged to God alone. Because of the sin, they were denied the privilege of leading the Israelites into the Promised Land. The punishment may seem too severe for the sin, but it shows that the privileged role of leadership given to Moses and Aaron carried with it an unusual measure of responsibility.</p>
<p>The people then journeyed from Kadesh to Mt Hor on the border of the land of Edom, where Aaron died. Moses took his priestly garments from him and gave them to Eleazar, his son, thereby transferring the priestly office (<a href="?bref=Num.20.28">Nm 20:28</a>).</p>
<p>As the people came closer to their destination, resistance on the part of the native population increased. There was a skirmish with the king of Arad and his forces at Hormah, resulting in a victory for Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.21.1-3">Nm 21:1-3</a>). As they journeyed around Edom, some of the Israelites began speaking against God and Moses because there was no food or water and they were tired of eating manna. This time the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many of them died of the venomous bites. Those who had not yet been bitten came to Moses, acknowledged their sin, and asked that the serpents be removed from their midst. God instructed Moses to make a serpent of bronze and set it on a pole. If a person bitten by a serpent looked up at the bronze serpent, he or she would live.</p>
<p>As the Israelites approached the territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites, they sent messengers asking permission to pass peaceably through his land. Instead of granting the request, Sihon gathered his army together and fought against Israel. He was killed in the battle, and his land and cities were taken and occupied by the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-25">Nm 21:21-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Arrival at the Jordan River</p>
<p class="fl">After their victory over Sihon, the Israelites set out again and encamped in the plains of Moab on the east side of the Jordan River facing Jericho, in full view of the Promised Land. The Moabites were terrified by the presence of these people because they had heard what happened to the Amorites. Their king, Balak, hired a magician named Balaam to curse the Israelites. Three times Balaam attempted to curse them, but each time God turned his words into a blessing (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Nm 22–24</a>). Though unable to curse the Israelites, Balaam was responsible for an even greater calamity. He advised the Moabites to entice the Israelites to sacrifice to their gods and bow down to them (<a href="?bref=Num.25.1-3">Nm 25:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.31.16">31:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.15">2 Pt 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.14">Rv 2:14</a>). While the people were worshiping the Moabite deity, Baal of Peor, God’s anger was kindled against them, and he sent a plague that killed 24,000 of them (<a href="?bref=Num.25.9">Nm 25:9</a>). It was Israel’s first encounter with the seductive allurement of licentious idolatry and an ominous foreview of what would happen after they settled down in Canaan. Their continued attraction to idolatry would be their final undoing.</p>
<p>After the plague, God instructed Moses and Eleazar to take another census of the people like the one almost 40 years earlier. A whole generation of Israelites had died in the wilderness, but they had been replaced by an almost equal number, so that now there were 601,730 men 20 years and older who were able to go to war (<a href="?bref=Num.26.51">Nm 26:51</a>). Not a man remained of those who had been counted in the first census, except Caleb and Joshua.</p>
<p>The Lord instructed Moses to lay hands on Joshua and commission him as the new leader in the sight of Eleazar the priest and all the congregation (<a href="?bref=Num.27.12-23">Nm 27:12-23</a>). In addition, the Lord gave Moses instructions concerning feasts and offerings and vows (chs <a href="?bref=Num.28.1-30.16">28–30</a>). God ordered Moses, as his last act as leader, to avenge the Israelites on the Midianites. In that battle the armies of Israel gained a great victory over the Midianites, killing their kings, their men, and also Balaam.</p>
<p>The Lord gave instructions to Moses concerning the boundaries that would mark the Promised Land and named the men who would divide the land among the tribes (<a href="?bref=Num.34.1-29">Nm 34</a>). He also ordered that 48 cities be given to the Levites, the priestly tribe, as their portion. Six of these were designated as cities of refuge where murderers could flee so that they would not be killed by those seeking vengeance without having an opportunity to stand before the congregation for judgment (ch <a href="?bref=Num.35.1-34">35</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Moses’ Death</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Deuteronomy has often been called Moses’ valedictory speech to the people, for in it Moses is not merely the chief speaker but the only speaker. With the congregation of his people gathered before him, he rehearsed all that God had done for them since leaving Sinai, and he reminded them of their failure to enter the Promised Land 38 years earlier (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.14">Dt 2:14</a>). He recalled his plea that God would let him cross the Jordan and see the land that was to be the home of the people, but God responded that Moses would only be allowed to view the land from the top of Pisgah. Moses then exhorted the people to obey the statutes and ordinances that had been given to them in order to experience God’s blessings in the land.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheDeathofMoses"/>
<p>As the day of Moses’ death approached, the Lord ordered Moses and Joshua to present themselves at the tent of meeting in order for Joshua to be commissioned as the new leader (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.14-23">Dt 31:14-23</a>). Before his death, Moses pronounced a blessing upon all the Israelites (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.33.1-29">33</a>). Having completed these tasks, Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mt Nebo, and to the top of Pisgah. From there God showed him the land promised long ago to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the land that was soon to be the home of the wandering Israelite tribes. Again God told him that he would not be allowed to cross over the Jordan. Moses died there and God buried him somewhere in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.6">34:6</a>). Moses was 120 years old when he died, and the Israelites mourned his death for 30 days. The finest tribute to Moses is found in the closing words of the book of Deuteronomy, “There has never been another prophet like Moses, whom the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> knew face to face” (v <a href="?bref=Deut.34.10">10</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="MosesintheNewTestament">Moses in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">All Jews and Christians in apostolic times considered Moses the author of the Pentateuch. Such expressions as “the law of Moses” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.22">Lk 2:22</a>), “Moses commanded” (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.7">Mt 19:7</a>), “Moses said” (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.10">Mk 7:10</a>) “and Moses wrote” (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.19">12:19</a>) shows that his name was synonymous with the OT books attributed to him. He is mentioned in the NT more than any other OT figure, a total of 79 times. His role as lawgiver is emphasized more than any other aspect of his life (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.4">Mt 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.10">Mk 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.17">Jn 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1">Acts 15:1</a>). He appears at the transfiguration of Jesus as the representative of OT law, along with Elijah as the representative of OT prophets (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-3">Mt 17:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>Moses’ role as prophet is also mentioned in the NT. As a prophet, he spoke of the coming Messiah and his sufferings (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.25-27">Lk 24:25-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.22">Acts 3:22</a>). The NT also draws from the life and experiences of Moses to show patterns of life under the new covenant. The nativity story of Jesus parallels the Mosaic story of the infant deliverer being rescued from the evil designs of an earthly despot (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-18">Mt 2:13-18</a>). Jesus’ proclamation of a new law in his Sermon on the Mount parallels the giving of the law at Sinai (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">Mt 5–7</a>) and presents Jesus as the authoritative interpreter of the will of God. Contrast between the old law and the new relationship with God is especially marked in the book of Galatians. The comparison of Moses with Christ is an important emphasis of the book of Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.5-6">Heb 3:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.11-22">9:11-22</a>). John contrasted the law that was given through Moses with the grace and truth that came through Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=John.1.17">Jn 1:17</a>). He also contrasted the manna in the wilderness to Jesus as “the bread of life” (<a href="?bref=John.6.30-35">6:30-35</a>).</p>
<p>Other references to Moses or to events associated with him include his birth (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.20">Acts 7:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.23">Heb 11:23</a>), the burning bush (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.37">Lk 20:37</a>), the magicians of Egypt (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.8">2 Tm 3:8</a>), the Passover (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.28">Heb 11:28</a>), the exodus (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.16">3:16</a>), crossing of the sea (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.2">1 Cor 10:2</a>), the covenant sacrifice at Sinai (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>), the manna (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.3">1 Cor 10:3</a>), the glory on Moses’ face (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.7-18">2 Cor 3:7-18</a>), water from the rock (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.4">1 Cor 10:4</a>), the bronze serpent (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>), and the song of Moses (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.3">Rv 15:3</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">MOSES, Song of</p>
<p class="fl">One of two archaic poems: the Blessing of Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.1-29">Dt 33</a>) and the Song of Moses (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.32.1-52">32</a>). The Song of the Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>) is set at a much earlier period of Moses’ life, while these two poems are virtually his “last will and testament.”</p>
<p>Moses had already written books of the Law as a witness against Israel, should they turn away from God. But the law itself required at least two witnesses to establish any charge (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.6">Dt 17:6</a>). Moses was then commanded to write down the song as a further witness against Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.19">31:19</a>).</p>
<p>The song is therefore a witness to the greatness and goodness of God, and in particular, his goodness to Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.10-14">Dt 32:10-14</a>). This grace underlines all the more the sinfulness of Israel’s response, which can only call forth the anger of God and consequent punishment. God will use “natural disasters,” wild beasts, and wars to carry out his purposes. Yet even this is not the end. God, in his grace, will turn his hand against Israel’s enemies instead, and rescue his own people (v <a href="?bref=Deut.32.36">36</a>).</p>
<p>This song carries the consistent message of every great prophet of the OT, a message that <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">Psalm 78</a> expresses in terms of Israel’s historical situations. The song outlines the very nature of God, so it is not strange that the song of heaven is “the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb” (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.3">Rv 15:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MOSES’ SEAT*</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical expression occurring only in <a href="?bref=Matt.23.2">Matthew 23:2</a>, where Jesus speaks of the scribes and the Pharisees as having sat down on the seat of Moses. In biblical times, the seat that one occupied usually indicated the degree of rank or respect one claimed for himself or was to receive from others (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.6">Mt 23:6</a>). Sitting on “Moses’ seat” referred to a place of dignity and the right to interpret the Mosaic law. The scribes were the successors and the heirs of Moses’ authority and were rightfully looked to for pronouncements upon his teaching.</p>
<p>In the context of <a href="?bref=Matt.23.2">Matthew 23:2</a>, Jesus does not seem to challenge this right, for he commands his hearers to practice and observe whatever the scribes and the Pharisees speak, that is, all they teach that is in accordance with the law. But Jesus warned the people against doing their works, because they did not practice what they spoke. On other occasions Jesus condemned their unbiblical traditions relative to the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.3-6">Mt 15:3-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.4,16-22">23:4, 16-22</a>).</p>

  <title>Mount, Mountain</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MOUNT, MOUNTAIN</p>
<p class="fl">Elevated topographical feature. In Israel, as in surrounding countries, mountains were places where people expected to meet God. Many significant events in Israel’s religion took place on Mt Sinai or Horeb (see <a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4">Ex 3:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.16.1-36">16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-23.33">19–23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.8-18">1 Kgs 19:8-18</a>), and Mt Zion became almost as important when David was king (<a href="?bref=Ps.50.2">Ps 50:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">Is 2:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>Whereas the Hebrews’ neighbors sometimes thought mountains were magical places where their gods actually lived, the Israelites knew that their God lived in heaven and only descended upon the mountain at significant times (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-25">Ex 19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.27">1 Kgs 8:27</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT much of Jesus’ activity takes place on mountains. He preached there (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1">Mt 5:1</a>); he retired there to pray (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.12">Lk 6:12</a>); and he was transfigured on a mountain (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-36">9:28-36</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">MOURNING</p>
<p class="fl">Established ritual for grieving, observed by a dead person’s relatives and friends. It began with the closing of the eyes of the dead (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.4">Gn 46:4</a>), the embracing of the body (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.1">50:1</a>), and its preparation for burial. The hot climate necessitated that burial take place immediately (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.1-10">Acts 5:1-10</a>). But detailed information about burial earlier than NT times (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.59">Mt 27:59</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.44">Jn 11:44</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.39-40">19:39-40</a>) is extremely meager. Excavations suggest that the dead were buried fully clothed but not in coffins. The Israelites practiced neither embalming nor cremation, but decent burial was essential.</p>
<p>At the news of a death, it was customary to tear one’s garments (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.34">Gn 37:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.11">2 Sm 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.1.20">Jb 1:20</a>), put on sackcloth (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.31">2 Sm 3:31</a>), and take off one’s shoes (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.30">2 Sm 15:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.1.8">Mi 1:8</a>) and headdress; a man might cover his beard or veil his face (<a href="?bref=Ezek.24.17,23">Ez 24:17, 23</a>). Mourners put earth on their heads (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.6">Jos 7:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.4.12">1 Sm 4:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.1">Neh 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.2.12">Jb 2:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.30">Ez 27:30</a>) or rolled themselves in the dust (<a href="?bref=Job.16.15">Jb 16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.1.10">Mi 1:10</a>) or sat on a heap of ashes (<a href="?bref=Esth.4.3">Est 4:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.5">Is 58:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.26">Jer 6:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.30">Ez 27:30</a>). Such mourning rites as shaving the hair and the beard and making cuts on the body (<a href="?bref=Job.1.20">Jb 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.22.12">Is 22:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.6">Jer 16:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.41.5">41:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.47.5">47:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.37">48:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.7.18">Ez 7:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.10">Am 8:10</a>) were condemned (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.27-28">Lv 19:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.1">Dt 14:1</a>) because of pagan associations. Mourners refrained from washing and discontinued the use of perfumes (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.20">2 Sm 12:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.14.2">14:2</a>).</p>
<p>Fasting was also a mourning rite (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.13">1 Sm 31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.12">2 Sm 1:12</a>). Neighbors or friends brought mourning bread and the “cup of consolation” to the relatives of the deceased (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.7">Jer 16:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.24.17,22">Ez 24:17, 22</a>). Food could not be prepared at the house of the dead because death rendered a place unclean. The dead were unclean to the extent that a priest could “profane” himself by taking part in mourning rites, except for his nearest blood relatives (mother, father, son, daughter, brother, and sister, provided she was still a virgin; <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1-4,10-11">Lv 21:1-4, 10-11</a>). These mourning rites were not acts of worship directed toward the dead, nor did they constitute a cult for the dead, but rather they were expressions of grief and affection.</p>
<p>At the graveside, lamentation for the dead was made (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.30">1 Kgs 13:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.26">Jer 6:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.16">Am 5:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.10">8:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.10">Zec 12:10</a>) by men and women in separate groups (<a href="?bref=Zech.12.11-14">Zec 12:11-14</a>). These exclamations of sorrow might develop into a rhythmic lament (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.17-27">2 Sm 1:17-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.8.10">Am 8:10</a>). However, professional mourners, men and especially women (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.17-19">Jer 9:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.16">Am 5:16</a>), were employed. The book of Lamentations is a fine example of laments and is a reminder that among Jews mourning was not always associated with death. It expressed brokenness of spirit for sin, individual and national. National calamity also evoked great lamentation.</p>
<p>These mourning rites were expressive of great grief. But some of them—tearing clothes, wearing sackcloth, disfiguring oneself with dust and ashes, self-mutilation—point to paroxysms of grief, the religious significance of which now escapes us. This was far removed from mourning as an inner feeling or a mood of the mind. It was not just an involuntary outburst of feeling but rather a deliberate, established ritual. When death occurred, the Israelite wept because it was customary and seemly. The erection of monuments or memorials was not unknown (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.18">2 Sm 18:18</a>), but the average Israelite was too poor for this to be a common practice.</p>
<p>Mourning practices in NT times differed little from those described in the OT. Mourning was associated with Christ’s second advent (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.30">Mt 24:30</a>), with repentance (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.8-10">Jas 4:8-10</a>), with Christ’s leaving the 12 (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.15">Mt 9:15</a>), with deep spirituality (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.4">5:4</a>), as well as with death (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.38-39">Mk 5:38-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.13">Lk 7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.33">Jn 11:33</a>).</p>
<p>True, the overthrow of death by Jesus Christ robbed death of its sting and the grave of its victory (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.54-57">1 Cor 15:54-57</a>), but the Christian still mourns, though not as those who have no hope (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.13">1 Thes 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.4">Rv 21:4</a>).</p>

  <title>Music</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MUSIC</p>
<p class="fl">A natural human expression that probably began with speech-singing and developed into songs, which were then accompanied by instruments. Music as we know it has become quite complex, a luxury and entertainment; music in antiquity, however, was a functional expression of daily life, work, and worship.</p>
<p>The phrase “sing to the Lord,” common to the OT (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.21">Ex 15:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.9">1 Chr 16:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.32">Pss 68:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.96.1-2">96:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.10">Is 42:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.13">Jer 20:13</a>), was not unique to the Jewish nation. All religions draw on the natural human impulse to sing. The injunction “sing to the Lord” was a signal for the people to pour out their praise in song.</p>
<p>The Bible, however, is limited in its treatment of music in ancient Israel. Since there was no written musical notation, the primary record of songs sung by the Hebrews is the collection of texts, particularly the psalms, and a few enigmatic musical instructions. The biblical writers were writing a history not of their culture but of their relationship with God; hence, their comments about music are not critical. Also, the biblical documents cover a long span of history and are grouped according to category rather than in chronological order, thus making it difficult to order the development of musical style with precision. Finally, there is the problem of understanding the biblical descriptions of music and its performance. Only in this century have scholars been able to interpret the information provided in the Bible in terms of Eastern music systems.</p>

<p class="h2" id="MusicintheOldTestament">Music in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The first musician mentioned in the Bible is “Jubal, the first musician—the inventor of the harp and flute” (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.21">Gn 4:21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The importance of this description of a musician so early in history lies in the equality Jubal is given with his brothers Jabal, the herdsman, and Tubal-cain, the smith. Music making is recognized among the earliest professions of nomadic peoples. The name Jubal is believed to be a derivative from the Hebrew word for “ram.” The ram’s horn <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">shophar</span><span class="ital">)</span> was an early instrument of the Jewish people and was significant in signaling important events.</p>
<p>For the most part, the music described in early biblical history was of a functional nature. Music gained special significance as it became an important part of temple worship. Many of the descriptions of music making in ancient Israel, before David’s time, are quite utilitarian. There are accounts of music at times of farewell (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.27">Gn 31:27</a>), at times of rejoicing and feasting (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.17-18">Ex 32:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.5.12">Is 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.24.8-9">24:8-9</a>), at military victories (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.27-28">2 Chr 20:27-28</a>), and for work (<a href="?bref=Num.21.17">Nm 21:17</a>, the song of the well diggers; <a href="?bref=Isa.16.10">Is 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.48.33">Jer 48:33</a>). Most of this music was probably rather crude and primitive in nature, especially the music associated with military advances, which was meant to terrify the enemy (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.17-20">Jgs 7:17-20</a>). The music and dancing that greeted Moses as he descended from the mountain was described as if it sounded like “war in the camp” (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.17-18">Ex 32:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>In the early history of the Jewish people, women played an important part in the performance of music. The image of women dancing and singing for joy accompanied by percussion instruments is repeated several times: Miriam led the women in a hymn of thanksgiving after the deliverance from the Red Sea (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.1-27">Ex 15</a>); Jephthah’s daughter welcomed her father in his victory (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.34">Jgs 11:34</a>); Deborah joined with Barak in singing a song of victory (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Jgs 5</a>); and women hailed David after his defeat of the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.6-7">1 Sm 18:6-7</a>). There is little mention of women as musicians following the establishment of the temple in Jerusalem, but there are a few allusions to the fact that women did participate in singing and dancing. The account of the return from exile in Babylon includes both male and female singers (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.67">Neh 7:67</a>), confirming that women still took part in musical performance.</p>
<p>As Jerusalem became the religious center of the Hebrew people (950–850 <span class="era">BC</span>), the role of the professional musician became more important. The women’s songs became insignificant compared to the pomp and ceremony associated with the temple and the royal court. While the Levitical singers took most of the musical responsibility at the temple, the development of antiphonal singing allowed the people to join in on responses in the singing of psalms.</p>
<p class="h3">Musical Style and Use</p>
<p class="fl">The Jewish people seem to have been especially musical. Of course, they were influenced by other ancient cultures, but there is evidence that they were in demand as musicians by other peoples. According to an Assyrian document, King Hezekiah gave as tribute to King Sennacherib many male and female Jewish musicians. The Babylonians demanded that the captive Jews sing to them and entertain them (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.137.3">Ps 137:3</a>).</p>
<p>Since the OT’s purpose was to narrate the relationship between the Jewish nation and God, most of the references to music deal with its function in worship. However, evidence reveals that there was also a large body of secular musical literature. There may have been guilds of poets and singers early in Jewish history. The kinds of songs recorded in the early part of the OT represent a folklike poetry. The song of thanksgiving to the Lord by Moses and the people of Israel after their escape at the Red Sea is a stirring national song. Many descriptions of the biblical writers reflect the spirit of bardic song. This would be logical, as these stories were meant to be passed on. Marching songs (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.27-28">2 Chr 20:27-28</a>), and songs of triumph (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Jgs 5</a>) also indicate a secular body of music.</p>
<p class="h3">Music in Worship</p>
<p class="fl">The singers and musicians for the temple worship were chosen from the tribe of Levi. King David assembled the Levites for a census, and out of the total of 38,000 men over the age of 30, 4,000 were chosen as musicians. These 4,000 were subsequently given specific jobs. “David and the chiefs of the service also set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with lyres, with harps, and with cymbals. . . . The number of them along with their brethren, who were trained in singing to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, all who were skilful, was two hundred and eighty-eight” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.25.1,7">1 Chr 25:1, 7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The singers were further divided into 24 groups of 12 singers, who rotated in participating in the weekday, Sabbath, and high holy day services.</p>
<p>According to a later source, there were minimum and maximum numbers of singers and instrumentalists required at each service. The minimum number of singers was twelve, the maximum was unlimited. There had to be in attendance at least two harps but no more than six, at least two flutes but no more than twelve, a minimum of two trumpets with no maximum, and a minimum of nine lyres with no maximum. There was only one player with a pair of cymbals.</p>
<p>A singer was admitted to the Levitical choir at the age of thirty following a five-year apprenticeship (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.3">1 Chr 23:3</a>). Five years is a relatively short time considering the amount of material these singers had to memorize (for there was no notation) and the liturgical ritual they had to master; it is speculated that they actually were in training from childhood. The Levites lived in villages outside the city wall and may have been actively involved in the musical education of their children (<a href="?bref=Neh.12.29">Neh 12:29</a>). The Levites performed other duties connected with the sacred service, but the singers were excused from all other duties because they were on duty day and night (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.33">1 Chr 9:33</a>). Their skills were an important part of the temple worship, and they were able to devote their entire life to the development of their musical ability. A singer served in the choir for 20 years, from age 30 to 50, and the music was of a high quality due to strict discipline and continuous practice and performance.</p>
<p>From the beginning of Jewish formal worship connected with the tabernacle, music and sound was important. In <a href="?bref=Exod.28.34-35">Exodus 28:34-35</a> the descriptions of Aaron’s robe include bells attached to the lower hem that sounded as he entered the Holy Place. The first liturgical music mentioned in the OT is found in <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-23">2 Samuel 6</a> in the descriptions of the transfer of the ark: David and the Israelites sang, played instruments, and danced to the glory of the Lord. This music bore little resemblance to the stately ceremony described later in Solomon’s temple. In <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.6">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>, David is given recognition for inventing the musical instruments used in the temple. In the postexilic era Levitical singers are mentioned as the descendants of Asaph, the “singing master” appointed by David (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.41">Ezr 2:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.44">Neh 7:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.22-23">11:22-23</a>). From passages such as these, we have a definite indication that liturgical music and organization stemmed from David’s time.</p>
<p>The ceremonies in the Jewish temple were organized around the sacrifice. Singing formed an integral part of the sacrificial service and was necessary to validate the sacrificial action. There were special musical settings for each sacrifice; thus the daily burnt, expiatory, and laudatory offerings and libations had individual liturgies. Particular psalms became associated with certain sacrifices as well as with certain days of the week. The psalm of the day was intoned as the high priest started to pour out the drink offering. The psalm was divided into three sections, each signaled by the blowing of the trumpets, on which signal the people would prostrate themselves. This is the only time the trumpets were used together with the other instruments in orchestral fashion on solemn occasions (<a href="?bref=2Chr.5.12-13">2 Chr 5:12-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="MusicinthePsalms">Music in the Psalms</p>
<p class="h3">Musical Psalm Titles</p>
<p class="fl">The collection of 150 lyric poems known as the book of Psalms contains the most information on music making in ancient Israel. The Psalter contains not only religious songs but also songs that have their roots in secular or popular songs, such as work songs, love songs, and wedding songs. The majority are songs of praise, thanksgiving, prayer, and repentance. There are also historic odes that relate great national events—for example, <a href="?bref=Ps.30.1-12">Psalm 30</a>, “a song at the dedication of the temple,” and <a href="?bref=Ps.137.1-9">Psalm 137</a>, which portrays the sufferings of the Jews in captivity.</p>
<p>The psalms were an important part of all the services of the temple; the Psalter became the liturgical hymnal of the Israelites. Worship included an appointed psalm for each day of the week. On the first day of the week, <a href="?bref=Ps.24.1-10">Psalm 24</a> was sung in remembrance of the first day of creation, <a href="?bref=Ps.48.1-14">Psalm 48</a> was sung on the second day, <a href="?bref=Ps.82.1-8">Psalm 82</a> on the third, <a href="?bref=Ps.94.1-23">Psalm 94</a> on the fourth, <a href="?bref=Ps.81.1-16">Psalm 81</a> on the fifth, <a href="?bref=Ps.93.1-5">Psalm 93</a> on the sixth, and <a href="?bref=Ps.92.1-15">Psalm 92</a> on the Sabbath. After the sacrificial offerings, <a href="?bref=Ps.105.1-5">Psalm 105:1-5</a> was sung at the morning service and <a href="?bref=Ps.96.1-13">Psalm 96</a> at the evening service. The Hallel psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.113.1-118.29">Pss 113–118</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.120.1-136.26">120–136</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.146.1-148.14">146–148</a>) were sung during the offering of the paschal lamb at the Passover feast.</p>
<p>While most of the liturgical music was performed by Levites, texts of the psalms suggest that there was also congregational participation. The forms of music found both in synagogal and ecclesiastical chant had their source in the forms of the poetic text of the psalms. The simplest is the plain psalmody sung by one person (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.3.1-5.12">Pss 3–5</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.46.1-11">46</a>). In responsorial psalmody the soloist is answered by the choir (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.67.1-2">Ps 67:1-2</a>; the soloist sang verse <a href="?bref=Ps.67.1">1</a> and the choir answered with verse <a href="?bref=Ps.67.2">2</a>). Antiphonal psalmody involves two groups singing alternately (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.103.20-22">Ps 103:20-22</a>). The congregation would chant a refrain such as appears in <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1-19">Psalm 80</a>: “Restore us, O God; let thy face shine, that we may be saved!” recurs throughout the psalm (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Even though the synagogue had no altar for sacrifice, psalm singing retained an important place. After the Romans destroyed the temple, the worship heritage of the Jews could have been lost if the customs, including musical customs, had not become an integral part of synagogue worship.</p>
<p>The most enigmatic part of the psalms is the headings that are not part of the poetic text. The first question is whether these should even be considered as superscripts. Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and other ancient languages were written in such a way that the text ran together without any break between chapters or paragraphs. This means that the verses, and even the division of the psalms themselves, were partially determined by copyists, chiefly the Masoretes. There is some question as to which psalms the extrapoetic texts actually belong with; they may actually be subscripts instead of superscripts. Sumerian and Babylonian poetry had information such as the name of the author, the musical instrument used for accompaniment, the tune, the purpose, and such listed at the end of the poem. Hence, some of the headings may actually be endings.</p>
<p>The indications at the beginning of a psalm fall into three categories. They are either musical terms giving direction for the actual performance, musical cues designating the tune to which the psalm would be sung, or comments indicating the function of the psalm. These terms have been interpreted in various ways.</p>
<p>Originally, these headings may have been marginal notes for the choir leaders. Realizing that these terms were not related to the psalm text proper, early biblical scribes may not have been overly careful with their placement in the text, which may explain some of the discrepancies among the early manuscripts—why certain words are left out in some and why terms assigned to only a few psalms may originally have been indicated on more of them.</p>
<p>All but 50 of the psalms contain a proper name in the heading. These names possibly indicate the author; other commentators, interpreting the preposition appearing before the names to mean “for,” think the names are a dedication. Thus the title would be “A Psalm for David,” not “A Psalm of David.” This may be the case with the names of Asaph, Heman, Ethan, and especially the sons of Korah, where it would make better sense for the psalm to be written for rather than by the family. Seventy-three psalms have David’s name in the heading, hence the common reference to the Psalter as the Psalms of David. Twelve include the name of Asaph, eleven the children of Korah, two Solomon, and one each contains Moses, Heman, and Ethan.</p>
<p class="h3">Musical Terms in the Psalm Titles</p>
<p class="fl">Numerous musical terms are included in the superscriptions to cue the kind of instrumental accompaniment, mood, and style of performance for the psalm.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Alamoth</span> is one of the most controversial terms found in the psalm headings. It appears at the beginning of <a href="?bref=Ps.46.1-11">Psalm 46</a> and also in <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.20">1 Chronicles 15:20</a>. One meaning for the Hebrew word is “maiden,” and musicologists interpret this as an instruction that the psalm should be sung in the range of the female singing voice. The reference in Chronicles is to harps in the range of women’s voices. This interpretation does not seem to fit <a href="?bref=Ps.46.1-11">Psalm 46</a>, but if we look at the preceding psalm and read the term as a subscript, it becomes logical. <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalm 45</a> is a song of love, actually a nuptial ode; it would be natural for women to sing the second half (vv <a href="?bref=Ps.45.10-17">10-17</a>). While there is little mention of women singing in the temple, there is speculation that young boys in training may have sung along with the Levitical singers. Also this may be a case where the term appears only once in the modern text but may have been used more often in the original. Another possible meaning for <span class="hebrew">Alamoth</span> is “flutes,” perhaps describing the kind of musical accompaniment for the performance of the psalm.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Gittith</span> is a term found in the superscriptions of <a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Psalms 8</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.81.1-16">81</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.84.1-12">84</a>. It may be a musical cue, indicating a mood for the performance of these psalms, but a more common explanation is that it is a collective term for the stringed instruments that would have accompanied them.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Mahalath</span> has been left in its original Hebrew form by early translators and is found in the headings of <a href="?bref=Ps.53.1-6">Psalms 53</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.88.1-18">88</a>. It may have roots in the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">mahaleh</span> “sickness” or <span class="hebrew">mahot</span> “dance,” though neither of these words can be related to the psalm texts. Another explanation is a musical one. <span class="hebrew">Mahalath</span> may come from the word <span class="hebrew">halal</span> meaning “to pierce,” implying that the psalm was to be accompanied with pipes.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Maskil</span> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Maschil”) appears in the headings of 13 psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">Pss 32</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.42.1-11">42</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-45.17">44–45</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.52.1-55.23">52–55</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.74.1-23">74</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.78.1-72">78</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.88.1-89.52">88–89</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.142.1-7">142</a>). The term is probably derived from the verb <span class="hebrew">sakal</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to have insight or comprehension,” but there is no agreement among commentators. By looking at the psalms themselves, their didactic nature and the structure of stanzas and refrains, musicologists conclude the term represents a song of praise, possibly sung by a soloist with participation by the choir.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Menazzeah</span> appears in the heading of 55 psalms. It appears 52 times in the first three books of Psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.1-89.52">Pss 1–89</a>), not at all in book four (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-106.48">Pss 90–106</a>), and 3 times in book five (<a href="?bref=Ps.107.1-150.6">Pss 107–150</a>). The most common modern translations are “to the Choirmaster” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), “to the choir director” (<span class="sc">nasb</span>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), “to the director of music” (<span class="sc">niv</span>), “to the chief Musician” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>, <span class="sc">nkjv</span>). The word is derived from the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">nazzah</span><span class="ital">,</span> appearing in <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.4">1 Chronicles 23:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Ezra.3.8-9">Ezra 3:8-9</a> in the sense of “administering.” In <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.21">1 Chronicles 15:21</a> the word is found in relation to leading or directing song in the temple. <span class="hebrew">Menazzeah</span> relates to the choirmaster and represents the singer chosen to lead the music who probably was involved in rehearsing and instructing. It is now assumed that <span class="hebrew">menazzeah</span> indicates the psalm was to be sung partially or entirely by a soloist. This is evidenced by the change in some texts from “I” where the soloist sang, to “we” where the choir or congregation sang. <a href="?bref=Ps.5.1-12">Psalm 5</a> is an example of a text divided for solo and choral singing: verses 1-3 solo; verses 4-6 choral; verses 7-8 solo; verses 9-10 choral; and verses 11-12 end the psalm with the combined soloist and choir.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Miktam</span> (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Michtam”) is another term that has no clear musical meaning, due mainly to the fact that its etymology is unknown. It occurs in <a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">Psalms 16</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.56.1-60.12">56–60</a>, all of which have a character of lamentation or supplication. In a musical sense, it probably meant that a certain well-known tune was to be selected as the melody of the psalm.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Mizmor</span> (Hebrew, meaning a song sung to instrumental accompaniment) is found nowhere else in the Bible; it is included in the superscriptions of 57 psalms. It probably indicated a song accompanied by melodic instruments as opposed to a dance song accompanied by rhythmic instruments.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Neginah</span> appears in the superscriptions of <a href="?bref=Ps.4.1-8">Psalms 4</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.6.1-10">6</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.54.1-55.23">54–55</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.61.1-8">61</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.67.1-7">67</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.76.1-12">76</a>. The term <span class="hebrew">neginah</span> and its plural <span class="hebrew">neginoth</span> are found in <a href="?bref=Ps.77.7">Psalm 77:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Lam.5.14">Lamentations 5:14</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.38.20">Isaiah 38:20</a>, and <a href="?bref=Hab.3.19">Habakkuk 3:19</a>. <span class="hebrew">Neginah</span><span class="ital">,</span> from the Hebrew root <span class="hebrew">naggen</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to touch the strings,” instructs that stringed instruments accompany the singing.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Nehiloth</span> is found only in the introduction to <a href="?bref=Ps.5.1-12">Psalm 5</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). The origin of the word is problematic. It could come from the verb <span class="hebrew">nahal</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to possess or inherit,” or more feasibly from <span class="hebrew">halal</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “to pierce.” The latter implies the idea of a pierced instrument (the flute or pipe) to be used for accompaniment.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Sheminith</span> appears in <a href="?bref=Ps.6.1-10">Psalms 6</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.12.1-8">12</a> and also in <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.21">1 Chronicles 15:21</a>. The Hebrew word means literally “over the eighth.” Some scholars feel it had something to do with an octave, but the Hebrew musical language probably did not include a musical unit divided into eight parts. Other scholars interpret <span class="hebrew">sheminith</span> as meaning an eight-stringed instrument. A more logical interpretation comes from examining its use in 1 Chronicles. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.20">15:20</a> the instructions are for musicians to play the harps according to <span class="hebrew">alamoth</span> and in verse <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.21">21</a> to play the lyres according to <span class="hebrew">sheminith</span><span class="ital">.</span> Here the terms <span class="hebrew">alamoth</span> and <span class="hebrew">sheminith</span> seem to be used in opposition. If <span class="hebrew">alamoth</span> implies a register of the female voice, then <span class="hebrew">sheminith</span> would imply a lower register. Thus, it may have been an instruction to use a lower pitched instrument for accompaniment.</p>
<p class="h3">Psalm Varieties in the Titles</p>
<p class="fl">Some of the notes in the psalm headings are indications of the type or variety of psalm.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Hazkir</span> is found in the headings of <a href="?bref=Ps.38.1-22">Psalms 38</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.70.1-5">70</a>. According to the Targum, this is an indication that the psalm was sung at the sacrificial rite called <span class="hebrew">askara</span> and is translated “for a memorial offering.”</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Lammed</span> appears in the superscription of <a href="?bref=Ps.60.1-12">Psalm 60</a> in the phrase <span class="hebrew">le-lammed</span><span class="ital">,</span> translated “to teach.” According to tradition, this was a psalm, though undoubtedly not the only one, taught to young people as part of their education. This is another example of a term that may have been omitted from other psalms in later versions of the Psalter.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shiggaion</span> is in the heading of <a href="?bref=Ps.7.1-17">Psalm 7</a> and also in <a href="?bref=Hab.3.1">Habakkuk 3:1</a>. The word probably comes from the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">shagah</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to wander,” but may also be connected with the Assyrian liturgical term <span class="hebrew">shigu</span><span class="ital">,</span> which represented a plaintive song in several stanzas. Biblical scholars have assumed <span class="hebrew">shiggaion</span><span class="ital">,</span> plural <span class="hebrew">shigionoth</span><span class="ital">,</span> was a lament or penitential song.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shir</span> is the simplest word for “song” and was probably used in the headings at an early stage of the Psalter; it is usually found with <span class="hebrew">mizmor</span> (13 times). Fifteen psalms have this heading. It was probably the term for a specific type of praise song, usually performed by the choir.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shir Hamaalot</span> and <span class="hebrew">Shir Lamaalot</span> occur in the headings of <a href="?bref=Ps.120.1-134.3">Psalms 120–134</a>, which are often referred to as the Psalms of Ascent (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Psalms of Degrees”). Most explanations offered relate to the fact that the temple was situated on high ground. Often these 15 psalms are associated with the 15 steps leading from the Court of the Women to the Court of the Israelites. But most contemporary scholars believe the idea of “going up” referred to the pilgrims’ journey to Jerusalem to worship at the temple. These psalms are short, with popular appeal, making them appropriate for singing during the journey.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shir Hanukkat Habayit</span> is found only in the heading of <a href="?bref=Ps.30.1-12">Psalm 30</a>. This phrase tells that the psalm was to be used for the dedication or rededication of the house of God.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shir-yedidot</span> appears only in <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalm 45</a>. It refers to a love song that was probably sung at wedding ceremonies.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Tefillah</span> is a common term for “prayer” and appears in the headings of <a href="?bref=Ps.17.1-15">Psalms 17</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.86.1-17">86</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-17">90</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.102.1-28">102</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ps.142.1-7">142</a>, and also in <a href="?bref=Hab.3.1">Habakkuk 3:1</a>. The word probably refers to a specific form of poetic prayer.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Selah</span> is one of the most frequently used, but most enigmatic, terms found in the book of Psalms. It occurs in 39 psalms, appearing a total of 71 times in the Psalter—67 times within the text and 4 times at the end of a psalm. It is most frequent in the first three books. In the first book <span class="hebrew">selah</span> appears in 9 psalms; in the second book, 17 psalms; in the third book, 11 psalms. In the fourth book it is not found at all and in the fifth book in only two psalms. Thirty-one of these psalms also include the term <span class="hebrew">menazzeah</span> in their superscriptions, which implies that they were sung by a soloist and choir. Most commonly, <span class="hebrew">selah</span> is interpreted as a signal for a break in the singing and possibly for an instrumental interlude. It never appears at the beginning of a psalm but only in the middle of the text or at the end. The regularity of its appearance within a psalm is not consistent, and in only a few instances do these divisions break the psalm into equal sections. Because of the random placement of the term, some scholars believe that, like the headings, <span class="hebrew">selah</span> was not always carefully copied into the text. It may have been a note appearing only in the texts of the musicians, which would explain this inconsistency. An explanation of <span class="hebrew">selah</span> is found in the Talmudic tradition: “Ben Azra clashed the cymbal and the Levites broke forth into singing. When they reached a break in the singing they blew upon the trumpets and the people prostrated themselves; at every break there was a blowing of the trumpet and at every blowing of the trumpet a prostration. This was the rite of the daily whole offering in the service of the House of our God.” <span class="hebrew">Selah</span><span class="ital">,</span> then, would be an instruction for the musicians that the singing was to cease and the instrumentalists were to play.</p>
<p>The term <span class="hebrew">higgaion selah</span> appears once, in <a href="?bref=Ps.9.16">Psalm 9:16</a>. The word <span class="hebrew">higgaiaon</span> comes from the root <span class="hebrew">hagah</span><span class="ital">,</span> “to murmur, to growl, to produce a low sound.” This may have been an instruction for the interlude to be more subdued than a normal <span class="hebrew">selah</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p class="h3">Ancient Melodies in the Titles</p>
<p class="fl">Many psalms contain headings that are not direct musical references but are cue words to suggest well-known tunes. They probably refer either to names or the first words of popular secular songs <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">makams</span><span class="ital">)</span> whose melodic patterns were used in singing the psalm. Many biblical scholars have tried to find hidden meaning in these headings, but most musicologists believe these are simply references or introductions to melodies.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Aijeleth Shahar</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Psalm 22</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), is translated “according to The Hind of the Dawn” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), and “To the tune of ‘The Doe of the Morning’ ” (<span class="sc">niv</span>), “To the tune ‘Doe of the Dawn’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Al-taschith</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.57.1-59.17">Psalms 57–59</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.75.1-10">75</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), is translated “To the tune ‘Do Not Destroy!’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Jonath-elem-rechokim</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.56.1-13">Psalm 56</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), is translated “according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), and “To the tune ‘Dove on Distant Oaks’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Mahalath Leannoth</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.88.1-18">Psalm 88</a>, is translated “To the tune ‘The Suffering of Affliction’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Muthlabben</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.9.1-20">Psalm 9</a>, is translated “To the tune ‘Death of the Son’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shoshannim</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.45.1-17">Psalms 45</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-36">69</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), is translated “To the tune ‘Lilies’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shoshannim-Eduth</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1-19">Psalm 80</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), is translated “To the tune ‘Lilies of the Covenant’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shushan-eduth</span><span class="ital">,</span> in <a href="?bref=Ps.60.1-12">Psalm 60</a>, is translated “To the tune ‘Lily of the Testimony’ ” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>These melody types appear only in the first three books of the Psalter, and this may imply that these popular <span class="hebrew">makams</span> had fallen into disuse by the time the final books of the Psalter were written. Other <span class="hebrew">makam</span>-types had probably become popular, and the authors, realizing the relatively short life of a popular tune, did not include them in the headings of the Psalms but left the choice up to the performer.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MusicintheNewTestament">Music in the New Testament</p>
<p class="h3">First-Century Influences</p>
<p class="h4">The Synagogue</p>
<p class="fl">By the time of Christ, the synagogue had become the chief place of worship for the Jewish people. It began as a place for study of the law but gradually became the center of worship for Jews unable to attend the temple. The liturgical service of the temple could not be duplicated in the synagogue as there was no sacrificial rite, and the music could not be exactly reproduced as there were no trained Levitical singers. Scholars do not agree about the amount of continuity between the music of the temple and the music of the synagogue, but there is evidence that certain musical practices did remain constant between the two places of worship.</p>
<p>Information on the customs and rituals of the synagogue come from Talmudic writings. The musical elements of worship in the synagogue were the chanting of Scripture, psalmody, and spiritual songs. The choral singing of the temple was replaced by a single cantor. The cantor was a layman who, according to tradition, had to have the following qualifications: “He had to be well educated, gifted with a sweet voice, of humble personality, recognized by the community, conversant with Scripture and all the prayers; he must not be a rich man, for his prayers should come from his heart.” His most important job was the cantillation of the Law and the Prophets. A series of accents and punctuations, forerunners of actual musical notation, were indications for the cantor in the musical interpretation of the Scripture.</p>
<p>Psalm singing was gradually transplanted from the temple to the synagogue, which in turn influenced the early Christian church. Gregorian psalm tones have their roots in Hebrew psalmody.</p>
<p class="h4">Greek and Roman Cultures</p>
<p class="fl">While both the temple and the synagogue were familiar to the early Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.46-47">Acts 2:46-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.1">3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.42">5:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.20">9:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">18:4</a>; etc.), the Greek and Roman cultures also played a major part in shaping the young church. Hellenistic influences by the time of Christ had long been felt in the Middle East, and while it was strongly opposed by some Jewish leaders, the Greek arts had permeated Jewish culture. Greek philosophers considered music a cathartic force that could lead humans into metaphysical knowledge. This understanding led to the belief that music had a moral substance that could influence people to either good or evil. If this philosophy had totally encompassed Judeo-Christian thought, certainly Paul would have encouraged the use of music in the spread of the gospel. However, Paul’s omission of this theory implies that the Judeo-Christian world at that time had rejected the Greek ideal, at least in part.</p>
<p>While the Jewish rabbis considered music an art form for the praise of God, and while the Greek philosophers thought of it as a powerful moral force in creation, the Romans considered music mainly as entertainment. The music of the Roman games was neither religious nor philosophic and, from the accounts of witnesses, it was not technically exceptional. In the Roman Empire musicians were given a lower status and looked on as mere entertainers. One reason the early church did not include instrumental music in their worship was in reaction to the debased secular use of instruments by the Romans.</p>
<p class="h3">In the New Testament Writings</p>
<p class="fl">One of the few mentions of instruments in the NT is the use of flutes at a wake (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.23">Mt 9:23</a>). As in the OT, music is associated with feasting and merrymaking (e.g., the return of the prodigal son, <a href="?bref=Luke.15.25">Lk 15:25</a>). Five passages mention music metaphorically (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.2">Mt 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.17">11:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.32">Lk 7:32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1">1 Cor 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.7-8">14:7-8</a>). The most well known of these is Paul’s celebration of love in <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">1 Corinthians 13</a>. The denunciation of the gong and cymbals must be understood in light of the attitude of the early Christians toward the music of the Pharisees. Here the signal instruments of the temple were used to represent pompous display of religious pietism.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientChristianHymn"/>
<p>Most references to music are found in the eschatological visions and prophetic passages scattered throughout the NT—most frequently in the book of Revelation (also <a href="?bref=Matt.24.31">Mt 24:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.52">1 Cor 15:52</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.16">1 Thes 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.19">Heb 12:19</a>). Many of these descriptions have a direct association with musical references in the OT (e.g., the use of harps and trumpets and the singing of the Hallelujah). But the value of many of the passages in Revelation comes from their literary style. These doxological and psalmlike passages were probably spontaneous “spiritual songs” composed by the young church (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rev.5.9-10">Rv 5:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>The passages that mention religious or liturgical music are often more conceptual than literal. Two parallel passages describing the Last Supper (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.30">Mt 26:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.26">Mk 14:26</a>) mention that Christ and his disciples sang a hymn. This is the only direct account of Jesus singing, but it is probable that when he read in the synagogue he did so in the accepted vocal style (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-20">Lk 4:16-20</a>). There is much controversy surrounding the actual events at the Last Supper, but we can assume that the hymn sung was a traditional Jewish hymn, probably associated with the Passover.</p>
<p>From the account in <a href="?bref=Acts.16.25">Acts 16:25</a> we know that Paul and Silas sang hymns while in jail. Paul gives instruction for music making in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.15,26">1 Corinthians 14:15, 26</a> in terms of a balance between rationalism and emotion. And, as with all the gifts of the Spirit, Paul asks that singing be done for edification.</p>
<p>In two similar passages (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.19">Eph 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.16">Col 3:16</a>) Paul groups together three musical terms—psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. The singing of psalms was an obvious carryover from the synagogue, and we can assume that the early Christian psalm singing followed the Jewish style. The term for “hymns” probably refers to poetic texts, possibly modeled after the psalms, but in praise of Christ. “Spiritual songs” may refer to a spontaneous, ecstatic form of musical prayer, possibly wordless (perhaps related to glossolalia), in a style that was popular in mystical Judaism. These outbursts of song were probably melismatic (sung on one tone) and are perhaps the forerunners of the later Alleluia chant.</p>
<p class="h3">Hymnody in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">It can be assumed that the early Christians composed hymns in praise of Christ. Logically, most of the hymns found in the NT are based on Hebrew poetic psalm forms, but there is Greek and Latin influence also. The hymns from the Gospel of Luke have become well-known canticles adopted by the church: the Magnificat (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55">Lk 1:46-55</a>), the Benedictus (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.68-79">1:68-79</a>), the Gloria (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.14">2:14</a>) and the Nunc Dimittis (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.29-32">2:29-32</a>). While patterned after the psalms of the OT, these hymns are full of confidence in the salvation of Christ and in his imminent return. Other Christological hymns found in the NT include the prologue to the Gospel of John, <a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-16">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Philippians 2:6-11</a>, <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, <a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Hebrews 1:3</a>, and <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18-22">1 Peter 3:18-22</a>.</p>

  <title>Musical Instruments</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</p>
<p class="fl">Stringed, wind, and percussion instruments used to make music.</p>
<p>In contrast to the detailed accounts of liturgical music in the OT, the descriptions of the musical instruments themselves are rather sparse. Because of the injunction of the second commandment, interpreted by the Hebrews as discouraging pictorial representations, there are few drawings of Hebrew instruments. In addition to the instruments used in the temple, the book of Daniel lists six instruments played in King Nebuchadnezzar’s court.</p>
<p>The ancient Hebrews made certain distinctions among the instruments, not on musical but on ethical grounds. Some instruments were considered “unclean” and were not allowed in temple worship.</p>
<p class="h2" id="StringedInstruments">Stringed Instruments</p>
<p class="fl">The stringed instruments were favored by the Jewish people. In many ancient civilizations the strings were considered the most masculine and noble (e.g., David playing the lyre); the Jews considered them the most suitable for accompaniment in the temple service. The term <span class="hebrew">minim</span> is used in <a href="?bref=Ps.150.4">Psalm 150:4</a> to designate the entire family of stringed instruments used in the praise of God.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Guitars"/>
<p><span class="hebrew">Asor</span> appears three times in the book of Psalms (<a href="?bref=Ps.33.2">Pss 33:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.92.3">92:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.9">144:9</a>). Although the word derives from a Hebrew root meaning “ten,” the actual description of the instrument remains unclear. The most common theory identifies it with the Phoenician zither having ten strings; it is perhaps the lute.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Kathros</span> was a stringed instrument included in the list of those played at Nebuchadnezzar’s court and was probably a kind of lyre (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.5,7,10,15">Dn 3:5, 7, 10, 15</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Kinnor</span> is the most frequently mentioned instrument in the Bible, found in 42 places. It is often called David’s harp and is the most beloved instrument of the Jewish people. We can say with reasonable certainty that it was a lyre and not a harp. The strings, the number of which is not clear, were made of sheep tripe and the sounding box was at the bottom of the instrument. It is not certain whether it was played with a plectrum or with bare hands, but the specific comment that David “played it with his hand” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.23">1 Sm 16:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) may have implied that this was not the common practice. The biblical descriptions of the sound of the <span class="hebrew">kinnor</span> include “pleasant” and “sweet” (<a href="?bref=Ps.81.2">Ps 81:2</a>). The <span class="hebrew">kinnor</span> was played mainly in worship but also in celebrations (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.12">Is 5:12</a>), for state occasions (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sm 6:5</a>), and by shepherds (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.16">1 Sm 16:16</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Strings"/>
<p><span class="hebrew">Nebel</span> was another stringed instrument (literally meaning “skin” or “skin bottle”) mentioned 27 times in Scripture. Its shape was probably similar to a bottle, with the belly-shaped sounding box on the bottom. It definitely belongs to the family of harps (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sm 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.12">1 Kgs 10:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.12.27">Neh 12:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.57.8">Ps 57:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.23">Am 5:23</a>) and may have been influenced by similar Egyptian instruments. The <span class="hebrew">nebel</span> was probably played without a plectrum and was a larger and louder instrument than the <span class="hebrew">kinnor</span><span class="ital">.</span> It is translated as “harp” in most modern English translations, compared to the <span class="sc">kjv</span> (“psaltery,” or “viol”).</p>
<p><span class="greek">Psantrin</span> or <span class="greek">pesanterin</span> was a Greek instrument, mentioned in the description of King Nebuchadnezzar’s orchestra. It may have resembled a dulcimer, having strings played with hammers (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.5-15">Dn 3:5-15</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Sabcha</span> or <span class="hebrew">sabbeka</span><span class="ital">,</span> identical with the Greek <span class="greek">sambyke</span> and the Roman <span class="ital">sambuca,</span> was a stringed instrument (<span class="sc">rsv</span> “trigon,” <span class="sc">kjv</span> “sackbut”) played in the Babylonian court. It was a triangle with four strings, having a high and harsh tone (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.5-15">Dn 3:5-15</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="MusicalInstrumentsFromAncientTimes"/>
<p class="h2" id="WindInstruments">Wind Instruments</p>
<p class="fl">The wind instruments can be divided into two groups: pipes and horns.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Musicians"/>
<p><span class="hebrew">Halil</span> is mentioned only six times in the Bible but was referred to frequently by postbiblical writers. This kind of piped instrument was similar to the Greek <span class="greek">aulos</span> (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.23">Mt 9:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.7">1 Cor 14:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.22">Rv 18:22</a>), a primitive oboe, rendered “flute” in many translations. The root word <span class="hebrew">halal</span> means “to pierce,” thus the meaning “hollow tube.” The early pipes were made from reedlike plants. The <span class="hebrew">halil</span> had a double-reed mouthpiece and probably produced a shrill and penetrating sound. It was connected with joyful events such as banquets (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.12">Is 5:12</a>) and prophetic frenzies (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>), but its tone was also associated with wailing and mourning (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.36">Jer 48:36</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Hatzotzrot</span> was a sort of trumpet. Modern scholars have more information about this horn than many of its ancient Hebrew counterparts. The triumphal arch built by Titus in Rome includes depictions of the captured implements of the temple, among which are two trumpets. The form of these horns may have been influenced by the Israelites’ knowledge of Egyptian trumpets. Similar instruments were also known in Assyria, in the Hittite Empire, and in Greece. Moses was commanded to make two silver trumpets (<a href="?bref=Num.10.2">Nm 10:2</a>); playing these instruments became the exclusive privilege of the descendants of Aaron. These trumpets were made of silver or gold, about a yard (.9 meter) long, but narrow, with a pronounced bell. The descendants of the <span class="hebrew">hatzotzrot</span> are the herald trumpets. <a href="?bref=Num.10.10">Numbers 10:10</a> says the trumpets were used “for a memorial before . . . God.” Trumpets and horns were used to signal the gathering of the congregation to the tent of meeting, to sound alarm, to alert the camps to move forward, and to announce when war was at hand. The <span class="hebrew">hatzotzrot</span> became an important part of the temple service. There were at least two trumpets in the daily services, but at high holidays the number could be increased indefinitely (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.28">1 Chr 15:28</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.15.14">2 Chr 15:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.98.6">Ps 98:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.3.5-15">Dn 3:5-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.5.8">Hos 5:8</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="Trumpets"/>
<p><span class="hebrew">Mashroqita</span><span class="ital">,</span> considered by modern scholars to be a Pan’s pipe similar to the Greek <span class="greek">syrinx</span><span class="ital">,</span> is included in the list of orchestral instruments of King Nebuchadnezzar’s court (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.5,7,10,15">Dn 3:5, 7, 10, 15</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shophar</span> is mentioned in the Bible 72 times, more than any other Hebrew instrument. It is the only instrument of ancient Israel that survives in its original form and is still used in Jewish liturgy. The early <span class="hebrew">shophar</span> was curved like a ram’s horn, but the later form was straight with a bend near the bell of the horn. There is some question whether any of the hornlike instruments can actually be considered musical instruments. The <span class="hebrew">shophar</span> could produce two, maybe three tones, and was used for giving signals, not for playing music. It was used in such religious ceremonies as the transfer of the ark (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.15">2 Sm 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.15.28">1 Chr 15:28</a>), the renewal of the covenant by King Asa (<a href="?bref=2Chr.15.14">2 Chr 15:14</a>), thanksgiving to God (<a href="?bref=Ps.98.6">Ps 98:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.150.3">150:3</a>), and was blown at the new moon and the beginning of the jubilee year. Its secular use included such royal occasions as Absalom’s accession to the throne (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.10">2 Sm 15:10</a>), Solomon’s anointing as king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.34">1 Kgs 1:34</a>), and Jehu’s accession to the throne (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.13">2 Kgs 9:13</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Sumponia</span> is an uncertain term included in <a href="?bref=Dan.3.1-30">Daniel 3</a>. Many commentators have interpreted it as a bagpipe (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), but musicologists strongly argue that at the time of King Nebuchadnezzar there was no such instrument. It has been suggested that <span class="hebrew">sumponia</span> was not a musical instrument at all but signified the playing of the entire ensemble. This could come from the Greek root <span class="greek">sym</span><span class="greek">phonia</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “sounding together.” The word is also found in <a href="?bref=Luke.15.25">Luke 15:25</a>, where it is translated as “music.”</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Ugab</span><span class="ital">,</span> a flutelike instrument, is mentioned in Scripture four times (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.21">Gn 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.21.12">Jb 21:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.30.31">30:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.150.4">Ps 150:4</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> mistranslates it as “organ”). It is only in <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1-6">Psalm 150</a> that the <span class="hebrew">ugab</span> is connected with a sacred occasion.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PercussionInstruments">Percussion Instruments</p>
<p class="fl">Most of the accounts of percussion instruments are found in the early history of the Hebrew people. They were gradually eliminated from the temple orchestra, perhaps because of their association with idolatrous practices.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Mena anim</span> was a loud metal rattle, constructed with a frame carrying loose rings. It is included in a list of instruments in <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Samuel 6:5</a> (<span class="sc">rsv</span> “castanet”; <span class="sc">kjv</span> mistranslates as “cornet”). It was likely a form of the <span class="ital">sistrum,</span> an Egyptian instrument.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Pamonim</span> were the bells attached to the lower hem of the priest’s garment, described in <a href="?bref=Exod.28.33-34">Exodus 28:33-34</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.39.25-26">39:25-26</a>. They were not loud but indicated the position of the high priest as he entered the sanctuary.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Shalishim</span><span class="ital">,</span> often translated as <span class="ital">sistrum</span> or <span class="ital">timbrel,</span> is a kind of rattle. It is not clear whether this term actually refers to a musical instrument. It appears in <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.6">1 Samuel 18:6</a> as part of the reception of King Saul and David after the battle with the Philistines.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Toph</span> or <span class="hebrew">tof</span> was an instrument used mainly by women, but there are some indications that men might have played it as well (<a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “tabret”; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sm 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.8">1 Chr 13:8</a>). The mention of this kind of hand drum appears 15 times in the Bible. A wooden or metal hoop was covered with the skin of a ram or wild goat and was played with the hand. It is not clear whether the <span class="hebrew">toph</span> had skin on just one side or two. Some commentators have described it as a tambourine or timbrel but there is no indication that it included jangles. The <span class="hebrew">toph</span> was used in merrymaking and was rather loud (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.20">Ex 15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.81.2">Ps 81:2</a>).</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Zelzelim</span> or <span class="hebrew">meziltayim</span> were cymbals. Both of these words come from the Hebrew root <span class="hebrew">zala</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “to resound” or “to tingle,” and the noun forms represent the instrument known as the cymbal. Sometimes these terms are wrongly translated as “castanets.” These were the only percussion instruments included in the temple music and were always referred to in a dual form, suggesting a pair of cymbals, but played by one man. Cymbals made of metal were known to most ancient cultures. They appear for the first time in the Bible when the ark was transferred to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.5">2 Sm 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.13.8">1 Chr 13:8</a>). Later they were played in the temple by the leaders of the Levitical singers (<a href="?bref=1Chr.15.19">1 Chr 15:19</a>). The function of the cymbals was less musical than liturgical, being used as signals for the singing to begin and between the sections of the psalms. Two different kinds of cymbals are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Ps.150.1-6">Psalm 150</a>, but their difference is not clear, probably involving either size or material.</p>

<p class="h1">MUTENESS</p>
<p class="fl">The inability to speak. Muteness, or aphasia, can be a momentary phenomenon or a permanent handicap. It may result from mental retardation, brain lesion, or deafness.</p>
<p>The Bible records several examples of muteness. Zechariah was made mute by the angel Gabriel for not believing he would become the father of John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.18-22">Lk 1:18-22</a>). That condition persisted at least nine months, until the baby was born and named (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.62-64">62-64</a>).</p>
<p>Inability to speak is usually associated with neurological diseases or severe structural deformities. When Jesus healed people who were thus afflicted, or hearing-impaired (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.32-33">Mt 9:32-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.22-23">12:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.30-31">15:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.32-37">Mk 7:32-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.17-27">9:17-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.14">Lk 11:14</a>), observers were understandably astonished.</p>
<p>Other scattered biblical passages refer to muteness in people (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.8">Prv 31:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.6">Is 35:6</a>) and in animals (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.10">Is 56:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.16">2 Pt 2:16</a>). The fact that false gods and idols cannot speak (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.18-20">Hb 2:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.2">1 Cor 12:2</a>) was frequently pointed out by the prophets, who contrasted them with the living, speaking God of Israel.</p>

  <title>Mystery</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MYSTERY</p>
<p class="fl">Counsel, or secret plan, that God shares only with his people. In most biblical passages it relates to the wise counsel of God in his guidance of history to its destiny. The most specific and significant application of the concept of mystery is to the plan of God regarding the death of Christ. It does not refer to a secret that God is unwilling to tell or to something so obscure that it could not be understood even if told.</p>
<p>The passages in which its theological meaning is most clearly seen (among over 30 occurrences in Scripture) are <a href="?bref=Dan.3.18-28">Daniel 3:18-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.6">4:6</a> (Septuagint); <a href="?bref=Matt.13.11">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.11">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.10">Luke 8:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.25">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.25">16:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.7">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.51">15:51</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.9">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.3-6,9-12">3:3-6, 9-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.26-29">Colossians 1:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.9,16">1 Timothy 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.20">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.10.7">10:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.17.5-18">17:5-18</a>.</p>
<p>In the passages in Daniel, the emphasis is on the revelation that God gave Daniel concerning the content and meaning of King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about the future. It is important to note here that the dream was about what God was going to do. No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner could explain it, but “there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries” (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.28">Dn 2:28</a>).</p>
<p>Scholarly studies in recent years have determined that similar themes are found in other Jewish writings, including the Dead Sea Scrolls. The stress is on the decisions God has made about the future, especially the end time. The world wrestles with such matters as the problem of evil (i.e., Why, if God is both good and powerful, do people still suffer?). The believer identifies with these problems but knows that God has his providential plans and that one day he will make all things clear. The way God will bring vindication for those who are wronged in this world and judgment to those who do wrong is part of the content of the “mystery” and was a major emphasis in the writings around the time of Christ. God controls the affairs of the universe. The nations will eventually fulfill his purposes.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Matt.13.11">Matthew 13:11</a>, <a href="?bref=Mark.4.11">Mark 4:11</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.8.10">Luke 8:10</a> are part of the parables of the kingdom. The kingdom itself is related to the final climactic work of God in history. This is seen in some of the imagery of the parables, such as the harvest, which symbolizes future judgment. Therefore, the word “mystery” is appropriate and significant here. In the immediate context Jesus is explaining why he uses parables. They both vividly illustrate truth and conceal truth from those who are not receptive to it. Therefore, the word “mystery” (plural in Mt and Lk) describes the inner meaning of Jesus’ teaching about the kingdom. Those who accept the message will know its meaning; those who do not will lose not only the meaning but apparently also the opportunity to hear and respond to the message of salvation (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.12-15">Mt 13:12-15</a>).</p>
<p>Another aspect of this passage lies in the unasked question as to why, if the Messiah has come, evil still persists in the world. The servants in one of the parables wanted to pull up the weeds, symbolizing evil or evil persons, but were told to allow them to grow until the time of harvest—that is, the judgment (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.24-30">Mt 13:24-30</a>). The persistence of evil in the world and the way God will eventually deal with it is one of the “mysteries.”</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rom.11.25">Romans 11:25</a> occurs in a large section (chs <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">9–11</a>) that deals with the people of Israel and their future. Once again, the issue concerns a present problem and its future resolution. In this case the problem is the unbelief of Israel. The hardening of Israel during the present time is called a “mystery” (<a href="?bref=Rom.11.25">Rom 11:25</a>). God’s purposes will not be thwarted, however, “and so all Israel will be saved” (v <a href="?bref=Rom.11.26">26</a>). This emphasis on the purposes of God is closely intertwined with the concept of the “mystery” and is basic to this entire passage.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rom.16.25">Romans 16:25</a> is broader in its scope, connecting the “revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past” with Paul’s “gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ.” Here the focus is more closely on the meaning of the death of Christ.</p>
<p>God’s “secret wisdom” is mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.7">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>. The context is the message of the cross that Paul preaches. This message is foolishness to those who consider themselves wise but are lost, and it is the “foolishness” of what is preached that brings salvation to believers (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.18-25">1:18-25</a>). Paul does not attempt to proclaim worldly “wisdom,” but he does declare a “message of wisdom” to those who are spiritually mature (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.6">2:6</a>). To these he speaks the “secret wisdom,” or literally, “wisdom in a secret” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.7">7</a>). This passage clearly connects the basic concept of “mystery” as the counsel of God with the death of Christ as the means of salvation. It also connects mystery with the process of history (“the rulers of this age”) and with the sweep of God’s purposes from OT times into the future. Verse <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.10">10</a> emphasizes the fact that God has indeed revealed these mysteries to us.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a> Paul again speaks from the context of a contrast between God’s wisdom and that of the world (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.18-23">3:18-23</a>). He speaks not only of secret things or mysteries but also introduces the concept of stewardship. He has been entrusted with the revelation of God’s mystery and must be faithful in his ministry of declaring it. This theme will reappear in <a href="?bref=Eph.3.2-6">Ephesians 3:2-6</a>.</p>
<p>Paul returns to the relationship of mystery and the end time in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>. The earlier passage (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.9-16">2:9-16</a>) showed that human knowledge cannot possibly anticipate what God has planned, but God has revealed this mystery to believers. A major aspect of this revealed mystery is the way in which the faithful will be brought into the presence of God: “Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.51-52">15:51-52</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The other references to mystery in 1 Corinthians occur in the broad context of chapters <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-14.40">12–14</a> dealing with spiritual gifts, which include receiving divine revelation, so the term “mysteries” in <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.2">13:2</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.2">14:2</a> is appropriate.</p>
<p>Ephesians opens with a series of statements about God’s purpose in history, culminating in the universal headship of Christ (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.10">Eph 1:10</a>). These statements include such terms as “chose,” “destined,” “will,” “purpose,” “plan,” and “counsel.” This is clearly the range of ideas associated with the word “mystery” in ancient Jewish writings, and these ideas shed light on Paul’s use of the summary expression: “For he has made known to us . . . the mystery of his will” (v <a href="?bref=Eph.1.9">9</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Part of God’s purpose was to form a body of believers, reconciled to himself and to each other through the cross (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.14-18">Eph 2:14-18</a>). In this body, Jewish and Gentile believers have been made members together of one body and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus, a new phase of God’s revealed plan, which Paul here calls a “mystery” (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.6">3:6</a>). As noted above, Paul himself has a responsibility to minister the truth of this “mystery” faithfully (<a href="?bref=Eph.3.2-5">3:2-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.1-5">1 Cor 4:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>Colossians continues to show Paul’s sense of responsibility regarding this “mystery,” which is now identified with the “word of God” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.25-29">Col 1:25-29</a>). Once again there is the idea of the span of history linked with the mystery that is known only by revelation: “the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints” (v <a href="?bref=Col.1.26">26</a>). As in Ephesians, the church is the locus for the working out of God’s mystery, “which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (v <a href="?bref=Col.1.27">27</a>). This Christ is proclaimed in wisdom, so that believers may reach mature completion in him (v <a href="?bref=Col.1.28">28</a>). The Colossian believers are asked to pray for Paul as he preaches this “mystery” (<a href="?bref=Col.4.3">4:3</a>).</p>
<p>It is made clear in <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Timothy 3:16</a> that the “mystery of godliness” includes the basic elements associated with the “mystery,” such as its manifestation in the world and ultimate vindication. However, this grand plan of God does not unfold without opposition. In connection with the coming of the end time, Paul again mentions a mystery. This time it is a dark mystery, called the “secret power of lawlessness” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.7">2 Thes 2:7</a>). A similar evil force, “Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes,” is introduced in the book of Revelation with the word “mystery” (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.5">Rv 17:5</a>). Perhaps the idea is that there are forces counter to God whose workings are also impossible for humans to understand. God’s truth and power will, however, prevail over these, as he brings his own mystery, his wise counsel, to fulfillment.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Rev.10.6-7">Revelation 10:6-7</a> declares this fulfillment. The ages of waiting in perplexity, of enduring evil, are over, as the angel announces, “There will be no more delay!” The time has finally come when “the mystery of God will be accomplished.” Note the dynamic quality of the mystery in this context. It is not just static truth but something that can be “accomplished.” This great climax to history is in accord with God’s previous revelation “to his servants, the prophets.” The mystery, then, is God’s wise counsel, which both guides history and is revealed in its culmination. It expresses God’s answer to the problem of evil and the vain opposition by evil powers. It declares the meaning of the central event in history, the death of Christ, and reveals the results of the resurrection in the ultimate transformation of all believers at the coming of Christ.</p>

  <title>Mystery of Lawlessness*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">MYSTERY OF LAWLESSNESS*</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase used by the apostle Paul to describe a lawless power or force threatening the world. The expression is found only in <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a> and must be considered in the light of its context.</p>
<p>Evidently, some members of the church at Thessalonica were convinced that Christ had already returned (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.1-2">2 Thes 2:1-2</a>). In order to counter this belief Paul describes some of the events that must occur before the return of Christ. These events center around the coming of “the man of lawlessness,” an evil figure who takes his seat in the temple of Jerusalem and proclaims himself to be God (vv <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.3-4">3-4</a>). Although the man of lawlessness is presently being restrained, the evil that he will perpetrate is already at work (v <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.6">6</a>). Paul calls this evil “the mystery of lawlessness.”</p>
<p>The identity of the man of lawlessness, the restrainer, and the content of the mystery of iniquity have been subject to much debate. Among the suggestions that have been made, the following three predominate:</p>
<p>1. The mystery of lawlessness is the tyranny of the Roman Empire, and the man of lawlessness is a future Roman emperor who is being kept from power by the present Roman ruler. In support of this position it can be said that the Jewish apocalypses of Paul’s day considered Rome to be the quintessence of evil. In addition, approximately 10 years before the writing of 2 Thessalonians, Caligula, the Roman emperor, ordered his statue to be erected and worshiped in the Jerusalem temple (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 18.8.2-6; <span class="ital">War</span> 2.10.1-5).</p>
<p>2. The mystery of lawlessness is the religion of Judaism, and the man of lawlessness is the high priest who is restrained by apostolic preaching. However, it is doubtful that Paul would have considered Judaism in this light (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-5">Rom 9:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>3. Dispensational theology identifies the mystery of lawlessness as the whole course of evil, consummated in the figure of the Antichrist (the lawless one) and presently restrained by the Holy Spirit. In such a context, it is difficult to establish a scriptural basis for the Holy Spirit being “taken out of the way” (<a href="?bref=2Thes.2.7">2 Thes 2:7</a>).</p>
