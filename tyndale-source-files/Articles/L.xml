  <title>Laban (Person)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LABAN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Bethuel’s son (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.24,29">Gn 24:24, 29</a>), brother of Rebekah (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.24.15,29">15, 29</a>), father of Leah and Rachel (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.16">29:16</a>), and the uncle and father-in-law of Jacob. Laban’s forebears lived in Ur, but his father, Bethuel, was called the Aramean of Paddan-aram, and Laban also is referred to as the Aramean (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “Syrian,” <a href="?bref=Gen.25.20">25:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.28.5">28:5</a>). Their hometown was Haran, which was in Syria and which, like Ur, was a center of the worship of the moon god, Sin or Nannar.</p>
<p>When Isaac came of age, Abraham sent his servant Eliezer back to Haran to find a wife for Isaac. Laban greeted Eliezer hospitably and made provision for him and his camels (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.29-33,54">Gn 24:29-33, 54</a>). Laban acted as the head of the house; he made the decision concerning Rebekah’s marriage to Isaac (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.24.50-51">50-51</a>), and it was to him and his mother that Eliezer made gifts of costly ornaments (v <a href="?bref=Gen.24.53">53</a>).</p>
<p>Laban figures largely in the narrative of his nephew Jacob in his quest for a wife. After the deception of Isaac by Rebekah and Jacob, Rebekah feared that Esau would kill Jacob, so she suggested that he flee to her brother, Laban (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.43">Gn 27:43</a>); meanwhile, she persuaded Isaac that Jacob should go to Haran to find a wife from among their own people. When Jacob arrived in the area of Haran, he met Rachel, the younger daughter of Laban, and was warmly welcomed (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.13">29:13</a>). Laban hired Jacob to tend his flocks, and it was agreed that after seven years of work Jacob would receive Rachel as his wages. At the end of that period Laban substituted Leah, his older daughter. Jacob protested, but the two men finally decided that Jacob should serve another seven years for Rachel.</p>
<p>Both Jacob and Laban were schemers and had serious disputes about wages. Jacob proposed that his wages should be a certain portion of the flocks. When this was accepted, the Lord blessed Jacob and his flocks, and Laban became angry. Jacob claimed that Laban had changed his wages ten times (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.7,41">Gn 31:7, 41</a>).</p>
<p>Jacob fled from Haran. Laban pursued him because he was missing his household gods, whose possession made the holder heir to Laban’s estate. Rachel had taken them but adroitly concealed them from her father’s search.</p>
<p>Laban and Jacob parted after making a covenant of peace and erecting a pillar of stones to serve as a witness between them (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.46-50">Gn 31:46-50</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">LACHISH</p>
<p class="fl">Place first mentioned in the Bible in connection with Joshua and the Israelite conquest of Palestine. At that time, its king and army were among the coalition of southern Palestinian towns that faced Joshua at Gibeon. After Joshua’s victory, he executed the king of Lachish and later took the town itself (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.26,32">Jos 10:26, 32</a>). Though David probably brought the town to life again, it gained new significance when King Rehoboam of Judah (c. 920 <span class="era">BC</span>) made it one of his fortified cities to protect the realm against Egyptian and Philistine attacks (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.9">2 Chr 11:9</a>). About a century later, Amaziah, king of Judah, was killed at Lachish, where he had fled to escape from conspirators (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.19">2 Kgs 14:19</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfLachich"/>
<p>Lachish resisted valiantly when Sennacherib of Assyria invaded in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, but it ultimately fell under furious onslaughts (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-17">2 Kgs 18:13-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-22">Is 36</a>). Reoccupied and rebuilt by the Judeans, it was one of the last outposts of Jerusalem to fall to the Babylonians when Nebuchadnezzar invaded in 588–586 <span class="era">BC</span> and brought the southern kingdom to an end (<a href="?bref=Jer.34.7">Jer 34:7</a>). In addition to biblical references, the Egyptian Amarna letters and Assyrian records allude to Lachish.</p>
<p>The location of Lachish was long debated. Originally, it was placed at Umm Lakis, then in 1891 at Tell el-Hesi, and finally in 1929 at Tell ed-Duweir, 30 miles (48.3 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem and 15 miles (24.1 kilometers) west of Hebron. This last identification has now been confirmed by a variety of indicators.</p>

  <title>Lachish Letters*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LACHISH LETTERS*</p>
<p class="fl">Collection of letters, sometimes described as “a supplement to Jeremiah,” which was J. L. Starkey’s most important discovery at Lachish. In 1935 he found 18 ostraca in a guardroom between the outer and inner gates of the city, in a layer of ash deposited by the fire that Nebuchadnezzar kindled when he destroyed the city. Probably the Chaldeans breached the walls late in 589 <span class="era">BC</span> after the olive harvest, since numerous burned olive pits appear in the nearby ruins. Having taken this and other outlying towns, Nebuchadnezzar then laid siege to Jerusalem in January of 588. In 1938 three other letters were found at Lachish. Of uncertain date, these were short and fragmentary. All 21 of these texts were written in black carbon ink with a wood or reed stylus on pieces of broken pottery. The scribes used the Phoenician script, in which classical Hebrew was written.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the 21 documents were letters, and most of them were written by some subordinate officer at an outpost to the commander at Lachish. Unfortunately, only seven of the texts are sufficiently legible to make connected sense; on the others, only isolated sentences and words can be read. Some of the signs are blotted out and unfamiliar abbreviations and symbols are used. Scholars differ in their interpretations.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting of the letters is no. 4, which says, “We are watching for the fire signals of Lachish, according to all the signs which my lord has given, for we cannot see [the signals of] Azekah.” <a href="?bref=Jer.34.7">Jeremiah 34:7</a> mentions Lachish and Azekah (12 miles, or 19.3 kilometers, northeast of Lachish) as two of the last surviving cities of Judah. Now it would appear that Azekah too has fallen and the Chaldean noose is tightening on the Judean kingdom. However, the signals of Azekah temporarily may not have been visible for climatic or other reasons. It is important to note the external evidence here for the use of fire signals in ancient Israel. The Hebrew word for fire signal is the same as that used in <a href="?bref=Jer.6.1">Jeremiah 6:1</a>.</p>
<p>Letter no. 6 alludes to the fact that the princes are weakening the hands of the people. Evidently this refers to some insubordination or defeatism. The text reads: “And behold the words of the princes are not good, but to weaken our hands and to slacken the hands of the men who are informed about them.” This is almost identical to the charge that some of the princes lodged against Jeremiah: “For he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them” (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.4">Jer 38:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Letter no. 3 refers to a journey of the Judean army commander to Egypt. Whether he went with an appeal for troops or supplies is not known. This allusion points to the intrigues of the pro-Egyptian party during the reign of Zedekiah. The reason for the present expedition must have been much different from that referred to in <a href="?bref=Jer.26.20-23">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>. Letter no. 3 also refers to a letter with a warning from a prophet. Efforts to identify this prophet as Uriah or Jeremiah have not been convincing.</p>
<p>Letters 2–6 refer to a defense that a certain Hoshaiah (a name that appears in <a href="?bref=Jer.42.1">Jer 42:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.43.2">43:2</a>), the writer of several of the Lachish texts, makes to his superior, Ya’osh. Though the charges are not always clear, they have something to do with reading confidential documents and presumably divulging some of the information contained therein. One scholar has suggested that this collection of letters in the Lachish guardhouse constituted a “file” used in the court-martial of Hoshaiah. The guardhouse was not only a military post but was also located by the gate where Palestinian trials were held in biblical times.</p>
<p>The Lachish letters have epigraphic, linguistic, and historical value for the Bible scholar. They indicate the kind of language and script the Hebrews were using in the age of Jeremiah, and they give information for textual criticism. They are firsthand documents of the disturbed political and military situation during the months before Nebuchadnezzar’s destruction of Jerusalem, when Jeremiah was the leading prophet in Judah. They help to make possible a study of Hebrew proper names in the last days of the monarchy and provide numerous historical references (e.g., no. 20 refers to the ninth year of King Zedekiah).</p>

<p class="h1">LAKE OF FIRE</p>
<p class="fl">Final abode of Satan, his servants, and unrepentant human beings.</p>
<p>This place is mentioned only in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.20">Rv 19:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.10,14-15">20:10, 14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.8">21:8</a>), but its terrible nature is abundantly clear. It is described as a lake of fire or lake of burning sulphur into which are cast (1) the “beast” and his “false prophet” after the Lamb defeats them, (2) Satan after his last rebellion, (3) Death and Hades, and (4) all whose names are not found in the “Book of Life.” It is called the second death, for it is the ultimate separation from God beyond the resurrection and final judgment.</p>
<p>The lake of fire is probably the same place that Jesus calls Gehenna (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.28">Mt 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.43">Mk 9:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.5">Lk 12:5</a>), the “outer darkness” (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.12">Mt 8:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.22.13">22:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.30">25:30</a>), and the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.41">Mt 25:41</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.66.24">Is 66:24</a>). The imagery is drawn from the fires in the valley of Hinnom outside of Jerusalem and perhaps the stream of fire issuing from God’s throne (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.33">Is 30:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.10">Dn 7:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.34.9-10">Is 34:9-10</a>). The picture was known to Jewish as well as Christian writers (Assumption of Moses 10:10; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.7.36">2 Esd 7:36</a>). Whatever the image or name, they all point to a place of eternal torment and separation from God where the unrepentant will suffer forever.</p>

<p class="h1">LAMB OF GOD</p>
<p class="fl">General term used twice by John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=John.1.29,36">Jn 1:29, 36</a>), adding on the first instance “who takes away the world’s sin!” He does not explain what the term means. Christians use the term freely, but what do they mean by it? Why would anyone be called “God’s Lamb”?</p>
<p>Some maintain that John saw Jesus fulfilling all that the Passover means and that this is a way of referring to the Passover lamb. It is true that the fourth Gospel places the death of Jesus at the time the Passover sacrifices were killed. But “Passover lamb” is a modern expression; not one example of its use is known to occur in antiquity. When people wanted to refer to the animal killed for this sacrifice, they simply called it “the Passover” (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.21">Ex 12:21</a>, cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The Passover victim was not necessarily a lamb; it might be, and often was, a kid. There is no reason for seeing the Passover in this expression.</p>
<p>Some scholars think the image comes from <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>. They see the lamb led to the slaughter (v <a href="?bref=Isa.53.7">7</a>) as a way of referring to the Messiah.</p>
<p>Other scholars think there is an allusion to the triumphant lamb of the apocalypses. The writers of apocalyptic literature used vivid imagery to reveal their meaning to initiates and to conceal it from outsiders. They sometimes used the lamb as a symbol of a conqueror (cf. the use of “the Lamb” for “the Mighty One” in Revelation). These scholars think that John was pointing to Jesus as the Messiah, King of Israel. Many find this view attractive. The royalty it ascribes to Jesus is certainly congenial to John. But against it is the weighty consideration that John was speaking about a Lamb who takes away sin, while the apocalyptic lamb is normally a conqueror. The roles are different. Further, it is not easy to see how non-Jewish readers of the Gospel at the time it was written would have been able to discern the point of apocalyptic imagery.</p>
<p>There are other suggestions. The “gentle lamb” (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.19">Jer 11:19</a>), the daily sacrifice in the temple, the scapegoat, and the guilt offering have all been put forward with some confidence. But no one has produced evidence that any of these was ever called “God’s lamb.”</p>
<p>In the OT passages referring to a lamb, nearly all of them speak of sacrifice (85 out of the total of 96). Combined with a reference to the taking away of sin, it is difficult to see how a reference to sacrificial atonement is to be rejected. Characteristically the lamb in Scripture puts away sin by being sacrificed. “God’s Lamb” means that this provision is made by God himself. A reference to sacrifice seems undeniable, but a connection with any one sacrifice is hard to make. All that the OT sacrifices foreshadowed, Christ perfectly fulfilled. God’s Lamb puts sin away finally.</p>

<p class="list">1. Methushael’s son, a descendant of Cain, and the husband of Adah and Zillah. Lamech’s sons by Adah were Jabal, “the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock,” and Jubal, “the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.” A son, Tubal-cain, “the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron,” and a daughter, Naamah, were Lamech’s children by Zillah (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.18-22">Gn 4:18-22</a>). In the account of beginnings given in the early chapters of Genesis, the sons of Lamech are the first herdsmen, musicians, and metalworkers. His song of vengeance (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.4.23-24">23-24</a>) is an example of early Hebrew poetry. In the song Lamech declares that he has killed a man for wounding him and compares the act to his forebear Cain’s slaying of Abel (cf. vv <a href="?bref=Gen.4.8-12">8-12</a>). He asserts that “if anyone who kills Cain is to be punished seven times, anyone who takes revenge against me will be punished seventy-seven times!” Lamech’s song indicates that, as civilization became more complex, pride and the propensity for violence increased. Jesus’ word about forgiving “seventy times seven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.22">Mt 18:22</a>) stands in sharp contrast to Lamech’s example.</p>
<p class="list">2. Methuselah’s son, and the father of Noah (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.25-31">Gn 5:25-31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.3">1 Chr 1:3</a>). When Noah was born, Lamech expressed his hope that the child would bring relief to humanity from the curse placed upon Adam (<a href="?bref=Gen.5.29">Gn 5:29</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.3.17">3:17</a>). His life span—777 years—is one of the longest in the listing of those who lived before the Flood. Fanciful conversations in old age between Lamech and his father, Methuselah, are recorded in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Lamech is listed as an ancestor of Jesus in the genealogy recorded in <a href="?bref=Luke.3.36">Luke 3:36</a>.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Lamentations has been traditionally ascribed to the prophet Jeremiah. This ascription is supported by the Latin Vulgate and the Septuagint.</p>
<p>The Jeremaic authorship of the book has been questioned by many scholars, however. The chief reasons for this are the different literary styles of the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations and the alleged conflicting viewpoints in the two books.</p>
<p>The literary styles of these books are strikingly different. The prophecies of the book of Jeremiah are flowing pronouncements that create an impression of spontaneity and are quite unlike the contrived literary structures of Lamentations. But it is somewhat arbitrary to assert that Jeremiah could not have written the book of Lamentations on the basis of style. The choice of the acrostic form would naturally limit the scope of the writer’s freedom and profoundly affect his style. It is clear from <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.25">2 Chronicles 35:25</a> that Jeremiah composed the same type of material as that found in Lamentations. Since the sermons of the book of Jeremiah were intended for public proclamation, they would naturally have a spontaneity that the book of Lamentations would not possess. Certainly, the sensitive nature reflected in Jeremiah’s prophecies characterized the author of Lamentations as well.</p>
<p>Typical of the alleged differences of viewpoint used to deny Jeremaic authorship is the role of the nations in the destruction of Jerusalem. In his prophecy Jeremiah saw the invading Babylonians as a tool of God’s punishment, and appealed to the Jews to surrender to the invaders (<a href="?bref=Jer.28.3">Jer 28:3</a>). The book of Lamentations seems to make God the direct author of the punishment and sees the enemy nations only as onlookers who will also experience God’s wrath (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.21">Lam 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.3.59-66">3:59-66</a>). It must be noted, however, that the enemies referred to in Lamentations are not only the Babylonians but all of the hostile powers that threatened Judah and gloated over its destruction (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.21">1:21</a>). The assurance that God will judge these enemies is not a denial of the message of the book of Jeremiah, for it would be artificial for Jeremiah to suppose that the Babylonians, even though they were an instrument of God’s anger, were exempt from punishment. Such a concept is at variance with <a href="?bref=Jer.12.14-17">Jeremiah 12:14-17</a>.</p>
<p>A number of phrases used in the book of Jeremiah are found in Lamentations as well. The expressions “terrors on every side” (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.22">Lam 2:22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.6.25">Jer 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.10">20:10</a>) and “wormwood” (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.15,19">Lam 3:15, 19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.9.15">Jer 9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.15">23:15</a>) are examples of these. This fact lends support to the concept of Jeremaic authorship of the book.</p>
<p>Other reasons cited for the denial of Jeremaic authorship are the absence of the name of Jeremiah in Lamentations and the position of the book in the Writings, not the Prophets, in the Hebrew Bible. The absence of Jeremiah’s name is not a cogent argument against his authorship; there are a significant number of OT books whose authors are not cited. Since the book of Lamentations is a formal dirge, and is thus unlike the book of Jeremiah with its numerous autobiographical references, one would not expect personal allusions by the author.</p>
<p>The position of Lamentations in the third division of the Hebrew Bible is sometimes appealed to by those who question Jeremaic authorship. Since Jeremiah is in the second division, it is argued that Lamentations was written too late for it to have been authored by Jeremiah. It should be noted, however, that there is a lack of unity in the early lists of the canonical books in the third division. It is difficult to assign a late date to a book of the third division only because of its inclusion in that division. The early church father Jerome indicated that Lamentations was once on the same scroll with Jeremiah.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">If the book of Lamentations was written by Jeremiah, the time of writing would be shortly after the fall of Jerusalem (586 <span class="era">BC</span>). It is extremely difficult to imagine an author living in later times writing such a poignant lament over Jerusalem’s fall. The vivid descriptions of the suffering endured by the inhabitants of Jerusalem support the position that the book was written by an eyewitness to the events.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">After many months of siege by the Babylonian armies, Jerusalem fell, and the final deportation of the people of Judah took place. Extrabiblical confirmation of the devastation caused by the Babylonian invasion may be found in the Lachish letters, which record the message from a soldier in the field who indicates that he is watching for the signals of Lachish but cannot see the signals of Azekah (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.34.7">Jer 34:7</a>).</p>
<p>The time preceding Jerusalem’s fall was one of internal strife and political intrigue. Jeremiah counseled surrender, while the chauvinistic leaders of Jerusalem tried to encourage the Judahites to fight on against the Babylonian onslaught. The role of Jeremiah in those final events was a tenuous one. His life was threatened, and he suffered numerous imprisonments.</p>
<p>The fall of Jerusalem meant more than ignominious defeat and exile. While these would have been hard to bear, the theological emergency brought about by the event would have been the most difficult thing for believing Jews to comprehend. The fall of the city in which God chose to reveal himself would have signaled the end of God’s promises. The OT clearly set forth a glorious future for Jerusalem. It was to be the center of the messianic kingdom in the end time (<a href="?bref=Mic.4.1-13">Mi 4</a>). The destruction of the city would cause many to question the veracity of God’s Word. The laments in this book are not only for the suffering that accompanied the fall of the city but also for the deep spiritual questions posed by its demise.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Structure">Structure</p>
<p class="fl">Each poem has a distinct symmetrical pattern. The first (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.1-22">Lam 1</a>) is an elaborate acrostic composed of three-line segments. There are 22 segments, each beginning with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet, proceeding in order from the first to the last. The second poem (ch <a href="?bref=Lam.2.1-22">2</a>) is similar except for a transposition of two Hebrew letters. The third poem (ch <a href="?bref=Lam.3.1-66">3</a>) is also composed of three-line segments, but each line begins with a different letter of the Hebrew alphabet, rather than only the first line of each segment as in the first two poems. The same Hebrew letters are transposed. The fourth poem (ch <a href="?bref=Lam.4.1-22">4</a>) is an acrostic composed of two-line segments. The first line of each segment begins with the appropriate Hebrew letter. The last poem (ch <a href="?bref=Lam.5.1-22">5</a>) is not an acrostic, but it contains the same number of letters as the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<p>The reason for this complex structure is unknown. It has been suggested that it is a device to aid memorization. Another suggestion is that the Hebrews may have seen the alphabet as representing the concept of totality or completeness. This idea derives from the fact that the Hebrew alphabet represented numbers as well as letters. This concept of totality may be reflected in the reference to the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet in <a href="?bref=Rev.1.8">Revelation 1:8</a>: “I am the Alpha and the Omega.” It is quite possible that the expression of lamentation in the structure of the Hebrew alphabet could have represented the full range of sorrow felt by the author as he pondered the fall of the city of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">A major purpose of the book of Lamentations was to give expression to the deep grief that Jeremiah felt as a result of Jerusalem’s catastrophe. By writing the book, he expressed the grief of all the Jews of his time and gave them a vehicle that would give vent to their sorrow.</p>
<p>The book does not contain only lamentation, however, for it expresses hope and comfort as well. Thus another of its purposes was to lift the hearts of the people and point them to God, the source of all comfort. One of the greatest expressions of hope in the book is found in <a href="?bref=Lam.3.22-23">3:22-23</a>: “The unfailing love of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> never ends! By his mercies we have been kept from complete destruction. Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each day” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important purpose of the book was to explain the theological reason for the catastrophe. The book places the reason for Jerusalem’s fall in clear focus and demonstrates what can be learned about God from this. The reason given for Jerusalem’s demise is the sin of the people (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.8-9,14">1:8-9, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.4.13">4:13</a>). The fall of the city is a vivid illustration of God’s justice in not overlooking sin even in those who are his own (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.18">1:18</a>). It demonstrates the fact that God may seem like an enemy to his people when they are disobedient (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.5-7">2:5-7</a>). It shows that the catastrophe was not outside the purposes of God (v <a href="?bref=Lam.2.17">17</a>) and vividly describes the results that can come from willful disobedience. But God is envisioned as a God of mercy and faithfulness as well. Even though Jeremiah saw his beloved homeland crumbling about him, there remained one great element of stability: God’s loyalty to his promises. Jeremiah knew that this was not the end, for he trusted in the steadfast love of the Lord and learned to wait quietly for God to act in his time (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.22-27">3:22-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The first chapter is a lamentation over the captivity of the citizens of Jerusalem and the resultant desolation of the city.</p>
<p>The author alludes to <a href="?bref=Deut.28.64-65">Deuteronomy 28:64-65</a> at the beginning of the first lamentation (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.3">Lam 1:3</a>). In that passage Moses warned the people that their disobedience to God would result in their dispersion among the nations, with no resting place. <a href="?bref=Lam.1.3">Lamentations 1:3</a> says that this warning has been realized.</p>
<p>The cause of Israel’s misfortune was their sin (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.8">1:8a</a>). This is a remarkable example of the results of disobedience to God. The dire results of sin permeate this first lamentation in a series of pictures of deep pathos (vv <a href="?bref=Lam.1.11-12,16-17">11-12, 16-17</a>). In the midst of this suffering Israel confesses that God was in the right (v <a href="?bref=Lam.1.18">18</a>). The righteousness of God involves his acting in integrity. He punishes sin even in his own people.</p>
<p>The first lamentation ends with a prayer in which the people cry out for God’s judgment on their enemies (<a href="?bref=Lam.1.21-22">1:21-22</a>). Such imprecations are the OT believer’s way of expressing his longing for an end to evil as it was personified in the godless nations.</p>
<p>The second lamentation also concerns the destruction of Jerusalem but places more emphasis on God’s judgment. The tone is more strident than in the previous lamentation. Throughout the passage words expressing anger appear (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.1-3,6-7">2:1-3, 6-7</a>). It is as though the terrible wrath of God evident in the destruction of the city is still vivid in the mind of the writer.</p>
<p>The author lays the blame for God’s anger squarely on the false prophets (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.14">2:14</a>); but he does not exempt the people from guilt, as is clear from other passages (e.g., <a href="?bref=Lam.1.5,8">1:5, 8</a>). It was the false prophets of the time who failed to warn the people of the results of their sin (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.14">2:14</a>). Because of this, destruction came, and the writer can give no comfort to the people (v <a href="?bref=Lam.2.13">13</a>).</p>
<p>The second lamentation begins with a reference to God’s footstool (<a href="?bref=Lam.2.1">2:1</a>), probably referring to the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.2">1 Chr 28:2</a>). The ark was the focal point of God’s revelation of himself. This verse reflects the theological emergency of the time; the writer laments the fact that God has not remembered his “footstool.” Even the holy ark, which marked God’s presence with his people, has not prevented God from destroying Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The same thought is expressed in verses <a href="?bref=Lam.2.6-7">6-7</a>, where the traditional aspects of Israelite worship, as well as the sanctuary, are seen as having been destroyed by God. This important truth demonstrates the viewpoint of the whole book, which sees God as the direct cause of the misfortune.</p>
<p>The third lamentation is very personal. At its conclusion, sorrow and complaint pass into a prayer of assurance (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.61-66">3:61-66</a>). In the first 18 verses of this chapter, the writer describes how the Lord has afflicted him. He refers to God in the third person, not addressing him as Lord until he speaks the words of verse <a href="?bref=Lam.3.18">18</a>. Only after he has poured out his grief in this fashion can he speak the name of the Lord. This poignant grief suddenly changes to an expression of joy. He can affirm the covenant faithfulness of the Lord, and in the midst of the deepening sorrow, he sees God’s mercies as new every morning (vv <a href="?bref=Lam.3.22-24">22-24</a>). The chapter closes with a sudden burst of assurance (vv <a href="?bref=Lam.3.58-66">58-66</a>), in which the writer affirms his belief that God will vindicate him before his enemies. Only after he meditates on the nature of God’s loving-kindness (vv <a href="?bref=Lam.3.22-27">22-27</a>) can he speak these words. The desperate isolation and separation from God expressed in verses <a href="?bref=Lam.3.1-17">1-17</a> give way as he affirms God’s goodness. Assurance comes as he reflects on the nature and goodness of God.</p>
<p>The fourth lamentation emphasizes the fact that the judgment was well deserved. The author describes the various classes of the population (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.1-16">4:1-16</a>) and indicates how each has been affected by Jerusalem’s downfall. Verses <a href="?bref=Lam.4.12-20">12-20</a> affirm that the judgment of God is a direct consequence of sin. This lamentation also becomes a joyous statement of hope (vv <a href="?bref=Lam.4.21-22">21-22</a>), as the writer affirms that God will punish Israel’s enemies. Israel’s sin will be forgiven, and the guilt of “the daughter of Edom” will be punished. The “daughter of Edom” undoubtedly stands for all the enemy nations. (Edom is used in <a href="?bref=Isa.63.1">Isaiah 63:1</a> in the same fashion.) This salvation of the nation of Judah will not take place until their guilt is atoned for. It occurs when God conquers the godless nations. This conquest of the nations is an event that takes place in the end time, according to numerous OT and NT passages. It represents the manifestation of God’s total sovereignty over his creation.</p>
<p>The last chapter is a poignant prayer in which the author describes their sufferings and asks God to restore the fortunes of the people. It begins with a request to God, asking him to consider all that has befallen the people (<a href="?bref=Lam.5.1-18">5:1-18</a>). Part of the ignominy of the captive Jews is that “slaves” rule over them (v <a href="?bref=Lam.5.8">8</a>). This is an apparent reference to the Babylonian captors, who themselves were subject to despotic rule for many decades. The author’s perspective changes in verse <a href="?bref=Lam.5.19">19</a>, where he affirms that the Lord reigns forever. While Jerusalem, the earthly dwelling place of the Lord, has come to an end, the Lord’s throne endures forever. Because his throne is everlasting, the author asks, “Why do you continue to forget us? Why have you forsaken us for so long? Restore us, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and bring us back to you again! Give us back the joys we once had! Or have you utterly rejected us? Are you angry with us still?” (<a href="?bref=Lam.5.20-22">5:20-22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The question is based on the belief that because God’s reign is eternal, he cannot utterly forsake his people. He will restore his kingdom.</p>
<p>The book of Lamentations is neglected by many Christians. It deserves to be studied more. Its powerful statement concerning the blessings that may come from tragedy is a relevant message in any age, and it is one of the most powerful illustrations of the results of sin to be found in the OT. Its theology is clear and precise, painting a brilliant picture of God’s faithfulness against the dark background of the collapse of the city of Zion.</p>

<p class="h1">LAMP, LAMPSTAND</p>
<p class="fl">Israelite lamps developed from those in general use among the Canaanites in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. Their shape was similar to a shell or saucer with a lip. Lamps of stone, metal, and shells were used, although the majority were made of pottery. A multitude of clay lamps, fashioned in a variety of designs, have been excavated in Palestine.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AnAncientLamp"/>
<p>The clay bowl was fashioned first, and the rim was folded over to help contain the oil. A spout was pinched in place at one end, into which the wick would be placed. When the clay had dried, the lamp would be fired to a dull brown shade. Gradually a style with an increasingly sharply pinched lip was developed. The wick was generally made of flax (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.3">Is 42:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), although an old piece of linen cloth was sometimes used. Salt could be added to the wick for a brighter flame, and frequently extra wicks were used. This led to the development of multispouted lamps like those found at Tell Dotha from 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Olive oil provided the most common form of lamp fuel (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.20">Ex 27:20</a>), and the average lamp could hold enough oil to burn through the night. Despite this, the housewife would have to get up several times to tend the wick and keep her precious lamp lit (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.18">Prv 31:18</a>). Tongs were used for extinguishing the flame of a lamp in the tabernacle or temple (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.38">Ex 25:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.23">37:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.9">Nm 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.49">1 Kgs 7:49</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.6">Is 6:6</a>). Since candles were not known in biblical times, the translation in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> is incorrect.</p>
<p>The saucer lamp, which would have spilled easily, was not suitable for night travel, so a torch was probably used for that purpose (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.16-20">Jgs 7:16-20</a>). In addition, the wick of the open saucer lamp could easily have blown out at night.</p>
<p>Lamps were commonly found in burials along with food offerings. Because the lamp’s flame was associated with life, lamps were frequently placed in tombs as a symbol of life being rekindled.</p>
<p>Although a more elaborate cup-and-saucer style of lamp was developed in which the flame came from the central area, the saucer lamp remained the most popular. The earliest Hellenistic lamp found in Palestine dates from 630 <span class="era">BC</span> and already shows indications of the later covered model. During the sixth and fifth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, a flat-bottomed, saucer-style lamp was developed.</p>
<p>In the third century <span class="era">BC</span> the more elaborate wheel-made, covered Greek style took precedence. These lamps were often simple in design, rounded, with a central hole for the oil and one in the small spout for the wick.</p>
<p>In the second century <span class="era">BC</span> the wheel-made lamp was replaced by a molded ceramic lamp of finer design with a larger spout. Imported Egyptian lamps of this type have been found in southern Palestine. Multispouted lamps were probably used on festive occasions. From the same period comes the Hellenistic-influenced bronze lamp of a seated figure holding out a saucer lamp in his hands. At the end of the Hellenistic age the form of lamps deteriorated as the spouts became thick and squat.</p>
<p>Small, round wheel-made lamps of simple design were prevalent in the time of Christ; this would be the type of lamp used by the woman searching the house for her gold coin (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.8">Lk 15:8</a>). With wicks trimmed, the lamps of the foolish virgins would probably have lasted approximately five hours, from dark until about midnight (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.1-12">Mt 25:1-12</a>).</p>
<p>Jewish lamps were part of the religious symbolism of the home, probably dating back to the prohibition against lighting a fire on the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.3">Ex 35:3</a>). References to light abound in Scripture. We read of the eye as a lamp (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.22-23">Mt 6:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.33-36">Lk 11:33-36</a>) and of Christ as the Light of the World (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">Jn 8:12</a>). We are warned to pay attention to teaching as to a light shining in the dark (<a href="?bref=Pr.6.23">Prv 6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.19">2 Pt 1:19</a>). Both God and the spirit of man are symbolized as lamps (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.29">2 Sm 22:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.27">Prv 20:27</a>), while in <a href="?bref=Pr.13.9">Proverbs 13:9</a> “lamp” is synonymous with the essence of life itself. Lamps, with or without stands, were also part of the Jewish ritual of death, mourning, and burial.</p>
<p>The tabernacle housed an ornate golden lampstand, or menorah. On either side three branches came out from the main central stem, and seven lamps could be lighted in the flower-shaped holders. The menorah from the Jerusalem temple is represented in relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome. This particular seven-branched lampstand resembles the ten that were part of the furnishings of Solomon’s temple.</p>
<p>The seven-branched lampstand has been a particular symbol of the Jewish faith from the time of its earliest appearance on a coin in the reign of Antigonus (40–37 <span class="era">BC</span>) up to the present day.</p>

<p class="h1">LAND</p>
<p class="fl">The relationship of humans to the land is a prominent theme in the OT. In Genesis the earth with its dry land was created as a place for humans to dwell in fellowship with God. Humans were given the task of subduing the earth and ruling over the animal creation to satisfy their own needs and to bring glory to the Creator. Subsequent to humanity’s fall into sin they suffered alienation not only from God and their fellow human beings but also from the land on which they lived. They were driven from the Garden of Eden, and the earth became cursed. They were forced to toil and sweat in order to subdue the earth and provide for their own subsistence because the harvest was choked by thorns and thistles.</p>
<p>After murdering his brother, Cain receives an individual intensification of the land curse as punishment. He is told that the earth will not yield its produce for him even with hard labor, forcing him to wander from one place to another. With no permanent homeland, Cain is denied the enjoyment of rest and prosperity. Because of sin, the important human aspiration for a sense of place is refused to Cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.12">Gn 4:12</a>).</p>
<p>After the Flood, which was God’s judgment on an exceedingly wicked human race, humans again provoked God’s wrath; the construction of the Tower of Babel exalts human might apart from God. God intervenes to confuse the people’s language and “scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.9">11:9</a>). <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-11.32">Genesis 1–11</a> is thus characterized by a sequence of narratives describing land loss with its attendant deprivations as a consequence of sin and rebellion against God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LandandtheAbrahamicCovenant">Land and the Abrahamic Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">In the time of Abraham, God intervened in human affairs to provide a special homeland for a select group of people who are set apart unto himself. It is here that the Promised Land theme is introduced in Scripture. God said to Abraham, “Leave your country, your relatives, and your father’s house, and go to the land that I will show you. I will cause you to become the father of a great nation” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-2">Gn 12:1-2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This promise to Abraham is enlarged upon in <a href="?bref=Gen.12.7">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.13.14-18">13:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.7-21">15:7-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.7-8">17:7-8</a>. Abraham is told that the land of Canaan is to be the “everlasting possession” of his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.8">17:8</a>).</p>
<p>The OT narrative then traces Abraham’s line of descent through Isaac and Jacob, and tells of the migration of Jacob’s family to Egypt, where during approximately four centuries they became a great and numerous people. During this period, the promise of possession of the land of Canaan is reiterated (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.15">Gn 28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.11-12">35:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.46.3-4">46:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.50.24">50:24</a>) and held before Abraham’s descendants as an integral feature of God’s covenantal promises.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LandandtheMosaicCovenant">Land and the Mosaic Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">When God called Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, he associated Moses’ task with the fulfillment of the promises to the patriarchs: “I have remembered my covenant with them. . . . I will make you my own special people, and I will be your God. . . . I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It will be your very own property” (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.5-8">Ex 6:5-8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Israel is to be delivered from Egypt for two reasons: first, in order to be established as God’s covenant people at Mt Sinai, and second, in order to possess the land promised to their fathers. It is of utmost significance, however, that with the establishment of the Mosaic covenant the continued possession of the land is made dependent on obedience. Should Israel violate the covenantal obligations, it will bring upon itself the covenant curses, the most severe of which is banishment from the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.32-33">Lv 26:32-33</a>). This does not mean that God will abandon his people and the land totally or forever, because God also promises that when the people repent, “then I will remember my covenant with Jacob . . . and I will remember the land” (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.42">Lv 26:42</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>During the reign of King David, the promise of land received at least a provisional fulfillment. Although it is true that initial fulfillment occurred when Joshua entered the land, at that time the territory did not extend to the borders promised Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.18">Gn 15:18</a>) and much of the land that was occupied still contained pockets of resistance by the former inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-6">Jos 13:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-36">Jgs 1</a>). It was not until the time of David that the land was fully possessed as originally promised (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.1-18">2 Sm 8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.21,24">1 Kgs 4:21, 24</a>).</p>
<p>The responsibility of the king to observe the law, and the connection between covenantal obedience and possession of the land is again made clear when Solomon dedicates the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.4-9">1 Kgs 9:4-9</a>). Disobedience will bring not only expulsion from the land but also the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>The subsequent history of the divided-kingdom era is for the most part a history of covenant abrogation, by the people as well as the kings. The Lord sent repeated warnings through the prophets that such disobedience could only lead to expulsion from the land. But their message fell on deaf ears (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.11-12">Is 6:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.27">Am 5:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.7.17">7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.9.17">Hos 9:17</a>). The kings repeatedly proved themselves to be unworthy of the office.</p>
<p>As the people persisted in their evil way, Jeremiah announced that Nebuchadnezzar was to be the Lord’s agent to drive them from the land (<a href="?bref=Jer.21.2">Jer 21:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.25">22:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.8-9">25:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.6">27:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.14">28:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.21">29:21</a>). However, Jeremiah and other prophets also looked beyond the exile to a future restoration and return to the land (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-25">Jer 32:6-25</a>). Historically, this was accomplished under the rule of Cyrus the Great of Persia (538 <span class="era">BC</span>) and is described in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>
<p>A difficulty of interpretation arises in finding an adequate fulfillment of certain prophecies of the return (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">Ez 37</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.14-15">Am 9:14-15</a>), which envision great prosperity and permanent possession of the land under the rule of a Davidic king. The intertestamental period does not seem to be a suitable fulfillment for these predictions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LandandtheNewCovenant">Land and the New Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT the land theme is much less prominent and seems mostly to be given a spiritual symbolism. The writer of Hebrews suggests that Abraham understood the land promise as something that pointed beyond a merely geographical fulfillment to a higher and far more satisfying heavenly home. Realizing the imperfection and transitory nature of all that this world offers, Abraham looked beyond the temporal fulfillment of the land promise for a city whose builder and maker is God (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.10">Heb 11:10</a>), and he sought a “better country, that is, a heavenly one” (v <a href="?bref=Heb.11.16">16</a>). In the NT it appears that Israel’s land promise and entrance into Canaan is to be understood as typifying something of the future heavenly rest awaiting God’s people (<a href="?bref=Heb.3.1-4.16">Heb 3–4</a>). Perhaps this explains the OT stress on the connection between Israel’s living in obedience to God’s law and their possession of the land. When the Israelites do not typify a condition of holiness, they disqualify themselves from typifying a condition of blessedness, and thus are either denied access to or driven from the land. The NT indicates that it is God’s purpose to prepare an eternal homeland for his people where the rule of the divine King is direct and just, where all things are subject to his will, where death and sin are abolished, and where the needs of his people are completely satisfied (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.13-16">Heb 11:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">Rv 21</a>).</p>
<p>The OT land promises have been viewed by some as having only typical significance. In the light of Christ’s incarnation any statement of Scripture concerning a future for the land is to be interpreted as fulfilled in a spiritual sense in the church. The church is now the new Israel and heir of the OT promises. Because God’s kingdom is now a spiritual reality, it is considered a misunderstanding of the OT to expect yet future fulfillments of the OT prophecies of Israel’s return to the land and an establishment of a period of peace and prosperity under the rule of Christ, the Son of David (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.2.1-5">Is 2:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.6-11">11:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.1-28">Ez 37</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.14-15">Am 9:14-15</a>). To abide in Christ is considered an adequate fulfillment of the physical and geographical promises of the OT economy.</p>
<p>Others, while not denying typical significance for these OT realities, would suggest that the land promises are still operative in the physical and geographical categories in which they were given. It is pointed out that Paul argues in <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-11.36">Romans 9–11</a> that there is yet a future for national Israel. In spite of Israel’s history of disobedience, climaxing in the rejection of the Messiah, the election and calling of God is irrevocable, and Israel is yet to be reingrafted in the olive tree from which it had previously been cut off. Luke says that Jerusalem will be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (<a href="?bref=Luke.21.24">Lk 21:24</a>), indicating that there is to be a future time when Jerusalem will again be possessed by the Jewish nation. This does not necessarily mean that one must view the present state of Israel as the direct fulfillment of the OT promises of return to the land. The OT indicates that the return will be occasioned by belief (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.1-16">Dt 30:1-16</a>). The present return is in unbelief. At the same time, the remarkable preservation of the Jewish people over the centuries and the recent reestablishment of the nation are perhaps to be understood as anticipations or signs of a future and more complete realization of the OT land promises.</p>

<p class="h1">LAODICEA, LAODICEANS*</p>
<p class="fl">Largest of three cities and its residents in the broad valley area on the borders of Phrygia, Laodicea stood where the Lycus Valley joined the Meander. Significantly, the western entrance to the city was called the Ephesian Gate. The traveler left the city on the east by the Syrian Gate, for the great road ran to Antioch, where other roads branched to the Euphrates Valley, to Damascus, and to the northeast, where the desert trade routes ran toward the mountains, the Gobi, and the remote lands of the East.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientLaodiceanWaterPipe"/>
<p>Laodicea was not a natural fortress. The low eminence, on which its Seleucid fortifications stood, might have presented a challenge to invaders, but Laodicea had a serious weakness. The water supply came principally via a vulnerable aqueduct from springs six miles (9.7 kilometers) to the north in the direction of Hierapolis. Fragments of the aqueduct can be seen today, the conduit badly narrowed by thick deposits of calcium carbonate. A place with its water so exposed could scarcely stand a determined siege. The double conduit was buried, but it was not a secret that could be kept.</p>
<p>With the Roman peace, Laodicea lost all of its frontier character. Under Rome, the city grew in commercial importance. Cicero traveled that way in 51 <span class="era">BC</span> on his way to the provincial governorship of Cilicia, and the fact that he cashed drafts in Laodicea shows that the city had outgrown neighboring Colosse and was already a place of financial importance and wealth. One product was a glossy black wool, and the strain of long-haired black sheep bred for the trade were common until the 19th century. The wool was the basis of a textile industry centered in both Colosse and Laodicea. Various types of Laodicean garments are listed in Diocletian’s price-fixing edict of <span class="era">AD</span> 300, a copy of which recently came to light from neighboring Aphrodisias.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AFlockOfSheepWithSomeGoatsInLaodicea"/>
<p>Laodicea had a medical school. The names of its physicians appear on coins as early as the principate of Augustus. It was probably the medical school of Laodicea that developed the Phrygian eye powder, famous in the ancient world. It is a fair guess that this was the dried mud of the Hierapolis thermal springs, which could be mixed with water to form a kaolin poultice, an effective remedy for inflammation.</p>
<p>It can be readily seen how these features of the city provided the pattern for the scornful imagery of <a href="?bref=Rev.3.17-18">Revelation 3:17-18</a>: “You say, ‘I am rich. I have everything I want. I don’t need a thing!’ And you don’t realize that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. I advise you to buy gold from me—gold that has been purified by fire. Then you will be rich. And also buy white garments so you will not be shamed by your nakedness. And buy ointment for your eyes so you will be able to see” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The black garments exported all over the Mediterranean world, the famous eye ointment, and the city’s wealth form a basis for the writer’s stinging reproaches.</p>

<p class="h1">LASCIVIOUSNESS*</p>
<p class="fl">Extreme indulgence in sensual pleasures. Modern Bible translations commonly use the words “licentiousness,” “debauchery,” or “sensuality” instead. Lasciviousness occurs when the pursuit of pleasure is carried to the extreme of complete disregard for the integrity of others and for the environment.</p>
<p>Among biblical examples of lasciviousness are the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, who filled their lives with lawless deeds (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.7">2 Pt 2:7</a>); the false teachers, who promised freedom but were themselves slaves of corruption (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.2,18-19">2 Pt 2:2, 18-19</a>; compare <a href="?bref=Jude.1.4">Jude 4</a>); and the Gentiles, who were greedy to practice every kind of uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.19">Eph 4:19</a>). The apostle Paul used “lasciviousness” to refer to sexual excesses (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.13">Rom 13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.21">2 Cor 12:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19">Gal 5:19</a>), which is likely the word’s sense in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.22">Mark 7:22</a>.</p>

  <title>Last Days</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LAST DAYS</p>
<p class="fl">Expression used in Scripture to describe the final period of the world as we now know it. In the OT the last days are anticipated as the age of messianic fulfillment (see <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2">Is 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.4.1">Mi 4:1</a>), and the NT writers regard themselves as living in the last days, the era of the gospel. Thus, for example, Peter explains that the events of the Day of Pentecost are the fulfillment of <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Joel 2:28</a>: “In the last days, God said, I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. In those days I will pour out my Spirit upon all my servants, men and women alike, and they will prophesy” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.17-18">Acts 2:17-18</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The author of the letter to the Hebrews declares, “Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets. But now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son” (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-2">Heb 1:1-2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The last days, then, are the days of evangelical blessing in which the benefits of the salvation procured by the perfect life, death, resurrection, and glorification of Jesus Christ are freely available throughout the world. They are the days of opportunity for unbelievers to repent and turn to God, and of responsibility for believers to proclaim the gospel message throughout the world.</p>
<p>The plural “last days” gives the impression of a period of some duration, and the correctness of this impression is confirmed by the fact that this final age has already lasted for many centuries. But in the perspective of eternity it is no more than a short time, and in every generation the end of this final age is always imminent, so much so that John speaks of it as “the last hour.” To this the presence of antichrist even within the church of the apostolic period bears witness. “It is the last hour,” John says, “and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come; therefore we know that it is the last hour” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18">1 Jn 2:18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The end of these last days is always at hand, and one day it will certainly come; hence the need, insisted on by Christ, for constant vigilance, in view of the consideration that we know neither the day nor the hour of his return in majesty, the climactic event that will bring these last days to a close (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.44">Mt 24:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.13">25:13</a>).</p>
<p>This leads naturally to the further teaching that these last days will have their culmination in “the Day”: the last days will be terminated by the last day. The use of the term “day” in the singular corresponds in the NT to the concept of the “Day of the Lord” familiar in the OT, where it is generally presented as an awful day of final judgment against the unrepentant, but with the implication that it is also the day of the salvation and vindication of God’s people (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.2.12-22">Is 2:12-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.13.5">Ez 13:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.15">Jl 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.1,11">2:1, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-24">Am 5:18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.7,14">Zep 1:7, 14</a>). The climax of these last days, and therefore of all history, will be “the day of the Lord,” which will overtake the world suddenly (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.2">1 Thes 5:2</a>). This last of the last days will be the day of the last judgment for rejecters of the gospel, the purification of our present fallen world, the restoration of the created order, so that in the new heaven and the new earth all of God’s purposes in creation are brought to fulfillment. Then, at the consummation of our redemption, at last fully conformed to our Redeemer’s likeness, we will enter into the enjoyment of his eternal glory (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.19-25">Rom 8:19-25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.2">1 Jn 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-8">Rv 21:1-8</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, Christians are reminded by the apostle Paul that on this last day, which he calls simply “the Day,” the quality of their building will be revealed—i.e., what they have done with their lives will be known. It is not that the security of their salvation in Christ is in any way at stake; rather, it is to measure whether they will meet him with confidence or with shame at his coming (cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.28">1 Jn 2:28</a>). “Each man’s work will become manifest,” Paul writes; “for the Day will disclose it. . . . If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.13-15">1 Cor 3:13-15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>This last of the last days is followed by the everlasting day of Christ’s kingdom when God will be all in all (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.28">1 Cor 15:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.20-21">Phil 3:20-21</a>). The last day is also, accordingly, the day of triumph and resurrection, when Christ has promised to raise up everyone who believes in him (<a href="?bref=John.6.39-44,54">Jn 6:39-44, 54</a>). The last days are like night compared with the glory that will be revealed at Christ’s return, so that the end of these last days will also be the beginning of God’s unending day (see <a href="?bref=Rom.13.11-12">Rom 13:11-12</a>). The realization that we are in the last days and that the last day is approaching ought to have a dramatic effect on the quality and intensity of our living here and now (see <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.11-14">2 Pt 3:11-14</a>).</p>
<p>The last days, then, are the days of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. They are preliminary to and preparatory for the last day of final judgment of unbelievers and the dawn of eternal glory for believers. For Christ’s faithful followers they are days of joy and blessing, but still days in which the fullness of redemption is awaited. They are days, too, of trial and affliction for the church of Christ. But God has given us the assurance of his Spirit in our hearts, the foretaste that guarantees the full banquet hereafter, the down payment that pledges the payment in full (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.23">Rom 8:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.14">Eph 1:14</a>). Meanwhile, we should be assured with the apostle Paul that the sufferings of these last days are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.18">Rom 8:18</a>). They are days, moreover, of responsibility and opportunity: responsibility because Christians are under orders to proclaim the gospel throughout the world (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19-20">Mt 28:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.8">Acts 1:8</a>) and all people everywhere are commanded by God to repent (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.30">Acts 17:30</a>).</p>

  <title>Last Judgment*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LAST JUDGMENT*</p>
<p class="fl">Time at the end of history when God will judge the deeds of all humankind. In their preaching concerning the Day of the Lord, various OT prophets anticipated the time when God would wage war against all wicked nations and establish his rule in the eternal city of Zion (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.2">Is 4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.10">11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.50.3-32">Jer 50:3-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.1-3">Jl 2:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.9-16">3:9-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.5.18-20">Am 5:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.11">9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Zeph.1.7-18">Zep 1:7-18</a>). The NT writers continue this theme, restating it in the light of the words and work of Jesus. He has been appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.42">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.17.31">17:31</a>). Both believers and unbelievers must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive good or evil, according to what they have done with their lives (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.10">2 Cor 5:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.14.10">Rom 14:10</a>).</p>
<p>The focus of God’s judgment is human behavior. Those faithful to the covenant will prosper, but those who are disloyal will perish. The prophet Habakkuk identifies the righteous person as the one who is faithful (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.4">Hb 2:4</a>). NT writers state that one will be judged according to whether or not his deeds are pleasing to God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.10">2 Cor 5:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.20.12">Rv 20:12</a>). However, the NT also states that no one has met the perfect standards of God. All have sinned and therefore deserve to be punished (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.9,23">Rom 3:9, 23</a>). The issue to be determined at the time of judgment is not one’s guilt but rather whether or not one has been acquitted. The NT speaks of this acquittal as justification and reconciliation (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-28">3:21-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-21">5:1-21</a>). The means of acquittal is the death and resurrection of Christ, for Jesus’ act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all people (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.18">5:18</a>). The one who trusts in Christ is not condemned (<a href="?bref=John.3.16-18">Jn 3:16-18</a>) and can enter the Day of Judgment with confidence (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.17">1 Jn 4:17</a>). His name is written in the Lamb’s Book of Life (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.27">Rv 21:27</a>). The unbeliever must face the Day of Judgment with no assistance. He will be judged by what is written in the books; that is, by what he has done (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.11-12">20:11-12</a>).</p>

  <title>Latin</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LATIN</p>
<p class="fl">One of the primary languages of the Greco-Roman world. The supremacy of Rome, and the ramifications of its official relations with the people under its control, made the widespread use of Latin, Rome’s vernacular, inevitable. This led to a considerable Latin contribution to <span class="ital">koine</span> (common) Greek. From the beginning of the Roman sway in Greece, Roman politics and commerce contributed a constantly increasing number of Latin words to Greek.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="OldLatinTextOfGenesis"/>
<p>Traces of Latin in the NT are, therefore, not surprising. But Latin influence on NT Greek has left its mark mainly upon vocabulary, in the transliterated words and literally translated phrases. Latin was one of the three languages in which the inscription on the cross was written (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.38">Lk 23:38</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <a href="?bref=John.19.20">Jn 19:20</a>). Only in these two passages does the term “Latin” occur in the NT. Latin was the language of Roman law and court procedure. Greek might be allowed, but only by favor of the court. This explains why the superscription was written in Latin as well as Greek and Aramaic. Every educated Roman would understand Greek, but Latin was used as the official and military, as well as legal, language. This is reflected in the NT where Latin judicial and military terms occur, along with the names of coins, articles of apparel, utensils, and so on. For example, Latin words are used for farthing, denarius, centurion, colony, guard or watch, legion, towel, parchment, palace, assassin, napkin, and superscription. In addition, over 40 Latin names of persons, titles, and places occur in the NT. Among the better known are Agrippa, Claudius, Caesar, Felix, and Cornelius. <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">Romans 16</a> reveals that Latin proper names were common among Christians.</p>
<p>In Mark’s Gospel more Latin words, apart from proper names, occur than in other NT documents. This is to be expected if the Gospel were indeed written in Rome, but this is by no means established. The occurrence of numerous Latin words in this shortest of the four Gospels is not necessarily evidence of its Roman origin, because they are usually terms that the Roman government would make familiar in all parts of the empire. Also, Latinisms found in Mark’s Gospel are found in the other three Gospels. For example, Matthew uses Latin words for mile, tribute, guard or watch, and to take counsel. Because of the close grammatical affinity between Latin and Greek, the influence of the former upon the grammar of the latter is more difficult to trace.</p>
<p>For over 100 years after the founding of the Christian church, Greek dominated over Latin in Christian circles. The providential spread of common Greek made it possible for the church to use one Bible: the Greek OT. To freedmen and slaves, Latin was a foreign, and largely unknown, language. This explains why the earliest traces of a Latin translation of any part of the Scriptures are relatively late.</p>

The spring rains normally conclude the rainy season until the resumption of the fall (early) rains in October.

  <title>Laughter</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LAUGHTER</p>
<p class="fl">Expression of a variey of emotions. Laughter can express overjoyed happiness when circumstances change for the better, as for the Jews in returning from exile (<a href="?bref=Ps.126.2">Ps 126:2</a>). Such joy is sincerely but facilely offered to Job by one of his comforters (<a href="?bref=Job.8.21">Jb 8:21</a>). Laughter can be good-humored and friendly, to encourage others (<a href="?bref=Job.29.24">29:24</a>). There is “a time to cry and a time to laugh” (<a href="?bref=Eccl.3.4">Eccl 3:4</a>), but the Preacher had his doubts: life is no laughing matter, and sorrow can be a better teacher (<a href="?bref=Eccl.2.2">2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.7.3">7:3</a>). Yet it is good to be able not to take certain things seriously. The well-prepared housewife “laughs with no fear of the future” (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.25">Prv 31:25</a>). Job is promised that war and famine would be nothing to worry about (<a href="?bref=Job.5.22">Jb 5:22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Hab.1.9">Hb 1:9</a>).</p>
<p>Laughter can be a negative, derisive thing. We can laugh at people and laugh them to scorn. This element comes very much to the fore in the OT. Job and Jeremiah complain of being laughingstocks (<a href="?bref=Job.12.4">Jb 12:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.7">Jer 20:7</a>). The nation complains that their enemies laugh at their distress (<a href="?bref=Ps.80.6">Ps 80:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.30.10">2 Chr 30:10</a>). Sometimes there is every justification. In <a href="?bref=Ps.52.6">Psalm 52:6</a> the righteous are promised the last laugh, at the expense of the wicked unbeliever who thinks that he can leave God out of his life. In <a href="?bref=Pr.1.26">Proverbs 1:26</a>, personified Wisdom warns that she will laugh at the calamity of those who refuse to take her advice: it will serve them right. In this sense laughter is ascribed to God three times in the Psalter. He laughs at the nations plotting against his anointed King (<a href="?bref=Ps.2.4">Ps 2:4</a>). He laughs at wicked people, knowing they are heading for disaster (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.13">37:13</a>). He is invited to laugh at the psalmist’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Ps.59.8">59:8</a>). This divine laughter is a way of expressing that the truth will eventually prevail.</p>
<p>Laughter has a special place in the Abraham narratives. It is used in connection with the name of his son Isaac, which means “He laughs” or “May [God] smile [upon him].” Hebrew stories like to bring out the meaning of words, and so the human reaction to the birth of Isaac, the channel of God’s patriarchal promises, is described in terms of laughter. It is theologically important because it tends to be contrasted with faith. In <a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">Genesis 17:17</a> laughter is Abraham’s incredulous response to God’s unrealistic promise of a son, in view of Sarah’s elderliness. In <a href="?bref=Gen.18.12">Genesis 18:12</a> Sarah cannot smother her laughter as she eavesdrops—it seems so absurd that she will become pregnant in her 90s. But finally in <a href="?bref=Gen.21.6">Genesis 21:6</a>, when the impossible becomes true, Sarah’s laughter is a mark of God-given joy.</p>

<p class="fl">Basin filled with water that the priests used to wash their hands and feet before entering the Holy Place and before returning to serve at the altar (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.17-21">Ex 30:17-21</a>). In Solomon’s temple a large laver called the “molten sea” was placed between the altar of burnt offerings in the courtyard and the entrance to the inner temple. This consisted of the large basin and the pedestal on which it sat (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.18">Ex 30:18</a>); it was made of bronze or brass, melted and shaped from mirrors of highly polished metal given by Israelite women (<a href="?bref=Exod.38.8">38:8</a>).</p>
<p>In Solomon’s temple, in addition to the molten sea (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.23">1 Kgs 7:23</a>), there were ten smaller lavers, five on the north and five on the south sides of the sanctuary (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.38-39">1 Kgs 7:38-39</a>). Each held 40 baths (320–440 gallons, or 1,211.2–1,665.4 liters), one-fiftieth the capacity of the large laver. The lavishly decorated molten sea was used for the ablutions of the priests, while the ten lavers were no doubt used for the sacrifices (<a href="?bref=2Chr.4.6">2 Chr 4:6</a>). Later King Ahaz, possibly for religious or financial reasons, severed the lavers from their bases and the sea from its base, placing it on a stone pediment (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.17">2 Kgs 16:17</a>). The prophet Jeremiah, during King Jehoiakim’s reign, predicted that the molten sea and the bases would be carried into Babylon (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.19-22">Jer 27:19-22</a>), which in fact happened, according to <a href="?bref=Jer.52.17">Jeremiah 52:17</a>. No mention is made of the ten small lavers, which were perhaps already melted down and sold.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel’s description of the temple to come (<a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-42.20">Ez 40–42</a>), there is no mention of a laver or molten sea. The apostle John, however, in <a href="?bref=Rev.4.6">Revelation 4:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.15.2">15:2</a> mentions a “sea of glass,” perhaps reminiscent of Solomon’s molten sea.</p>

<p class="h2" id="HistoricalContext">Historical Context</p>
<p class="fl">When man was created in God’s image, he received glory, rule, and provision for his daily sustenance from the Creator-King (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.27-30">Gn 1:27-30</a>). However, in his exalted status as ruler over God’s creation on earth, man had to prove his loyalty to the Lord. For this purpose God set up a simple test: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Man was prohibited from eating the fruit of that tree (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.17">2:17</a>). His disobedience marked him as unfit for fellowship with the great King. He was rebellious and by nature full of treachery, as the subsequent accounts of Cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.1-16">4:1-16</a>), the generation of the Flood (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-13">6:1-13</a>), Ham and Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.18-26">9:18-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.10.6-20">10:6-20</a>), and the Tower of Babel (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-9">11:1-9</a>) demonstrate.</p>
<p>Yet in the midst of all this the Lord graciously called Abraham. He promised to bless him, his seed, and the families of the earth that would join in a common expression of faith (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2-3">Gn 12:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.4-7">17:4-7</a>). Abraham responded to God in faith (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">15:6</a>), willingly observed the ritual of circumcision as a sign of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.10">17:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.21.4">21:4</a>), and walked before God with integrity of heart (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">17:1</a>). Abraham subsequently learned that God had sovereignly and graciously chosen him with the purpose that Abraham’s family might distinguish itself from the nations “by doing righteousness and justice” (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.19">18:19</a>). The Lord was pleased with his servant Abraham, who, though he had not received detailed laws, was a man of integrity. His heart was right with God, so that he willingly did what God commanded.</p>
<p>The father of faith was the father of the faithful; the Lord testified that Abraham “obeyed me and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees and my laws” (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.5">Gn 26:5</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). His faith resulted in the fruits of righteousness (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.21-24">Jas 2:21-24</a>).</p>
<p>However, Israel, blessed by the Lord in the increase of descendants, the exodus, the crossing of the Red Sea, and his presence, did not respond to him in faith. They murmured and complained at Mt Sinai, at Kadesh-barnea, and in the plains of Moab. They proved themselves to be a rebellious and stiff-necked people (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.9">Ex 32:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.3,5">33:3, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.9">34:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.9.6,13">Dt 9:6, 13</a>). Though they had shown their character, the Lord was faithful to Abraham by covenanting himself to them. Israel became his people, his royal priesthood, his holy nation (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-6">Ex 19:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.26.18-19">Dt 26:18-19</a>). He gave Israel the Ten Commandments, the law, and the covenant, symbolized by the two tablets of the testimony (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.15-16">Ex 32:15-16</a>). Even after Moses had broken them in anger because of the people’s idolatrous worship of the golden calf, the Lord renewed his covenant by writing again the words of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.28">34:28</a>). On one hand, the context in which the law was given reflects God’s grace and forbearance with Israel’s sins (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">6-7</a>) and his determination to use Israel in the unfolding of his plan of redemption for the world. On the other hand, the context reflects Israel’s immaturity and stubbornness. Therefore, the law in the OT has positive and negative purposes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LawintheOldTestament">Law in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The OT has many words for God’s law. The most general word is <span class="hebrew">Torah</span><span class="ital">,</span> which signifies instruction of any kind: religious and secular, written and oral, divine and human. Law in Israel was God’s law, mediated through Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.19">Ex 20:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.23-27">Dt 5:23-27</a>). Because Israel rejected the direct revelation of God’s oracles, the law was mediated through Moses the servant of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.17">Jn 1:17</a>).</p>
<p>Synonyms for law are, in various translations, word (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.24.3">Ex 24:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.27">34:27</a>), judgment (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.24.3">Ex 24:3</a>), decree (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.30.16">Nm 30:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.1">Dt 4:1</a>), ordinance (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.9.12,14">Nm 9:12, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.2">Dt 6:2</a>), command(ment) (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.6.1,25">Dt 6:1, 25</a>), statutes (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.17">Lv 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.10.11">10:11</a>), precepts (a Hebrew word used only in Psalms; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.119.4,15,27,40,45,56,63,69,78,87,93,94,100,104,110,128,134,141,159,168,173">119:4, 15, 27, 40, 45, 56, 63, 69, 78, 87, 93, 94, 100, 104, 110, 128, 134, 141, 159, 168, 173</a>), stipulations, requirements, testimonies (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.4.45">Dt 4:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.20">6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.3">1 Kgs 2:3</a>), precept (a Hebrew term not in the Pentateuch; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.119.15">Ps 119:15</a>), or simply the “way(s)” (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.3">1 Kgs 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.21">Pss 18:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.25.9">25:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.37.34">37:34</a>).</p>
<p>These words form a semantic field, and it is far from easy to distinguish clearly among the various forms of laws. Generally “the words” pertain to the duties of man toward God, especially the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1">Ex 20:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.27">34:27</a>). The “judgments” contain civil regulations and duties to one’s fellows and to the social environment (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-23.9">21:1–23:9</a>); these are often in the form of “if . . . then. . . .” In Leviticus and in cultic formulations the word “ordinances” has the technical sense of cultic regulations—the ceremonial laws. However, in other contexts, especially in a series of synonyms for law, it signifies any expectation or regulation. The “commandments” are those regulations given by a higher authority. Though the OT has many words for law, the connotation of one word is often indistinguishable from that of other words, especially in series such as “the decrees and laws” (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.1,5">Dt 4:1, 5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.1">5:1</a>), “the commands, decrees and laws” (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.1">6:1</a>), “walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.3">1 Kgs 2:3</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p>The motivation for keeping the divine law lies in the acts and presence of the Lord. The prologue to the Decalogue reminds us of God’s mighty acts: “I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2">Ex 20:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In the historic acts of Israel’s redemption, revelation at Mt Sinai, and consecration of Israel to be his people, he involved himself with Israel as a “father.” He adopted Israel to sonship and consecrated them; that is, he declared them holy (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.31.13">31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.8">Lv 20:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.22.32">22:32</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.4">Rom 9:4</a>). Sometimes the two concepts of redemption and consecration are placed together, but whether they are or not, they are inseparable: “I am the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who makes you holy” (<a href="?bref=Lev.22.32">Lv 22:32b</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The ground of obedience can be stated simply by an appeal to God’s name: “I am Yahweh” (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.18.6,21,30">Lv 18:6, 21, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.10,14,16,18,28,30-31,34,36-37">19:10, 14, 16, 18, 28, 30-31, 34, 36-37</a>). The requisite of practical holiness is also based on the experience of God’s presence. The Lord commanded Israel to be holy because he is holy (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.44-45">Lv 11:44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">19:2</a>). The “holy one of Israel” dwelt in the midst of his people (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.8">Ex 25:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.29.45">29:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.5.3">Nm 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.35.34">35:34</a>).</p>
<p>How could rebellious Israel grasp what God required, if it were not by precise moral, social, civil, and cultic regulations? The Lord had observed that they did not have “the heart” to serve him as a covenant-loyal people (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.29">Dt 5:29</a>). By Israel’s very nature, it could not develop an adequate moral and cultic system to please God. Because of the people’s hardness of heart, God had to reveal (i.e., “spell out”) his will.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IsraeliteLawandtheAncientNearEast">Israelite Law and the Ancient Near East</p>
<p class="fl">Israel’s law reflected the practices of its ancient Near Eastern context. Ancient Babylonian law codes (Eshnunna, Hammurabi) show similarities with the biblical codes. The similarities go beyond similarity of cases and include legal formulations (casuistic law). Israelite law is distinct in that it is divine law. Moses is the mediator and not the promulgator of the law, as was the practice of a king who, like Hammurabi, put into force a legal code. The Lord himself gave Israel its laws (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.4.5-8">Dt 4:5-8</a>). The laws in the ancient Near East dealt with the ordering of society. But Israel’s laws were given to regulate every aspect of life: personal, familial, social, and cultic. The laws were to teach Israel to distinguish between holy and profane, between clean and unclean, and between just and unjust.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentLaws">Old Testament Laws</p>
<p class="fl">The legal corpus of the OT is not given in one book or in one section. Moreover, the laws reflect the development from the desert context (Exodus) to the context of the land (Deuteronomy). The OT legal material is complex, full of variations and duplications. It is found in Exodus (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-24.18">20–24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.25.1-31.18">25–31</a>), Leviticus, Numbers (chs <a href="?bref=Num.3.1-6.27">3–6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.8.1-10.36">8–10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.1-41">15</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.18.1-32">18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.19.1-22">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.1-30.16">28–30</a>), and Deuteronomy (chs <a href="?bref=Deut.5.1-26.19">5–26</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Ten Commandments</p>
<p class="fl">The commandments are simply designated as “the words” of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.1">Ex 20:1</a>). They appear in <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-17">Exodus 20:1-17</a> and in <a href="?bref=Deut.5.6-21">Deuteronomy 5:6-21</a>, but minor variations and individual commandments occur in other contexts (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.34.14,17,21">Ex 34:14, 17, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.1-8">Lv 19:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.15-16">Dt 27:15-16</a>). As a part of the covenant, the commandments were first addressed to Israel; they now form the basis of morality in Christianity. The abiding relevance of the moral law is clear from the NT. Our Lord established his authority as interpreter of all the commandments (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.17-48">Mt 5:17-48</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-14">12:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.23-24">23:23-24</a>). He summarized the law in terms of love for God and man (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.22.37-40">Mt 22:37-40</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.28-34">Mk 12:28-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.27">Lk 10:27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-9">Rom 13:8-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.14">Gal 5:14</a>). Since he is also the Lord of the Sabbath, the Sabbath cannot be divorced from the other commandments (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.8">Mt 12:8</a>). The apostle Paul also upheld the law, as his “ethics of the Spirit” reflects an internalization of the law of God in the hearts of believers (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-17">Rom 8:1-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-15.13">12:1–15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.6-16">1 Cor 2:6-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-8">5:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.23-11.1">10:23–11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.13-6.10">Gal 5:13–6:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.17-6.9">Eph 4:17–6:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.1-18">Phil 2:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4.6">Col 3:1–4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.1-12">1 Thes 4:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.12-24">5:12-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.3.6-15">2 Thes 3:6-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.3-10">1 Tm 6:3-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.1-11">Ti 3:1-11</a>).</p>
<p>The commandments were written on both sides of the two tablets by the Lord (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.15-16">Ex 32:15-16</a>). It is unclear whether the tablets were duplicate copies, how the commandments were divided, and how the commandments were numbered. They were kept in the ark of the covenant as a testimony to the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.20">40:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Book of the Covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.23-23.19">Ex 20:23–23:19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of the covenant code was to exemplify and to set into motion the legal machinery by which Israel as a nation could reflect God’s concern for justice, love, peace, and the value of life. The laws in the Book of the Covenant are mainly of the casuistic type. They regulate life in an agricultural society with servants, donkeys, bulls, oxen, sheep, and fields of grain. The regulations pertain to relations with women (including widows), aliens, orphans; to legal concerns (liability, damages, ownership); as well as to religious obligations (altar, Sabbath). Often the law requires restitution, but restitution is not the rule when human life is involved (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.12-29">Ex 21:12-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.22.2-3">22:2-3</a>), especially when it involves one’s family (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.15-17,22-25">21:15-17, 22-25</a>). The penal code attached to the case laws makes clear the value of human life, which is protected by the <span class="ital">lex talionis</span> (“law of retaliation”). The <span class="ital">lex talionis</span> does not point to a lack of forgiveness under the OT but rather was intended to be a legal principle giving coherence and justice to a society. The Book of the Covenant explicates by means of principles and cases how Israel must live together as a nation embracing the law of God and applying it <span class="ital">justly</span> (without discrimination or twisting of rights), <span class="ital">lovingly</span> (with a concern for the parties involved), and <span class="ital">peaceably.</span></p>
<p class="h3">The Priestly Law</p>
<p class="fl">God’s concern for holiness and purity comes to expression in the priestly laws (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.1-31.18">Ex 25–31</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.1-40.38">35–40</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-27.34">Lv 1–27</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.1-10.36">Nm 4–10</a>). The regulations pertain to the construction of the tabernacle, the consecration and ordination of priests, the offerings and sacrifices, rules of purity, the holy days, and vows.</p>
<p>The tabernacle was set in the middle of Israel’s camp in the wilderness. It symbolized the presence of God with his people. The priests and Levites were encamped around the tabernacle to serve and protect God’s holiness. All the tribes were situated around the tabernacle, and though the members of the tribes did not have access to all parts of the tabernacle, they had to be ritually clean to live in the camp. Anyone who was ritually defiled (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.46">Lv 13:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.5.1-3">Nm 5:1-3</a>) or had sinned grievously was put outside the camp (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.10-23">Lv 24:10-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.32-36">Nm 15:32-36</a>). This regulation even included objects that had become defiled (<a href="?bref=Lev.8.17">Lv 8:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.9.11">9:11</a>).</p>
<p>By means of prescribed offerings and sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-7.38">Lv 1–7</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.1-31">Nm 15:1-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.28.1-31">28</a>), God assured Israel, individually and corporately, of forgiveness when it had unwittingly sinned. The offerings and sacrifices concretely embodied the purpose of the offerer, whether forgiveness, dedication, or fellowship.</p>
<p>The priests and Levites taught the law of God (<a href="?bref=Deut.31.9-13">Dt 31:9-13</a>), applied its regulations, and served in courts (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.8-13">17:8-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Holiness Code (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.1-26.46">Lv 17–26</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The holiness code forms a significant part of the book of Leviticus. Here Moses addressed all of Israel (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.17.2">Lv 17:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.18.2">18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.2">20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.21.24">21:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.2">23:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.24.2">24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.2">25:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.26.46">26:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.27.2">27:2</a>).</p>
<p>The laws are in the form of prohibitions and direct commands. They pertain to the place of sacrifice and the prohibition of eating meat with blood in it (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.17.1-16">17</a>); the prohibition of sexual relations with specified family members (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">18</a>); and regulations promoting godliness, holiness, justice, and love in society (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.19.1-37">19</a>). The penal code applies penalties to those who sin against the regulations (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-27">20</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.24.10-23">24:10-23</a>). Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1-24.23">21–24</a> apply the cultic regulations to the priests and to all Israelites. The institutions of the sabbatical year and the Year of Jubilee regulate the remission of debts, freedom of people, and restitution of land (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-55">25</a>).</p>
<p>The holiness code spells out the qualities required of a holy people: devotion to God (offerings, sacrifices, priests) and love for man (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18b</a>) demonstrated in concern for justice, peace, freedom, the value of human life, and a concern for the family. Many of the laws reflect the spirit of the Decalogue (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.19.1-37">19</a>).</p>
<p>Both promises and curses are attached to the holiness code (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">26</a>). The curses predict exile as a consequence of breaking the laws. But always underlying the laws and penalties is the grace of the Lord, who promises freely to forgive the people’s sins and to renew the broken covenant (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.44-45">26:44-45</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Laws of Deuteronomy</p>
<p class="fl">The Deuteronomic laws are explications and new applications of the Book of the Covenant in view of Israel’s new historical situation. Israel was about to enter the Promised Land when Moses outlined to them the law of God (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.5">Dt 1:5</a>). The impersonal element of the Book of the Covenant is here transformed by personal appeal. Moses strongly appeals to Israel to be loyal to the Lord, the covenant, and the covenantal stipulations. The Deuteronomic laws envision the people in the land of promise, with a central sanctuary (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.5,11-18">12:5, 11-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.23">14:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.20">15:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.5-7,16,21">16:5-7, 16, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.8">17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.18.6">18:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.26.2">26:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.31.11">31:11</a>) and with a king (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">17:14-20</a>). The blessings and the curses motivate covenant loyalty (ch <a href="?bref=Deut.28.1-68">28</a>). However, Israel is also here assured that even if it breaks God’s law, the Lord remains gracious and forgiving.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposesoftheLaw">Purposes of the Law</p>
<p class="fl">The law revealed at Mt Sinai was intended to lead Israel closer to God. Rebellious though they were, God used the law as his righteous instrument to teach, in a very specific way, what sin is (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.5.20">Rom 5:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.7.7-8">7:7-8</a>) and how they should walk on a path that kept them undefiled by sin and holy to the Lord. The law was the teacher and the keeper of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.24">Gal 3:24</a>). The detailed explications of the laws in all areas of life (work, society, family, cult, and nation) had an important place in God’s dealings with Israel. Israel was a nation in a special land, with a theocratic government, and was in need of a legislative corpus. Moreover, Israel’s condition at Mt Sinai was such that it could not receive direct revelation. The revelation had to be mediated through Moses. It had to be set forth in detail because Israel had no intuitive grasp of what the revelation of God’s holiness, justice, righteousness, love, and forebearance required of them. They had adopted Egyptian ways and had to learn the divine will by revelation. However, Moses and the prophets emphasize that the purpose of the law is not strict adherence to the law for its own sake (legalism) or for a reward (Pharisaism). Keeping the law is an act of devotion to God, for the sake of God. Our Lord confirmed the purpose of the law: to establish a dynamic way of life in which one continually seeks God’s kingdom and his righteousness (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.33">Mt 6:33</a>).</p>
<p>The law of God is his means of sanctification. He consecrated Israel by an act of grace, and he required Israel to remain holy. Jesus confirmed those uses of the law whereby one may know his sinfulness and by which he may be driven to Christ. On the cross our Lord carried the penalties of the law, fulfilled in a greater way the tabernacle/temple presence of God, fulfilled the Father’s expectations of atonement, and demonstrated the love of the Father. He, the Son and greater than Moses, gave the essence of the law in the summary of God’s requirements: love of God and love of neighbor (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.23-24">Mt 23:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.42-44">Lk 11:42-44</a>). Jesus taught that the purpose of obedience is not primarily to receive a reward but to serve as salt (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.13">Mt 5:13</a>) and light (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.14-16">Mt 5:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.17-5.20">Eph 4:17–5:20</a>), and to bear fruit (<a href="?bref=John.15.1-17">Jn 15:1-17</a>). The purpose of the law of God is the gradual transformation of the children of God to reflect the image of the Son (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>), to be an imitation of the Father (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.1-2">Eph 5:1-2</a>), and to be filled with the Spirit of God (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.18,22-24">Gal 5:18, 22-24</a>). For this purpose Jesus gave us the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount, which summarize the intent of the teaching of Moses and the prophets (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">Mt 5–7</a>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the law is to transform regenerated believers into maturity. Spiritual maturity is not a privilege that was reserved for believers after Christ; OT saints also walked with God (Enoch, <a href="?bref=Gen.5.22-24">Gn 5:22-24</a>; Noah, <a href="?bref=Gen.6.9">6:9</a>; Abraham, <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">17:1</a>). These were mature men who lived with integrity in the presence of God (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">Gn 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.18.13">Dt 18:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.15.1-2">Pss 15:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.26">18:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.101.2,6">101:2, 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.119.80">119:80</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.5">Prv 11:5</a>).</p>
<p>Maturity, or integrity, is that response to God whereby the believer no longer needs to live by individual stipulations or in fear of mistakes and sins of omission, but delights in doing the Lord’s will (<a href="?bref=Ps.1.2">Pss 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.1">112:1</a>). Since the coming of Christ and Pentecost, the Holy Spirit has been poured out on every believer. He has come not only to internalize the law of God (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.33">Jer 31:33</a>) but also to help us develop Christian maturity by giving the fruits of godliness in greater fullness (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22-24">Gal 5:22-24</a>). Whereas maturity and freedom were experienced by some OT saints, it is God’s gift to all his children in Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.39">Acts 2:39</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Cor 12:13</a>). The purpose is still the same, “so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped [mature] for every good work” (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.17">2 Tm 3:17</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>), but the means to accomplish this and the status of the child of God is so much better since Pentecost.</p>

<p class="h1">LAZARUS</p>
<p class="list">1. Lazarus the beggar. In one of Jesus’ most familiar parables (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>), he contrasted the earthly circumstances of a beggar named Lazarus with that of a nameless rich man. From the adjective for “rich” in the Latin Vulgate, the rich man came to be called in English “Dives.” The rich man relished the luxury of his wealth, while he ignored an ulcerated blind beggar lying at his gate. Jesus said that Lazarus died and went to Abraham’s bosom, while Dives suffered everlasting torment.</p>
<p class="list-text">The parable of Lazarus has been misinterpreted sometimes as a condemnation of wealth instead of a warning against enjoyment of wealth without regard for the poor. It teaches that decisions in the present life determine eternal destiny.</p>
<p class="list-text">In no other parable did Jesus identify a character by name. Some Bible students have therefore concluded that he was telling a true story. The name’s symbolism, however, seems to account for its use, since Lazarus was cast in the role of one “whom God helped.” In the Middle Ages the beggar Lazarus was venerated as the patron saint of lepers. Leper hospitals were called lazar-houses.</p>
<p class="list">2. Lazarus of Bethany. Jesus performed the most spectacular of all his miracles (excluding his own resurrection) when he restored Lazarus of Bethany to life four days after death. Lazarus lived with his two sisters, Mary and Martha. They were among Jesus’ most intimate friends (<a href="?bref=John.11.3-5,36">Jn 11:3-5, 36</a>). On several occasions he visited in their home, which also served as his headquarters during his final week on earth (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.17">Mt 21:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.38-42">Lk 10:38-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.1-12.11">Jn 11:1–12:11</a>). Lazarus was at the banquet in Jesus’ honor when Mary anointed Jesus’ feet with costly ointment (<a href="?bref=John.12.1-3">Jn 12:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The raising of Lazarus, the climax of the signs in John’s Gospel, receives the fullest treatment of Jesus’ miracles. It produced three notable results: (1) many Jews in the vicinity of Jerusalem believed in Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.11.45">Jn 11:45</a>) and some weeks later escorted him into the city (<a href="?bref=John.12.17-18">12:17-18</a>); (2) the Jewish leaders, hardened in their rejection of Jesus, resolved that he must die (<a href="?bref=John.11.53">11:53</a>); (3) those leaders also plotted Lazarus’s death (<a href="?bref=John.12.10-11">12:10-11</a>). The miracle not only showed Jesus’ power over death but set the stage for his own resurrection.</p>

<p class="h1">LEAH</p>
<p class="fl">Laban’s daughter, the wife of Jacob, and the older sister of Rachel.</p>
<p>After deceiving his father, Isaac, into giving him the blessing intended for Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.5-40">Gn 27:5-40</a>), Jacob left home and went to his uncle Laban (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.43">27:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.2">28:2</a>) in distant Mesopotamia, in order to find a wife (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.46-28.2">27:46–28:2</a>) and escape the revenge of Esau, who had determined to kill him (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.41-42">27:41-42</a>). Here he fell in love with his cousin Rachel and arranged with her father to marry her in exchange for seven years of work (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.17-18">29:17-18</a>). When the time for the wedding feast came, Laban deceived Jacob in an apparent scheme to keep his services for seven more years; he gave Leah instead of Rachel to Jacob on the wedding night (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.29.21-25">21-25</a>). His lame excuse that custom required the giving of the older daughter in marriage before the younger (v <a href="?bref=Gen.29.26">26</a>) was hardly appropriate at that point and certainly should have been explained from the beginning. Leah is described as “weak-eyed,” perhaps to be understood as “dull-eyed,” in contrast with Rachel, who is described as “beautiful and lovely” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.29.17">17</a>).</p>
<p>Jacob’s love for Rachel (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.20">Gn 29:20</a>) induced him to agree to work for another seven years in order to receive her also as his wife. Because of the intense rivalry between the two sisters and Jacob’s favoring of Rachel, the Lord blessed Leah with six sons and a daughter (Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dinah) before Rachel was given any children (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.31-30.22">29:31–30:22</a>). This barrenness became a great burden for Rachel over the years. At one point she bargained with Leah for mandrakes, a plant believed to ensure conception, in exchange for conjugal rights. The result was to increase her sister’s advantage, however, because Leah conceived and bore her fifth son, Issachar (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.14-17">30:14-17</a>).</p>
<p>Leah was given the honor of being the mother of the two tribes that played the most significant roles in the history of the nation of Israel. The tribe of Levi became the tribe of the priesthood. The tribe of Judah became the tribe of royalty through which the promised seed (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.15">Gn 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.12.2-3">12:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.16">2 Sm 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>) ultimately came in the person of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="h1">LEATHER</p>
<p class="fl">Prepared animal hide, used extensively in Bible times for a wide variety of purposes. It was used as clothing in early times (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.21">Gn 3:21</a>). At the beginning of the period of the prophets, their raiment, made from animal skins, became a means of identifying them (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.8">2 Kgs 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.4">Zec 13:4</a>). Elijah’s mantle (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.13,19">1 Kgs 19:13, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.8,13-14">2 Kgs 2:8, 13-14</a>) is described in the Greek OT as sheepskin. Animal skins were also used to make shoes (<a href="?bref=Ezek.16.10">Ez 16:10</a>), girdles (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.4">Mt 3:4</a>), and other articles of clothing (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.48">Lv 13:48</a>).</p>
<p>Some household utensils were made of leather. The most common was the container for holding liquids, such as milk (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.19">Jgs 4:19</a>), wine (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.22">Mk 2:22</a>), and water (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.14">Gn 21:14</a>). Oil, extracted from olives, then purified and refined, was also stored in skins, until required for cooking, toiletry, or medicinal purposes, or as fuel for lamps. In all probability leather was used for beds, chairs, and other household articles. There is no reference to leather being used to make tents, but animal skins were employed in the construction of the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.5">Ex 25:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.8">Nm 4:8</a>). Clearly, the references are to tanned skins. Their use would ensure that the roof was waterproof.</p>
<p>The Bible is silent concerning the use of leather for making armor or weapons; however, it would be a natural choice for helmets and shields for defense, slings for offense, and quivers to hold arrows. Rubbing oil into the surface of shields, presumably to keep them from becoming brittle and therefore useless, is referred to in <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.21">2 Samuel 1:21</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.21.5">Isaiah 21:5</a> and points to their being made of leather. A painting in the tomb of an Egyptian nobleman from about 1900 <span class="era">BC</span> supplements the meager knowledge that the Bible provides concerning the use of leather in OT times. In the painting the men wear sandals and the women boots. A leather water bottle is strapped to one man’s back. Another, an archer, carries a quiver on his back. The asses are carrying objects that have been identified as two pairs of goatskin bellows.</p>
<p>Leather was used extensively as writing material, but early on almost wholly in Egypt. There, parchment, also derived from animal hides, has a very ancient history. The difference between leather and parchment is that the former is tanned, whereas the latter is produced by treating the skins with solutions of lime, salt, or dyes, scraping off the hair on one side and the flesh on the other, stretching and drying them in a frame, then rubbing them with a pumice stone to produce smooth surfaces on both sides. The use of prepared skins for writing material was known before 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> in Egypt, but according to Pliny, the term “parchment” did not come into use until about 160 <span class="era">BC</span> in other areas.</p>
<p>No leather documents have been recovered from Assyria or Babylonia, probably because leather was used much less extensively there than elsewhere in the ancient East. Middle East literary allusions point to its having come into use there at a later period. The term “parchment” is not found before the Persian period, and the phrase “written on parchment” does not occur before the early years of the Seleucids (312–64 <span class="era">BC</span>). Even then papyrus was the chief writing material.</p>
<p>Another leather product, vellum, is fine parchment made from calf, kid, lamb, or antelope skins. In Rome, from the first century <span class="era">BC</span> through the second century <span class="era">AD</span>, vellum was in restricted use. Not until the third and fourth centuries did vellum prevail. It was at this time that the celebrated Codex Vaticanus and the Codex Sinaiticus were produced. The whole Bible now could be gathered into a single codex, which was in the form of a modern book with folded sheets, whereas previously a set of from 30 to 40 rolls of papyrus would be required for the Bible. Vellum also allowed for the palimpsest, from which the original writing could be erased and written upon again.</p>
<p>In the OT leather or skins are not mentioned in connection with writing. Books in roll form are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Ps.40.7">Psalm 40:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-32">Jeremiah 36</a>, and <a href="?bref=Ezek.2.9-3.3">Ezekiel 2:9–3:3</a>, but these were probably papyrus. Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the earliest reference to Jews using parchment or leather as writing material is found in Josephus, toward the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>. However, we now know that around 100 <span class="era">BC</span> parchment was used by Jews. The Talmud requires the Law to be written on skins of clean animals, a regulation that still stands for books to be used in the synagogue, but it is not certain that this points to an ancient tradition.</p>
<p>Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were written on leather. For example, the great scroll of Isaiah, written about 100 <span class="era">BC</span>, consists of 17 sheets sewn together into a length of almost 23 feet (7 meters). The autographs of the NT were probably written on papyrus. Certainly John wrote his second letter on papyrus (<a href="?bref=2Jn.1.12">2 Jn 1:12</a>) within the last quarter of the first century.</p>
<p>Tanning is not mentioned in the OT, but it is implied in <a href="?bref=Exod.25.5">Exodus 25:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.13.48">Leviticus 13:48</a>. The possible use of skins of unclean animals and the constant contact with dead bodies made tanning an unclean trade, and it was forbidden in the city. However, the preparation of skins for parchment was considered an honorable calling.</p>

  <title>Leaven*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LEAVEN*</p>
<p class="fl">Any substance that produces fermentation when added to dough. Leaven may signify the dough already infected by leaven, which was put into the flour so that the leaven could pass through the entire mass before baking, or it may refer to dough that had risen through the influence of the leaven. The early Hebrews apparently depended on a piece of leavened dough for transmission of the leaven; not until much later were the lees of wine used as yeast.</p>
<p>The ancient Israelites regularly ate leavened bread (<a href="?bref=Hos.7.4">Hos 7:4</a>), but in the commemoration of the Passover they were forbidden to eat leavened bread or even to have it in their homes during the Passover season (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.7">Ex 13:7</a>). This annual observance ensured that the people would not forget their hasty exodus from Egypt, when God’s command gave no time for the preparation of leavened bread. The people were forced to carry with them their kneading troughs and the dough from which they baked unleavened cakes to sustain them as they journeyed (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.34-39">Ex 12:34-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.3">Dt 16:3</a>).</p>
<p>Possibly because fermentation implied disintegration and corruption, leaven was excluded from all offerings placed on the altar to be sacrificed to God (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.18">Ex 23:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.25">34:25</a>). It was also not permitted in grain offerings (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.11">Lv 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.17">6:17</a>). Scripture does not tell us whether or not the showbread (or bread of the Presence) was unleavened, but the historian Josephus states that it was leavened (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 3.6.6).</p>
<p>Two exceptions to this rule should be noted. Leaven could be used in offerings that were to be eaten by the priests or others. Leavened bread could accompany the peace offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.13">Lv 7:13</a>), and it was sacrificed at the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) because it represented the ordinary daily food that God provided for his people (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.17">23:17</a>).</p>
<p>The slow working of the leaven proved to be a problem during the agricultural stage of Hebrew development, especially during the first busy days of harvest. Unleavened dough, therefore, became increasingly common for ordinary baking. This practice was encouraged by the growth of the idea that leaven represented decay and corruption, as did other fermented things. This view excluded leaven as inconsistent with the concept of the perfect holiness of God. Plutarch was expressing a long-held belief current also among other peoples when he wrote, “Now leaven is itself the offspring of corruption and corrupts the mass of dough with which it has been mixed.” The apostle Paul quotes a similar proverb in <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.6">1 Corinthians 5:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Gal.5.9">Galatians 5:9</a>.</p>
<p>The significant thing about leaven is its power, which may symbolize either good or evil. Usually, though not always, leaven was a symbol of evil in rabbinic thought. Jesus referred to leaven in the adverse sense when he used the word to describe the corrupt doctrine of Pharisees and Sadducees (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.6,11-12">Mt 16:6, 11-12</a>) and of Herod (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.15">Mk 8:15</a>). The leaven of the Pharisees is elsewhere identified as hypocrisy (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.1">Lk 12:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.23.28">Mt 23:28</a>).</p>
<p>Paul applies the same concept to moral corruption, warning that “a little leaven leavens the whole lump” and admonishing his readers to clean out the old leaven, that is, the vestiges of their unregenerate lives, and to live the Christian life with the “unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.6-8">1 Cor 5:6-8</a>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Christ uses the concept of leaven’s effect upon dough in its good sense to provide his disciples with a brief but memorable parable (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.33">Mt 13:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.20-21">Lk 13:20-21</a>), wherein leaven illustrates the cumulative, pervasive influence of the kingdom of God on the world.</p>

  <title>Lebanon</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LEBANON</p>
<p class="fl">Region mentioned only in the OT, although its towns, including Tyre and Sidon, are named in the NT. The name Lebanon generally refers to the double range of mountains that commences near Tyre and runs northeast following the Mediterranean coast. The two Lebanon ranges are parallel to one another, Lebanon to the west and Anti-Lebanon to the east. The name Lebanon is derived from the Hebrew root <span class="hebrew">l-b-n</span><span class="ital">,</span> meaning “white,” which may reflect either the white limestone of the mountains or the snow that lay on the mountains for six months of the year (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.14">Jer 18:14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">At the southern end the Lebanon ranges are a direct continuation of the hills of northern Galilee, with Mt Hermon (Sirion, Senir) very prominent in the Anti-Lebanon range, rising to 9,230 feet (2,813.3 meters). The two ranges are divided by a broad valley, the valley of Lebanon (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.17">Jos 11:17</a>) or “the entrance of Hamath” (<a href="?bref=Num.34.8">Nm 34:8</a>), the modern Beqa’a.</p>
<p>In the south the Lebanon range is separated from the Galilee hills by a deep east-west gorge through which the Litani River flows, entering the Mediterranean just north of Tyre. In its upper courses it follows the Beqa’a Valley in a northeasterly direction almost to Baalbek. The Lebanon ridge, about 100 miles (160.9 kilometers) long, stretches north to the east-west valley of the Nahr el-Kebir and is marked by a series of peaks. In the south are Gebel Rihan, Tomat, and Gebel Niha (ranging from 5,350 feet to nearly 6,230 feet, or 1,636.7 to 1,898.9 meters, high) east of Sidon. In the center lie Gebel Baruk, Gebel Kuneiyiseh, and Gebel Sunnin (7,220 feet, 6,890 feet, and 8,530 feet high, or 2,200.7 meters, 2,100.1 meters, and 2,599.9 meters high, respectively) east of Beirut. Further north, to the east of Tripoli, lies Qurnet es-Sauda, which reaches 9,840 feet (2,999.2 meters), and Qurnet Aruba, about 7,320 feet (2,231.1 meters) high.</p>
<p>These high mountains trap the rain coming from the Mediterranean, providing both the mountain areas and the coastal strip below with good rainfall; beyond the mountains, the rainfall drops. It is along the coastal strip between the mountains and the sea that the Phoenicians flourished and towns like Tyre, Zarephath, Sidon, Berytus (Beirut), Byblos (Gebal), and Tripoli were established. The coastal area has a number of headlands that are extensions of the mountain range. The coastal road had to be cut around or through these spurs. A good example is the headland of Nahr el-Kelb, a little to the north of Beirut.</p>
<p>On the east side of the Lebanon range is the Beqa’a Valley. The Orontes River rises in the north of this valley and flows north to enter the Mediterranean north of ancient Ugarit. This whole valley region was known in classical literature as Coele-syria (Hollow Syria). It was the “breadbasket” of the Romans.</p>
<p>To the east of the Beqa’a Valley is the Anti-Lebanon range, in which the Barada River rises and flows east toward the fertile oasis of Damascus. Mt Hermon, in the southern part of the range, was known as Sirion by the Phoenicians and Senir by the Amorites (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.9">Dt 3:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Resources">Resources</p>
<p class="fl">Lebanon was famous in antiquity for its rich forests of fir and cedar. The coastal areas, the Beqa’a Valley, and the lower slopes of the mountains were suitable for olive trees, fruit trees, and vineyards, as well as some grain crops. One important product came from the sea: a mollusk of the gastropoda class from which a red or purple dye was obtained. The name “Phoenician” derived from the Greek <span class="greek">phoinos</span><span class="ital">,</span> red-purple. Wool dyed purple was available in Ugarit about 1500 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Phoenicians had a monopoly on this industry for centuries. The people of Israel, who used a great deal of purple dye in their tabernacle furnishings (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.1-37">Ex 26</a>) and the garments of their priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.4-6">Ex 28:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.39.1,28-29">39:1, 28-29</a>), probably obtained the dye from the Phoenicians.</p>
<p>King Solomon had significant trading relations with Phoenicia. To build the temple in Jerusalem, cedar and fir were obtained from Hiram I of Tyre (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.6,9,14">1 Kgs 5:6, 9, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.2">7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.17,21">10:17, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.8,16">2 Chr 2:8, 16</a>). Solomon paid for this timber in wheat and olive oil (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.11">1 Kgs 5:11</a>). The trees were floated down by sea to a point in Solomon’s domain and transported from there to Jerusalem. Cedar and fir trees from Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon provided ships for Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.5">Ez 27:5</a>), sacred barges and furniture for Egypt, and timber for building the second temple in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.7">Ezr 3:7</a>).</p>
<p>From the ports of Lebanon, the Phoenicians traded with many lands. They mastered the art of shipbuilding, and their ships were used in peace and in war. A vivid picture of the trading activities of traders from Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, and Arvad is given in <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.1-36">Ezekiel 27</a>, where the extent and nature of their trade is given in considerable detail.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">The area became of interest to the Egyptians during the fourth dynasty (c. 2600 <span class="era">BC</span>) when Pharaoh Snofru acquired 40 shiploads of cedar from Lebanon. Byblos fell under Egyptian influence during the 12th dynasty (c. 1980–1800 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Egyptians gave golden ornaments in exchange for cedar. During the 18th dynasty (c. 1552–1306 <span class="era">BC</span>), Egypt conquered Syria, and the records speak regularly of cedar being taken as tribute. Later an envoy of Ramses XI named Wenamon paid dearly for the cedar (c. 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>When Egyptian power waned, the Assyrians controlled the area and took vast quantities of cedar as tribute from the days of Tiglath-pileser I (c. 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>) onward. Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian nation likewise controlled Lebanon and took away large quantities of cedar to build temples and palaces. The spoiling of Lebanon’s forests was spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.8">Is 14:8</a>) and Habakkuk (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.17">Hb 2:17</a>). In later centuries Lebanon passed successively under the domination of Persians, Greeks, and Romans.</p>
<p>In NT times the towns of Tyre and Sidon are generally coupled together (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.21">Mt 15:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.8">Mk 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.24,31">7:24, 31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.17">Lk 6:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.13-14">10:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.20">Acts 12:20</a>), though sometimes they are referred to alone (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.3,7">Acts 21:3, 7</a>). A Greek woman who was a Syro-Phoenician is referred to in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.26">Mark 7:26</a>. Jesus preached in these areas during his ministry. In biblical poetry the tall cedars of Lebanon were a symbol of majesty and strength (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.15">Jgs 9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.9">2 Kgs 14:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.92.12">Pss 92:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.16">104:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.2">Is 35:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.13">60:13</a>). They were also a symbol of earthly pride that would be broken before the wrath of God one day (<a href="?bref=Ps.29.5">Ps 29:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.2.13">Is 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.34">10:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.22.6">Jer 22:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.3">Ez 31:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">LEGION</p>
<p class="fl">A unit of the Roman army. In NT times the standard size of the legion was 6,000 men, to which some 120 cavalry were added.</p>
<p>Because it represented a large body of men, the word “legion” came to be used symbolically for an indefinitely large number; this use occurs four times in the NT. In the story about the demoniac in the country of the Gerasenes, Jesus asked the man, “What is your name?” and the reply was, “My name is Legion, for we are many” (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.9,15">Mk 5:9, 15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.30">Lk 8:30</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.12.45">Mt 12:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.2">Lk 8:2</a>, which speak of a number of demons possessing a single individual).</p>
<p>Another use of the word is in <a href="?bref=Matt.26.53">Matthew 26:53</a>, where at the time of Jesus’ arrest one of those with him drew his sword to defend his Master. Jesus forbade such action, saying, “Don’t you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands [legions] of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly?” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>; see mg). Thus he spoke of the vast number of angels that could be summoned to his aid.</p>
<p>The word “legion” is never used in the NT in its military sense, but either of the spiritual powers of evil that oppose men (cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Eph 6:12</a>) or of the spiritual powers that can be summoned to their aid (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.1.14">Heb 1:14</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">LEPER, LEPROSY</p>
<p class="fl">One afflicted with a chronic infectious disease caused by <span class="ital">Mycobacterium leprae,</span> a bacterium similar to the tuberculosis bacillus. The disease is manifested by changes in the skin, mucous membranes, and peripheral nerves. In the skin there are often patches of depigmentation but rarely a total loss of pigment, so a pure white patch of skin is definitely not characteristic of leprosy. Loss of sensation to touch and temperature is frequently associated with the depigmented patches. Thickening of the skin and nodule formation cause the lionlike facial appearance commonly associated with leprosy. Peripheral nerve involvement may cause paralysis of a hand, leg, or face, or it may cause loss of sensation so complete that serious injury or ulceration to an extremity may occur without the afflicted person knowing it. The eyes, ears, and nose are also frequently involved. An effective, though prolonged, treatment has been developed, and sometimes spontaneous arrest may occur. The disease is spread through prolonged contact with an individual having leprosy. Children are more susceptible than adults, but in any case the transmissibility is low.</p>
<p>The early history of leprosy is shrouded in uncertainty. Possible references to leprosy have been cited in ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, and Indian writings, but authorities disagree over whether the records refer to modern leprosy. The ambiguity in these early records is significant because it limits the help they might give toward our understanding of the meaning of “leprosy” in the OT.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-59">Leviticus 13</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.14.1-57">14</a> contain the most details about what is called “leprosy” in the Scriptures (in traditional versions such as the <span class="sc">kjv</span> and <span class="sc">rsv</span>). However, careful study of the descriptions of the disease given in these passages strongly suggests that what is now called leprosy is not the skin disease described in Leviticus. If a priest today used the criteria given in these verses, he would probably declare many leprosy patients unclean, but he would also pronounce unclean many individuals with a variety of other skin conditions. The disease we call leprosy (or Hansen’s disease) does not fit the description given in Leviticus. The white hairs referred to so frequently in these verses are not typical of leprosy and may be found in many skin diseases. A white patch of skin is not characteristic of leprosy, nor is the scalp ordinarily affected. A 7- to 14-day period is usually inadequate to observe changes in the disease. If modern leprosy is being described in these verses, it seems strange that the more obvious characteristics of the disease are not mentioned. The bacillus of leprosy has defied attempts by bacteriologists to cultivate it, so leprosy of garments or houses is most unlikely to occur. Therefore, biblical leprosy is not synonymous with modern leprosy. Consequently, modern versions do not use the word “leprosy” in <a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-59">Leviticus 13</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.14.1-57">14</a>; rather, it is rendered as “contagious skin disease” in the <span class="sc">nlt</span> and “infectious skin disease” in the <span class="sc">niv</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT there is no description of the disease referred to as leprosy, so again we cannot be certain whether it is the modern disease or not. Modern leprosy was known to the people of that day, but it is doubtful whether they were always able to accurately distinguish it from other skin conditions. The Greek word translated “leprosy” in the NT basically means “scaly.” The Greeks used it to designate psoriasis-like skin conditions, and they referred to leprosy by the word we translate as “elephantiasis,” a word not found in the NT. Confusion concerning the use of the word “leprosy” extends even to the Middle Ages, leaving historians uncertain at times concerning the historical spread of the disease. When we read in the NT that Christ cleansed lepers, we know only that he healed chronic skin conditions considered to be defiling.</p>
<p>The attitude of Jesus toward those afflicted with leprosy was in marked contrast to that of the rabbis of his day. One rabbi would not eat an egg purchased in a street where there was someone with leprosy. Another rabbi threw stones at lepers in order to keep them away. But Jesus touched a man with leprosy, thereby demonstrating his power to overcome uncleanness as represented by leprosy (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.3">Mt 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.41-42">Mk 1:41-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.12-13">Lk 5:12-13</a>).</p>

  <title>Letter of Jeremiah</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LETTER OF JEREMIAH</p>
<p class="fl">The Letter of Jeremiah is a book accepted as part of the Deuterocanonical works. It was originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic by an unknown Jewish author. The work is no longer extant in the original but has come down to us in the Greek Septuagint. The book cannot be clearly dated; most scholars agree that the Letter was composed between the third and first centuries <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The Letter aims at demonstrating the folly of idolatry. Its claim to have been written by Jeremiah to the captives in the Babylonian exile is spurious. Rather, it was written by a pious Jew for Jews who, living in the Diaspora, were challenged by the dangers of idolatry—“So take care not to become at all like the foreigners. . . . But say in your heart, ‘It is thou, O Lord, whom we must worship’ ” (Letter of Jeremiah 6:5-6). Ridicule is heaped on the gods made by craftsmen out of raw materials. The idols tarnish and may easily be burned up in a fire. They collect dust, are blackened by the smoke of the temple, and are a resting place for animals. They cannot speak and are impotent to protect themselves against offenders and pillagers. They cannot see the lamps lighted in the temples. The idols cannot receive the sacrifices brought by the devotees and are also not in a position to bless or help those who believe in them. Since the idols are frauds, fashioned by craftsmen, they are incapable of providing people’s needs and of delegating divine authority to kings. The Letter concludes with several comparisons: the idol’s protection is likened to a scarecrow in a plot of cucumbers and to a thornbush in a garden, or to a corpse cast out in the dark (vv 70-71).</p>
<p>The Letter was printed as chapter <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Bar.6.1-72">6</a> of the book of Baruch in the Latin Vulgate. <span class="ital">See also</span> <a href="?item=BaruchBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Baruch, Book of</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">LETTER WRITING*, Ancient</p>
<p class="fl">A communication, especially from a king or high official, usually containing commands, promulgations, or reports. There are letters extant from Arad-Nana, the royal physician, to his master Ashurbanipal on the matter of the monarch’s spondylitis and a young prince’s eye trouble. The famous Amarna letters are reports and appeals from petty subject princes in Palestine disturbed over the weakness of Pharaoh Akhnaton’s foreign policy in the area. There is a tantalizing letter from Tutankhamen’s widow to a Hittite king on the subject of a marriage arrangement.</p>
<p>Examples of OT letters are David’s deadly letter to Joab about Uriah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.14-15">2 Sm 11:14-15</a>), Jezebel’s equally evil letter over Ahab’s forged signature to the elders of Jezreel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.8-9">1 Kgs 21:8-9</a>), and the Syrian king’s letter to the king of Israel about Naaman’s leprosy (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.5-7">2 Kgs 5:5-7</a>). All these are reported in the OT record without the customary greetings and the polite forms of address. In Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.11-23">Ezr 4:11-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.7-17">5:7-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.11-26">7:11-26</a>), Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.5-7">Neh 6:5-7</a>), and Jeremiah, correspondence appears that purports to be the full text. Commonly there is paraphrase, abbreviation, or mere report of content (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.8">Neh 2:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.9.20-31">Est 9:20-31</a>).</p>
<p>Official communications in letter form like those noted in the OT are found in the Egyptian papyri. For example, there is the letter of Claudius sent in <span class="era">AD</span> 42 to the turbulent Alexandrians about the Jewish problem in that city. A circular letter of the early second century <span class="era">AD</span> from the governor of Egypt about the approaching census, and highly relevant to the story of the Nativity, is known. The letters of Cicero provide invaluable information on the stormy period in which senatorial rule ended and the Roman Empire was established. The letters of Pliny show Roman society at its best at the turn of the first century of the Christian era, when the writer was governor of Bithynia, and they give much information about the first clash between the state and the church.</p>
<p>Ancient correspondence throws vivid light on common life and the mundane occupations of ordinary people in Greco-Roman times and the early Christian centuries in a manner only to be paralleled in the documents of the NT. It provides background, illustration, comment, and sometimes direct historical evidence—as, for example, the letter file of the leader of the second rebellion of the Jews (<span class="era">AD</span> 132–35), Bar-Kochba. A cache of Bar-Kochba’s letters and campaign documents was discovered in a cave by the Dead Sea. In one letter he orders, “Whatever Elisha says, do.” Another orders the arrest of Tahnun ben Ishmael and the confiscation of his wheat. Another calls for punishment of some who had repaired their homes in defiance of some scorched-earth policy.</p>
<p>Paul observed, with some care, the forms of letter writing common in his day. There is an opening word of salutation, followed by thanksgiving and prayer for the person or company addressed. Then comes the special subject of communication, greetings to friends, and perhaps a closing word of prayer. Here is a second-century letter that shows strikingly the Pauline style in brief:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">Ammonous to her sweetest father, greeting. When I received your letter and recognized that by the will of the gods you were preserved, I rejoiced greatly. And as at the same time an opportunity here presented itself, I am writing you this letter being anxious to pay my respects. Attend as quickly as possible to the matters that are pressing. Whatever the little one asks shall be done. If the bearer of this letter hands over a small basket to you, it is I who sent it. All your friends greet you by name. Celer greets you and all who are with him. I pray for your health.</p>
<p class="sp">In subject matter Paul ranges from delicate irony over Corinthian pretensions to stern rebuke for heresy, and from news of friends to some precious books and the warm cloak he left at Troas.</p>
<p>The NT letters continue and adapt a mode of didactic correspondence that can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle, except that the NT writers address themselves to groups or communities (Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, Ephesians, Colossians, Thessalonians, Hebrews), to the church at large (the letters of Peter, Jude, James, and John’s first epistle), or to individuals or a specific Christian community. The apostolic letter recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> may have inspired this practice. <a href="?bref=Rev.2.1-29">Revelation 2</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.3.1-22">3</a> are genuine letters to seven churches on John’s Asian circuit.</p>

<p class="list">1. Jacob’s third son by Leah (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.34">Gn 29:34</a>). The etymology of the name is uncertain. Levi’s name is associated with the tragedy at Shechem, where the male inhabitants of the city were ruthlessly murdered when Levi and Simeon sought to avenge the violation of their sister Dinah by Shechem the Hivite. Jacob condemned the act and before his death pronounced a judgment on Levi’s behavior (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.5-7">49:5-7</a>). According to these words, Levi’s descendants were to be dispersed among the tribes.</p>
<p class="list-text">The tribe of Levi was composed of the descendants of Levi’s three sons: Gershon (Gershom), Kohath, and Merari. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam traced their genealogy to Kohath (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.16">Ex 6:16</a>). The Levites remained faithful to Yahweh at the occasion of the golden calf by Mt Horeb. They were rewarded with the right to special service in and around the tabernacle (ch <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">32</a>) and later in the temple.</p>

<p class="h1">LEVI, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">Israelite tribe taking its name from the third son of Leah and Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.34">Gn 29:34</a>). The meaning of the name (“attached”) is a pun on Leah’s position as an unloved wife: now that she has borne three sons to Jacob, surely he will be “attached” to her. Elsewhere, by a similar pun, the tribe of Levi is described as “attached” to Aaron (<a href="?bref=Num.18.2">Nm 18:2</a>).</p>
<p>Levi appears with Simeon at the treacherous slaughter of the inhabitants of Canaanite Shechem (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.25-29">Gn 34:25-29</a>). This brings Jacob’s rebuke at the time (v <a href="?bref=Gen.34.30">30</a>) and his deathbed curse (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.5-7">49:5-7</a>), foretelling that the descendants of Levi and Simeon will be scattered throughout Israel. This does not seem a likely background for God’s priestly tribe, but so it proved to be, for it was as a priestly tribe that Levi was scattered through Israel, while Simeon merely melted into the desert south of Judah.</p>
<p>At first Levi was apparently a “secular” tribe like any other. True, Moses and Aaron were of Levi (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.1">Ex 2:1</a>), but no stress is laid on this. Levi’s later position was God’s reward for its costly faithfulness when Israel rebelled against God (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.25-29">32:25-29</a>); this inaugurated the “covenant with Levi” (<a href="?bref=Num.18.19">Nm 18:19</a>). Henceforth the tribe of Levi would be accepted by God instead of Israel’s firstborn sons, who belonged to him by the law of “firstfruits” (<a href="?bref=Num.3.11-13">3:11-13</a>). Levi, as a tribe, could therefore own no tribal territory: God himself was their inheritance (<a href="?bref=Num.18.20">18:20</a>). However, they were given 48 villages, with their pasturelands, in which to live (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-42">Jos 21:1-42</a>). These included the six cities of refuge (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-9">20</a>).</p>
<p>Since Levi could not amass wealth, the tribe was to be supported by gifts and tithes (<a href="?bref=Num.18.21">Nm 18:21</a>); like the widow, orphan, and stranger, they were commended to the care of God’s people (<a href="?bref=Deut.14.29">Dt 14:29</a>). Since they were God’s tribe, Joab was unwilling to include Levi in David’s census (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.6">1 Chr 21:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.1.49">Nm 1:49</a>). Naturally, Levi did not serve in war except in a religious capacity (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.21">2 Chr 20:21</a>). Their service pertained to the meeting tent (<a href="?bref=Num.1.50-53">Nm 1:50-53</a>) and later the temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.25-32">1 Chr 23:25-32</a>). Within Levi the Bible makes a clear distinction between (1) the high priest (sometimes merely called “the priest,” <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.9">1 Sm 1:9</a>), who came from one branch of Aaron’s family; (2) the rest of the priests, also of particular families; and (3) a mass of subordinate Levites, who had lesser tasks. In early days they packed and moved the portable tent of meeting (<a href="?bref=Num.1.50-51">Nm 1:50-51</a>), as well as did other duties; in later days they served as porters and choristers (<a href="?bref=1Chr.16.42">1 Chr 16:42</a>). The duties of Levi are summarized in <a href="?bref=Deut.33.8-11">Deuteronomy 33:8-11</a>, where oracular guidance and theological instruction are just as important as their priestly duties. It is therefore no surprise that Jehoshaphat later used them as teachers of law (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.7-9">2 Chr 17:7-9</a>). Nevertheless, the ordinary Israelite thought of them primarily as priestly (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.13">Jgs 17:13</a>).</p>
<p>Later references to the lasting covenant with Levi are found in <a href="?bref=Jer.33.20-26">Jeremiah 33:20-26</a> and <a href="?bref=Mal.3.3-4">Malachi 3:3-4</a>. Members of the tribe returned from the exile (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.36-42">Ezr 2:36-42</a>), apparently more coming from the priestly than the wider Levitical section. Barnabas, in NT days, belonged to the tribe of Levi (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.36">Acts 4:36</a>). Indeed, among modern Jews, wherever the surname Levy is found, a member of the tribe probably lives on.</p>

<p class="h1">LEVITICAL CITIES</p>
<p class="fl">Special areas set aside for the tribe of Levi in place of a regular territorial inheritance (<a href="?bref=Num.18.20-24">Nm 18:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.62">26:62</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.9">Dt 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.18.1-2">18:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.7">Jos 18:7</a>). The Levites were allotted 48 cities, including the six cities of refuge (<a href="?bref=Num.35.6-7">Nm 35:6-7</a>). Each town and a limited zone around it was for the Levites (vv <a href="?bref=Num.35.3-5">3-5</a>); their property enjoyed a special status with regard to the laws of redemption (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.32-34">Lv 25:32-34</a>).</p>
<p>Two lists of the Levitical cities are given (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-45">Jos 21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.54-81">1 Chr 6:54-81</a>). Thirteen towns were for the priests (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.4">Jos 21:4</a>), including the six cities of refuge. In spite of some variation between the two lists, it seems clear that they go back to one original. The distribution of the Levitical towns tells much about their purpose. They were distributed among the 12 tribes but not usually placed at the tribal centers. Those in Judah and Simeon were actually in the southern hill country, the area where the satellite clans of the Calebites and the Kenizzites had settled. Those in Benjamin were grouped along the southern half of that tribe’s inheritance, the part later attached to Judah; the family of Saul was located there. Levitical towns were placed in border areas where garrisons were required—for example, on the eastern desert fringes in Reuben and facing Philistia in Dan. Other key territories were in the plains where Asher, Manasseh, and other Galilean tribes had originally failed to conquer the Canaanite cities (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.27,31">Jgs 1:27, 31</a>). Thus, the Levites were assigned places where the special task of controlling strategic areas was necessary. Many of the towns were not taken during the initial conquest and only came under Israelite control in the reign of David.</p>
<p>Though the Levites were not the exclusive residents of any one city (they shared them with other Israelites), they were posted there for specific duties. They tended to the work of the Lord and the service of the king (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.30-32">1 Chr 26:30-32</a>). Collecting tithes (<a href="?bref=Num.18.21">Nm 18:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.28">Dt 14:28</a>), handling legal and judicial matters (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.29">1 Chr 26:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.8">2 Chr 17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.19.8-10">19:8-10</a>), military garrison duties (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.1-19">1 Chr 26:1-19</a>), and managing the storehouses (v <a href="?bref=1Chr.26.22">22</a>) were all Levitical responsibilities. Though they served by rotation in the capital (<a href="?bref=1Chr.27.1">27:1</a>), they also had similar duties the year round in their home districts (<a href="?bref=1Chr.26.29-32">26:29-32</a>). Their loyalty to the house of David caused them to lose their status in the northern kingdom, so most of them joined Judah when the kingdom was split (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.13-14">2 Chr 11:13-14</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">A traditional alternative title of Leviticus is the Third Book of Moses, which gives proper credit to the man who most deserves to be called its author. For though the book never says that Moses wrote down any of the material, it repeatedly states that God revealed the contents of Leviticus to Moses. It may be that Leviticus was not put into writing as soon as it was revealed, but there is little to commend the common critical view that it was composed nearly a thousand years after Moses. The spelling and grammar of Leviticus was, like other books of the OT, revised from time to time to make it understandable to later generations of Jewish readers, but that does not mean the essential content of the book was modified.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">God revealed some of the laws in Leviticus by speaking to Moses from the tent of meeting, or tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1">Lv 1:1</a>). Other laws were revealed on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.46">26:46</a>). Such statements show that Moses learned the contents of Leviticus after the tabernacle had been built but before the Israelites left Mt Sinai. This fits in with <a href="?bref=Exod.40.17">Exodus 40:17</a>, which says that the tabernacle was erected exactly a year after the Israelites left Egypt. They then spent another month at Sinai, during which time the laws in Leviticus were given to Moses. Then one month later (<a href="?bref=Num.1.1">Nm 1:1</a>) Moses was commanded to prepare the people to leave Sinai to conquer the Promised Land of Canaan.</p>
<p>It is difficult to give an exact date for the Israelite exodus from Egypt. Dates at the end of the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span> or early in the 13th century are put forward by different scholars. Whichever view is adopted, the origin of Leviticus must be one year later than the exodus. But certainty about the absolute date of Leviticus is unimportant so long as the religious setting of the book is understood.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">About 400 years before the exodus, God promised Abraham that his descendants would be very numerous and live in the land of Canaan. The family of Abraham multiplied, but as a result of famine they had to go and live in Egypt. Afraid of the Israelites, the rulers of Egypt turned them into slaves.</p>
<p>The book of Exodus tells how God, acting through Moses, brought the Israelites out of Egypt in a miraculous way. Moses led them to Mt Sinai, where God appeared in fire and smoke on the top of the mountain. Moses went up the mountain, and there God gave him the Ten Commandments and explained various laws. Through these acts God showed that he had chosen the nation of Israel to be his special holy people, different from all the other nations because they would show God’s character through their behavior (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.19.5-6">Ex 19:5-6</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientHebrewTextOfLeviticus"/>
<p>God’s revelation at Sinai was unique and unrepeatable. But he disclosed to Moses that he wanted to live among the people of Israel permanently. They were told to build a portable royal palace that would be suitable for the divine King of kings. The building of this portable palace, traditionally called the tabernacle, is described in <a href="?bref=Exod.35.1-40.38">Exodus 35–40</a>. When it was completed, the fire and cloud that had been seen on Mt Sinai appeared over the tabernacle as a sign that God was now dwelling in it (<a href="?bref=Exod.40.34-38">Ex 40:34-38</a>).</p>
<p>Exodus also tells how Moses was told to appoint his brother, Aaron, and Aaron’s sons to serve in the tabernacle as priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.1-29.46">Ex 28–29</a>). Unfortunately, before the Israelites even began to build the tabernacle, they made a golden calf under Aaron’s leadership and started to worship it instead. The people were spared only as a result of Moses’ prayers. The book of Exodus therefore leaves the reader in suspense. The tabernacle has been built, but no one knows how to worship God in it. Though Aaron and his family are alive, we are left wondering whether they will still be allowed to lead the worship of God after the idolatry of the golden calf. The book of Leviticus answers this question.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheology">Purpose and Theology</p>
<p class="fl">The Ten Commandments explain briefly and simply how God expects his people to behave. The first four commandments explain our duty toward our neighbor. The book of Leviticus follows a similar scheme. Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-17.16">1–17</a> show how God wanted Israel to worship him, while chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-27.21">18–27</a> are mainly concerned with how people should behave toward each other. Whereas the Ten Commandments are general and can be applied quite easily to every society, the book of Leviticus is much more detailed and specifically geared to the special circumstances of ancient Israel. If modern readers are to profit from reading Leviticus, they must look behind the specific regulations to the underlying religious principles that do not change—in other words, to the theology of Leviticus.</p>
<p>Four themes are very important in the theology of Leviticus: (1) the presence of God, (2) holiness, (3) sacrifice, and (4) the Sinai covenant.</p>
<p class="h3">The Presence of God</p>
<p class="fl">God is always present with Israel in a real way. Sometimes his presence becomes visible in fire and smoke. But even when there is no miraculous sign, God is present. He is especially near when people worship him and offer sacrifice. The many animal sacrifices mentioned in the book are all brought to the Lord. When the animals are burnt, God is pleased with the smell (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.9">1:9</a>). The priests who offer the sacrifices must be especially careful since they come closer to God than other people do. If they are careless in their duties and break God’s commands, they may die (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-2">10:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>God is present not just in worship but in all the ordinary duties of life. The recurring refrain of the later chapters, “I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, am your God” (<a href="?bref=Lev.18.2">18:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.3">19:3</a>), reminds the Israelites that every aspect of their life—religion (chs <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1-24.18">21–24</a>), sex (chs <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">18</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-27">20</a>), and relations with neighbors (chs 19, 25)—matters to God. The behavior of every Israelite must mirror that of God himself (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.7">20:7</a>). The fear of God should prompt persons to help the blind, the deaf, the elderly, and the poor. Though such people may have no redress against unfair treatment, God cares about what happens to them (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.14,32">19:14, 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.25.17,36,43">25:17, 36, 43</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Holiness</p>
<p class="fl">“You must be holy because I am holy” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.44-45">11:44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.26">20:26</a>) could be termed the motto of Leviticus. “Holy,” “clean,” and “unclean” are common words in this book. God is the supremely holy person in the Bible, and holiness is the distinctive feature of his character. But earthly creatures can become holy too. To become holy, a person must be chosen by God and undergo the correct ceremony. Thus, at Sinai all Israel became a holy nation (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>). <a href="?bref=Lev.8.1-9.24">Leviticus 8–9</a> explains how Aaron and his sons were ordained priests. This made them more holy than ordinary Israelites and therefore able to approach God and offer sacrifice.</p>
<p>Before anyone could become holy, they had to be “clean.” Cleanness in Leviticus means more than just being free of dirt, though this idea is included. It means being free of any abnormality. Whenever a person appears to fall short of perfection, he is described as “unclean.” Thus, the worst uncleanness is death, the very opposite of perfect life. But bleeding and other discharges and patchy skin diseases can make someone unclean. Animals that move in peculiar ways or have strange habits are also called unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-15.33">Lv 11–15</a>).</p>
<p>Holiness and its opposite, uncleanness, can describe behavior as well as outward appearance. To be holy means to obey God and to act like God. Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-25.55">18–25</a> explain what holiness means in daily living. It means avoiding illicit sexual relations, caring for the poor, being honest, being fair, and loving your neighbor as yourself. This sort of behavior made Israel different from other peoples. Through their holiness the whole nation was supposed to demonstrate what God was like.</p>
<p class="h3">Sacrifice</p>
<p class="fl">In practice, unfortunately, the nation and the individuals within it rarely lived up to these ideals of holiness. Even if one did not commit a grievous sin, he or she was always liable to become unclean through contact with someone else, touching a dead animal, or in some other way. To maintain contact with a holy God, Israel’s sins and uncleanness had to be removed. This is what the sacrifices were for. They brought the forgiveness of sins and cleansing from uncleanness. Because sin affects relations between God and humans in various ways, Leviticus provides four different types of offerings to cover the different cases (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-6.30">Lv 1–6</a>), and explains which sacrifices must be offered on which occasions (chs <a href="?bref=Lev.7.1-17.16">7–17</a>). All these rituals served to underline the seriousness of sin and helped preserve peace and fellowship between God and humanity.</p>
<p class="h3">The Sinai Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">All the laws contained in Leviticus form part of the Sinai covenant. They fill out and apply the principles of the Ten Commandments to the specific circumstances of ancient Israel. But they are more than a set of detailed rules, because they were given as part of the covenant. Three things have to be remembered about this covenant. First, the covenant created a personal relationship. The Lord became Israel’s king, and Israel became his special treasure set apart from the other nations of the world. Second, the covenant was based on God’s grace. He had made a promise to Abraham and, in saving the people from Egyptian slavery, he demonstrated his faithfulness to his promise and his love for Israel. Israel, in turn, was to show its gratitude for salvation by keeping the law. In no way did keeping the law earn them salvation. The law was given to a redeemed people. Finally, there were promises and threats built into the covenant (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">Lv 26</a>). When the nation keeps the law, God promises they will enjoy good harvests, victory over their enemies, and God walking among them as he did in Eden. But if they reject God’s laws, terrible calamities will befall them: drought, famine, defeat, and even expulsion from the land God had promised to give them. These covenant curses form the background to the prophets’ warnings in later times.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Kinds of Sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-7.38">1–7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">These chapters explain how the different kinds of sacrifices were to be offered. Most of these sacrifices also formed part of the regular worship in the tabernacle and later in the temple. But these chapters are concerned with personal offerings made when someone had sinned or made a vow or recovered from an illness. They explain what the offerer must do and what the priest must do, which parts of the animal must be burned, which parts may be eaten by the priest, and what is to be done with the blood of the animal.</p>
<p>First, the offerer brought the animal into the outer court of the tabernacle. In the presence of the priest he put his hand on the head of the animal and explained why he was bringing the sacrifice. Then the worshiper killed the animal and chopped it up. The priest then took over. He caught the blood as it ran out of the dying animal and splashed it over the altar, and burned at least some of the animal on the great altar in the court of the tabernacle. These acts were performed with all the animal sacrifices.</p>
<p>The special feature of the burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-17">Lv 1</a>) was that the whole animal, which had to be unblemished, was burned on the altar. All that the priest received was the skin. This was the most common sacrifice and was offered on many different occasions. In giving the whole animal to God in the sacrifice, the worshiper dedicated himself or herself totally to God’s service. “Lay your hand on its head so the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will accept it as your substitute, thus making atonement for you” (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.4">1:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.2.1-16">2</a> deals with the grain offering that always accompanied the burnt offering, but which could also be offered alone. Only part of this offering was burned; the rest was given to the priests to eat. The sacrifices formed an important part of their income.</p>
<p>The peace (fellowship) offering’s special feature was that it was the only sacrifice where the offerer was allowed to eat part of the meat (<a href="?bref=Lev.3.1-17">Lv 3</a>). Since in the earliest period Israelites were not permitted to kill animals except for sacrifice (ch <a href="?bref=Lev.17.1-16">17</a>), every meal that included meat had to be preceded by a peace offering. <a href="?bref=Lev.7.11-18">Leviticus 7:11-18</a> mentions three occasions that might prompt a peace-offering “thanksgiving”: when someone had something to praise God for or some sin to acknowledge; a vow promising a sacrifice if God would help one out of a difficulty; and a voluntary offering, made just because the person felt like it.</p>
<p>Despite its name, the sin offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.1-35">Lv 4</a>) was not the only offering dealing with sin. The other sacrifices also made the forgiveness of sin possible. The special significance of this sacrifice is emphasized by its unusual ritual. Instead of the blood being splashed over the altar, as in the other sacrifices, it was carefully smeared over the horns (corners) of the large altar in the courtyard (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.30">4:30</a>) or over the small altar inside the holy place (v <a href="?bref=Lev.4.18">18</a>); once a year the blood was sprinkled over the ark in the Holy of Holies (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.14">16:14</a>). Sin makes these different parts of the tabernacle unclean, unfit for the presence of God. And if God is not present in the tabernacle, worship has no point. The blood acts as a spiritual disinfectant, making the tabernacle clean and holy again. The sin offering was required whenever a person inadvertently broke one of the commandments or had suffered from a discharge or skin disease that made him or her unclean for a week or more (chs <a href="?bref=Lev.12.1-8">12</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.15.1-33">15</a>).</p>
<p>The guilt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.14-6.7">5:14–6:7</a>) was for more serious offenses, such as stealing holy property or deliberately using God’s name in a false oath. Such an offense was seen as robbing God. Therefore, a ram had to be offered as a sort of repayment. Whereas the poor person could offer just a bird for the other sacrifices, a ram was always required for a guilt offering.</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.6.8-7.38">6:8–7:38</a> contain various other regulations about sacrifice, mainly specifying how much of each sacrifice the priests may eat and how much must be burned. One important rule for those who weren’t priests was that they were not to eat any fat or blood or eat sacrificial meat when they were unclean. If they did, they could be cut off from Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.7.21-27">7:21-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Beginnings of the Priesthood (<a href="?bref=Lev.8.1-10.20">8–10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Though Leviticus looks like a law book, because it contains so many regulations, it is really a history book describing the events that occurred about a year after the exodus. These chapters remind us of the true character of the book, for they tell how Moses ordained Aaron and his sons to be priests and how they offered their first sacrifices.</p>
<p>Awed by the complexity of the ordination rituals, the modern reader may miss the marvel that Aaron should have been appointed high priest. For it was Aaron who had presided over the making of the golden calf and encouraged its worship (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-35">Ex 32</a>). Had not Moses interceded for Israel, the whole nation would have been destroyed in the wilderness. Here the gracious forgiveness of God is most clear. Aaron, the chief sinner, is appointed chief mediator between God and the people. In the NT the career of Peter parallels Aaron’s in some respect.</p>
<p>The greatness of the high priesthood is symbolized by the richly decorated robes Aaron wore. He and his sons were anointed with oil, and then Moses offered the three most common sacrifices on their behalf. They were confined to the court of the tabernacle for a week, and it seems likely that some of the rituals were repeated each day. By this means they were set apart from the rest of the people and entirely consecrated to their holy office.</p>
<p>By the eighth day the process was complete. Now Aaron and his sons could offer sacrifice. This time, Moses only told them what to do; he did not offer sacrifices himself. Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.9.1-24">9</a> concludes by telling that, after they had offered the sacrifices for themselves and the people, fire came out of the tabernacle to burn up the offerings, thereby displaying God’s approval of their actions.</p>
<p>After this, <a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-2">10:1-2</a> presents an unexpected turn of events: “Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu put coals of fire in their incense burners and sprinkled incense over it. In this way, they disobeyed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> by burning before him a different kind of fire than he had commanded. So fire blazed forth from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s presence and burned them up, and they died there before the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). We do not know exactly what is meant by unholy fire. What is important is that the priests did something that God had not commanded them. The priests were supposed to set an example of total obedience to God’s word: this is the essence of holiness. Instead, they decided to follow their own plans and the consequences were dire.</p>
<p>“Aaron was silent” (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.3">10:3</a>). He was warned not even to mourn his sons’ deaths, lest he be suspected of condoning their sin (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.10.6-7">6-7</a>). Yet, despite his sons’ actions, Aaron and his surviving sons were confirmed as priests. They were reminded that their job was “to distinguish between what is holy and what is ordinary, what is ceremonially unclean and what is clean. And you must teach the Israelites all the laws that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has given through Moses” (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.10.10-11">10-11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The chapter closes on another note of grace. Although the priests made a mistake in offering one of the sin offerings, God would overlook it on this occasion.</p>
<p class="h3">Cleanness and Uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-16.36">11–16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Distinguishing between the unclean and the clean is the theme of chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-15.27">11–15</a>, which prepare for the great Day of Atonement ceremonies of chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">16</a>. These are designed to cleanse the tabernacle from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel, thereby ensuring that God would continue to dwell among them (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.16,19">16:16, 19</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">11</a> discusses unclean animals, that is, animals that may not be eaten. Land animals are dealt with first, then fish and birds, and finally various miscellaneous creatures such as locusts and reptiles. To be clean, a land animal must have cloven hooves and chew the cud; that covers sheep and cattle but excludes pigs and camels. Fish must have fins and scales to be edible; without them, they count as unclean. Birds are clean unless they are birds of prey or scavengers that eat carrion. Insects that resemble birds in having wings and two large legs to hop with—for example, locusts—are clean. Other flying insects are unclean. All squirming creatures that dart hither and thither, such as lizards, are unclean.</p>
<p>The reasons for declaring some animals clean and others unclean has long been a great puzzle. One suggestion is that the unclean animals were used in sacrifice by pagan worshipers or were thought to represent pagan deities. Certainly some unclean animals were used in pagan worship, but so were some clean ones, and that fact makes this explanation unsatisfactory. A second possibility is that the rules were hygienic: the clean animals were safe to eat whereas the unclean were not. There may be some truth in this explanation, but it is not completely adequate, for some clean animals can be harmful while some unclean ones are all right to eat.</p>
<p>Unclean animals could not be eaten, but there was no harm in touching them. Israelites could ride camels, for example. However, all dead animals, unless killed for sacrifice, were unclean. Anyone who touched the carcass of a dead creature became unclean himself and therefore could not enter the tabernacle that day (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.39-40">11:39-40</a>).</p>
<p>The following chapters deal with other conditions that make people unclean. Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.12.1-8">12</a> states that childbirth, or more precisely the bloody discharge that follows childbirth, makes a woman unclean. In OT theology death is the ultimate uncleanness, and conditions that are abnormal or threaten to lead to death are also unclean. When the discharge has ceased, after a fixed period the mother must bring a burnt offering and a sin offering to atone for any sin she may have committed, and to purify the tabernacle that may have been polluted through her uncleanness.</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-14.57">13–14</a> deal with the uncleanness caused by skin diseases. Detailed regulations are given to distinguish between different diseases so that the priests can decide whether people are unclean or not. If they are unclean, they must live outside the camp until their skin heals. Traditionally the unclean skin disease has been called leprosy. But this is unlikely to be correct, since leprosy was unknown in the Middle East in OT times. Rather, it was any disease that led to the skin peeling off in patches, such as psoriasis. This explains why the disease might spontaneously get better.</p>
<p>If the disease did retreat sufficiently, the sufferer could call the priest, and if the priest was satisfied with the cure, the sufferer could be readmitted to the community after following the rituals prescribed in chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.14.1-57">14</a>. This also explains what is to be done if patches of mold are found in pieces of cloth or house walls.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.15.1-33">15</a> explains how men can become unclean through discharges from their sexual organs, due to gonorrhea or sexual intercourse, while women become unclean through menstruation or a long-term discharge. Part of the purpose of these regulations is to prevent the sacred prostitution that was common in the ancient world. Since sexual intercourse made people unclean, they could not go to worship immediately afterward. Further, the uncleanness of menstruation should have discouraged men from being overfamiliar with unmarried girls.</p>
<p>The broad scope of these uncleanness regulations meant that nearly every Israelite would be unclean at some time in his or her life. This uncleanness could contaminate God’s dwelling place, the tabernacle, making it impossible for God to continue to live there. To avert this catastrophe, a Day of Atonement was held once a year. This is the most solemn day in the Jewish calendar, and the ceremonies for it are described in detail in <a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Leviticus 16</a>.</p>
<p>There are three acts on the Day of Atonement that are described in this chapter. There was first the special sin offering offered by the high priest, in the course of which the outer altar of burnt offering, the incense altar inside the Holy Place, and finally the ark itself in the Holy of Holies were sprinkled with blood to purify each part of the tabernacle. This was the one occasion in the year when the high priest entered the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, and elaborate precautions were taken to screen the high priest from God’s holiness (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.2-4,11-17">16:2-4, 11-17</a>). There was another public act that pictured the sins of Israel being taken away. A goat was chosen by lot. Then the high priest placed his hands on its head and recited over it the nation’s sin. This goat was then led away and driven into a solitary place; in later times it was pushed over a precipice. These actions pictured Israel’s sins being carried away, so that they could not disturb the peace between God and his people. The third important feature of the Day of Atonement was public prayer and fasting. This showed that sin could not be eliminated without effort, but only through a complete change of heart by every person in Israel.</p>
<p class="h3">Rules for Daily Life (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.1-25.55">17–25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Whereas the opening chapters of Leviticus are entirely concerned with the Godward side of religion, the later chapters are more concerned with practical religious duties toward other persons. However, chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.17.1-16">17</a> repeats some of the rules about sacrifice and makes one new one: that all sacrifice must be offered in the tabernacle courtyard. This was to prevent people from secretly worshiping heathen gods.</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">18</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-27">20</a> spell out the rules governing sexual relations in ancient Israel. Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.19.1-37">19</a> gives further examples of what holiness means in everyday life. Positively, it means helping the poor by leaving some grain behind in the fields at harvesttime (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-10">19:9-10</a>); paying people promptly (v <a href="?bref=Lev.19.13">13</a>); avoiding gossip (v <a href="?bref=Lev.19.16">16</a>); honoring the elderly, helping the immigrant, and being honest in business (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.19.32-36">32-36</a>). But holiness goes beyond deeds and words. It should transform thoughts: “Never seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone, but love your neighbor as yourself” (v <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">18</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Lev.21.1-24">21</a> and <a href="?bref=Lev.22.1-33">22</a> discuss how the holy men of Israel, the priests, are to demonstrate their holiness in their lives. First, they must avoid approaching dead bodies unless the dead are very close relatives. Second, they must marry women of known moral uprightness. Third, deformed priests—for example, a blind or lame priest—may never offer sacrifices. Here the principle is plain that men who represent God must reflect the perfection of God in normal, healthy bodies. However, those who are temporarily unclean, through skin disease or a discharge, may resume their duties as soon as their uncleanness is cured.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.23.1-44">23</a> lists the main holy days and the sacrifices that had to be offered on each one. Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.24.1-23">24</a> deals with the lamp and special bread kept within the tabernacle. A case of blasphemy that occurred in the wilderness is mentioned. Because the man actually used the sacred name of God in a curse, he was sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-55">25</a> deals with the jubilee year. In every society people fall into debt. Today the effects of debt are somewhat cushioned by state welfare payments and bank overdrafts, but ancient societies did not have such aid available. People in debt had to sell off their family land, on which they depended for their living, or in more serious situations, they could sell themselves into slavery. Once impoverished in this way, it was exceedingly difficult ever to recover one’s land or one’s freedom. But this law in Leviticus provided an escape. Every 50 years was a jubilee. In this year every slave was released from bondage, and everyone who had sold his land was given it back free. Thus, everyone who fell into debt was given a chance to make a fresh start. Though this law was primarily designed to help the poor, it also served to prevent the accumulation of too much wealth in the hands of a few rich men.</p>
<p class="h3">Blessings, Curses, and Vows (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-27.34">26–27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.26.1-46">26</a> contains the blessings and curses that traditionally concluded a covenant. Israel is promised great material and spiritual prosperity if she keeps the law but is warned that tragedy will befall if she is disobedient.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Lev.27.1-34">27</a> is an appendix dealing with vows and other gifts made to God. When a person promises to give something to God, it becomes holy and cannot be retracted unless a suitable payment is made instead. This chapter sets out the rules about such dedications.</p>

<p class="h1">LIBERTINES*</p>
<p class="fl">Freedmen of Jewish extraction. The only reference to Libertines in the NT is <a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>). Most modern versions render this Latin term with the more Anglicized “freedmen” (“Freed Slaves,” <span class="sc">nlt</span>) on the assumption that the designation is legal-political, not geographical. The appearance of Libertines with groups from various parts of the empire could be taken to mean that the Libertines were a group from the region of Liberatum in North Africa, at that time under Roman jurisdiction. A more probable understanding, however, is that the people who met in the synagogue of the Libertines were Jews who had formerly been slaves. Philo, a Hellenistic Jew of Alexandria, writes about Jews who had been captured during Pompey’s conquests and taken to Rome in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, where they were sold as slaves but later released. When these Jews were set free, they settled in various parts of the empire: Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and Asia.</p>
<p>These Greek-speaking Jews, according to <a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>, worshiped in a synagogue of their own in Jerusalem. They could not speak the Aramaic of their Palestinian counterparts. In 1913 R. Weill found an inscription in Jerusalem relating to a certain Theodotus, son of Vettenos. The inscription refers to a synagogue that fits the description of <a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>. The early church found it necessary to debate its faith with the Libertines of this synagogue. Stephen, a man appointed earlier to deal with problems arising in the Greek-speaking element of the church (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.1-6">Acts 6:1-6</a>), appears as the able exponent of faith in Christ Jesus against the synagogue of the Libertines.</p>

<p class="h1">LIBERTY*</p>
<p class="fl">Quality or state of being free. In the ancient world slavery was universal. The law of Moses provided that a Hebrew slave serve six years and go free in the seventh (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.2">Ex 21:2</a>). This provision of the law lies behind <a href="?bref=Jer.34.1-22">Jeremiah 34</a>, a passage that makes two things plain: (1) what the law required was recognized, but (2) many failed to comply with it. But whatever the practice, the law enshrined the principle of freedom. After each 49 years there was to be a jubilee year when all property would be returned to its original owners and slaves would be freed (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.8-24">Lv 25:8-24</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.46.17">Ez 46:17</a>).</p>
<p>Liberty might be given a slave for other reasons. If his owner destroyed the sight in an eye or knocked a tooth out, the slave must be freed for the loss of his eye or tooth (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.26-27">Ex 21:26-27</a>). In a somewhat gloomy passage Job reflects that in Sheol “the slave is free from his master” (<a href="?bref=Job.3.19">Jb 3:19</a>). In another vein he appreciates the freedom of the wild ass (<a href="?bref=Job.39.5">39:5</a>).</p>
<p>When the Messiah comes, one of his tasks will be “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Is 61:1</a>). OT believers thought of this liberty in terms of freedom from foreign domination. But the Messiah is concerned basically with setting people’s spirits free. Liberty is a way of life before God, as well as a state of being free from shackles.</p>
<p>In the NT freedom is sometimes seen as a literal release from captivity. For example, all four Gospels refer to the Jewish custom of having a prisoner set free at Passover (see <a href="?bref=Mark.15.6-15">Mk 15:6-15</a>). There are references also to the release of prisoners (see <a href="?bref=Acts.3.13">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.35">16:35</a>). Paul encouraged Christian slaves to get their freedom if they could (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.21">1 Cor 7:21</a>), and he personally advocated the freedom of Onesimus, a slave who had run away from his master, Philemon (see <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1-25">Phlm</a>). But Paul did not advocate freedom from slavery as part of the Christian gospel. Rather, he emphasized freedom in Christ for all the believers—both those who are free and those who are slaves.</p>
<p>The freedom that matters is the freedom Christ gives. Jesus says plainly that people are really free when the Son sets them free (<a href="?bref=John.8.36">Jn 8:36</a>). Paul exults in the freedom that Jesus Christ brings (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.24-25">Rom 7:24-25</a>). The same idea can be expressed in terms of the truth making people free (<a href="?bref=John.8.32">Jn 8:32</a>); of course, these words must be understood in light of the fact that Jesus is himself the truth (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">Jn 14:6</a>). This is not the philosophical concept that error enslaves men while truth has a liberating effect. Truth here is that truth that is associated with Jesus, “the word of the truth, the gospel” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.5">Col 1:5</a>). Paul says, “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17">2 Cor 3:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The NT is insistent that, left to themselves, people cannot defeat sin. And this is a fact of life of which the modern world affords ample proof. We may earnestly desire to do good, but evil is too powerful for us. We cannot do the good we wish to do (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.21-23">Rom 7:21-23</a>). But because of Christ’s atoning work, the power of sin is broken. “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2">Rom 8:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). This truth is insisted on again and again, and is expressed in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>But there is another freedom that belongs to the Christian—freedom from the law. There were many in the first century who saw the way of salvation as keeping the commandments of God. This was commonly urged among the Jews, and some of the first Christians seem to have taken up the idea from them. After all, it seems so obvious: if we lead good lives, we will be all right with God. The trouble with this position is that we do not lead good lives, for sin is too strong. But there is a further defect; namely, that the way of law is not the way for which Christ died. This is given special emphasis in Galatians, where Paul argues strongly that salvation is not by way of the law but by faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.1-25">Rom 4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.1-29">Gal 3</a>). He complains of people who slipped in to spy on the freedom they had in Christ Jesus (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.4">Gal 2:4</a>). He points out that since Christ freed us, we ought not to get caught up in any form of bondage (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.1">5:1</a>).</p>
<p>In one striking passage Paul looks for the whole creation to be liberated from the bondage of decay (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.21">Rom 8:21</a>). It will in some way share in the liberty of the glory of God’s children. This points to a wonderful destiny for creation. And we should not miss the “glory” that the liberty of God’s children means.</p>
<p>There is an obvious temptation to presume on our freedom, since we do nothing to merit our salvation. But we are more than once warned not to misuse our liberty (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-4">Rom 6:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.13">Gal 5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.16">1 Pt 2:16</a>). We must live as free people without making our liberty the means of bringing us into a new form of slavery of our own devising.</p>

<p class="h1">LIFE</p>
<p class="fl">In biblical perspective, life flows from the living Father through the Son (his agent in creation and redemption) into a world thirsting for “real” life (see <a href="?bref=John.6.57">Jn 6:57</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLivingFather">The Living Father</p>
<p class="fl">God the Father is above all else “the living God” (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.10">Jer 10:10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.26">Jn 5:26</a>). God, the source of all life (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.13">1 Tm 6:13</a>), “inbreathed” humans at creation and sustains them continually (<a href="?bref=Job.34.14-15">Jb 34:14-15</a>). God alone gives life (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.16">Gn 17:16</a>) and takes it away (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.22-24">Gn 3:22-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.6.3">6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.104.29">Ps 104:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.20">Lk 12:20</a>).</p>
<p>The sign of life is movement; man is a “lively,” animated body (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.50">Mt 27:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.55">Lk 8:55</a>). Animals also have this animating “breath-soul” (Hebrew of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.24">Gn 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.6.17">6:17</a>). Thus, all nature is instilled with life deriving from God (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.24-28">Acts 17:24-28</a>). Life is therefore sacred, but unfortunately it is as transient as grass, clouds, dew, shadow (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.15">1 Chr 29:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.7.6,9">Jb 7:6, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.13-16">Jas 4:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.24">1 Pt 1:24</a>). Long life is desired (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.29">Gn 35:29</a>); any life is preferable to death and of infinite value (<a href="?bref=Eccl.9.4-6">Eccl 9:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.6.25">Mt 6:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.16.26">16:26</a>), for Sheol houses a ghostly “nonliving life,” bereft of feeling, hope, or divine help (<a href="?bref=Ps.88.3-12">Ps 88:3-12</a>). One’s life can be enhanced by loving and serving God (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.15-20">Dt 30:15-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.8-12">1 Pt 3:8-12</a>), by experiencing God’s deliverance (<a href="?bref=Isa.38.16">Is 38:16</a>), and by receiving divine blessings (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">Mt 5:3-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChristasLife">Christ as Life</p>
<p class="fl">The Greek word for “life” is <span class="greek">zoe</span><span class="ital">.</span> In classical Greek this word was used for life in general. There are a few examples of this meaning in the New Testament (see <a href="?bref=Acts.17.25">Acts 17:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.14">Jas 4:14</a>: <a href="?bref=Rev.16.3">Rv 16:3</a>), but in all other instances the word was used to designate the divine, eternal life—the life of God (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.18">Eph 4:18</a>). This life resided in Christ, and he made it available to all who believe in him. Human beings are born with the natural life—called <span class="greek">psuche</span> in Greek (translated “soul,” “personality,” or “life”); they do not possess the eternal life. This life can be received only by believing in the one who possesses the <span class="greek">zoe</span><span class="ital">-life,</span> namely, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The overflowing, vibrant quality of life made available in Christ was evident in the authority of his speech and the power of his touch (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.18">Mt 9:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.27,41-42">Mk 1:27, 41-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.27-29">5:27-29</a>). He is “the author of life” (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.15">Acts 3:15</a>), who provides the way into life (<a href="?bref=Matt.7.14">Mt 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.46">25:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.35-37">Mk 8:35-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.42-47">9:42-47</a>). And he raised the dead with his life-giving power. His own resurrection made him “a life-giving spirit,” with the power of “an indestructible life” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2">Rom 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45">1 Cor 15:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.16">Heb 7:16</a>). Thus, Jesus Christ is “our life” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.4">Col 3:4</a>)—in union with whom we find “newness of life” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.4">Rom 6:4</a>) and are newly created, living henceforth not for ourselves but for him (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.15-17">2 Cor 5:15-17</a>).</p>
<p>John, especially, dwells on the theme that Christ is the source of this new life (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-16">Jn 3:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.21">5:21</a>) for the children of God (<a href="?bref=John.1.12">1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.3,5">3:3, 5</a>). This life is enjoyed already by those who know God and Christ (<a href="?bref=John.5.24">5:24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.3">17:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.11-12">1 Jn 5:11-12</a>), for they have already passed from death into eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.10.28">Jn 10:28</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.26">11:26</a>). Such life is abundant (<a href="?bref=John.10.10">10:10</a>), enlightened (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>), free and satisfied (<a href="?bref=John.10.9">10:9</a>), victorious (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.6-14">Rom 6:6-14</a>), full of peace and joy (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.1-11">Rom 5:1-11</a>), inexhaustibly refreshed (<a href="?bref=John.4.13-14">Jn 4:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.37-38">7:37-38</a>) and immortal (<a href="?bref=John.5.24">Jn 5:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.51-57">1 Cor 15:51-57</a>).</p>
<p>All this is possible because from the beginning “all that came to be was alive with his life” (<a href="?bref=John.1.4">Jn 1:4</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>). Thus, the life within the Father flows into the world through the Son, who also “has life in himself” and gives it to whom he will (<a href="?bref=John.5.26">5:26</a>). He is “the resurrection and the life” (<a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>) and demonstrates it by restoring life to paralyzed limbs, raising the dead, and conquering death (<a href="?bref=John.5.5-9">5:5-9</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.43">11:43</a>; ch <a href="?bref=John.20.1-31">20</a>). People remain in death only because they will not “come” and “have life” (<a href="?bref=John.5.40">5:40</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.14">1 Jn 3:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">LIGHT</p>
<p class="fl">Illumination that makes sight possible.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Light is a many-sided concept in the OT. The term is often used of ordinary, sensible light, but it also speaks of communicating spiritual truth. Light was the first thing God created after the heavens and earth (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.3">Gn 1:3</a>). God also made individual lights such as the sun, moon, and stars (v <a href="?bref=Gen.1.16">16</a>). Sometimes light is personified, as when its inaccessibility is indicated by saying that it is impossible to reach the place where it lives (<a href="?bref=Job.38.19">Jb 38:19</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=Job.38.24">24</a>). There are also manufactured light sources, such as those used in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.37">Ex 25:37</a>).</p>
<p>Light is a natural symbol for what is pleasant, good, or uplifting, or what is associated with important people and more especially with God. “Light is pleasant,” says the preacher (<a href="?bref=Eccl.11.7">Eccl 11:7</a>). During one of the plagues in Egypt, the Egyptians were in thick darkness while the Israelites had light (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.23">Ex 10:23</a>). When the Israelites left Egypt, they were led in the wilderness by a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.21">13:21</a>). The pillar gave them light when their enemies were in darkness (<a href="?bref=Exod.14.20">14:20</a>). In later days Israel remembered that God did not abandon his people even when they sinned; the pillar of fire was always there to show them the right way (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.19">Neh 9:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Neh.9.12">Neh 9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.14">Pss 78:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.105.39">105:39</a>).</p>
<p>Light symbolizes the blessing of the Lord. Job said, “He floods the darkness with light; he brings light to the deepest gloom” (<a href="?bref=Job.12.22">Jb 12:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In his time of trouble Job recalled earlier, better days: “I long for the years gone by when God took care of me, when he lighted the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness” (<a href="?bref=Job.29.2-3">Jb 29:2-3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Similarly Eliphaz pictured the happiness that would befall Job if he would take Eliphaz’s advice: “Whatever you decide to do will be accomplished, and light will shine on the road ahead of you” (<a href="?bref=Job.22.28">Jb 22:28</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Eliphaz’s use of that expression shows what is commonly conveyed in his day. The psalmist counted it a blessing when God himself lighted his lamp (<a href="?bref=Ps.18.28">Pss 18:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.118.27">118:27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.97.11">97:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.4">112:4</a>).</p>
<p>Light is closely linked with God; indeed, God can be said to be light: “No longer will you need the sun or moon to give you light, for the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God will be your everlasting light, and he will be your glory. The sun will never set; the moon will not go down. For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> will be your everlasting light” (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.19-20">Is 60:19-20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The psalmist exulted, “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is my light and my salvation” (<a href="?bref=Ps.27.1">Ps 27:1</a>). God is said to be robed with light (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.2">104:2</a>), and light dwells with him (<a href="?bref=Dan.2.22">Dn 2:22</a>). Darkness is no problem to God; darkness and light are alike to him (<a href="?bref=Ps.139.12">Ps 139:12</a>). Micah saw God as light and also as bringing his servants into the light (<a href="?bref=Mic.7.8-9">Mi 7:8-9</a>). Both are ways of affirming that there is blessing and victory with God, so that a servant of God need never be dismayed.</p>
<p>God’s blessing, described in terms of light, is also related to “the light of his presence.” Something of that expression’s meaning is seen from its use in <a href="?bref=Ps.4.6">Psalm 4:6</a>: “Many people say, ‘Who will show us better times?’ Let the smile of your face shine on us, <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The parallelism shows that “good” and the lifting up of the light of God’s countenance are much the same. Similarly, it was the light of God’s countenance that brought victory (<a href="?bref=Ps.44.3">Ps 44:3</a>; here it is linked with God’s right hand and arm and his delight in his people). Those who walk in the light of God’s countenance are blessed (<a href="?bref=Ps.89.15">89:15</a>). There is another side to that expression, for secret sins are exposed in his light (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.8">90:8</a>). There is a close scrutiny from which no one and nothing can escape. But the predominant idea is that of the blessing that follows from God’s looking upon his people. On one occasion the phrase is used of a person showing favor to others (<a href="?bref=Job.29.24">Jb 29:24</a>). An extension of the Lord’s blessing is the light God gives to the world through his servants (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.6">Is 42:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">49:6</a>). God’s servants can guide others to the revelation and blessing of God.</p>
<p>Light is associated with justice when the Lord says, “A law will go forth from me, and my justice for a light to the peoples” (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.4">Is 51:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). God’s light in that act of justice is a consuming fire. Sometimes light is connected with good behavior: “The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day” (<a href="?bref=Pr.4.18">Prv 4:18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The OT uses the absence of light as a synonym for disaster. There are those who grope in the dark without light (<a href="?bref=Job.12.25">Jb 12:25</a>). Bildad saw the light of the wicked put out in punishment and death (<a href="?bref=Job.18.5-17">18:5-17</a>). The wicked will be “thrust from light into darkness” (v <a href="?bref=Job.18.18">18</a>). In the aftermath of the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem there came the lament “He has brought me into deep darkness, shutting out all light” (<a href="?bref=Lam.3.2">Lam 3:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">New Testament references to light are often figurative. Thus, on the Damascus road, Saul of Tarsus encountered “a light from heaven” (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.3">Acts 9:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-11">22:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.13">26:13</a>). Was that light as we know it or something else? Likewise, what quality of light shone in the apostle Peter’s cell (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.7">12:7</a>)? The light in the heavenly city is not the kind of illumination seen on earth, “for the Lord God will be their light” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.5">Rv 22:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.21.11,23-24">21:11, 23-24</a>).</p>
<p>The association of God with light is recurrent in the NT. The apostle John wrote that “God is light and there is no darkness in him at all” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5">1 Jn 1:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The apostle James referred to God as “the Father of lights” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.17">Jas 1:17</a>). Or God may be thought of as living in light, light that no person can approach (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.16">1 Tm 6:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>). Jesus said, “I am the light of the world” (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">Jn 8:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.9.5">9:5</a>), and “I have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness” (<a href="?bref=John.12.46">Jn 12:46</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus told his followers to believe in the light while it was with them (v <a href="?bref=John.12.35">35</a>). Such passages emphasize that Christ brought a revelation from God, but he was more than a revealer. He was himself that revelation, according to the apostle John (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-10">Jn 1:1-10</a>). John the Baptist came to bear witness to the light for the purpose of bringing people to believe (vv <a href="?bref=John.1.7-8">7-8</a>). Those who received Jesus, who believed in the light, received the right to become children of God (vv <a href="?bref=John.1.9-12">9-12</a>). Sometimes light is used to express the illumination that happens when people come to the knowledge of God and his salvation (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.16">Mt 4:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.32">Lk 2:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.47">Acts 13:47</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.18">26:18</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps thinking of a then-popular concept of a war between light and darkness, John wrote that the light shines in the darkness and adds that the darkness has not overcome it (<a href="?bref=John.1.5">Jn 1:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.8">1 Jn 2:8</a>). John tells us that “the light from heaven came into the world, but they loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil” (<a href="?bref=John.3.19">Jn 3:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). To love darkness brings condemnation, now and at the final judgment. John pointed out that evildoers keep away from the light; they do not want their evil exposed. But those who “do the truth” come to the light (vv <a href="?bref=John.3.20-21">20-21</a>). In John’s account of the raising of Lazarus, Jesus speaks of the possibility of walking without stumbling in the light of day, but then he goes on to the way a man stumbles in the night because he has no light (<a href="?bref=John.11.10">11:10</a>). The lack of light “in” the man shows that it is a spiritual process with which Jesus is concerned and not with making physical progress by daylight. He who follows Jesus will have the light of life (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>), which indicates what Jesus has in mind.</p>
<p>Those who respond to the light may be characterized as “sons of light” (<a href="?bref=John.12.36">Jn 12:36</a>). Their allegiance is to the light and their conduct has been shaped by this fact. The concept is not confined to John’s Gospel, for we also see it in Luke (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.8">Lk 16:8</a>). We find it in Paul’s affirmation that the Thessalonian Christians are children of light and of the day, not of the night or darkness (<a href="?bref=1Thes.5.5">1 Thes 5:5</a>). John speaks of walking in the light (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>) and sees the conduct of the Christian as aptly symbolized by light.</p>
<p>This way of looking at the Christian’s manner of life reaches its high point in the words of Jesus to his followers: “You are the light of the world” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.14">Mt 5:14</a>), thus applying to them words that are also applied to himself. Of course, we are not the world’s light in the same sense as he is. When light refers to Christ, there is a reference to him as Savior and not merely as one who reveals great truths. When believers are called the light of the world, there is clearly no saving significance in the description: they do not accomplish the world’s salvation. But they do point it out. It is their function to live as redeemed people. They are to show the quality of life proper to the people of God and in this way act as light to the people of the world. They are to let their light shine before the world in such a way that people will see their good deeds and so come to praise God (not, be it noted, those who do the deeds, <a href="?bref=Matt.5.16">Mt 5:16</a>). It is important for those in this position to make full use of the light they have. It is tragic when the light that is in them is darkness (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.23">Mt 6:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.35">Lk 11:35</a>).</p>
<p>This metaphor is worked out in a way not congenial to modern men and women, but the basic lesson is clear. Christians have been illuminated by the light that is Christ, who dwells within his people. If they ignore the illumination he brings and live like those in the dark, then indeed they are in deep darkness. They are worse than others because they know what light is and what it can mean to them, and have turned away from it.</p>

  <title>Lightning</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LIGHTNING</p>
<p class="fl">The flashing of light. When the Bible speaks of lightning, it usually has to do with God making an appearance. It occurs, therefore, at very dramatic moments, as when God comes down upon Mt Sinai just before giving the Ten Commandments to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.16">Ex 19:16</a>); or referring to the return of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.27">Mt 24:27</a>), where lightning is only one of many spectacular signs of the event (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.14">Ez 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.6">Dn 10:6</a>). It is a common symbol also in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.5">Rv 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.5">8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.18">16:18</a>), a book whose chief concern is to give a vision of God.</p>
<p>Sometimes the figure of lightning speaks of God in special ways. It can accompany judgment against God’s enemies (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.15">2 Sm 22:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.18">Rv 16:18</a>). More often, it points to God’s power and kingship over all creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.135.7">Ps 135:7</a>). Lightning is one of the things God mentions to Job (<a href="?bref=Job.38.35">Jb 38:35</a>) to show him how great is the creation and the Creator, and how small Job is by comparison (compare <a href="?bref=Ps.77.16-18">Ps 77:16-18</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">A title of the Messiah that appears only in <a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">Revelation 5:5</a>: “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the heir to David’s throne, has conquered” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). This is an allusion to the messianic promise of <a href="?bref=Gen.49.9-10">Genesis 49:9-10</a>, “Judah is a young lion. . . . The scepter will not depart from Judah” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The expression summarizes the OT hope that the Messiah would come as a conquering hero, delivering his people from every form of spiritual, political, and social evil (cf. <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.11.37">2 Esd 11:37</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Esd.12.31">12:31</a>). The OT frequently employs the lion as a symbol of power and the complete ability to subdue one’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Job.10.16">Jb 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.10.9">Ps 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.10">Ez 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-4">Dn 7:1-4</a>).</p>
<p>The author of Revelation expressed the belief of all Christians—that Christ is the deliverer who would defeat all the powers of evil. However, in contrast to the OT hope, the deliverer comes not as the conquering Lion of military power, but rather as the Lamb, who suffers and is sacrificed for the sins of his people (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.6">Rv 5:6</a>).</p>

The writer of Proverbs understood the critical nature of the liver when he noted that an arrow injury to the liver (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “heart”) was fatal (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.23">Prv 7:23</a>). In most instances, in Scripture the liver is mentioned in connection with the description of animal sacrifices (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.13,22">Ex 29:13, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.3.4,10,15">Lv 3:4, 10, 15</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">City on the coastal plain of Palestine. The modern city, called Ludd, is located 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) southeast of Tel Aviv. The name of the city first occurs in a list of Canaanite towns that goes back to 1465 <span class="era">BC</span>, to the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III, who supplied the list. The founder of the city is said to have been Shemed, a Benjamite (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.12">1 Chr 8:12</a>). It is included in a list of places that were resettled by returning exiles from Babylon (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.33">Ezr 2:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.7.37">Neh 7:37</a>), and is included in the list of Benjamite settlements (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.35">Neh 11:35</a>). The history of the city can be traced continuously from Maccabean times, through the Roman period, including the first and second Jewish wars against the Romans, to the Byzantine and Crusader periods, through to modern times.</p>
<p>In the NT era Jewish sources emphasize the importance of the city, at that time named Lydda. It had a large market and was noted for the raising of cattle. Textile, dyeing, and pottery industries flourished there. And it was the seat of a Sanhedrin; famous Talmudic scholars taught there. This, then, was the kind of bustling, flourishing community that existed when Peter visited the city and ministered to its Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.32-35">Acts 9:32-35</a>).</p>

In the NT girded loins signified that a man was ready for service or heavy battle (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.35">Lk 12:35</a>). Metaphorically, girding the loins is a symbolic way of saying that one is standing firm and/or exercising self-control (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.14">Eph 6:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.13">1 Pt 1:13</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">LONGSUFFERING*</p>
<p class="fl">Word denoting long and patient endurance. This is a word used in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> four times in the OT (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6">Ex 34:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.18">Nm 14:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.86.15">Ps 86:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.15">Jer 15:15</a>) and 13 times in the NT.

<p>Longsuffering is usually applied to God (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.4">Rom 2:4</a>). A holy God must punish sin. Yet his loving nature delays that punishment to give the sinner time to repent and turn away from his sin (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.16">1 Tm 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.20">1 Pt 3:20</a>). Longsuffering is also a Christian virtue, a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>). Christians need to exercise this in their relationships with each other.</p>

<p class="fl">“Lord” in English is the rendering of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">‘adonai</span> or of the Greek <span class="greek">kurios</span><span class="ital">.</span> The Hebrew YHWH is usually rendered “<span class="divine-name">Lord</span>”; <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=YahwehYhwh_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Yahweh (YHWH)</a>. </p>
<p>God’s rule and authority as Lord rests ultimately upon his creation and ownership of all things and people (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.1-2">Ps 24:1-2</a>). God’s total supremacy over nature is emphasized by his being called the Lord over earthquakes, wind, fire (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.10-14">1 Kgs 19:10-14</a>), stars (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.26">Is 40:26</a>), beasts and sea monsters (<a href="?bref=Job.40.1-41.34">Jb 40–41</a>), and primeval chaos (<a href="?bref=Ps.74.12-14">Pss 74:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.8-10">89:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>The later prophets indicated that God is Lord or King of history because he directs the affairs of humans and nations (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.15-18">1 Kgs 19:15-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.10.5-9">Is 10:5-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Am 9:7</a>) and he is the Lord of universal morality (<a href="?bref=Ezek.25.1-32.32">Ez 25–32</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2.16">Am 1:3–2:16</a>). But he is especially the Lord of Israel; his expressed will represents their civil and religious constitution and demands absolute obedience (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2">Ex 20:2</a>). The divine sovereignty was, however, Israel’s comfort under oppression and hope for the future, when a triumphant Day of the Lord would right its wrongs, punish its oppressors, and restore its glory (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4,11-12">Is 2:2-4, 11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.8">34:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.30.1-5">Ez 30:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.31-3.1">Jl 2:31–3:1</a>).</p>
<p>In the Septuagint, the regular expression for “Lord/ lord/master” is <span class="greek">kurios</span><span class="ital">,</span> which in the Greek NT also is used of masters, husbands, and rulers (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.11">Mt 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.21">Lk 14:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.25.26">Acts 25:26</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.6">1 Pt 3:6</a>); of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.25">Mt 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.2">Heb 8:2</a>); and of pagan gods (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.5">1 Cor 8:5</a>). It is used of Jesus as a customary title of respect (“sir,” <a href="?bref=Matt.8.2">Mt 8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.25">15:25</a>); it also retains its Septuagint associations of faith, reverence, and worship (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.3">Mt 3:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.13">Lk 7:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.14">Acts 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.10">9:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.13-14">1 Cor 6:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.2.3">Heb 2:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.7">Jas 5:7</a>); it appears in phrases like “the Lord Jesus,” “the Lord’s Day,” “the Lord’s Table,” “the Spirit of the Lord” (who is also “Lord,” <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17">2 Cor 3:17</a>), “in the Lord,” “from the Lord,” “light in the Lord,” “boast in the Lord.” Sometimes it is not clear whether God or Christ is intended (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.31">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.21">2 Cor 8:21</a>). The title is attributed to Jesus himself in <a href="?bref=John.13.13-14">John 13:13-14</a>; in <a href="?bref=John.20.28">John 20:28</a> Jesus accepts the title “My Lord and my God!”</p>
<p>In the first Christian sermon Jesus’ lordship is made central to salvation (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.21">Acts 2:21</a>). It appears that the public confession of Jesus as Lord was the approved focus and expression of Christian faith, and the basis of membership in the apostolic church (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.31">Acts 16:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.9">Rom 10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.3">1 Cor 12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.11">Phil 2:11</a>). Thus, it could become more a formal statement than a sincere expression of belief—hence, the warnings in <a href="?bref=Matt.7.21">Matthew 7:21</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.6.46">Luke 6:46</a>.</p>
<p>From the first, such a confession was fraught with meaning. In common usage “lord” reflected the slave system and implied the absolute power exercised by the master over the purchased slave. So Paul unhesitatingly expounds the moral implications of Christian redemption (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.19-20">1 Cor 6:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.22-23">7:22-23</a>; <span class="ital">see</span> photo). To Jewish minds, the title had messianic overtones of kingship and authority (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.41-44">Lk 20:41-44</a>), offending both Jews and Romans. Politically, “Lord” was a title claimed by Caesar. Therefore, it is significant that Jesus is called “King of kings and Lord of lords” during the age of Domitian when Caesar worship was mandated (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.14">Rv 17:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.16">19:16</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="LordJesusChristWrittenAsANomenSacrum"/>
<p>Among Greek-speaking Jews of the dispersion, familiar with the Septuagint, as among Gentiles, for whom “Lord” was the customary title for the many gods of polytheism, the application to Jesus of the epithet belonging to godhead was blasphemous, especially when associated with “Son of God,” prayer, praise, total devotion, and hope (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.5-6">1 Cor 8:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.2.9-11">Phil 2:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.14-17">1 Thes 4:14-17</a>). On every level, therefore, the adoring tribute given to Jesus was loaded not only with spiritual meaning but with positive and imminent danger.</p>

<p class="h1">LORD’S DAY, The</p>
<p class="fl">Expression occurring once in the NT (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.10">Rv 1:10</a>), where John says, “On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit” (<span class="sc">niv</span>); synonym for “Sunday” in modern usage.</p>
<p>The earliest reference to Christian activity on Sunday comes in a brief allusion Paul makes to “the first day of the week” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.2">1 Cor 16:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). He instructs individual members of the church in Corinth to remember their poverty-stricken fellow believers in Jerusalem by setting aside a sum of money each Sunday.</p>
<p>Why Sunday? Obviously the first day of the week had taken on a special significance among Christians in Corinth before Paul wrote this letter (<span class="era">AD</span> 55–56), and he makes it clear that the observance was not merely local (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1">1 Cor 16:1</a>). Sunday was the day when special church meetings took place (Paul alludes several times to these in 1 Cor—see <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.4">5:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.18-20">11:18-20</a>). Collections were taken on these occasions to meet local needs (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.7-14">1 Cor 9:7-14</a>). So Paul was saying, “When the collection bag comes around on Sundays, and you are reminded of your local needs, set aside something—privately—for the needs of your brethren in Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>There is a more detailed account of a Christian Sunday meeting in <a href="?bref=Acts.20.6-12">Acts 20:6-12</a>. The all-night service Luke describes there took place in Troas about three years after Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. Luke’s main aim is to tell the story of sleepy Eutychus’s miraculous recovery, so some of the details of the meeting that would interest us most are missing. Nevertheless, the account is full enough to indicate the kind of things the first Christians did when they met together on Sundays.</p>
<p>The fact that Luke mentions the day of the week at all is significant. Elsewhere he rarely identifies a day, unless it is a Sabbath or a special feast. His word for “gathered” (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.7">Acts 20:7</a>) is important too. It is a semitechnical term the NT uses for Christians gathered together for worship (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.4">1 Cor 5:4</a>). So this was not a special meeting convened to hear Paul (who had already been in town six days) but a regular weekly event. The church in Troas may have met daily, like the church in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.42,46">Acts 2:42, 46</a>), but the Sunday meeting was obviously treated as a special occasion.</p>
<p>Luke uses the same word to describe Paul’s preaching (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.7">Acts 20:7</a>) that he used earlier for the apostle’s preaching ministry in the synagogues at Ephesus and Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.19.8">19:8</a>). This preserves an interesting link between the Jewish Sabbath and the Christian Sunday. When a local church separated from the synagogue, it probably modeled its worship on synagogue practice. Although the three main components of synagogue worship (Scripture reading, teaching, and prayer) are not found together in the few NT accounts of Christian worship, each is separately attested.</p>
<p>The main purpose behind the church’s Sunday meeting at Troas, however, was distinctively Christian. It was “to break bread” (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.7">Acts 20:7</a>), the NT’s term for eating the Lord’s Supper (and including, probably, the less formal table fellowship of the love feast—cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.17-34">1 Cor 11:17-34</a>). The Lord’s Supper very quickly became a focal point of the early church’s Sunday worship. As a memorial of the resurrection and the promise of Christ’s presence in the worshiping fellowship, it was an obviously appropriate Christian way of celebrating the first day of the week.</p>
<p>The third clear reference to Sunday in the NT (and the only one that calls it the Lord’s Day) takes us from the Turkish mainland to the Aegean island of Patmos, probably about 40 years after Paul’s visit to Troas. In <a href="?bref=Rev.1.10">Revelation 1:10</a> John describes how he was worshiping on the Lord’s Day when he received his great vision. It is just possible that the expression “Lord’s Day” here means Easter, or even the great day of God’s judgment that the OT prophets foretold, but in view of the way later Christian writers used this phrase, it is far more likely to mean simply “Sunday.”</p>
<p>The immediate context of <a href="?bref=Rev.1.10">Revelation 1:10</a> makes it clear that John saw Sunday as the Lord’s Day because on it Christians expressed together their total commitment to Jesus as Lord and Master (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.8">Rv 1:8</a>). It was Jesus’ resurrection on the first day of the week that demonstrated his lordship most clearly (see <a href="?bref=Rev.1.18">Rv 1:18</a> and <a href="?bref=John.20.25-28">Jn 20:25-28</a>). One day the whole world will have to acknowledge that he is “King of kings and Lord of lords” (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.16">Rv 19:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Phil.2.11">Phil 2:11</a>), but in the meantime it is in the church’s worship that his lordship is recognized.</p>

  <title>Lord’s Prayer, the*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">LORD’S PRAYER, The*</p>
<p class="fl">Pattern for prayer Jesus gave his followers to use. There are two versions of the Lord’s Prayer (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.9-13">Mt 6:9-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.2-4">Lk 11:2-4</a>). The former is included in the Sermon on the Mount; the latter is Jesus’ response to a disciple’s request that he teach them to pray. There are considerable differences between the two versions.</p>
<p>Some scholars devote a good deal of attention to the question of which is the earlier of the two. Generally speaking, they conclude that in most points Luke’s is the earlier form. This is largely because it is shorter, and there is no reason why someone should leave out anything in a prayer as short as this, whereas it is easy to see why additions might be made. These scholars usually hold that in some of the wording Matthew is likely to have retained the earlier form.</p>
<p>This approach, however, does not take into account the fact that Jesus seems to have regarded the prayer as a pattern, not as a formula. In Matthew he introduces it with the words “Pray then like this.” If the prayer was seriously meant as a model, it is unlikely that it would be recited only once. On the contrary, it is to be expected that Jesus would have used it on a number of occasions. And if he seriously meant people to pray “in this way” (and not invariably in these words), then variations in the wording are to be expected.</p>
<p>Some recent writers regard the whole prayer as eschatological—that is, concerned with the end of the world. They take the petition “Thy kingdom come” as central and understand all the other petitions to refer in one way or another to the coming kingdom. The prayer about hallowing the name is then seen as a prayer for the destruction of God’s enemies who do not revere his holiness; the line about the bread becomes a petition for the messianic banquet; and so on. But this is to take the words in an unnatural sense. Christians are, of course, always living in the “last days,” and there is no reason why they should not see an application of Jesus’ words to the eschatological situation. It seems much more probable, however, that we should understand the prayer with reference to the help we need in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="poetry-1-sp">Our Father which art in heaven,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Hallowed be thy name.</p>
<p class="poetry-1">Thy kingdom come.</p>
<p class="poetry-1">Thy will be done in earth,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">as it is in heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry-1">Give us this day our daily bread.</p>
<p class="poetry-1">And forgive us our debts,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">as we forgive our debtors.</p>
<p class="poetry-1">And lead us not into temptation,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">but deliver us from evil:</p>
<p class="poetry-1">For thine is the kingdom,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">and the power,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">and the glory, for ever.</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Amen.</p>
<p class="sp">The first person singular pronoun is not used anywhere in the prayer. We say, “Our Father, . . . give us. . . .” This prayer is meant for a community. It may profitably be used by an individual, but it is not meant as an aid to private devotion. It is a prayer to be said by God’s people; it is the prayer of the Christian family.</p>
<p>In Matthew the opening words are “Our Father in heaven,” whereas Luke has simply “Father.” Those who pray like this are members of a family, and they look to God as the head of the family, one who is bound to them by ties of love. Matthew’s “in heaven” brings out something of his dignity, and this is seen also in the petition “Hallowed [Honored] be thy name” (identical in the two). In antiquity “the name” meant far more than it does to us. In some way it summed up the whole person. Thus this petition is more than a prayer that people will use the name of God reverently rather than blasphemously (though that is important and is included). It looks for people to have a reverent attitude to all that God stands for. They should have a proper humility before God, being ready to honor him as he is in all his holiness.</p>
<p>“Thy kingdom come” is the petition that most of all looks for the eschatological activity of God. Christians have always longed for the day when God will overthrow the kingdoms of this earth and when all will become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.15">Rv 11:15</a>). This is included in the meaning of the petition. But there is another sense in which the kingdom is a present reality, a kingdom that is now in human hearts and lives. This aspect of the kingdom is brought out in the words added in Matthew’s version, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.10">Mt 6:10</a>). The servant of God looks for the rule of God to become actual in more and more lives.</p>
<p>In the petition about bread Jesus is concerned with the material necessities of daily life. Jesus’ followers are, it is true, not to be anxious about the things they need to eat and to wear (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.25">Mt 6:25</a>). But Jesus also taught that they should constantly look to God for such needs to be supplied (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.6.32-33">32-33</a>). The view that the messianic banquet is in mind does not reckon with the fact that the banquet is regarded as a feast, while it is bread, not some festive food, that is mentioned here. The big problem in this petition is the meaning of the word usually translated “daily.” It is an exceedingly rare word, and many scholars think that it was coined by Christians. Since it is impossible to establish meaning from the way it is used, discussions center on its derivation. It could mean any number of things: “daily,” “for today,” “for the coming day,” “for tomorrow,” or “necessary.” The traditional understanding, “daily,” seems most probable. But however we translate it, the prayer is for the simple and present necessities of life. Jesus was counseling his followers to pray for necessities, not luxuries, and for what is needed now, not a great store for many days to come. By confining the petition to present needs, Jesus taught a day-by-day dependence on God.</p>
<p>The petition about forgiveness differs slightly in the two accounts. In Matthew it is “Forgive us our debts,” while Luke has “Forgive us our sins.” Without question it is the forgiveness of sins that is in mind, but the Matthean form sees sin as an indebtedness. We owe it to God to live uprightly. He has provided all we need to do this. So when we sin, we become debtors. The sinner has failed to fulfill his obligations, what he “owes.” Matthew goes on to say, “as we also have forgiven our debtors,” and Luke, “for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to us.” The tense in Matthew indicates that the person praying is not only ready to forgive but has already forgiven those who have sinned against him; in Luke, that he habitually forgives. Further, he does so in the case of every debtor.</p>
<p>In neither form of the prayer is it implied that human forgiveness earns God’s forgiveness. The NT makes it clear that God forgives on account of his mercy, shown in Christ’s dying for us on the cross. Nothing we do can merit forgiveness. There is also the thought that those who seek forgiveness should show a forgiving spirit. How can we claim the forgiveness of our sins if we do not forgive others who sin against us?</p>
<p>There is dispute as to the precise meaning of the petition traditionally translated “lead us not into temptation.” Some favor a rendering like that of the <span class="sc">neb</span>, “do not bring us to the test.” The word usually understood as “temptation” does sometimes mean a proving or a testing. But it is the kind of testing that the evil one engages in, testing with a view to failure. It is thus the normal word to be used when temptation is in mind. If the whole prayer is to be understood eschatologically, then “do not bring us to the test” is no doubt the way this petition should be taken. The great testing time that comes with the upsurge of evil in the last days is something from which every Christian naturally shrinks, and the prayer would give expression to this. But it is much more likely that the prayer refers to life here and now. Even so, it may mean “severe trial,” and some scholars favor this. They think that Jesus was counseling his followers to pray for a quiet life in which they would not meet serious misfortune. But a prayer to be delivered from temptation is much more likely. Christians know their weakness and readiness to sin, so pray that they may be kept from the temptation to go astray. It is true that God does not tempt people (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.13">Jas 1:13</a>). But it is also true that it is important for the believer to avoid evil. One should not see how close to sinning one can come without actually doing it, but one should keep as far away from it as possible (cf., e.g., <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.18">1 Cor 6:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.14">10:14</a>).</p>
<p>Matthew adds, “but deliver us from evil” (as do some manuscripts of Luke). This is a further development of the prayer just offered. There is uncertainty as to whether the last word means “evil” generally or “the evil one.” Either meaning is possible. Christians pray that they may not be tempted, and this leads naturally to the thought either that they may not become the prey of evil or that they may be free from the domination of the devil. It is the general thrust of Jesus’ teaching that should decide the point, not the precise language used here.</p>
<p>This is where the prayer ends in Luke and in the oldest manuscripts of Matthew. Few would doubt that here is where the prayer ended in the teaching of our Lord. But many manuscripts, some of them fairly old, add the familiar words, “for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever.” This is the kind of doxology that is often found in prayers in antiquity, both Jewish (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.11">1 Chr 29:11</a>) and Christian. The early Christians used the Lord’s Prayer in worship services and doubtless found this a splendid way to end it. In time, what was so acceptable in worship found its way into some of the manuscripts. We may well continue to end the prayer in this way. It is good to remind ourselves that all ultimate sovereignty, power, and glory belong to God forever. But we should not see this as part of the prayer Jesus taught his followers to use.</p>

<p class="fl">The supper Jesus shared with his disciples a few hours before he was arrested and taken to his trial and death (thus often called “The Last Supper”); the ceremony of partaking of the bread and wine that Christians have come to call the Lord’s Supper (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.20">1 Cor 11:20</a>), the breaking of bread (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.42,46">Acts 2:42, 46</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.7">20:7</a>), Holy Communion (from the expression of <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16">1 Cor 10:16</a>), the Eucharist (the Greek word for “thanksgiving,” see <a href="?bref=Mark.14.23">Mk 14:23</a>), or the Mass. The apostle Paul speaks of handing on what he had “received from the Lord” concerning the institution of this supper “on the night when he was betrayed.” Like Luke, Paul gives the Lord’s command to his disciples: “Do this in remembrance of me” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.24-25">1 Cor 11:24-25</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>, the early Christians from the beginning of the life of the church met regularly for “the breaking of bread.”</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheAccountsoftheInstitution">The Accounts of the Institution</p>
<p class="fl">The institution of the Lord’s Supper is recorded in <a href="?bref=Matt.26.26-30">Matthew 26:26-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-26">Mark 14:22-26</a>; and <a href="?bref=Luke.22.14-20">Luke 22:14-20</a>. John’s Gospel (ch <a href="?bref=John.13.1-38">13</a>) tells of the Last Supper Jesus shared with his disciples, of his washing the disciples’ feet and the teaching associated with that, but does not mention his institution of Communion. Many see the Lord’s Supper reflected in the teaching of <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">John 6</a>, following the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 and Jesus’ speaking of himself as “the bread of life,” but this is open to question. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.23-26">First Corinthians 11:23-26</a> gives Paul’s version of the institution, which he speaks of as “receiving” and “delivering” to the Corinthian Christians.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Luke.22.17-18">Luke 22:17-18</a> Jesus is said to have passed the cup to the disciples with the words “Take this, and divide it among yourselves” before taking the bread and giving it to them. In most early manuscripts there is then a second cup after the giving of the bread. This difference of Luke from the other Gospels and from Paul has been variously explained, but whether there are two cups of wine at the supper or a different order in the giving of the bread and the wine, it makes no essential difference to the fact and the meaning of the institution.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTimeoftheInstitution">The Time of the Institution</p>
<p class="fl">All of the narratives—the three Gospels and 1 Corinthians—speak of the Last Supper when the Eucharist was instituted as taking place a few hours before Jesus’ arrest. All four Gospels tell, in this context, of Jesus’ words to his disciples, about Judas’s betrayal, and about Jesus telling Peter that he would deny his Master. Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.17-20">Mt 26:17-20</a>), Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.12-17">Mk 14:12-17</a>), and Luke (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.7-14">Lk 22:7-14</a>) all say clearly that this Last Supper was prepared by the disciples and kept by Jesus with them as a Passover meal. John speaks of it as happening “before the feast of the Passover” and then says that at the time of the trial of Jesus before Pilate the Jewish leaders “did not enter the praetorium, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover” (<a href="?bref=John.13.1">Jn 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.28">18:28</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Various explanations of this difference between John and the other Gospels have been suggested, such as that different groups of the Jews kept the Passover at different times, that the meal in the upper room was not strictly a Passover but a fellowship meal at the Passover season, or that Jesus deliberately chose for his own special reasons to celebrate the Passover before the normal time. <a href="?bref=Luke.22.15">Luke 22:15</a> gives his words, “I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). However the differences between the Gospels may be explained, and whenever the gathering around the table took place, it is clear that the Last Supper had the significance of a Passover meal.</p>
<p>Thus, there is an inevitable similarity between the celebration of the Passover as a feast of the old covenant and the Lord’s Supper as a feast of the new. The former looks back with thankful remembrance to the people’s redemption and liberation from Egypt by the act of God, associated with the sacrifice of the Passover lamb. The latter looks back with thankful remembrance to redemption by the act of God through the sacrifice of Christ. The apostle Paul links the two: “Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="WordsandActionsoftheInstitution">Words and Actions of the Institution</p>
<p class="fl">The association of the Last Supper with the Passover points to the importance of the OT background for our understanding of the meaning of the Lord’s Supper. This OT background is equally important in understanding the words and actions of Jesus in the upper room.</p>
<p class="h3">“This is my body.”</p>
<p class="fl">The actions of Jesus in taking the bread are described similarly in Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.26">Mt 26:26</a>), Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.22">Mk 14:22</a>), Luke (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.19">Lk 22:19</a>), and 1 Corinthians (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.23-24">1 Cor 11:23-24</a>). Jesus took the bread, gave thanks to God (“blessing” has the same meaning in the biblical context), and broke it. It is noteworthy that the same three actions are described in the records of the feeding of the 5,000 and of the 4,000 (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.41">Mk 6:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.6">8:6</a>). What he said, according to all four accounts of the Last Supper, was “This is my body.” Christians in Catholic, Orthodox, and various Protestant traditions have differed in their understanding of the precise meaning of those words. What is clear is that in the taking of the bread there is the realization of Jesus’ giving himself, his body to be broken on the cross, his life offered that we, in and through him, might have life. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.24">First Corinthians 11:24</a> gives the words as “This is my body which is for you,” and some early manuscripts have “broken for you.”</p>
<p class="h3">“Do this in remembrance of me.”</p>
<p class="fl">This specific instruction is found only in <a href="?bref=Luke.22.19">Luke 22:19</a> and <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.24">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>. Some have argued that the absence of the words in the other Gospel records indicates that it was not the explicit intention of the Lord that what he did at the Last Supper was to be repeated as a Christian sacrament. Yet all the Gospels were written when the breaking of bread had been a regular practice in the life of the church for years. Matthew and Mark, therefore, may have thought it unnecessary to express Jesus’ intention with those words. They were taken for granted.</p>
<p>It must also be said that these words have been interpreted differently in various Christian traditions. Many Protestant Christians have understood them to mean that in the Holy Communion we are to recall with great thankfulness that Christ loved us and gave himself to die for us. In the Roman Catholic Church the word “remembrance” has been understood as a memorial before God, a representing of the sacrifice of Christ before the Father. “This do” has been interpreted as meaning “offer this,” and even in the second century Christian writers spoke of the Eucharist as a “sacrifice.” Protestant Christians generally have felt the danger of this way of speaking; it can detract from, or even deny, the biblical understanding of the sacrifice of Christ having been offered once and for all, sufficiently atoning for the sins of the world (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.7.27">Heb 7:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.12">9:12</a>). It must be said, however, that many Roman Catholic statements today stress the sufficiency and completeness of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross; and many Protestant scholars, while not wishing to introduce a sacrificial understanding of the Lord’s Supper, stress that “remembrance” is more than simply calling to mind a past action. In biblical thinking “remembrance” often involves a realization and appropriation in the present of what has been done or what has proved true in the past (see <a href="?bref=Ps.98.3">Pss 98:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.45">106:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.112.6">112:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.12.1">Eccl 12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.57.11">Is 57:11</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">“This is my blood of the [new] covenant.”</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus took the cup of wine, gave thanks, and handed it to his disciples for them all to drink. In essence the four accounts of the institution agree. Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>) and Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mk 14:24</a>) give the words of Jesus as “This is my blood of the [new] covenant.” <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Luke 22:20</a> has “This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood,” and <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Corinthians 11:25</a> is similar to this. This refers back to the ritual of making a covenant with the offering of sacrifice, as the covenant between God and Israel after the exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-8">Ex 24:1-8</a>). Implied also is that the prophetic hope of the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>) was fulfilled in Jesus, as <a href="?bref=Heb.8.1-9.28">Hebrews 8–9</a> describes.</p>
<p class="h3">“Poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”</p>
<p class="fl">The meaning of the death of Jesus as a sacrifice is linked with the understanding of the Passover and of the covenant. It is also linked with what <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> says of the suffering Servant making himself “an offering for sin” (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.10">Is 53:10</a>). <a href="?bref=Luke.22.37">Luke 22:37</a> includes among the words of Jesus in the upper room the statement, “This scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was reckoned with transgressors.’ ” That verse, <a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">Isaiah 53:12</a>, also says, “he poured out his soul to death” and “he bore the sin of many.” <a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mark 14:24</a> appears to allude to these Scriptures when Jesus speaks of his blood “poured out for many,” and <a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Matthew 26:28</a> adds “for the forgiveness of sins.”</p>
<p class="h3">Expectation for the Future</p>
<p class="fl">All four accounts of the Last Supper associate, though in different ways, an expectation for the future with the institution of the Eucharist. In <a href="?bref=Mark.14.25">Mark 14:25</a> it comes in the words of Jesus, “Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). In <a href="?bref=Matt.26.29">Matthew 26:29</a> that future drinking of the fruit of the vine is said to be “with you in my Father’s kingdom.” In <a href="?bref=Luke.22.18">Luke 22:18</a> there are similar words, and two verses earlier the statement about fulfilling the Passover “in the kingdom of God.” All of these can be understood as the ultimate realization of another hope that both OT and later Jewish apocalyptic writings set forward: the messianic banquet, the feast on the mountain of the Lord of which <a href="?bref=Isa.25.6">Isaiah 25:6</a> speaks. In <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.26">1 Corinthians 11:26</a> that future hope is quite explicitly that of Christ’s second coming; for, says the apostle, “As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePracticeoftheEarlyChurch">The Practice of the Early Church</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Acts.2.42">Acts 2:42</a>, after the record of what happened at Pentecost, it says “they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). Further, “day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts” (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Two questions are raised about these words and the practice that lay behind them. Do they simply mean that the Christians shared fellowship meals together? <a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a> seems to speak of breaking bread and partaking of food as two separate actions. Moreover, <a href="?bref=Acts.20.7">Acts 20:7</a> in speaking of Christians at Troas “on the first day of the week . . . gathered together to break bread” seems clearly to allude to a Christian service and not just a meal. From <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.1-33">1 Corinthians 10</a> and perhaps from the reference to “love feasts” in <a href="?bref=Jude.1.12">Jude 12</a>, we may reasonably deduce that a meal in Christian fellowship and the celebration of the Lord’s Supper often took place together. A second question is whether the earliest “breaking of bread,” as in the Jerusalem church, may have been a different rite from that with the bread and wine, the former recalling the fellowship of the disciples with the risen Lord, the latter especially recalling his sacrificial death. There is no direct evidence to support such a view. The Lord’s Supper to which the Gospels bear witness involved the breaking of bread and the sharing of the cup in remembrance of the blood of Christ “poured out for many.” We may assume, too, that the tradition that the apostle Paul received, followed, and passed on to others went back to his earliest years as a Christian and so involved the breaking of the bread and the sharing of the cup in remembrance of Christ, and thus proclaiming the Lord’s death until his return.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PaulsTeaching">Paul’s Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">In Paul’s teaching, as in the Gospels, the Lord’s Supper clearly involves the backward look in thankful remembrance for the sacrifice of Christ offered once for all for the sins of the world, the realization of the Lord being with his people in the present, and the look forward in hope. Other aspects of teaching relating to the Eucharist are brought out in <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.1-11.34">1 Corinthians 10–11</a>. The teaching arises from practical aspects of the situation in the Corinthian church; the need to be aware of the danger of turning back in any way to the worship of idols; and the potential divisions in the Christian fellowship, including that between rich and poor.</p>
<p class="h3">Fellowship with Christ</p>
<p class="fl">To partake of the bread and to drink of the cup is spoken of as having part with Christ, as sharing in sacrificial meals would mean partaking at “the table of demons” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.21">1 Cor 10:21</a>). “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16">16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). “Participation” is the translation of the Greek word <span class="greek">koinonia</span><span class="ital">,</span> so often rendered “fellowship” in NT passages. When the Lord’s Supper was celebrated, there must often have been a recalling not only of the Last Supper on the night before Jesus died, but also of his presence with his disciples on the first Easter and his making himself known to them in the breaking of the bread (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.30-35">Lk 24:30-35</a>). They continued to experience that fellowship with him.</p>
<p class="h3">Feeding on Christ</p>
<p class="fl">Of the two Christian sacraments, baptism has a once-for-all nature, while Holy Communion is repeated. The life of Christ has been offered for sins once for all on the cross, and we find life in turning to him—baptism signifies that. At the same time that life is also offered to us constantly for the nourishing of our spiritual lives day by day—of this regular feeding on Christ the Eucharist speaks. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.3-4">First Corinthians 10:3-4</a> speaks of “supernatural food” and “supernatural drink” and finds in the events at the sea and in the wilderness in the days of Moses foreshadowings of what Christians find in Christ. Christ said, “I am the bread of life,” and “My flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed”; thus what we have in John’s Gospel (<a href="?bref=John.6.35,55">Jn 6:35, 55</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) is close to what Paul implies about the Lord’s Supper expressing the truth of Christians spiritually feeding on Christ.</p>

<p class="h1">LOT</p>
<p class="fl">Abraham’s nephew; progenitor of both the Moabites and the Ammonites. Like Abraham, he was born in Ur. When his father died, he was put in the care of his grandfather Terah, and accompanied him and his uncle Abram to Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.27-32">Gn 11:27-32</a>). After the death of Terah, he joined Abram in the journey to Canaan and subsequently to Egypt and back to Canaan.</p>
<p>By the time the pair returned to Canaan, their flocks and herds were too numerous for them to live together in a single area. Generously, Abram gave Lot his choice of where he would like to settle; Lot chose the fertile plain of the Jordan, which was like a “garden of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.10">Gn 13:10</a>) before the divine judgment and catastrophe fell on the region. Thus, Lot became increasingly involved with and contaminated by the corruption of the cities of the plain and took up his residence in Sodom.</p>
<p>While Lot was living in Sodom, four Mesopotamian kings (probably of small city-states) defeated the kings of the five towns in the area in battle, and in the subsequent plundering they carried off Lot and his family and possessions. When word of the loss reached Abram, he launched a rearguard action against the invaders and recovered all the prisoners and the loot at Hobah, north of Damascus (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Gn 14</a>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, two angelic visitors called on Lot in Sodom to hasten his departure from the doomed city. The homosexual attack on them illustrated the depravity of the city, and Lot’s willingness to sacrifice his daughters shows how the corruption of his environment was rubbing off on him. As further evidence of the evil influence, Lot was unwilling to leave Sodom; his future sons-in-law refused to accompany him; and his wife looked back and was turned to a pillar of salt (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">Gn 19</a>).</p>
<p>The sequel to the story was as sordid as the scene at Lot’s door. His daughters, despairing of husbands of their own, got him drunk enough to engage in sexual relations with them. The result was the birth of two sons, Moab and Ben-ammi, ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites, inveterate enemies of Israel (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.30-38">Gn 19:30-38</a>).</p>
<p>In spite of his waywardness the NT declares that Lot was a “righteous man” (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.7-9">2 Pt 2:7-9</a>), apparently meaning that his faith in God was sufficient to guarantee his salvation. To critics who question the historicity of Lot and the destruction of Sodom, it must be noted that Jesus vouched for both in <a href="?bref=Luke.17.28-29">Luke 17:28-29</a>.</p>

<p class="h1">LOTS, Casting of</p>
<p class="fl">Practice common in the OT, less common in the NT prior to Pentecost, and absent in the biblical narrative after Pentecost.</p>
<p>In the Bible the practice was used in a variety of circumstances, including (1) the selection of the scapegoat (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.8-10">Lv 16:8-10</a>); (2) the allocation of the tribal inheritance in the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.26.55-56">Nm 26:55-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.14.2">Jos 14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.3">Jgs 1:3</a>); (3) the determination of the families who had to relocate to give a proper distribution of the populace or of those warriors who had to go to war where only a percentage was required (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.9">Jgs 20:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.11.1">Neh 11:1</a>); (4) the order of the priests and their duties (<a href="?bref=1Chr.24.5-19">1 Chr 24:5-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.10.34">Neh 10:34</a>); (5) the determination of an offender (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.14-18">Jos 7:14-18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.18.18">Prv 18:18</a>).</p>
<p>According to biblical usage, lots seem to have been used only when the decision was important and where wisdom or biblical injunctions did not give sufficient guidance. One of the advantages of the casting of lots was the impartiality of the choice. It was held that the Lord directed the lots (<a href="?bref=Pr.16.33">Prv 16:33</a>). The method of casting lots is not specified or described and seems to have varied according to the need of the situation (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.16.8">Lv 16:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.55-56">Nm 26:55-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.20.9">Jgs 20:9</a>).</p>
<p>The practice of casting lots was never condemned by God and on several occasions was sanctioned by him (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.8">Lv 16:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.18">Prv 18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.17">Is 34:17</a>). The principle behind the procedure is set forth in <a href="?bref=Pr.16.33">Proverbs 16:33</a>, which affirms that the disposition or result of the lot is determined by God; therefore, the theory was that the lot pronounced the will of God.</p>
<p>In the NT the soldiers cast lots over Jesus’ garments (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.35">Mt 27:35</a>), and the disciples cast lots when they selected Matthias to the apostleship in place of Judas (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.26">Acts 1:26</a>). After the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the church, the practice of casting lots ceased. Some scholars think that there was no further need for the practice to continue, as the Holy Spirit guided the church in its decisions.</p>

<p class="fl">Prominent virtue in Christian theology and ethics. It is therefore important to understand clearly this exceedingly important term.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Sexual love <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">ahabah</span> and <span class="hebrew">dod</span><span class="ital">)</span> is spoken of in the stories of Adam and Eve and of Jacob and Rachel, as well as in the Song of Songs. A higher form of love, involving loyalty, steadfastness, and kindness, is expressed by the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">hesed</span><span class="ital">,</span> which is sometimes rendered “loyalty” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.26">2 Sm 22:26</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), but more often “steadfast love” or “loving-kindness.”</p>
<p>The connotation of this significant word is clear in <a href="?bref=Hos.2.19-20">Hosea 2:19-20</a>: “I will make you my wife forever, showing you righteousness and justice, unfailing love and compassion. I will be faithful to you and make you mine, and you will finally know me as <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>); in <a href="?bref=Job.6.14-15">Job 6:14-15</a>, where kindness is compared with treachery; and in <a href="?bref=1Sam.20.8">1 Samuel 20:8</a>, which speaks of covenanted kindness. This unshakable, steadfast love of God is contrasted with the unpredictable, capricious moods of heathen deities. <span class="hebrew">Hesed</span> is not an emotional response to beauty, merit, or kindness but rather a moral attitude dedicated to another’s good, whether or not that other is lovable, worthy, or responsive (see <a href="?bref=Deut.7.7-9">Dt 7:7-9</a>).</p>
<p>This enduring loyalty, rooted in an unswerving purpose of good, could be stern, determined to discipline a wayward people, as several prophets warned. But God’s love does not change. Through exile and failure it persisted with infinite patience, neither condoning evil nor abandoning the evildoers. It has within it kindness, tenderness, and compassion (<a href="?bref=Ps.86.15">Pss 86:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.103.1-18">103:1-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.136.1-26">136</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.11.1-4">Hos 11:1-4</a>), but its chief characteristic is an accepted moral obligation for another’s welfare.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, response was expected. The Law enjoined wholehearted love and gratitude for God’s choosing and redeeming of Israel (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.20-25">Dt 6:20-25</a>). This was to be shown in worship and especially in humane treatment of the poor, the defenseless, the resident alien, slaves, widows, and all suffering oppression and cruelty. Hosea similarly expected steadfast love among people to result from the steadfast love of God toward people (<a href="?bref=Hos.6.6">Hos 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.7.1-7">7:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.10.12-13">10:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>Love for God and for “your neighbor as yourself” (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18</a>) are thus linked in Israel’s law and prophecy. While much love of another kind lies within the OT, these are the major points: God’s loving initiative, the moral quality of love, and the close relationship between love for God with loving others.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Of the Greek words available to describe love, <span class="greek">eros</span> (sexual love) does not occur in the NT. <span class="greek">Phileo</span><span class="ital">,</span> connoting natural affection, occurs some 25 times, with <span class="greek">philadelphia</span> (brotherly love) five times, and <span class="greek">philia</span> (friendship) only in <a href="?bref=Jas.4.4">James 4:4</a>. <span class="greek">Storge</span><span class="ital">,</span> connoting natural affection between relatives, appears occasionally in compounds. By far the most frequent word is <span class="greek">agape</span><span class="ital">,</span> generally assumed to mean moral goodwill that proceeds from esteem, principle, or duty rather than attraction of charm. <span class="greek">Agape</span> is very similar in meaning to <span class="hebrew">hesed</span> in that both denote dedication. <span class="greek">Agape</span> specifically means to love the undeserving, despite disappointment and rejection. The difference between <span class="greek">agapao</span> and <span class="greek">phileo</span> is difficult to sustain in all passages. <span class="greek">Agape</span> is especially appropriate for divine love. <span class="greek">Agape</span> was long believed to be a Christian coinage, but pagan occurrences have recently been claimed. The verb <span class="greek">agapao</span> was frequent in the Greek OT. Though <span class="greek">agape</span> has more to do with moral principle than with inclination or liking, it never means the cold religious kindness shown from duty alone, as scriptural examples abundantly prove.</p>
<p class="h3">In the Synoptic Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">In a sinful and suffering world, Jesus’ divine love showed itself supremely in compassion and healing for the distressed and in redemptive concern for the alienated and the self-despairing. Hence, the kingdom Christ proclaimed offered good news to the poor, captives, blind, and oppressed (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.2-5">Mt 11:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">Lk 4:18</a>), while the attitude of Jesus toward those ostracized, despised, or grieving over sin in some far country of the soul assured them of forgiveness and a welcome return to the Father’s house (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.1-32">Lk 15</a>). Such forgiveness was free, its only precondition being readiness to receive it in repentance and faith.</p>
<p>Moreover, the good news of divine love does impose its own obligation: to love God and to love others as God does (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.44-48">Mt 5:44-48</a>). The first and greatest commandment in God’s law is “You shall love the Lord your God. . . . And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets” (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.35-40">Mt 22:35-40</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Dt 6:5</a>).</p>
<p>The first commandment is not identical with, lost in, or only fulfilled through the second; it is separate and primary. What Jesus meant by loving God is indicated by his own habits of public worship, private prayer, and absolute obedience. Love for one’s neighbor is nowhere defined but everywhere illustrated. In the parable of the good Samaritan, “neighbor” is shown to mean anyone near enough to help, and love involves whatever service the neighbor’s situation demands. The parable of the sheep and goats shows love feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and the imprisoned. In the untiring example of Jesus, love heals, teaches, adapts instruction to the hearers by parable and symbolic language, defends those criticized or despised, pronounces forgiveness, comforts the bereaved, befriends the lonely. We are to love others as he has loved us and as we love ourselves. Such imaginative transfer of self-love does good without expecting return, never returns ill treatment, ensures unfailing courtesy even to the lowliest, sustains thoughtful understanding that tempers judgment.</p>
<p>To Jesus, the outstanding sin was lovelessness, the willful omission of any possible good, passing by on the other side while others suffer, ignoring the destitute at one’s gate, withholding forgiveness. Lovelessness was made worse by self-righteousness, censoriousness, the religious insensitivity that ignores another’s distress to preserve some petty ritual regulation. In the end, obedience to or neglect of the law of love will determine everyone’s eternal destiny (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">Mt 25:31-46</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In the Writings of Paul</p>
<p class="fl">The apostolic church quickly grasped the revolutionary principle that love is enough. Paul’s declaration that love fulfills the whole law is almost a quotation from Jesus. His exposition of various commandments against adultery, killing, stealing, and coveting is summarized in loving, because love can do no wrong to a neighbor (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.8-10">Rom 13:8-10</a>). <a href="?bref=Eph.4.25-5.2">Ephesians 4:25–5:2</a> makes the same point another way: all bitterness, anger, lying, stealing, slander, and malice are to be replaced by tenderness, forgiveness, and kindness.</p>
<p>Love is, for Paul, “the law of Christ,” supreme and sufficient (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.14">Gal 5:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.2">6:2</a>), and Paul neatly defines what alone “avails” in Christianity as “faith working through love” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.6">5:6</a>). He insists that the supreme manifestation of the Spirit that Christians should covet is “the more excellent way” of love (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27-13.13">1 Cor 12:27–13:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.5.5">Rom 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>). Here, too, he contrasts love with five other expressions of religious zeal much prized at Corinth in order to show that each is profitless without love (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-3">1 Cor 13:1-3</a>). He ends the chapter by comparing love with faith and hope, the other enduring elements of religious experience, and declares love to be the greatest.</p>
<p>Paul’s description of love in action includes liberality, acts of mercy, and hospitality; avoidance of revenge; sympathy; rejoicing with others; sharing of weakness, shame, or need; restoring, supporting, and edifying others, giving them all honor, kindness, forgiveness, encouragement; restraining criticism, even of the divisive, overscrupulous “weaker brother”—the list is almost endless. More generally, love is revealed as a quality of activity, of thinking, and of suffering (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.4-8">1 Cor 13:4-8</a>). In brief, love does no harm and omits no good; it is God’s law.</p>
<p>According to Paul, God showed his love for us in that Christ died for us. Because of his great love, he made us alive in Christ; in that love we live, by it we conquer, and from it nothing shall separate us (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.8">Rom 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.32-39">8:32-39</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.14">2 Cor 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.4">Eph 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.16">2 Thes 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.4-5">Ti 3:4-5</a>). Our love reflects the love first “poured into our hearts” (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.5">Rom 5:5</a>), and it is directed toward Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1-40">1 Cor 7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.22">16:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.24">Eph 6:24</a>) and toward others, whom we love for his sake.</p>
<p class="h3">In the Writings of John</p>
<p class="fl">What John later recalled, and reflected upon, forms the crown of biblical teaching about love. For John, love was the foundation of all that had happened—“God so loved the world” (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.23">17:23</a>). This is how we know love at all: Christ laid down his life for us (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.16">1 Jn 3:16</a>). The mutual love of Father, Son, and disciples must be the fundamental fact in Christianity because God himself is love (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.8,16">4:8, 16</a>).</p>
<p>We know this by the Incarnation and by the cross (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.9-10">1 Jn 4:9-10</a>). Thus we know and believe the love God has for us, and that love itself is divine (“of God”). It follows that “he who loves is born of God.” “He who does not love does not know God.” Such a person “is in the darkness,” “is not of God,” and “remains in death.” No one has ever seen God; nevertheless “if we love, . . . God abides in us” and we in God.</p>
<p>God’s love is thus prior and original; if we love at all, it is “because he first loved.” Our love is directed first toward God, and John is exceedingly searching in his tests of that Godward love. It demands that we “love not the world,” that we “keep his word [and] his commandments,” and that we love our Christian brothers and sisters. This commandment we received from Christ, “that he who loves God should love his brother also,” for “if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.” Twelve times John stressed the duty of mutual loyalty and love. Indeed, if one closes his heart against his brother or sister, “how does God’s love abide in him?”</p>
<p>This emphasis upon the mutual love of Christians has been held a serious limitation of the love Jesus required. “Your brother” appears to have supplanted “your neighbor.” In this respect the commandment given in the upper room (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>) is “new” compared with that in <a href="?bref=Matt.22.39">Matthew 22:39</a> (citing <a href="?bref=Lev.19.18">Lv 19:18</a>), and the circumstances explain why. The night on which Jesus was betrayed was shadowed by the surrounding world’s hostility, the imminent crucifixion, and the defection of Judas. All the future depended upon the mutual loyalty of the 11 disciples, standing together under social pressure. By the time of John’s letter, new defections had rent the church. A perversion of the gospel called Gnosticism, essentially intellectualist, proud, “giving no heed to love” (Ignatius), had drawn away leaders and adherents (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.19,26">1 Jn 2:19, 26</a>). Once again mutual loyalty was all-important, and John wrote expressly to consolidate and maintain the apostolic fellowship (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.3">1 Jn 1:3</a>).</p>
<p>However, love for one’s fellow Christians does not exclude, but instead leads on to, a wider love (cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.1.7">2 Pt 1:7</a>). John insists that God loved the whole world (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.2">1 Jn 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.14">4:14</a>). Moreover, if love fails within the Christian fellowship, it certainly will not flourish beyond it but evaporate in mere words (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.18">1 Jn 3:18</a>).</p>
<p>In countering the loveless conceit of Gnostic Christianity, John’s concern was with the basic commandment of love to God and people as at once the criterion and the consummation of true Christian life. He does not, therefore, detail the many-sided expressions of love. For description of love in action, his mind recalls Christ’s words about “keeping commandments” and “laying down life” in sacrifice (<a href="?bref=John.15.10,13">Jn 15:10, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.16">1 Jn 3:16</a>), and he mentioned especially love’s noticing a brother’s need, and so sharing this world’s goods (v <a href="?bref=John.3.17">17</a>). Terse as these expressions are, they contain the heart of Christian love. John’s forthright realism in testing all religious claims ensures that for him love could be no vague sentimentalism.</p>
<p>The Christian ideal can only be socially fulfilled within a disciple band, a divine kingdom, the Father’s family, the Christian fellowship. In Scripture, love is no abstract idea, conceived to provide a self-explanatory, self-motivating “norm” to resolve the problem in every moral situation. It is rooted in the divine nature, expressed in the coming and death of Christ, experienced in salvation, and so kindled within the saved. Thus it is central, essential, and indispensable to Christianity. For God is love.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">LUCIFER*</p>
<p class="fl">Appellation from a Latin word meaning “light bearer.” The Latin term refers to the planet Venus appearing in the evening and the morning, which is the brightest object in the sky except for the sun and moon. Others have identified it with the crescent moon. It is also said by some to be the planet Jupiter. The Hebrew term, from which the Latin <span class="ital">lucifer</span> is derived, is found in <a href="?bref=Isa.14.12">Isaiah 14:12</a>: “How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!” (<span class="sc">niv</span>). The Hebrew word means the “shining one.” It has cognates in Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Arabic. The Septuagint, Targum, and the Vulgate translate it as “morning star,” quite fitting in view of the appositional “son of the dawn.”</p>
<p>The Hebrew expression was probably never meant to be a name, but it has come to be used thus because the verse in which it occurs is applied to Satan. This apparently was done first by two of the church fathers, Tertullian and Origen. However, the popularity of Lucifer as a name for Satan may be attributed to its use in John Milton’s <span class="ital">Paradise Lost.</span></p>
<p>The event recorded in <a href="?bref=Isa.14.12">Isaiah 14:12</a> may be an example of a story quite commonly known in the time of Isaiah. This old Canaanite story concerned the morning star, who had attempted to rise high above the clouds and establish himself on the mountain where the gods assembled, in the uttermost part of the north. He had desired to take the place of the highest god, becoming ruler of the world. His attempts were thwarted, and he was cast into the underworld. This story of the minor star deity aspiring to ascend above the throne of the most high god served, in the purposes of Isaiah, as an excellent analogy to the pride and aspirations of the king of Babylon, the person with whom chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.13.1-22">13</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.14.1-32">14</a> are concerned. Isaiah states (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.3-4">14:3-4</a>) that Yahweh, the God of Israel, would give the people relief from the tyranny of their oppressors, and they would take up a taunt song against the king. Although he had sought to be great, he would be brought low; he who sought to be a god would, with his descendants, cease to exist on the earth. Though the Hebrews had no myths, illustrations from familiar gentile mythology often were used to express spiritual truth.</p>
<p>There are many who believe the expression (and surrounding context) refers to Satan. They believe the similarities among <a href="?bref=Isa.14.12">Isaiah 14:12</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.10.18">Luke 10:18</a>, and <a href="?bref=Rev.12.7-10">Revelation 12:7-10</a> warrant this conclusion. However, although the NT passages do speak of Satan’s fall, the context of the Isaiah passage describes the defeated king of Babylon. The Babylonian king had desired to be above God and so fell from heaven. His doom is pictured as already accomplished. Though defeat is certain for Satan, he yet continues his evil acts against God’s people. Not until the final judgment (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.1-20.15">Rv 12–20</a>) will his fate be sealed and his activity stopped. Isaiah, then, is not speaking of Satan in <a href="?bref=Isa.14.12">14:12</a> but of the proud, and soon to be humiliated, king of Babylon.</p>

<p class="h1">LUKE (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Companion of the apostle Paul; author of the third Gospel and Acts.</p>
<p>Accepting the author of Luke-Acts as Luke the companion of Paul, much can be learned about him from this two-volume work. The preface to the Gospel indicates that Luke was not an eyewitness or immediate disciple of the Lord. Luke states that he had carried out extensive research and had written an orderly account about Jesus.</p>
<p>Luke’s writings have some features not found in the other Gospels. The extraordinary feature of Luke’s work is the inclusion of the book of Acts as a sequel to the Gospel. The two books together—Luke and Acts—show the actual fulfilling of the prophecies of Isaiah in the proclamation of the gospel to the ends of the earth. This inclusion of the Gentiles is often referred to as Luke’s universalism or concern for all humanity (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.14">Luke 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.47">24:47</a>). The Gospel of Luke displays a keen interest in individuals, social outcasts, women, children, and social relationships, especially situations involving poverty or wealth. This Gospel has a special stress on prayer and the Holy Spirit, which results in a striking note of joyfulness and praise. These features tell us something about Luke as a person and his understanding of Christianity.</p>
<p>If Luke is accepted as the companion of Paul, then the “we” passages of Acts disclose that Luke was in Philippi (possibly his hometown) when he first joined Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.10-17">Acts 16:10-17</a>). Then he later rejoined Paul when the latter returned to Philippi (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.5-15">20:5-15</a>). Luke then journeyed with Paul on his way to Jerusalem and stayed with Philip at Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.1-18">21:1-18</a>). Then, after Paul’s two-year imprisonment in Caesarea, Luke sailed with him to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-28.16">27:1–28:16</a>).</p>
<p>Further references to Luke in the epistles of Paul (<a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Col 4:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.11">2 Tm 4:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.24">Phlm 1:24</a>) give some valuable information about Luke. <a href="?bref=Col.4.11">Colossians 4:11</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.4.14">14</a> seem to indicate that Luke was a Gentile and a physician. The latter is supported, but not proved, by the interest shown by Luke in medical matters, as in <a href="?bref=Luke.4.38">Luke 4:38</a>, <a href="?bref=Luke.5.12">5:12</a>, and <a href="?bref=Luke.8.43">8:43</a>. It is also interesting that early tradition adds that Luke was a physician of Antioch who wrote his Gospel in Achaia and died at the age of 84.</p>

<p class="fl">Tradition attributes the authorship of the Gospel to the esteemed companion of Paul, Luke the physician (<a href="?bref=Col.4.14">Col 4:14</a>). The Gospel does not identify its author by name, but he is apparently well known in the company of early believers. He had obviously been gathering information for his project for some time. In both Luke and Acts the recipient is identified as Theophilus.</p>
<p>The internal testimony of Acts for Lucan authorship must also be weighed, since there is a close relationship between the two books. In three extensive “we” passages the author reports his presence (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.10-17">Acts 16:10-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.20.5-21.18">20:5–21:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-28.16">27:1–28:16</a>). These appear to be excerpts from a travel diary; the last of them places the author in Rome with the apostle Paul. We can, by the process of elimination, virtually establish Luke as the author.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">The dating of Luke is debatable. Some argue for a date after <span class="era">AD</span> 70, but this robs <a href="?bref=Luke.21.20">Luke 21:20</a> of its predictive value. Others suggest a date prior to the death of Paul (<span class="era">AD</span> 64). The latter would readily account for Acts concluding with his ministry in Rome while in prison.</p>
<p>The Gospel may have been written in Rome, but this is by no means certain. Asia Minor and Greece have also been suggested as possibilities. The <span class="ital">Monarchian Prologue to Luke</span> promotes the latter option, but its reliability is suspect. It was at Rome that Luke could have used the time profitably to put the finishing touches on the third Gospel.</p>
<p>Luke wrote to Theophilus. Theophilus (“beloved of God”) is probably not, as some suggest, a generic term for all believers. He was a person apparently unfamiliar with the geography of Palestine, for Luke takes care to detail it from time to time. He has a much better grasp of the Greco-Roman world as a whole, for Luke predictably assumes his reader’s familiarity with it. Luke also avoids terms that might prove puzzling to a gentile reader, such as “hosanna” in connection with Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In all probability the third Gospel was composed in Rome while Paul awaited trial, on or before <span class="era">AD</span> 64. It was dedicated to the “most excellent Theophilus” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.3">Lk 1:3</a>), as an appropriate custom of the time. He was a prominent Gentile who had become a believer. Luke wanted to instruct him (and others) more carefully in the faith.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus lived out his life within an area roughly 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) wide and 150 miles (241.4 kilometers) long, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south. Apart from Jerusalem, the places he is reported to have visited are not important to the secular history of the region. He was raised in the humble village of Nazareth and lived there until about 30 years of age. Capernaum became the center for his Galilean ministry. He passed through Samaria on occasion, and he ministered in Perea. He was betrayed and crucified in Jerusalem. He was raised in triumph on the third day.</p>
<p>Luke writes in retrospect. His perspective had shifted during the interim—geographically from Palestine to the Roman Empire, politically from Israel to Rome, socially from Jewish society to pagan, and religiously from the temple to the horizon of Christian mission. It is as if one era were superimposed on the other, so that the significance of the life and ministry of Jesus can be seen for the early church.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Simeon beautifully expressed the redemptive theme of Luke’s Gospel when he held Jesus in his arms and exclaimed: “I have seen the Savior you have given to all people. He is a light to reveal God to the nations, and he is the glory of your people Israel!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.30-32">Lk 2:30-32</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). He pointed to Jesus as the long-anticipated Savior, the hope of Gentiles and Jews alike.</p>
<p>Luke wove the work of the Holy Spirit into the life and ministry of Jesus. Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">Lk 1:35</a>); the Spirit descended on him at his baptism (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.22">3:22</a>); he was led into the desert by the Spirit to be tempted (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.2">4:2</a>); he was anointed by the Spirit for his ministry (v <a href="?bref=Luke.4.18">18</a>). The Spirit is, as it were, in the background with regard to Jesus’ subsequent labors, but the relationship is understood even when it is not repeated.</p>
<p>Luke accented the experience of messianic joy. The angelic host announced Jesus’ birth with the words, “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and peace on earth to all whom God favors” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.14">2:14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Then, as he was approaching Jerusalem, the multitude that accompanied him began to praise God, saying, “Bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in highest heaven!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.38">19:38</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>All this suggests that the redemptive theme in Luke is complex in character. It points to Jesus as the Christ. It invites the favorable response of Gentiles no less than Jews. It blends in the empowering of the Holy Spirit for Jesus’ ministry and that of his disciples. It emphasizes the joy that accompanies the publication of the gospel. These are simply variations on the one redemptive design of Luke.</p>
<p>Other concerns surface incidentally. Luke’s interest in historical accuracy is one of these. His apologetic burden is another. The critical place he gives to prayer is a third. The list could be extended.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Prologue (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-4">1:1-4</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospel begins with a formal prologue. Luke sought to record in orderly fashion what others had handed down as a legacy of faith. He did so in order to establish the historical credentials of the faith and to assure his readers of their validity.</p>

<p class="h3">Nativity and Childhood of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.5-2.52">1:5–2:52</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">None of the Gospels is a thoroughgoing biography of Jesus. But Luke took a special interest in historical incidents, first with regard to the nativity and childhood narratives. He recounted 10 episodes in all: the annunciation of John the Baptist’s birth as the forerunner of Christ; the announcement of Jesus’ birth to Mary; the visit of Mary to Elizabeth; the birth of John the Baptist; John the Baptist’s time in the wilderness; the birth of Jesus; the visit of the shepherds; the circumcision of Jesus; Jesus’ presentation in the temple; and the visit to the temple as a youth.</p>
<p>John the Baptist received considerable attention from the outset. Luke recorded that it was during the reign of Herod (Herod the Great, 37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>) that Zechariah the priest was ministering in the temple. (Twenty-four platoons of priests served in this capacity for two separate weeks out of the year. The privilege of burning incense was determined by casting lots, and once the priest had done so, he was disqualified from repeating the act.) An angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah as he was about to burn incense, announcing that he and his wife, Elizabeth, would have a son, whose name should be John. He was to live as a Nazirite (see <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-4">Nm 6:1-4</a>) and prepare the way for the Messiah. When Zechariah was reluctant to believe (he and Elizabeth were of advanced age), the angel struck him dumb until the time of the promised birth.</p>
<p>We next hear of John in connection with Mary’s visit to Elizabeth. The baby leaped within Elizabeth’s womb as she heard Mary’s greeting (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.41">Lk 1:41</a>). Luke immediately followed this account with the birth of John the Baptist. Zechariah named the child as he had been directed, received back his speech, and proceeded to prophesy concerning the coming Messiah and the preparatory role his son would play. The child grew and became “strong in spirit,” abiding in the wilderness until his public ministry began.</p>
<p>Luke told the nativity story from the perspective of Mary. The angel Gabriel visited her and announced that she would give birth to the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-38">1:26-38</a>). She would conceive miraculously by the Holy Spirit. Mary is portrayed as being devoutly submissive to the purposes of God.</p>
<p>The birth is said to have taken place when Quirinius was governor of Syria, and persons had to travel to their ancestral towns to register for a census. Mary gave birth in a Bethlehem stable. Angels announced the birth to shepherds, who left their flocks to observe the child. Mary treasured these events and continued to ponder their significance.</p>
<p>After Mary had observed her 40 days of ritual purification, she went with Joseph to the temple to present Jesus to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.21-40">2:21-40</a>). There Simeon and Anna, two elderly and devout persons, recognized the infant as the promised Messiah. Simeon concluded that Jesus would cause many in Israel to fall and rise, and would bring deep sorrow to the heart of Mary.</p>
<p>The nativity and childhood narratives close with Jesus’ visit to the temple at age 12 to celebrate the Feast of the Passover. Joseph and Mary left Jesus behind in the temple, supposing that he was among relatives or friends. They retraced their steps and found him in the temple conversing with the rabbis—listening to them and amazing them with his own understanding. Luke concluded by saying that “Jesus grew both in height and in wisdom, and he was loved by God and by all who knew him” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.52">2:52</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Beginning of the Public Ministry (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1-4.30">3:1–4:30</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Luke then recorded those events related to the inauguration of Jesus’ ministry. These include the ministry of John the Baptist, the baptism of Jesus, his genealogy, his temptation, and the public announcement in Nazareth. Luke dated the beginning of John the Baptist’s ministry in no fewer than six ways: with the terms of office of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate, Herod Antipas, Philip, Lysanias, and Annas and Caiaphas. John came preaching a baptism of repentance in preparation for the coming of the Messiah. Multitudes came out into the wilderness to hear him and to be baptized by him.</p>
<p>Jesus also came to be baptized. (Luke does not record John’s protest that Jesus ought rather to baptize him, or Jesus’ insistence that it had to be done—apparently to identify with the people and anticipate his vicarious death on their behalf.) The baptism marked Jesus’ entry into public ministry. Luke inserted what may be the genealogical record through Mary, consistent with his earlier efforts to narrate the events from her perspective.</p>
<p>The temptation of Jesus was a probationary test of his messianic ministry. The introduction to two of the temptations, “If you are the Son of God,” was calculated to make him doubt the words heard at his baptism, “You are my Son” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.22">3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.3,9">4:3, 9</a>). Satan hoped to persuade Jesus to seek to fulfill his calling and yet avoid the cross. Each time Jesus parried the temptation with a quotation from Scripture.</p>
<p>Jesus returned to Galilee and to the synagogue in Nazareth. Here he announced his public ministry in words borrowed from the jubilee observance and associated with the messianic age (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.18-19">4:18-19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-2">Is 61:1-2</a>). They reflected both the religious focus and broad social implications of the ministry to come. The announcement especially held out hope to those who were downtrodden and ostracized by society. When those in attendance challenged his credentials, Jesus replied, “No prophet is accepted in his own hometown” (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.24">Lk 4:24</a>). And when they would have cast him from the brow of a hill, he passed through their midst and went on his way.</p>
<p class="h3">The Galilean Ministry (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.31-9.50">4:31–9:50</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus moved the center of his activity to Capernaum. Luke records a variety of episodes associated with the Galilean ministry that follows. Approximately 30 instances are mentioned. About a third involve some extraordinary occurrence, such as healing, exorcism, raising from the dead, or feeding a multitude. These were events associated with the messianic age.</p>
<p>However, it was Jesus’ teaching that first seems to have caught the people’s attention. He did not teach as the rabbis, by drawing upon traditional precedent, but he taught in the authority of his messianic office. Luke interlaced his narrative with a considerable amount of Jesus’ teaching. There is a fairly extended section on the observance of the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.1-11">6:1-11</a>). But it is less prominent than Jesus’ sermon “on the plain,” with its extended comments concerning blessings and woes, love for enemies, judging others, knowing one by his fruit, and wise and foolish builders (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.12-49">6:12-49</a>). Jesus taught by way of parables, and Luke recorded those of the sower and lamp (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.1-18">8:1-18</a>). In the former instance, the seed represents the word of God, and the soil the varying preparation to receive the Word. Thereby the disciples might better understand the mixed results of Jesus’ ministry and their own. Others would be perplexed by the parables.</p>
<p>Luke described the calling of select disciples. He mentioned Peter, James, and John, and at a later point Levi (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.1-11,27-32">5:1-11, 27-32</a>). The former were called from their fishing boats and the latter from his tax booth. All were summoned to follow Christ in his messianic ministry through the Galilean countryside. Later on, when there were 12 disciples, Jesus sent them out to preach the kingdom and heal the sick (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.1-11">9:1-11</a>). No doubt many contributed to the extended ministry. Luke recorded certain women who traveled with them and “were contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples” (<a href="?bref=Luke.8.3">8:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>One senses a rising tide of enthusiasm with regard to the Galilean enterprise. It begins with Jesus alone, working in obscurity; it terminates with a faithful band of followers, multitudes hanging on his words, and his name circulated throughout the region. The section peaks with Peter’s confession of Jesus as the Christ and the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.10-36">9:10-36</a>). The presence of Moses and Elijah represents the Law and Prophets as subordinate to the Messiah.</p>
<p>The scene shifts abruptly to the foot of the mount, where the disciples have been ineffective in delivering a demon-possessed boy. Here Jesus pointed out the need for spiritual resources to accomplish kingdom needs, and thereafter (in response to the disciples’ argument over who would be greatest) an appeal to humility.</p>
<p class="h3">The Journey toward Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.51-19.27">9:51–19:27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Luke next reported Jesus’ ministry on the way to Jerusalem. This has sometimes been called the Perean ministry, assuming that much of it took place across the Jordan in the district of Perea. It has also been graphically described as “the road to the cross.” The number of incidents are roughly the same as those in the preceding section, although the text is about 25 percent longer.</p>
<p>Opposition is seen building at the outset. Jesus sent messengers ahead to prepare for his arrival at a Samaritan village. But the inhabitants would not welcome him, because he was on the way to Jerusalem. There was bad blood between the Jews and Samaritans. The latter had been settled in the land during the Assyrian occupation and brought with them foreign religious and social customs, resulting in a syncretism repugnant to the Jews. Certain disciples asked if Jesus would have them bring down fire from heaven on the village, but Jesus rebuked them. He evidenced a more conciliatory spirit.</p>
<p>Luke reintroduced the Samaritans in connection with a story Jesus tells (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.25-37">10:25-37</a>). It seems that a man was attacked by thieves, who left him for dead. First a priest and then a Levite came along, each walking by on the opposite side of the road. Another passed that way and took pity on the injured stranger. He bound up his wounds and brought him to an inn where he could be cared for at the expense of his benefactor. Jesus added the detail that the man who stopped to help was a Samaritan. He alone understood that a neighbor is the one we befriend rather than the one who befriends us. (The Samaritans reappear once more in the account of 10 lepers who were healed, of whom only a Samaritan returned to give thanks—<a href="?bref=Luke.17.11-19">17:11-19</a>.)</p>
<p>The story of the good Samaritan suggests the opposition Jesus was encountering from the religious establishment centered in Jerusalem. Even as the crowds increased, Jesus observed: “The queen of Sheba will rise up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, because she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now someone greater than Solomon is here—and you refuse to listen to him” (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.31">11:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). So also will the men of Nineveh stand to condemn the present generation, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</p>
<p>Jesus reserved the severest rebuke for those Pharisees who had come to contest his every move. Jesus and the Pharisees traveled in much the same circles. Some had been sympathetic to his message, but these seem to have been in the minority. Jesus pictured the Pharisees as meticulous legalists (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.37-44">11:37-44</a>). Events were building to a climax. Jesus had prophesied his impending death and subsequent resurrection. His face was set toward Jerusalem. When some solicitous Pharisees warned him of Herod Antipas’s plan to have him killed, he refused to be intimidated (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.32-33">13:32-33</a>).</p>
<p>Parables abound in this section of the Gospel. They include those of the Good Samaritan, mustard seed, yeast, narrow door, invitation to a marriage feast, great banquet, tower builder, king who goes to war, lost sheep, lost coin, Prodigal Son, unjust steward, rich man and Lazarus, Pharisee and publican, and ten minas. These seem to fall into one of three categories, although perhaps not exclusively so. The one has to do with accepting sinners. (While Scripture reveals that we are all sinners, “sinners” in the synoptic Gospels refers to nonobservant Jews.) A classic instance is the story of the Prodigal Son (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.11-32">15:11-32</a>).</p>
<p>The second category might be called kingdom parables. They suggest that while the kingdom begins in some relatively insignificant fashion, it will expand to incredible proportions. They also warn that not all that seems a part of the growth is a true extension of the kingdom. These emphases can be recognized by comparing the parables of the mustard seed, yeast, and narrow door (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.18-30">13:18-30</a>).</p>
<p>The third category deals with stewardship. Jesus told one such parable as they neared Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.11-27">19:11-27</a>). It involved a man of noble birth who went to a far country, leaving his servants with ten minas each (a mina was about a three-month wage for laborers). They were to invest the minas so that the man would have a good profit when he came back. Upon returning, the nobleman called his servants to get an accounting from them. Those who were found faithful in lesser things were given greater opportunity, but one who failed lost even that which he had been given.</p>
<p>There are some especially touching scenes in the Gospel narrative. One shows Jesus welcoming little children (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.15-17">18:15-17</a>). Another describes a rich ruler who inquired of Jesus how he might obtain eternal life (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.18.18-30">18-30</a>). Still another episode concerns a tax collector called Zacchaeus (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.1-10">19:1-10</a>). These help us to gain a better appreciation of Jesus’ diversified ministry.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely Jesus had worked his way to Jerusalem. He had met increasing opposition. The cross was just over the horizon. He ministered while time allowed.</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus’ Death and Resurrection (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.28-24.53">19:28–24:53</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Luke concluded his account with the Passion week. First is the Triumphal Entry of Christ (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.28-44">19:28-44</a>). As those with Jesus came over the crest of the Mt of Olives, they began to praise God for all the miracles they had seen: “Bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in highest heaven!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.38">19:38</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The jubilation of the multitude stands in sharp contrast to Jesus’ weeping over an unrepentant city and lamenting the destruction to be visited upon it.</p>
<p>Entering the temple area, Jesus began driving out those who were selling goods there. God’s house should be a house of prayer, but—Jesus protests—they have made it a den of robbers. He continued to teach daily in the temple precincts, while the religious leaders plotted how to put him to death without inciting the anger of the people.</p>
<p>Luke recorded some of the interchange with the leaders and people (chs <a href="?bref=Luke.20.1-21.38">20–21</a>). This includes a challenge to Jesus’ authority, the parable of the wicked tenants, the question about paying taxes to Caesar, another question concerning the resurrection, Jesus’ question about how to understand the Messiah’s Davidic ancestry and lordship, warning against the scribes, comments on the widow’s offering, and discourse on the end of the age. This broad range of topics is related to the messianic disputation in progress.</p>
<p>The problem as Luke represents it seems less an intellectual than a moral one. The religious establishment was determined to retain its privileged position at all costs. This Galilean rabbi was a serious threat that had to be eliminated. It was only a matter of waiting for the right opportunity. It appeared when Judas Iscariot offered to betray Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.1-6">22:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>The Last Supper and the prayer vigil in Gethsemane intervene between the plot of the leaders and the arrest of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.7-46">22:7-46</a>). From the upper room Jesus and the disciples made their way across the Kidron Valley to the Mt of Olives. Here Jesus prayed in preparation for the crucifixion to follow. The disciples slept, being weary from the heavy demands of those days. Soon Judas appeared to point Jesus out, and the soldiers rushed him away to stand before the high priest. Peter denied Christ, fearing for his own life. Jesus was condemned by the Sanhedrin. (Commentators debate whether this was a formal session of the council of Jewish elders.) He was sent to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, then to Herod Antipas, and back again to Pilate. Pilate saw no reason for putting Jesus to death, but the multitude was stirred up by the Jewish leaders to demand his crucifixion. Pilate yielded to their pressure when alternatives seemed to escape him.</p>
<p>Jesus was led away to be crucified. Luke alone mentioned those who mourned him (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.27">23:27</a>). Jesus warned them rather to mourn for themselves and their children. Here and hereafter we see Jesus’ concern for others in the midst of his own agony: those crucifying him, the repentant criminal, and his mother, Mary.</p>
<p>Luke records a mixed response to the crucifixion. The people stood watching, as if immobilized by the rush of events. They may have felt helpless to intervene even if disposed to do so. Some of the religious leaders went so far as to mock Jesus; “He saved others, . . . let him save himself if he is really God’s Chosen One, the Messiah” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.35">23:35</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). One hardened criminal joined in their derision; the other asked for clemency.</p>
<p>Darkness shrouded the scene. The curtain of the temple was torn, as if to suggest that access was being made available through the shed blood of Christ. Jesus commended his spirit to the Father. He breathed his last. His body was laid in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. Women went to prepare spices and perfumes for the interment, but they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</p>
<p>Early on the first day of the week the women approached the tomb, only to find the stone guarding its entrance rolled away and the body of Jesus missing. Suddenly two figures in gleaming array stood by them. They announced to the frightened women: “He isn’t here! He has risen from the dead!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.6">24:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The women returned to report to the apostles. Peter ran to confirm their findings. He discovered the strips of linen laid out as they had been, but with the body absent. He wondered what had happened.</p>
<p>The same day two disciples were going to a village called Emmaus. They were discussing what had happened in Jerusalem when Jesus joined them. They were kept from recognizing him until later on when he broke bread with them. They hurriedly returned to Jerusalem to reassure the fellowship that it was true that the Lord was risen.</p>
<p>While they were still talking, Jesus appeared in their midst. “Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it’s really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don’t have bodies, as you see that I do!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.39">24:39</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Then he helped them understand the implications of what had happened: “Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah must suffer and die and rise again from the dead on the third day. With my authority, take this message of repentance to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem: ‘There is forgiveness of sins for all who turn to me.’ You are witnesses of all these things. And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven” (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.24.46-49">46-49</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Luke concludes his Gospel with an account of the ascension (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.50-53">24:50-53</a>). It was as Jesus blessed them that he was lifted up before their eyes. They worshiped him as the ascended Lord and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. There they remained in the temple precinct, praising God and anticipating the coming of the Holy Spirit to empower them for witnessing to all the world.</p>

In recognition of God’s presence he called the place “the house of God” (beth-El). Jacob may not have been in the city itself, which might account for the seeming discrepancy in <a href="?bref=Josh.16.2">Joshua 16:2</a>. The phrase “from Bethel to Luz” in the description of the border of the land allotted to Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh) seems to distinguish Bethel from Luz as though they were two different cities. Perhaps the solution is to be found in that originally the name Luz continued to be used of the city, while at the same time the Israelites knew, through tradition, of the place where Jacob had named Bethel outside the city of Luz. According to <a href="?bref=Josh.16.2">Joshua 16:2</a>, then, Bethel would be an area lying east of the city of Luz. At the time of Conquest (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.22-25">Jgs 1:22-25</a>), or subsequently, the Israelites changed the name of Luz to Bethel.</p>

Prior to Roman occupation, it was bordered on the north by Galatia, on the south by Cilicia, on the east by Cappadocia, and on the west by Phrygia and Pisidia. Like many of its neighboring states, Lycaonia was ruled by the Seleucids after the conquest of Alexander the Great. When the Romans defeated the Seleucids in western Asia Minor (190 <span class="era">BC</span>), Lycaonia was given to the Attalids of Pergamum. It remained under their control until 130 <span class="era">BC</span>, when their king died and their kingdom was dissolved. The area was subsequently administered by the Romans, who attached the northern section of the Lycaonian territory to Galatia, the eastern section to Cappadocia, and the southern section to Cilicia. In <span class="era">AD</span> 37 eastern Lycaonia gained independence from Cappadocia and was known as Lycaonia Antiochiana. By the time of Christ, Lycaonia had essentially been reduced to an ethnic area in southern Galatia and should be considered as such in all NT references.</p>
<p>The territory was situated on a high, barren plateau. The soil was generally of poor quality, though fertile areas existed in the south around the principal cities of Lystra and Derbe. Consequently, the primary occupations were the herding of sheep and goats, with some agriculture in the south. Lycaonia was bisected by a major trade route between Syria, Ephesus, and Rome.</p>
<p>It is debatable whether Iconium was a city of Lycaonia. Some scholars believe it was the capital and principal city. Others consider it a Phrygian city. The latter position seems to be supported in Acts, where Paul is said to flee Iconium for Lystra and Derbe, “cities of Lycaonia” (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.6">Acts 14:6</a>)—places where the Lycaonian language was spoken (v <a href="?bref=Acts.14.11">11</a>). It is likely that within the political territory of Galatia there were several ethnic areas and that Paul crossed an ethnic border in an attempt to find safety from the disgruntled Jews of Iconium.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul made three visits to Lycaonia. During his first missionary journey, the preaching of the gospel was very effective and many disciples were made (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.21-22">Acts 14:21-22</a>). In fact, when Paul healed a crippled man in Lystra, the leaders of the pagan cult wished to worship him as a god (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.11-18">11-18</a>). He visited the area again on his second missionary journey. It was here that he met Timothy and asked him to join his company (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-5">16:1-5</a>). A final visit (during his third journey, where his purpose was to strengthen the believers) is indicated by <a href="?bref=Acts.18.23">Acts 18:23</a>.</p>
<p>Later Christian inscriptions indicate that by the end of the third century the region of Lycaonia possessed one of the most mature ecclesiastical systems in Asia Minor.</p>

<p class="h1">LYCIA</p>
<p class="fl">Country located in the southwest part of the Roman province of Asia (commonly known as Asia Minor), bounded on the northwest by Caria, on the north by Phrygia and Pisidia, on the northeast by Pamphylia, and on the west, south, and east by the Mediterranean Sea. The geography of the region combines rugged mountainous terrain with fertile valleys formed by the descent of several small rivers to the sea. The mountainous regions produce olives, grapes, and timber, while the valleys are responsible for the production of the area’s cultivated grains. At the mouths of the rivers are located the major seaports of the country. Two of these, Patara and Myra, are of interest to students of the NT.</p>
<p>Patara, located in southwest Lycia in the valley of the Xanthus River, was the seat of the oracle of Apollo. <a href="?bref=Acts.21.1">Acts 21:1</a> mentions it as the port where Paul, at the conclusion of his third missionary journey, boarded a ship sailing for Phoenicia (some manuscripts include here an additional stop at Myra). Myra, located in southeast Lycia, is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.27.5-7">Acts 27:5-7</a> as the port where Paul and Julius, a Roman centurion, boarded an Alexandrian ship bound for Rome. When winds were from the west, it was the practice of Alexandrian grain ships headed for Italy to work north along the shore of Palestine and Syria and west along the southern coast of Asia Minor. This would make the ports of Lycia natural places for ships to harbor in preparation for the final leg of the trip to Italy.</p>
<p>The history of the region is tied closely to that of Asia Minor. Among all the peoples of western Asia Minor, Lycia was alone able to withstand the onslaught of the kings of Lydia. However, in 546 <span class="era">BC</span> it was forced to submit to Persian domination. With the invasion of Alexander the Great in 333 <span class="era">BC</span>, Lycia came under the control of the Ptolemies (308–197 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the Seleucids (197–189 <span class="era">BC</span>). When the Romans defeated Antiochus III at Magnesia (189 <span class="era">BC</span>), Lycia was given to Rhodes, an island off its western coast. Twenty years later Rome granted Lycia the status of an independent state. This status held until <span class="era">AD</span> 43, when Emperor Claudius declared Lycia a Roman province. Under the provincial reorganization of Vespasian in <span class="era">AD</span> 74, it was joined with Pamphylia.</p>
<p><a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.23">First Maccabees 15:23</a> gives evidence of a sizable Jewish community in Lycia around 139 <span class="era">BC</span>. The NT provides no evidence of Christians in this area. However, a letter from Lycia written in <span class="era">AD</span> 312 to Emperor Maxim in opposition to Christianity indicates the presence of Christians in this region in the early centuries of the church.</p>

Lydia was a dealer in purple cloth and came from the city of Thyatira in the region of Lydia in the western part of the Roman province of Asia (commonly known as Asia Minor). The description of her as “a worshiper of God” (or “God-fearer”) indicates that she was a Gentile who had been attracted to Judaism. After her conversion to Christianity and her baptism, she hosted Paul and Silas during their stay in Philippi.</p>

In other versions, it is listed as “Lud” (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg) or “Ludim.” But the identification of Lydia with Lud or Ludim in the OT is not certain. Jeremiah mentions Lud in connection with the North African countries of Put (Libya) and Ethiopia (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.9">Jer 46:9</a>). Ezekiel mentions Lud in connection with Put and Persia (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.10">Ez 27:10</a>), as well as Arabia (<a href="?bref=Ezek.30.5">30:5</a>). Josephus considered the Lydians to have been founded by Lud (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 1.6.4).</p>
<p>In any event, it appears that Lydia refers to a province in the western part of the Roman province of Asia (modern Turkey) bounded on the north by Mysia, on the east by Phrygia, on the south by Caria, and on the west by the Greek cities in Ionia. It is listed among the provinces taken by the conquering Romans from the Syrian king Antiochus the Great and given to Eumenes II, the king of Pergamum, after the battle of Magnesia in 190 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The capital of Lydia, Sardis, was considerably inland, and the province never showed any significant maritime development. Herodotus referred to Lydia as a fertile land and to its abundance of silver (<span class="ital">Persian Wars</span> 5.49), while Tacitus spoke of the rich countries around Sardis (<span class="ital">Annals</span> 4.55). According to Herodotus, the Lydians “were the first nation to introduce the use of gold and silver coin, and the first who sold goods by retail” (<span class="ital">Persian Wars</span> 1.94).</p>
<p>By NT times, Lydia had become a part of the Roman province of Asia, having been given to Rome in 133 <span class="era">BC</span> by the Pergamene king Attalus III. Five of the churches to which the book of Revelation was addressed were in Lydia (Ephesus, Smyrna, Sardia, Philadelphia, and Laodicea).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">LYSANIAS</p>
<p class="fl">Tetrarch of Abilene (the area west of Damascus) in <span class="era">AD</span> 27–28. The Gospel of Luke mentions Lysanias as among those who ruled at the beginning of John the Baptist’s ministry (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). This is the only reference to him in the NT.</p>
<p>Josephus mentions a Lysanias who succeeded his father, Ptolemaeus, as the king of Chalcis. However, he was killed by Mark Antony in 36 <span class="era">BC</span>. Since there is no other known reference to a Lysanias in the writings of antiquity, and since this second Lysanias could not have lived during John the Baptist’s lifetime, some biblical scholars assume Luke was inaccurate in his chronology. In defense of Luke, other scholars indicate that Josephus mentions “Abila of Lysanius,” an area given to Agrippa II by Claudius in <span class="era">AD</span> 53; however, that reference may be to the Lysanias who ruled Chalcis 90 years earlier.</p>
<p>The most conclusive evidence in support of Luke is found in an inscription that records the dedication of a temple at Abila, “for the salvation of the Lord Imperial and their whole household by Nymphaeus, a freedman of Lysanias the tetrarch.” The title “Lord Imperial” was bestowed jointly only on Emperor Tiberius and his mother, Livia, Augustus’s widow. That would fix Lysanias’s date between <span class="era">AD</span> 14 (when Tiberius became emperor) and <span class="era">AD</span> 29 (when Livia died). On that basis Luke’s chronology may be assumed accurate.</p>

<p class="list">2. Appointed regent of Syria by Antiochus IV Epiphanes while the king was fighting the Parthians (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.3.31-37">1 Macc 3:31-37</a>; 166–165 <span class="era">BC</span>). Lysias (d. 162 <span class="era">BC</span>) sent generals Ptolemy, Nicanor, and Gorgias to subdue Judas Maccabeus in Judea and then himself led an attack on Judas. Eventually, a peace treaty was signed and approved by Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Macc 11). This removed the severe religious restrictions against the Jews, and Judas proceeded to cleanse the temple and reinstate the daily sacrifice.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Antiochus Epiphanes died in 164, Lysias, accompanied by the boy-king Antiochus V Eupator, entered Judea again, defeated Judas at Bethzacharia, and laid siege to Jerusalem. But the political situation in Antioch forced Lysias to withdraw and return to Syria, where he and his young charge, Antiochus V, were overthrown by Demetrius I and executed (162 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">LYSTRA</p>
<p class="fl">City in the region of Lycaonia in the Roman province of Galatia. Events in the town in the NT are confined to the book of Acts (and referenced in <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.11">2 Tm 3:11</a>). On Paul’s first missionary journey, Paul and Barnabas encountered opposition at Iconium and fled to Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.6">Acts 14:6</a>). While at Lystra, Paul healed a crippled man (v <a href="?bref=Acts.14.8">8</a>). This miracle excited the local crowd to cry out that Barnabas must be Zeus, and that Paul was Hermes (later called by their Latin counterparts Jupiter and Mercury in some English versions) because of his role as chief speaker (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.14.9-21">9-21</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="PaulandBarnabassMinistryinLystra"/>
<p>The town of Lystra was largely inhabited by the remnants of a small Anatolian tribe who spoke their own dialect, attested today by a number of inscriptions found in the area and still spoken as late as the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>. Evidently the old Anatolian village system prevailed in this market town even when Roman rule was established there.</p>
<p>The Greek deities Zeus and Hermes were worshiped in that area, and archaeological evidence confirms Luke’s picture in Acts. One inscription records the dedication to Zeus on a statue of Hermes. Another records a dedication to “Zeus before the town,” throwing light on <a href="?bref=Acts.14.13">Acts 14:13</a> with its reference to the priest “of Zeus before the gate.”</p>
<p>Geographically Derbe and Lystra both belonged to the same political region, while Iconium lay in another. Lystra was closer to Iconium than to Derbe geographically, commercially, and socially—in spite of the political boundary separating them. There was evidently a good deal of communication between the two towns. In <a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-2">Acts 16:1-2</a> Lystra and Iconium are linked together as places where Timothy was well known and respected.</p>
