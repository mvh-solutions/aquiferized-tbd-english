  <title>Caesarea</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAESAREA</p>
<p class="fl">City named in honor of Augustus Caesar, built by Herod the Great from 22 to 10 <span class="era">BC</span>. The 8,000-acre (3,240-hectare) site lies 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of modern Haifa, in the beautiful plain of Sharon on Israel’s Mediterranean coast. Known as Caesarea Maritima, it became the administrative center of the country throughout the period of Roman occupation. Three Roman governors of Palestine lived there: Felix (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.1-27">Acts 24</a>), Festus (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1,4-6,13">25:1, 4-6, 13</a>), and Pontius Pilate, who visited Jerusalem on special occasions (as in <a href="?bref=John.19.1-42">Jn 19</a>). Archaeologists found Pilate’s name carved in stone in the theater at Caesarea.</p>
<p>Caesarea served as the major seaport of Judea in NT times. Since the southern Palestinian coastline lacked a good harbor, Herod created one by building two huge breakwaters that could shelter ships from Mediterranean storms.</p>
<p>A Roman officer named Cornelius was converted to Christianity in Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1,24">Acts 10:1, 24</a>). Later, the apostle Peter visited Philip, a prominent Christian leader who lived there (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.8">21:8</a>). Paul spent more than two years in prison in Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.27-25.1">24:27–25:1</a>) and embarked from there on his journey to Rome (ch <a href="?bref=Acts.27.1-44">27</a>). In <span class="era">AD</span> 70 Roman general Titus returned to Caesarea after conquering Jerusalem, as did Flavius Silva in <span class="era">AD</span> 73 after defeating the fortress cities of Masada and Herodium (both in eastern Judea).</p>
<p>Continuous excavations since 1971 have added to the wealth of information about Caesarea. Herod built a high-level aqueduct to bring freshwater from Mt Carmel to Caesarea; the water originated from springs to the northeast and traveled in an underground aqueduct to Mt Carmel. A smaller aqueduct brought brackish water from a spring north of the city for irrigation. Large sewers (mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus), flushed by the action of the sea, have been found running under the city. A 30,000-seat hippodrome (racetrack) lay on the east side of the city. It appears to have been built in the second century <span class="era">AD</span> but was destroyed during the Muslim invasion of 640, along with a large archives building on the coast. Excavation of the archives building produced several inscriptions on its mosaic floors, among which were two quotations of the Greek text of <a href="?bref=Rom.13.3">Romans 13:3</a>. Still lying beneath the ground and visible only in infrared photography is a large amphitheater northwest of the hippodrome.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfCaesareaMaritima"/>
<p>Excavations in 1976 produced the first evidence of Strato’s Tower, the Hellenistic site near which Herod built Caesarea, according to Josephus. A small synagogue was excavated north of a large fort built at the Herodian harbor during the Crusades. The harbor area contained many stone storerooms; although 7 have been entered, as many as 73 may still lie unexcavated. One storeroom was reused by the Roman legions as a Mithraeum (a cultic center dedicated to the Persian god Mithras), the only one ever found in Palestine. The city of Caesarea was not rebuilt after its destruction by Muslims in the 13th century.</p>

  <title>Caesarea Philippi</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAESAREA PHILIPPI</p>
<p class="fl">City at the northern extremity of Palestine, on the southern slopes of Mt Hermon near the ancient city of Dan. Caesarea Philippi lies in a beautiful area on one of the three sources of the Jordan River, the Wadi Banias.</p>
<p>In the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the place was called Panion because the Greek god Pan was worshiped in a cave there. It is mentioned by Polybius, a Greek historian, as the place where Syrian king Antiochus III defeated the Ptolemies of Egypt in an important battle about 200 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Jewish historian Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 15.10.3) wrote that “Panium” was governed by Zenodorus; its cultic site was “a very fine cave in a mountain, under which there is a great cavity in the earth, and the cavern is abrupt, and prodigiously deep, and full of a still water; over it hangs a vast mountain, and under the caverns arise the springs of the river Jordan.”</p>
<p>After the death of Zenodorus, Augustus Caesar gave the city to Herod the Great, who, according to Josephus, “adorned this place, which was already a very remarkable one” with a “most beautiful temple of the whitest stone.” When Herod died in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, his son Philip was given the territory surrounding Panion, an area known as Paneas. Josephus (<span class="ital">War</span> 2.9.1) reported that “Philip built the city Caesarea, at the fountains of Jordan, and in the region of Paneas.” Philip made it his capital and named it Caesarea Philippi after the Roman emperor Tiberius Caesar and himself, thus distinguishing it from the larger Caesarea Maritima on the Mediterranean coast. Josephus (<span class="ital">War</span> 3.9.7) wrote that emperors Vespasian and Titus both “marched from that Caesarea which lay by the seaside, and came to that which is named Caesarea Philippi.”</p>
<p>It was in Caesarea Philippi that the apostle Peter confessed Jesus to be “the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-16">Mt 16:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-29">Mk 8:27-29</a>).</p>
<p>About <span class="era">AD</span> 50, Agrippa II enlarged Caesarea Philippi and named it Neronias in honor of the emperor Nero. The modern name, Banias, derives from the Arabic difficulty in pronouncing Paneas.</p>

  <title>Caesars, the</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAESARS, The</p>
<p class="fl">Succession of Roman emperors. The name Caesar, which has derivatives in the German Kaiser, Dutch Keizer, and Russian Czar, goes back to the family name of Julius Caesar (100–44 <span class="era">BC</span>), which his successors took to themselves. Luke’s Gospel mentions Caesar Augustus (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1">Lk 2:1</a>) and Tiberius Caesar (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). In the book of Acts the title “Caesar” is used to refer to Nero (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.11-12,21">Acts 25:11-12, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.32">26:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.27.24">27:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.19">28:19</a>). During NT times, 12 Caesars reigned, 6 of them actually of the Caesarean lineage.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EmperorsofCaesarsLineage">Emperors of Caesar’s Lineage</p>
<p class="h3">Julius Caesar (100–44 <span class="era">BC</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Julius had imperial powers but never held the title of emperor. Rome had been a republic (really an aristocracy) for almost 500 years. Its citizens hated the idea of a monarch, a position Julius Caesar judiciously declined, accepting a republican office but ruling as virtual dictator. The republic was dead in practice if not in principle. Vainly hoping to revive it and fearing Caesar’s imperial ambitions, a group of republicans conspired to assassinate him. Caesar was murdered on March 15 (the “ides of March”), 44 <span class="era">BC</span>, as he entered the Roman Senate. Although the conspiracy succeeded, its purpose failed. In the civil war that followed, Caesar’s grand-nephew Octavian emerged as victor and in 31 <span class="era">BC</span> became the first Roman emperor.</p>
<p class="h3">Augustus (63 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 14, reigned 31 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 14)</p>
<p class="fl">Gaius Octavianus (Octavian) was the grandson of Julia, Julius Caesar’s sister. He was 18 and studying in Greece when his great-uncle was assassinated. Caesar’s will, which adopted him as son and made him heir, brought him into the resulting power struggle.</p>
<p>Within a year and a half, a trio consisting of Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian was confirmed in power. The following year, in a battle at Philippi (in Macedonia, now Greece), Octavian defeated both Cassius and Brutus, the chief conspirators against Caesar. Antony took command of the eastern provinces (which included Greece and Egypt), Octavian led his forces back to Italy, and Lepidus assumed jurisdiction over Gaul and western North Africa. Lepidus, however, was forced into retirement, and the area he controlled fell to Octavian. Thus Octavian and Antony, who had clashed even before their alliance, became rivals again. In the battle of Actium (31 <span class="era">BC</span>), Octavian defeated Antony to become sole ruler of the Roman world and its first emperor.</p>
<p>Octavian did not possess the military brilliance of his great-uncle, but he had a talent for ending strife and maintaining peace, which immediately gained him the support of the people. During his reign Roman culture enjoyed a golden age, particularly in architecture and literature. Augustus founded the Praetorian Guard, the emperor’s private honor corps of 9,000 soldiers. Originally intended to secure the emperor’s position, it later became so influential that it could independently depose an emperor or elect a new one without Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>The title Augustus <span class="ital">(Augoustos),</span> meaning “exalted one,” was given to Octavian in 27 <span class="era">BC</span>. The title reflects the practice of emperor worship that had been partly initiated in the reign of Julius Caesar, who declared himself to be “the unconquered god” and “the father of the fatherland.” Augustus continued the cult, although at first he declared that he should be worshiped only in association with the goddess Roma. Later, however, Augustus’s name became equated with Rome, and the emperor was regarded as the savior of the world. A temple to Augustus was built in Athens, and even Herod the Great built temples in his honor.</p>
<p>When Augustus became emperor, he devoted himself to reorganizing his empire. Because of the chaos that had prevailed in the provinces, he took it upon himself to restructure economic and financial policies.</p>
<p>Though Caesar Augustus is mentioned only once in the NT, he nevertheless is known to every reader of the Bible because of the census he decreed in all the provinces just before the birth of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1">Lk 2:1</a>). Little information is available about that census, but Luke wrote that the first census was held when Jesus was born. The second was conducted in <span class="era">AD</span> 6 and resulted in an uprising instigated by Judas of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.37">Acts 5:37</a>).</p>
<p>During the time of Augustus’s reign, Herod the Great gained the emperor’s trust and was allowed to rule the Jews without Roman interference. In appreciation Herod rebuilt the old city of Samaria and renamed it Sebaste to honor Augustus. Caesarea on the Mediterranean coast of Palestine was also named in his honor.</p>
<p>Conflicts between Herod and his sons were settled by Augustus in 12 <span class="era">BC</span>. When dispute between father and sons arose again, however, Augustus ordered that it be settled in a Roman court, which ruled in 7 <span class="era">BC</span> that two of them, Alexander and Aristobulus, be executed. In 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, Augustus permitted the execution of Herod’s son Antipater.</p>
<p>In Herod’s last will and testament, three of his sons (Archelaus, Antipas, and Philip) were appointed to rule his kingdom. Augustus’s approval of those appointments was necessary. Archelaus made a personal visit to Rome immediately after the death of his father to request possible changes in his status. Likewise, Antipas journeyed to Rome to see whether Augustus might be willing to grant him royal status as well. While the two of them sought separate audiences with the emperor, a delegation representing the people of Judea appeared before Augustus with the request that the Herodian rule—which was never very popular—be terminated. At the same time riots in Judea had to be suppressed by Roman legions sent from Syria.</p>
<p>Augustus compromised. He converted Herod’s old kingdom to a Roman province and refused kingship to all of Herod’s sons. Otherwise he kept to the provisions of Herod’s testament: Archelaus became ethnarch (overlord) of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea (half of the new province); Antipas became tetrarch of Galilee and Perea (one quarter of the province); Philip became tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>; an area east of Galilee—the final quarter of the province). Because Archelaus was unable to rule effectively, he was deposed by the emperor in <span class="era">AD</span> 6 and banished to Vienne in southern France.</p>
<p>Augustus died in <span class="era">AD</span> 14 after a brief illness, leaving the empire to his appointed successor, Tiberius.</p>
<p class="h3">Tiberius (42 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 37, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 14–37)</p>
<p class="fl">Tiberius Claudius Nero became Octavian’s stepson at the age of four, when his mother, Livia, divorced his father to marry the future emperor. Tiberius was made Augustus’s co-regent in <span class="era">AD</span> 13 and succeeded him the following year. When he became emperor, he changed his name to Tiberius Caesar Augustus.</p>
<p>Tiberius did not have an easy life. His stepfather had forced an unhappy marriage upon him. The Roman Senate often opposed him. In <span class="era">AD</span> 27 Tiberius left Rome for the island of Capri, leaving the task of governing the empire in the hands of Sejanus, a Roman prefect (high-ranking official). During the next five years, Sejanus secretly tried to depose the emperor and seize power for himself. His conspiracy almost succeeded, but Tiberius eventually had him executed. Despite this, Tiberius’s administration was characterized by wisdom, intelligence, prudence, and duty. He continued his predecessor’s policy of striving for peace and security.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 26, presumably before going into semiretirement, Tiberius appointed Pontius Pilate as governor of Judea. Directly responsible to the emperor, Pilate could be immediately removed from office if word of Jewish disturbances or complaints reached Tiberius. Pilate’s capitulation to the Jewish authorities during the trial of Jesus can be best understood in view of this. The Jews accused Jesus of claiming to be king, implying a rivalry with the emperor. When Pilate judged Christ innocent of the charge and sought to release him (<a href="?bref=John.18.33-38">Jn 18:33-38</a>), the Jews insisted he could not do so and still be a friend of Caesar (<a href="?bref=John.19.12">19:12</a>). If he released Jesus, they insinuated, he would risk losing the emperor’s favor. Because of crimes committed at his command against the Jews, Pilate knew they might carry out their threat, resulting in his banishment. So, surrendering to their demands, he condemned Jesus to death by crucifixion.</p>
<p>Tiberius Caesar is mentioned only once in the NT. The Gospel of Luke states that John the Baptist began his ministry in the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). Whether that date was calculated from Tiberius’s actual accession or from the time of his co-regency is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Tiberius was a strangely humble emperor. At his own request he was never officially recognized as a god (a sort of honorary title that the Senate had given to his predecessors). Interest in emperor worship had waned, and Tiberius intended to confine deity to his two predecessors. He also stopped the practice of naming months of the year after emperors; thus there is a July for Julius, an August for Augustus, but no Tiber for Tiberius. Plagued by domestic and political problems all his life, Tiberius died a tired and dejected old man. In fact, he was an excellent administrator.</p>
<p class="h3">Caligula (<span class="era">AD</span> 12–41, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 37–41)</p>
<p class="fl">At the death of Tiberius, Gaius Julius Caesar became emperor at the age of 25. He was the son of an influential general, Germanicus; Augustus had forced Tiberius to adopt Gaius and make him his heir. As a child, Gaius had accompanied Germanicus on his military duties along the Rhine River in Germany. The soldiers nicknamed him Caligula (“Little Boot”) for his military attire. The name stuck.</p>
<p>To gain popularity with the Romans, Caligula began his reign by pardoning people and recalling exiles. He squandered the money of the Roman treasury, however, and was forced to levy new taxes. His popularity was short-lived.</p>
<p>Six months after assuming office, Caligula suffered a serious illness that left him insane. On one occasion, for example, he appointed his horse as consul (chief magistrate). He insulted many people, banished others on whim, and had others murdered without provocation. When he felt that he had been insulted by the Jews in Jamnia, a Judean town near the Mediterranean coast, he ordered a statue of himself placed in the temple at Jerusalem in revenge. The Jews were outraged, and a full-scale revolt was avoided only by the prudence of the governor of Syria, Petronius, who delayed carrying out the order. Not long afterward the emperor was assassinated by one of the many men he had insulted.</p>
<p>It was Caligula who appointed Herod Agrippa I (Herod in <a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-25">Acts 12</a>) king over a tetrarchy northeast of Galilee—one of the first acts he performed as emperor, according to the Jewish historian Josephus. The two had become close friends before either had come to power, while Agrippa was living in Rome, where even as king he later spent much of his time. But unlike Caligula, Agrippa was a capable and popular ruler. Both king and emperor, in the tradition of many eastern monarchs, fancied themselves gods. Caligula, in fact, revived the notion in Rome of the emperor’s deity and madly proclaimed himself equal to Jupiter. The Senate, however, refrained from officially recognizing that status.</p>
<p class="h3">Claudius (10 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 54, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 41–54)</p>
<p class="fl">Tiberius Claudius Germanicus was born in Lyon (France). He was Tiberius’s nephew and a grandson of Livia, the wife of Augustus. In <span class="era">AD</span> 37 he was appointed consul by Caligula. After Caligula’s death Claudius was proclaimed emperor by the Praetorian Guard, and the Senate approved the choice.</p>
<p>When Claudius became emperor, he faced the task of healing the broken relationships caused by Caligula’s madness. He ended the persecution of Jews in the city of Alexandria. Josephus recorded an edict that Claudius sent to Egypt, which read, in part: “Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, high priest and tribune of the people, ordains thus. . . . I will, therefore, that the nation of the Jews be not deprived of their rights and privileges on account of the madness of Gaius; but that those rights and privileges that they formerly enjoyed, be preserved to them, and that they may continue in their own customs.”</p>
<p>That change of policy reflected the emperor’s friendship with Herod Agrippa, who had played an influential role in Claudius’s succession as emperor. Claudius, in turn, added Judea and Samaria to Agrippa’s kingdom, giving him the dominion that once belonged to his grandfather, Herod the Great. He also promoted him to consular rank. Further, having complete trust in Agrippa’s abilities, Claudius removed Judea from Roman provincial rule.</p>
<p>Agrippa’s rule, however, was of short duration. In order to please the Jews, he had the apostle James, Zebedee’s son, killed. He also had the apostle Peter imprisoned, planning to have him executed after the Passover feast in the spring of <span class="era">AD</span> 44 (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-5">Acts 12:1-5</a>). Peter escaped. During the summer of that year, Agrippa, who was wearing a glistening garment made of silver thread, gave a speech from his throne. The people acclaimed him as a god (v <a href="?bref=Acts.12.22">22</a>), and immediately he was struck down by an angel of the Lord. Five days later he died.</p>
<p>The emperor wished to stay on the right side of the Jewish people, yet five years after the death of Agrippa, Claudius issued an edict expelling all Jews from Rome. Luke related that Aquila and Priscilla were among those who had been ordered to leave the imperial city (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). The Roman biographer and historian Suetonius wrote that “because the Jews of Rome were indulging in constant riots at the instigation of Chrestus he [Claudius] expelled them from the city.” The writer could easily have been uncertain of the spelling, because Chrestus, a common slave name, was pronounced virtually the same as Christus. It appears that Suetonius sought to convey to his readers that Chrestus was the founder of a movement (presumably Christianity).</p>
<p>Because of mismanagement by Caligula, the supply of grain for food was at an all-time low when Claudius began to reign (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">Acts 11:28</a>). Josephus related that during Claudius’s administration, famine plagued Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. To alleviate the famine in Jerusalem, Helena, mother of the king of Adiabene, bought grain from Egypt and dried figs from Cyprus. That must have taken place in <span class="era">AD</span> 45–46. Various ancient historians, including Tacitus, Suetonius, and Eusebius, reported that on frequent occasions famines prevailed in Rome and elsewhere. Repeatedly, harvests were minimal and distribution of food supplies was poor.</p>
<p>Claudius’s family life and reputation were marred by intrigue. His immoral third wife, Messalina, was eventually put to death. Causing a slight scandal, he married his niece Agrippina, who had a son by a former marriage. She wanted her son Nero to be emperor, but Britannicus, Messalina’s son, stood first in line. In <span class="era">AD</span> 54, when Claudius decided that Britannicus should succeed him, Agrippina poisoned her husband and made Nero emperor. The Senate officially deified Claudius, making him the third emperor to receive that honor.</p>
<p class="h3">Nero (<span class="era">AD</span> 37–68, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 54–68)</p>
<p class="fl">Nero was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. His father was a senator and consul who died when Nero was still a boy. His mother, Agrippina, Germanicus’s daughter, was reputed to be one of the wealthiest and most beautiful women in Rome. When she married the emperor, her son received the name Nero Claudius Caesar Germanicus at his adoption by Claudius.</p>
<p>Nero was at first dominated by his proud mother, who wished to reign alongside her son. In those years Rome was a hotbed of political intrigue, murder plots, and assassinations. During the first five years of his reign, Nero had Britannicus and Agrippina eliminated in quick succession. A few years later he banished his wife, Octavia, and had her killed.</p>
<p>Ironically, the church at Rome flourished at that same time. The last chapter of the apostle Paul’s Letter to the Romans, written from Corinth in <span class="era">AD</span> 57, contains a long and impressive list of names of personal acquaintances—especially impressive because Paul had never been in Rome.</p>
<p>Nero had reigned more than five years when Paul, imprisoned at Caesarea, appealed to Caesar (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.11">Acts 25:11</a>). Motives for the appeal may have been a prison release for Paul and an opportunity to seek legal recognition of Christianity. Paul’s appeal to Caesar, however, does not necessarily mean that he was judged by Nero. The emperor had made it known at the beginning of his reign that he would not be a judge. Instead, he appointed prefects of the Praetorian Guard to judge cases for him. In the early part of <span class="era">AD</span> 62, Nero changed that rule and judged a case himself. Therefore, whether Paul stood before Nero or before one of the prefects is difficult to determine. If prosecutors failed to appear, Paul’s case may not have come before the judge at all. According to <a href="?bref=Phil.1.7-14">Philippians 1:7-14</a>, Paul was still expecting a trial at the time of his writing that letter.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 62 Nero’s adviser Afranius Burrus died. Burrus had been a prefect of the Praetorian Guard and, together with an able senator, Seneca, had ruled the empire effectively while Nero spent his time on pleasure. After Burrus’s death (Seneca was forced to commit suicide three years later), Nero began to indulge his whims unchecked. His greedy advisers, who sought self-advancement at the expense of the state, caused a severe financial crisis. Nero was also unbalanced in regarding himself the savior of the world.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 64 a fire broke out at the Circus Maximus in Rome. It spread quickly, devouring everything in its path. Fanned by the wind, it raged for more than five days and devastated a large area of the city before being brought under control. At the time, Nero was at Antium, his birthplace, some 33 miles (53 kilometers) to the south. He rushed to Rome to organize relief work. Because of his evil record, however, people put stock in the rumor that Nero had set the fire himself.</p>
<p>Nero, in turn, found a scapegoat in the Christians, whom he charged with the crime. Many were persecuted. Perhaps the apostle Peter in his first letter was referring to the sufferings of Christians during the last few years of Nero’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12">1 Pt 4:12</a>). Nero may have been influenced by his second wife, Poppaea, to blame the Christians for the devastation of Rome. The church had increased in numbers and had become a movement. Tacitus alluded to the size of the church when he wrote that “a huge crowd was convicted not so much of arson as of hatred of the human race.”</p>
<p>It is likely that Peter and Paul were executed during the Neronian persecution. Clement of Rome, an early church father, in his letter to the church at Corinth (written presumably in <span class="era">AD</span> 95), referred to the heroes of faith “who lived nearest to our time,” namely Peter and Paul, who suffered martyrdom.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 66 a Jewish revolt broke out in Caesarea. Nero dispatched his general Vespasian to squelch the revolt, taking no interest himself in the affairs of state. He left Rome for a journey to Greece, leaving the responsibility of governing the empire to a Roman prefect, Helius. Because of the inescapable opposition he encountered from leading governors in France, Spain, and Africa on his return, Nero committed suicide in <span class="era">AD</span> 68. He was the last emperor of the Caesarean line by blood or marriage.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SomeLaterEmperors">Some Later Emperors</p>
<p class="h3">Galba (3 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 69, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 68–69)</p>
<p class="fl">After Nero’s death, the Praetorian Guard selected Serius Sulpicius Galba to become emperor. Galba was a popular and capable governor at various times in the provinces of France, Germany, Spain, and Africa. He was a less successful emperor and became increasingly unpopular with the army and the people for his frugality and dislike of ceremony. The German legions of the Roman army, who had only reluctantly recognized him as their commander-in-chief, withdrew their support in <span class="era">AD</span> 69, proclaiming Aulus Vitellius emperor.</p>
<p>When Galba failed to appoint one of his chief supporters, Marcus Salvius Otho, as his successor, he in essence signed his own death warrant. Otho gained the support of the Praetorian Guard, was proclaimed emperor, had Galba killed, and was confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p class="h3">Vespasian (<span class="era">AD</span> 9–79, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 69–79)</p>
<p class="fl">In the fall of <span class="era">AD</span> 69, Vespasian found Rome ready for a period of stability, peace, and order. The son of a tax collector, he lived frugally, reestablished Rome’s finances, reorganized the armies, and reemphasized the outward forms of the old republic. According to Suetonius, no innocent party was ever punished while Vespasian was emperor. He grieved when convicted criminals were executed.</p>
<p>Because of Nero’s financial mismanagement, Vespasian had to levy new taxes and increase existing taxes in order to meet his fiscal obligations. As a result he was slandered as avaricious, although he was generous in aiding underprivileged senators and impoverished ex-consuls. Vespasian improved a number of cities in the empire that had been devastated by fire or earthquake, and he promoted the arts and sciences. In Rome he built the Temple of Peace after the destruction of Jerusalem and the defeat of the Jews, erected a forum, restored the Capitol, and began construction of the Colosseum.</p>
<p>During his 10-year reign, Vespasian established peace throughout the empire. His son Titus ended the war in Palestine, and other Roman generals suppressed a revolt in Germany. Public confidence was largely restored with the return to earlier standards of morality. Vespasian appointed his sons Titus and Domitian to succeed him.</p>
<p class="h3">Titus (<span class="era">AD</span> 39–81, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 79–81)</p>
<p class="fl">Titus Flavius Vespasianus had served efficiently as a colonel in Germany and Britain. When the Jewish revolt broke out, he accompanied his father to Palestine. When Vespasian left for Rome five years later, Titus was appointed general of the Roman forces in Palestine. On September 26, <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by fire, the citadel fell into the hands of the Romans, and countless Jews were killed. Titus returned to Rome with Jewish captives and spoils from the temple to celebrate his victory with his father. The Arch of Titus was erected in Rome, depicting his conquest of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Until Vespasian’s death, Titus was almost a co-ruler with his father. He served as Vespasian’s secretary, drafted edicts, and addressed the Senate in session. Titus was a talented person, especially in politics and music. He had fallen in love with Queen Bernice, King Agrippa II’s sister (see <a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-26.32">Acts 25–26</a>) and allegedly had promised to marry her, but moral integrity prevented him when rumor reached him of an incestuous relationship with her brother.</p>
<p>During Titus’s brief reign as emperor (<span class="era">AD</span> 79–81), a series of catastrophes occurred: Mt Vesuvius in southern Italy erupted and buried the towns of Pompeii, Stabiae, and Herculaneum (August, <span class="era">AD</span> 79); a fire raged for three days and nights in Rome (<span class="era">AD</span> 80); and a plague spread throughout the imperial city. Suetonius wrote that during those disasters Titus cared for the people with a love resembling the deep love of a father for his children. When Titus died unexpectedly, his death caused universal mourning; he was eulogized by senators and common people alike.</p>
<p class="h3">Domitian (<span class="era">AD</span> 51–96, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 81–96)</p>
<p class="fl">During Titus’s rule, his brother Domitian expressed bitterness at having to take second place, openly coveted power, and conspired to seize command of the armed forces. He secretly rejoiced over Titus’s sudden death and tried to slight his older brother’s reputation. As it turned out, Domitian proved to be a capable administrator: he restored the fire-gutted Capitol and built a temple to Jupiter, the Flavian Temple, a forum, a stadium, a concert hall, and an artificial lake for sea battles. He instituted the Capitoline Festival, promoted the arts and sciences, and maintained the public libraries.</p>
<p>After the custom of earlier emperors Domitian proclaimed himself divine and had his subjects call him “Lord God.” The Senate, however, never officially deified him. Throughout his reign they resented and often opposed the power he exercised by prerogative. Domitian did not hesitate to persecute senators who made their objections known. In order to protect himself, he sought the army’s support by periodically increasing their pay. He collected additional taxes and often resorted to extortion. Jewish people were especially affected by his taxation. In the last years of Domitian’s reign, religious persecution was revived.</p>
<p>The early Christian writers Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Eusebius mention the persecution of Christians during Domitian’s administration. Domitian appears to have been a relentless persecutor, second only to Nero. He even put members of his own family to death; his wife, Domitia, feared for her life because of her alleged affiliation with Christianity. With friends and freedmen, she plotted her husband’s assassination.</p>
<p>After ruling the empire for 15 years, Domitian was murdered. Mourned by none, except perhaps his well-paid army, he left in the wake of his reign a bitter memory of oppression.</p>
<p class="h3">Trajan (<span class="era">AD</span> 53–117, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 98–117)</p>
<p class="fl">Trajan was born Marcus Trajanus of Roman parents in Italica, Spain. His father was a soldier who was promoted to governor of an eastern province in Spain. Trajan, trained to be a military commander, proved himself in campaigns in Spain, Syria, and Germany. In <span class="era">AD</span> 97, Emperor Nerva adopted him as his son and heir. Upon Nerva’s death the following year, Trajan was named emperor.</p>
<p>A powerful military leader, Trajan expanded the Roman Empire by many conquests in Dacia (now part of Romania and Hungary), Arabia, and Parthia (now part of Iran). He established new cities, including Thamugadi in what is now Algeria. He also oversaw many building programs, including bridges across the Danube River in Dacia and Tagus River in Spain, and a harbor at the port of Rome. According to the writings of Pliny (see <span class="ital">Letters</span> 10.96), we know that Trajan instigated persecutions against Christians because their worship of Jesus threatened to exterminate the traditional forms of Roman worship. The Christians’ refusal to invoke the Roman gods and make offerings to the emperor’s statue was considered a treasonous act because it undermined the empire’s security.</p>
<p class="h3">Diocletian (<span class="era">AD</span> 245–313, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 284–305)</p>
<p class="fl">Born to parents of humble means in Dalmatia (now part of Yugoslavia), Diocles changed his name to Diocletian when he became emperor. As a young man he joined the army and rose in rank, becoming commander of the imperial guard. When the emperor Numerian was murdered, Diocles’ troops proclaimed him the new ruler. Numerian’s brother, Carinus, was killed by his own troops when he sought the throne, and the way was clear for Diocles to assume control unopposed.</p>
<p>Diocletian, an able organizer and administrator, used his skills to enact many structural reforms in the Roman Empire, including the establishment of the tetrarchy (293), a new imperial system in which four rulers shared power. His other reforms affected military, administrative, and economic areas. As a result of such reorganization, Diocletian created an efficient bureaucracy. Nevertheless, Rome declined as a political power center, and the Senate was further subordinated to the tetrarchy.</p>
<p>A persecution of Christians began during Diocletian’s reign in 303, which was aimed at destroying church buildings and copies of the NT Scriptures. Among the tetrarchs, Galerius was the most active in carrying out the persecution. Because persecution continued under Galerius after Diocletian’s abdication, some scholars maintain that Diocletian was not responsible for the policy. Diocletian retired to a villa at Split in his native Dalmatia, avoiding public association with the new administration’s superstitious and violent policies.</p>
<p class="h3">Constantine the Great (<span class="era">AD</span> 272 or 273–337, reigned <span class="era">AD</span> 306–337)</p>
<p class="fl">Constantine’s parents were Constantius Chlorus, the Western co-emperor of the Roman Empire, and Helena, a concubine. When his father died in England in 306, Constantine was proclaimed emperor by the troops and grudgingly accepted by Galerius, the Eastern emperor. The government of the empire was thrown into turmoil, and within two years five men had claimed to be emperor.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death in 311, Galerius, the senior co-emperor, issued an edict of toleration that ended the persecution of Christians. With Galerius gone, Constantine and Licinius (who had become his co-emperor) allied themselves against Maxentius and Maximin Daia. In 312 Constantine defeated and killed Maxentius in a battle at the Mulvian Bridge near Rome. Maximin Daia fell to Licinius in the next year. An uneasy peace between Constantine and Licinius was maintained until 323, when Constantine crossed into Licinius’s territory while chasing out Gothic invaders. Battles at Adrianople and Chrysopolis in the next year decided the matter and left Constantine the sole emperor.</p>
<p>One of his most significant political moves was the founding of the city of Constantinople, dedicated in 330 on the site of Byzantium. Its location on the Strait of Bosporus was ideal from a military standpoint since it gave access to both the Rhine-Danube and Persian fronts. Constantine continued a reorganization of government started by Diocletian (reigned 284-305) and reformed the currency. He also allowed barbarians to settle within the empire in order to use them in the army.</p>
<p>Constantine is most remembered for his religious policies. The nature of his own religious beliefs has been disputed. From the first he was tolerant of Christians in his own realm. His preference for Christianity was demonstrated just before the battle at the Mulvian Bridge. According to one account, in a dream before the battle Constantine saw a vision of a monogram composed of the first two Greek letters of the name of “Christ.” The next day he had his soldiers inscribe that monogram on their shields. Another story says that, while marching one day, he and his army saw the image of a cross appear before the sun with the words “In this sign conquer.” During the winter of 312–13, he wrote to an officer in North Africa instructing him to supply money to the bishop of Carthage in order to pay expenses of the clergy. When he and Licinius met in Milan in 313, they issued an edict granting all persons the freedom to follow whichever religion they wished. His Christian sentiments also resulted in laws allowing bishops to decide civil lawsuits, banning any branding on the face (because it marred the image of God), closing law courts and workshops on Sunday, and banning gladiatorial games. Though he favored Christianity, Constantine was also tolerant of paganism and, as late as 324, pagan themes were engraved on his coins. With Christians such a minority in the empire, Constantine felt he could not risk offending the pagan majority.</p>
<p>Constantine took an active role in church controversies. When Caecilian was challenged as bishop of Carthage (313) by the Donatists (separatists in the African church), Constantine instructed the bishops of Rome to summon a commission to hear the case. Since the Donatists were not content with the results of that commission, Constantine himself eventually heard the case, and in 316 he declared Caecilian to be the rightful bishop. Constantine also summoned the Council of Nicaea in 325, which ruled against Arianism (a heresy that denied that Christ as the Son of God was coeternal with the Father). It was the emperor’s edict that gave legal force to the Nicaean decision.</p>
<p>One serious scandal marred Constantine’s reign. In 326 he had his son Crispus and his own wife, Faustus, executed on charges of adultery. Constantine was succeeded by his three other sons (Constans, Constantius, Constantine II), after being baptized a Christian on his deathbed (according to legend).</p>

  <title>Caesar’s Household*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAESAR’S HOUSEHOLD*</p>
<p class="fl">Term referring to imperial servants, both slave and free, in Rome and in the provinces of the Roman Empire. The apostle Paul closed his letter to the Philippian Christians with greetings from those “of Caesar’s household” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.22">4:22</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The imperial household staff numbered in the hundreds, and the positions carried a certain amount of social importance.</p>
<p>According to the Martyrdom of Paul, written in the second century, when Paul arrived at Rome, he was greeted by people “from Caesar’s household.” He put himself in communication with the local Jewish leaders and preached and taught unhindered (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.17,31">Acts 28:17, 31</a>). Some men and women were convinced and believed (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.23-24">Acts 28:23-24</a>), no doubt including some in Caesar’s household. The message even spread to the whole Praetorian Guard (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.13">Phil 1:13</a>). Some scholars trace certain believers mentioned in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">Romans 16</a> to members of the imperial household.</p>

  <title>Caiaphas</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAIAPHAS</p>
<p class="fl">High priest during the life and ministry of Jesus. As official head of the Jewish state, Caiaphas presided over the council, or Sanhedrin—its highest court. Next to the Roman governor, he was the most powerful man in Judea and was responsible to the Romans for the conduct of the nation. Caiaphas was, therefore, especially concerned about the popular enthusiasm and political unrest centering on the ministry of Jesus and about its implications for the revolutionary sentiment of the time. The activities of the Zealots were increasing and were destined to break out soon into open revolt.</p>
<p>A huge stir among the people, caused by the raising of Lazarus (<a href="?bref=John.11.1-57">Jn 11</a>), brought matters to a head. Alarmed lest the activities of those seeking a political messiah should lead the Romans to intervene with armed force, Caiaphas advised that Jesus should be put to death (<a href="?bref=John.11.48-50">Jn 11:48-50</a>). The Gospel writer John pointed out that, in so doing, Caiaphas unwittingly prophesied concerning the atoning nature of Jesus’ death (<a href="?bref=John.11.51-52">Jn 11:51-52</a>).</p>
<p>Caiaphas played a chief role in Jesus’ arrest and trial. The leaders laid their plans in his palace (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.3-5">Mt 26:3-5</a>); it was there also that part of Jesus’ preliminary trial took place with Caiaphas presiding (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.57-68">57-68</a>). That was after Jesus had first been taken before Annas, Caiaphas’s father-in-law (<a href="?bref=John.18.13">Jn 18:13</a>). Matthew, Mark, and Luke omit the visit to Annas, and Mark and Luke do not refer to Caiaphas by name. Upon Jesus’ admission that he was “the Christ, the Son of God,” Caiaphas tore his robes and charged him with blasphemy (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.63-66">Mt 26:63-66</a>). After Pentecost, he, along with other Jewish leaders, presided over the trial of Peter and John when the council attempted to stop the preaching of the apostles (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.5-6">Acts 4:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>Annas, who had held the office of high priest before Caiaphas, remained influential in the affairs of the nation. That explains why Luke, in his Gospel, set the ministry of John the Baptist “in the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.2">Lk 3:2</a>), and in Acts called Annas the high priest (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.6">Acts 4:6</a>). John’s account of Jesus’ visit to Annas makes plain that Annas was still popularly referred to as “high priest” (<a href="?bref=John.18.22">Jn 18:22</a>).</p>
<p>The historian Josephus records that Caiaphas was appointed to his office about <span class="era">AD</span> 18 and ruled until he was deposed about <span class="era">AD</span> 36. The high priest held office at the whim of the Romans, so Caiaphas’s unusually long term indicates that he was a man of considerable political skill. Caiaphas was removed from his position by the proconsul Vitellus, and nothing more is known of him.</p>

<p class="h1">CAIN (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">First son of Adam and Eve, who became a tiller of the soil while his brother, Abel, was a keeper of sheep. Cain’s murder of Abel became proverbial of similarly violent and destructive sins (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>). Each of the two brothers had brought a sacrifice to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.3-4">Gn 4:3-4</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Heb.11.4">Hebrews 11:4</a>, Abel had acted in faith by bringing a more acceptable sacrifice than that of Cain. The latter’s anger had flared against the divine rejection. In retaliation, he killed his brother, whose offering had been accepted (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.5-8">Gn 4:5-8</a>). In seeking a reason for Cain’s inappropriate violent reaction, biblical commentary simply says that he belonged to the evil one (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.12">1 Jn 3:12</a>). The Lord confronted Cain with his guilt, judged him, and pronounced a curse upon him, driving him out to the land of Nod, east of Eden (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.9-16">Gn 4:9-16</a>). When he complained that his punishment was greater than he could bear and that someone would find him and kill him, the Lord placed a mark on Cain and promised to take sevenfold vengeance on anyone who dared to kill him.</p>
<p>In the land of Nod, Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.17">Gn 4:17</a>). Through Enoch, Cain became the progenitor of a large family that during its early generations became tent-dwelling herdsmen, musicians, and fashioners of metal objects and implements (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.4.18-22">18-22</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">CALAH</p>
<p class="fl">One of the ancient capital cities of Assyria built by Nimrod (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.11-12">Gn 10:11-12</a>). Calah is the ancient name for modern Nimrud, which is located 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) south of Nineveh on the east bank of the Tigris River. It was excavated by Henry Layard from 1845 to 1849 and by the British School of Archaeology in Iraq from 1949 to 1964. The site was occupied from prehistoric times down to the Hellenistic period.</p>
<p>Excavations at Calah revealed a large ziggurat and temples dedicated to Ninurta and Nabu. A large citadel constructed by Shalmaneser I in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> and a palace built by Ashurnasirpal II (883–859 <span class="era">BC</span>) were also uncovered there. Palaces of Shalmaneser III (858–824 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Esarhaddon (680–669 <span class="era">BC</span>) were partially cleared. Among other notable discoveries from the city is the black obelisk of Shalmaneser III, which is presently in the British Museum. The monument is important to biblical studies because of its record of tribute paid by King Jehu of Israel to the Assyrians.</p>
<p>Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Sargon II (721–705 <span class="era">BC</span>) launched their attacks on Israel and Judah from Calah. Sargon captured Samaria. Tiglath-pileser was involved with Judah when Ahaz formed a coalition with him against Israel and Syria (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-17">Is 7:1-17</a>). Calah was eventually destroyed by the Babylonians and Medes in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>

<p class="h1">CALEB</p>
<p class="list">1. Son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite (<a href="?bref=Num.32.12">Nm 32:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.14.6">Jos 14:6</a>) and older brother of Kenaz (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.13">Jgs 1:13</a>). Caleb was one of the 12 spies sent to scout out the land of Canaan. Although he and Joshua, another spy, recommended an immediate attack, their suggestion was rejected by the Israelite tribes because of other reports of heavily defended fortresses. Consequently, entrance into Canaan, the Promised Land, was delayed for some years as a divine judgment (<a href="?bref=Num.14.21-23,34-35">Nm 14:21-23, 34-35</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Israel under Joshua’s leadership finally occupied Canaan, Caleb, at age 85 (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.6-7,10">Jos 14:6-7, 10</a>), was assigned Hebron, which he conquered by overcoming its Anakim inhabitants (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.14.13-14">13-14</a>). Caleb offered his daughter Achsah to whomever would overthrow nearby Debir (Kiriath-sepher). Othniel, Kenaz’s son and Achsah’s cousin, was able to claim her as his wife by conquering the town (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.16-17">15:16-17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Hebron later became a Levitical city of refuge (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.13">Jos 21:13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.55-57">1 Chr 6:55-57</a>). In some portion of Caleb’s territory David spent time as an outlaw and met his future wife Abigail, then the wife of Nabal, a Calebite (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.3">1 Sm 25:3</a>). Here also his wives were captured by Amalekite marauders who had raided southern Judah and “the Negev of Caleb” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.30.14">1 Sm 30:14</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Hezron’s son and brother of Jerahmeel (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.18,42">1 Chr 2:18, 42</a>), also called Chelubai (v <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.9">9</a>). Many scholars, however, believe that this Caleb is the same as #1 above because (1) Achsah is mentioned as the daughter of both (v <a href="?bref=1Chr.2.49">49</a>); and (2) the prominent place of an otherwise unknown Caleb in the genealogy would be hard to account for. According to these scholars, Caleb was listed as a son of Hezron (the grandson of Judah) in order to establish his position and inheritance in Judah’s tribe. In reality, however, Caleb was a foreigner, son of Jephunneh, a Kenizzite, who had joined himself and his clan to Judah’s tribe. Some support this view by arguing that Caleb is a Horite rather than Israelite name.</p>
<p class="list">3. Hur’s son, according to the <span class="sc">kjv</span> (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.50">1 Chr 2:50</a>).

<p class="h1">CALENDARS, Ancient and Modern</p>
<p class="fl">Systematic arrangements showing the beginning and length of each year and its division into days, weeks, and months. The modern calendar is usually taken for granted. But without a calendar it would be extremely difficult to establish a uniform chronology (that is, a system for arranging events in the time sequence in which they actually happened). Also, accurate prediction of the coming and going of seasons would be impossible.</p>
<p>Before the calendar took on its modern format, it had to progress through a number of developmental stages.</p>

<p class="h2" id="DaysandTheirDivisions">Days and Their Divisions</p>
<p class="fl">The earliest attempt to mark off time was probably the simple counting of days, followed by the subdivision of each day into what eventually became 24 equal parts called hours. Since the Sumerians seem to have originated the measurement of time by minutes, hours, and days, they obviously also knew the narrower meaning of “day,” which for them designated a 12-hour period.</p>
<p>Measurement of time in the days of King Ahaz is illustrated by reference to a sundial (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.9">2 Kgs 20:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.38.8">Is 38:8</a>). The precise measurement of hours, however, must have been a relatively late practice. Early Europeans, like the ancient Egyptians, placed the beginning of the day at midnight, further dividing the period into two 12-hour segments. In the second century <span class="era">BC</span> the Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy and his disciples devised an astronomically convenient method of calculating each day from high noon, when the sun reached its apex in the heavens. The Roman day began at sunrise, with the second part of the day commencing at sunset.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AstronomyandtheCalendar">Astronomy and the Calendar</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient peoples constructed their calendars on the basis of their observations of “cycles” of the sun and moon. The solar year is the period of time in which the earth accomplishes a complete revolution in its orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>The life of ancient peoples was closely tied to the changes in temperature and in the relative length of days and nights characteristic of the four seasons. Seasonal changes result from the fact that while the earth is orbiting the sun, it is also rotating on its own axis, tipped at an angle to the plane of its path around the sun. The longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere is called the summer solstice (about June 21 on the modern calendar). At the winter solstice (December 21 or 22) the noonday sun appears lowest (farthest south) and the days are shortest. (In the southern hemisphere summer and winter are reversed by the effect of the earth’s tilt.) Halfway between, at the vernal (spring) equinox about March 21, and the autumnal (fall) equinox about September 23, the sun is directly over the equator and there are as many hours of daylight as of darkness. The term “equinox” is from the Latin words for “equal night.” A solar year could be measured by ancient peoples as the period between two similar solstices or equinoxes.</p>
<p>The solar calendar marks off days by observing the period between consecutive returns of the sun to a similar position above the earth, such as its rising, setting, or highest point at midday. A “day” thus represents one complete rotation of the earth on its own axis, now divided into 24 hours. Since that rotation is not directly related to the earth’s annual orbit around the sun, calendar problems arise because the true solar year does not equal a certain whole number of days but 365 days plus a fraction of a day.</p>
<p>The most significant calendar problems arise when the sun’s motion is not the only factor taken into consideration in marking off a year. Considerable difficulties were encountered in ancient attempts to reconcile solar and lunar periods, especially when subdivisions of the year (months) were made to correspond to the more irregular phases of the moon. The fact that while the moon is orbiting the earth, the earth is orbiting the sun (and rotating at the same time) produces many complications.</p>
<p>The lunar calendar measured time by lunations (a lunation is the interval of time, expressed in days, between two successive new moons). Each lunar month, beginning when the thin crescent of the new moon first becomes visible at dusk, averages just over 29½ days. The moon actually orbits the earth in about 27<span class="sup">1</span>/<span class="sub">3</span> days. Because the earth is meanwhile moving around the sun, it takes the moon two extra days to come to the same position between the sun and earth and produce a “new moon.”</p>
<p>A lunar year of 12 months was approximately 11 days shorter than the solar year, so additional days were inserted to make up for the difference. The practice of insertion, known as intercalation, was a device common to several lunar calendar systems. The ancient Chinese compensated by adding an intercalary month every 30 years to their calendar, which consisted of 12 months of 29 or 30 days each. The Muslim lunar calendar, still used throughout Islam, also recognized 30 years as a cycle. Beginning with the second year within each cycle, and at subsequent intervals of three years, a “leap year” (a year of abnormal length) is observed. In that framework a leap year comprises 355 days as opposed to the ordinary Muslim year of 354 days. Calculation of the ancient Hebrew year suffered the same problems as other lunar calendars.</p>

<p class="h2" id="JewishCalendar">Jewish Calendar</p>
<p class="fl">It is hard to imagine a people with lives more closely bound to and regulated by the calendar than the people of ancient Israel. The Jewish calendar is dated from what is supposed to have been the Creation: 3,760 years and three months before the Christian era. Accordingly, to find the current year in the Jewish calendar, one must add 3,759 to the date in the Gregorian calendar. The system, however, will not work to the exact month, since the Jewish year (running on the civil calendar) begins in autumn rather than in midwinter.</p>
<p class="h3">Months</p>
<p class="fl">Most of the 12 months of the postexilic calendar have names adapted from the Babylonians. The months do not correspond to but overlap the months of the Roman calendar.</p>
<p>The names of over half the months are mentioned in the OT: Kislev (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.1">Neh 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.7.1">Zec 7:1</a>; <span class="sc">rsv</span> “Chislev”), Tebeth (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.16">Est 2:16</a>), Shebat (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.7">Zec 1:7</a>), Adar (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.7,8">Est 3:7, 8:12</a>), Nisan (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">Neh 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.3.7">Est 3:7</a>), Sivan (<a href="?bref=Esth.8.9">Est 8:9</a>), and Elul (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">Neh 6:15</a>).</p>
<p>Since the Jewish month invariably began with the new moon, at intervals of approximately 29½ days, the Jewish year ran 354 days. No exact information is available to explain how the Jews originally adjusted their inaccurate lunar calendar to synchronize with the actual solar year. Late in Israel’s history an extra month was inserted between Adar and Nisan. That month, sometimes called Veader (“second Adar”), was added seven times within a 19-year cycle (at which time Adar received an extra half day).</p>
<p>The names for the Jewish months as now known come from the period following the return from Babylonia to Palestine. Before the Babylonian exile at least four other names were in use: Abib (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.4">Ex 13:4</a>), Ziv (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1,37">1 Kgs 6:1, 37</a>), Ethanim (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.2">8:2</a>), and Bul (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.38">6:38</a>). After the Captivity, they were renamed Nisan, Iyyar, Tishri, and Heshvan (originally Marcheshvan), respectively. The preexilic names carried agricultural connotations. For example, Abib signified the month in which the heads of the grain became ripe; Ziv was the month for desert flowers to bloom. An agricultural orientation is apparent in what is evidently the oldest Hebrew calendar, found at Gezer (southeast of Tel Aviv) in 1908 and dating from the 10th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Probably the work of a Jewish schoolboy, the calendar breaks down the year by agricultural activities such as sowing, reaping, pruning, and storage.</p>
<p>Primarily, however, the months were religiously significant to the Jews and enabled them to commemorate the important events of their history. Each month’s beginning was considered holy. To ancient Israel, the moon became a spiritual symbol of the nation itself; the sun eventually became symbolic of the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.2">Mal 4:2</a>). Since the moon produces no light of its own, the symbolism is especially appropriate: Israel was supposed to reflect the Messiah’s light to the world.</p>
<p>The Jewish calendar remained unchanged during the period between the OT and NT (approximately 400 years) despite an attempt by Hellenistic rulers to introduce a modified lunar month system, presumably of Macedonian origin. According to that calendar, five days were added to the final month of the year, with each of the 12 months containing 30 days. Even then, it only approximated the solar year.</p>
<p class="h3">Reckoning of Dates</p>
<p class="fl">We know of no era in which the ancient Hebrews recorded dates by citing a month and day. Rather, dates were computed by reference to some significant event such as the accession year of the reigning king. In NT times the Jews continued the OT method of dating events by synchronizing them with events either in their religious calendar or within the secular sphere of the Roman world. Writers of the NT followed the same principle (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">Lk 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.1">Jn 12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12">Acts 18:12</a>). Only as the calendar reforms of Julius Caesar became embedded in the culture did people change from that long-standing method to a more standardized system.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JewishFestivals">Jewish Festivals</p>
<p class="fl">In addition to keeping the Sabbath, Jews observe seven annual festivals.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Passover (14th of Nisan) marks the deliverance from Egypt (the exodus). The first day of Nisan determines the date for Passover. Passover is observed for seven days and encompasses the Feast of Unleavened Bread, an event recalling Israel’s hasty preparation for the flight from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.15">Ex 12:15</a>). The festival for the firstfruits of the barley harvest immediately follows (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.10">Lv 23:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Pentecost is celebrated 50 days after Passover. A time of joyful celebration for the people, Pentecost is the Feast of Ingathering of the firstfruits of the wheat harvest (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.22">Ex 34:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.23.15-17">Lv 23:15-17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Next in order is New Year’s Day, the beginning of Tishri. The first of Tishri, according to the rabbis, was the day in which the Lord created the world. It is called Rosh Hashanah, “head of the year.”</p>
<p class="list">4. On the 10th of Tishri, Israel’s most solemn day, Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), is observed. This holiest of days is known as “the Sabbath of Sabbaths,” and the complex ritual for its observance is set forth in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.1-34">Lv 16</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Succoth, the Feast of Tabernacles, occupies the 15th through the 22d of Tishri. A largely agricultural festival, it celebrates the ingathering of the autumn harvest. The apostle John referred to it simply as “the feast” (<a href="?bref=John.7.37">Jn 7:37</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles, sometimes called the Feast of Booths (Shelters), is also a spiritual commemoration; it recalls God’s care over his people throughout Israel’s 40 years in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Lev.23.39-43">Lv 23:39-43</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. Of later origin is the Festival of Hanukkah, the Feast of Dedication. It commemorates Judas Maccabeus’s decisive victory over Antiochus Epiphanes and the Syrians 150 years before Christ. Since Malachi, the last of the OT prophets, had passed from the scene long before that event, tradition alone governs the manner in which the occasion is celebrated. On the 25th of Kislev and the following seven days, joyous activities mark the Jewish calendar.</p>
<p class="list">7. Concluding the sacred festivals for the year is Purim, which falls on the 14th and 15th of Adar. The feast, which finds its origin in ancient Persia, commemorates the deliverance brought through Mordecai and Esther when they frustrated Haman’s plot to destroy the Jews (<a href="?bref=Esth.9.1-32">Est 9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">As ancient sundials and modern clocks mark the passage of minutes and hours, a calendar marks the passage of days, weeks, months, years, and even centuries. A uniform, understandable way of measuring the longer units of time aids secular enterprises such as agriculture, business, and government; it is essential to historians and brings unity to the celebration of religious rites. Development of the modern (Gregorian) calendar represents an interaction between the science of astronomy and much historical and religious tradition. The religious significance of the calendar for Christians stems partly from the biblical contrast between God’s timelessness and human mortality (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-17">Ps 90</a>). The psalmist asked God to “teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom” (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.12">Ps 90:12</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">CALF, Golden</p>
<p class="fl">Calf-shaped idol fashioned at the Israelites’ request from their own gold jewelry (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-4">Ex 32:1-4</a>). Under Aaron’s supervision, the idol was created while Moses was receiving the Ten Commandments on Mt Sinai. Upon seeing the golden calf and the immoral carousing in which the people were engaged, Moses smashed the tablets containing the commandments. He then ground the calf to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the people drink it (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.32.15-20">15-20</a>). Some of the transgressors were slaughtered (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.32.25-29">25-29</a>), while others were punished by God himself with a plague (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.32.33-35">33-35</a>).</p>
<p>Aaron’s golden calf was probably modeled after Apis, an Egyptian bull god. Apis was connected with another Egyptian god, Osiris. Magnificent bulls worshiped in life as Apis were buried at death as Osiris-Apis, a name that became Serapis during the intertestamental period. The notoriety of Aaron’s golden calf is underscored by several biblical references to it in historical summaries (<a href="?bref=Deut.9.16,21">Dt 9:16, 21</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.9.18">Neh 9:18</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.106.19-20">Ps 106:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.39-41">Acts 7:39-41</a>).</p>
<p>Jeroboam I (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>), the first king of Israel after the division of the monarchy, set up shrines at Dan in the far north and at Bethel in the south, installing a gold calf in each (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.26-33">1 Kgs 12:26-33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.11.13-15">2 Chr 11:13-15</a>). Israel’s prophets knew that such calves were not the one true God (<a href="?bref=Hos.8.5-6">Hos 8:5-6</a>). Hosea called the calf at Bethel (“house of God”) the calf of “Beth-aven” (“house of wickedness,” <a href="?bref=Hos.10.5-6">Hos 10:5-6</a>). Within two centuries after Jeroboam’s time, people had stooped to kissing calves (<a href="?bref=Hos.13.2">13:2</a>), and Jeroboam’s sinful act was listed as one of the main factors leading to the destruction of Samaria, Israel’s capital city, and the northern kingdom’s exile in 722 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.16">2 Kgs 17:16</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Galilean town that was the scene of Jesus’ first miracle: changing water into wine at a wedding feast (<a href="?bref=John.2.1,11">Jn 2:1, 11</a>). Jesus was again in Cana when he told a nobleman that his son, who was seriously ill at Capernaum, would live (<a href="?bref=John.4.46">Jn 4:46</a>). Cana was also the home of Jesus’ disciple Nathanael (<a href="?bref=John.21.2">Jn 21:2</a>).</p>
<p>During the first Jewish rebellion, which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, Cana was made headquarters for defending Galilee against the Romans. After the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, the town became the seat of the priestly family of Eliashib. John’s Gospel refers to it as “Cana of Galilee,” evidently to distinguish it from the Kanah located near the Phoenician city of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.28">Jos 19:28</a>). The traditional site of Cana, revered as such since Byzantine and medieval times, is Kefar Kana, about four miles (6.4 kilometers) east of Nazareth on the main road from Nazareth to Tiberias. Contemporary scholarship, however, has almost unanimously settled on Khirbet Kana as the site of NT Cana. That ruin is about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) north of Nazareth on the northern edge of the Battuf Plain. The Arabs of the region call it Cana of Galilee to this day. Archaeologists exploring at the site have found pottery from the Hebrew monarchy period (c. 900–600 <span class="era">BC</span>) as well as from Hellenistic, Roman, Arabic, and Crusader times.</p>

<p class="h2" id="LandandPeople">Land and People</p>
<p class="fl">In the “table of nations” (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.15-19">Gn 10:15-19</a>), Noah’s grandson Canaan was progenitor of 11 groups that lived in the area of Syria and Palestine. The first six evidently occupied territory at or south of Sidon, whereas the others lived farther north. The northerners mostly settled on the edge of the coastal plain; in the south, settlement spread eastward to the upland areas. OT references specifically placed the Canaanites in western Palestine’s valleys and coastal areas; the upland country was occupied by Amorites and other peoples (<a href="?bref=Num.13.29">Nm 13:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.1">Jos 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.9">7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.1.27-36">Jgs 1:27-36</a>).</p>
<p>One of the earliest known references to the people of Canaan is in a tablet from Mari (15th century <span class="era">BC</span>), in which a military officer reported his surveillance of “thieves and Canaanites.” The Canaanites were listed as a group on the Memphis Stele (inscribed column) of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenophis II (c. 1440 <span class="era">BC</span>). The land of Canaan was mentioned in a 15th-century inscription of Idrimi, king of Aleppo (west of Ugarit), who fled to the Canaanite seaport of Ammiya and then became ruler of Alalakh (north of Ugarit). During the Amarna Age (15th–14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>), Palestine was politically dominated by Egypt, according to the Egyptian Amarna tablets.</p>
<p>Just as “Canaan” designated the whole western Palestinian area, so “Canaanite” described its pre-Israelite inhabitants without specifying race. Among the peoples who lived in Palestine, the Amorites first appeared in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span> as immigrants from Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Several OT references seem to equate Amorite territory and the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.5-6">Gn 12:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.15.18-21">15:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.48.22">48:22</a>), a tradition reflected in the 18th-century <span class="era">BC</span> Alalakh tablets, which depicted “Amurru” as part of Syria-Palestine. Tablets from Mari from about the same period speak of an Amorite ruler of Hazor in northern Palestine. The Tell el-Amarna texts (14th–13th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>) indicate that the Amurru kingdom of the Lebanon region was monopolizing coastal trade and commerce; therefore, references to the two peoples (Amorites and Canaanites) together in Moses’ time and throughout the late Bronze Age (c. 1550–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>) are not surprising.</p>
<p>At the end of that period, the “Sea Peoples” (largely Philistines) destroyed the Hittite Empire, and in the time of Ramses III (c. 1180 <span class="era">BC</span>) occupied western Palestine. The Israelite conquest of Palestine broke the power of many Canaanite and Amorite city-states, while the rise of a Philistine confederacy on the southern Palestinian coast restricted further the range of specifically Canaanite territory. From the beginning of the Iron Age the cultural heirs of the Canaanites were the Phoenicians, centered in the city-states of Tyre and Sidon, who themselves liked to be known as Canaanites (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.15.21-22">Mt 15:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.7.24-26">Mk 7:24-26</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Language">Language</p>
<p class="fl">The various groups that inhabited western Palestine in the pre-Israelite period probably spoke related dialects of the Northwest Semitic linguistic family. The large territory covered by those peoples and the possible influence of Amorite, Hurrian, and Ugaritic languages complicate modern theories about what is properly meant by “Canaanite” as a language.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Literature">Literature</p>
<p class="fl">As with language, it is difficult to be specific about Canaanite literature. One clear fact is that our own alphabet originated in middle Bronze Age Canaan. Before that time, writing was either pictographic (words or ideas represented by pictures), cuneiform (wedge-shaped impressions in soft clay representing syllables and whole words), or hieroglyphic (Egyptian pictorial writing). Alphabetical writing was passed on through the Hebrews and Phoenicians to the Greeks, who gave our present alphabet its classical form.</p>
<p>Until 1929 little Canaanite literature was known, but with the discoveries at Ugarit a large body of literary material came to light. The discoveries included portions of an epic poem about the god Baal and his consort Anath (possibly from c. 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>), a legend about a royal personage named Aqhat (from c. 1800 <span class="era">BC</span>), the legendary activities of King Keret (written c. 1500 <span class="era">BC</span>), and fragmentary religious, medical, and administrative material.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">Archaeological evidence shows that western Palestine was occupied as far back as the Old Stone Age. Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic deposits have also been found at several sites. It is possible that Semitic-speaking peoples inhabited places such as Jericho, Megiddo, and Byblos around 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Discoveries at Tell Mardikh (Ebla) show that a vigorous Canaanite Empire existed in Syria about 2500 <span class="era">BC</span>, and there is no doubt that both Amorite and Canaanite peoples were firmly settled in Syria and Palestine by 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>. The best evidence for Canaanite occupation of western Palestine has come from the middle and late Bronze Age (c. 1950–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>), when the land was dotted with Canaanite and Amorite city-states.</p>
<p>The Egyptians made periodic forays into Palestine during their 5th and 6th dynasties; in the 13th dynasty (second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>) they controlled much of Syria-Palestine both politically and economically.</p>
<p>Canaanite contacts with Mesopotamia from about 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> are indicated in texts discovered at Mari and Ugarit. Evidently Amorites, Hurrians, early Assyrians, and other peoples periodically migrated to Canaan, bringing with them a diversity of political and social forms. By the late 16th century <span class="era">BC</span>, most of the small Canaanite kingdoms were firmly under Egyptian control. Within two centuries the most northerly ones were subject to Hittite political influence.</p>
<p>Canaanite history is further complicated by the activities of the Hyksos people between about 1800 and 1500 <span class="era">BC</span>. Of mixed Asiatic origin, the Hyksos owed much of their political influence to their military use of iron-fitted chariots and the compound Asiatic bow. From Canaanite locations like Hazor and Jericho, they invaded Egypt and established control there from about 1776 to about 1570 <span class="era">BC</span>. When they were expelled at the start of Egypt’s New Kingdom (1570–1100 <span class="era">BC</span>), they retreated to fortified sites in southern Canaan.</p>
<p>Egyptian control over western Palestine had disappeared by the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan; Joshua met predominantly Canaanite and Amorite opposition. The Israelite occupation of Canaan was aided by the state of decay into which the small Palestinian kingdoms had fallen. With the destruction of Hittite culture by the Sea Peoples and their occupation of the northern and coastal regions, the traditional city-states collapsed. From about 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, Canaanite culture was restricted to Tyre, Sidon, and a few other places.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Religion">Religion</p>
<p class="fl">Before the Ugaritic discoveries, little was known about Canaanite religion apart from OT references to it. From what is now known of Canaanite culture, the head of the Canaanite list of gods was a shadowy personage named El, who was worshiped as the “father of man.” His consorts were Athirat, known to the Israelites as Asherah, Astarte, and Baaltis. El had a son, Baal, a fertility god described in myths as the lord of rain and storm. Baal succeeded his father as head of the pantheon (list of gods) and supposedly resided in the distant northern heavens. A monument found at Ugarit represented him carrying a thunderbolt at his left side and a mace in his right hand.</p>
<p>Many small terra-cotta figurines with exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics, representing one or the other of the female deities, have been recovered from middle and late Bronze Age sites in western Palestine. A center devoted to the Anath cult, excavated at Byblos in Phoenicia, was evidently notorious for religious prostitution and sexual fertility rites; many naked female figures were found there. Other Canaanite cult objects included a sacred pillar of some sort <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">massebah</span><span class="ital">)</span> and a wooden image <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">asherah</span><span class="ital">),</span> probably of the goddess herself.</p>
<p>In the Amarna Age, Canaanite orgiastic religion was especially influential in the Near East; it infiltrated to some extent even the conservative religions of Egypt and Babylonia. Four principal festivals associated with agriculture seem to have been celebrated by the Canaanites, invariably occasions of revelry, drunkenness, and sexual excess. Canaanite religion was evidently the most sexually depraved of any in the ancient world.</p>
<p class="h2" id="InfluenceonIsrael">Influence on Israel</p>
<p class="fl">Israelite morality, as defined by the covenant laws of Mt Sinai, was very different from the cultic traditions of Canaanite life. Hebrew ethical monotheism was in many ways opposite to the depraved polytheistic nature worship of Canaanite religion. It was clear that the two systems could not coexist. Hence the law contained strict instructions that the Canaanites and their ways were to be eliminated from the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.24">Ex 23:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.13-16">34:13-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-5">Dt 7:1-5</a>) and that the Hebrews were to remain separate from Canaanite religion in loyalty to God’s covenant. That was far from easy, if only because both peoples spoke closely related dialects and therefore used similar expressions of speech. Further, the invading Israelites under Joshua found that the Canaanites were superior to them in building stone structures and in making metal tools, implements, and weapons. The Hebrews, at a disadvantage, must have faced the prospect of requiring technical help from the Canaanites. In the time of King Solomon, Canaanites from Phoenicia were enlisted to design and construct the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem. A superficial resemblance between some aspects of Canaanite and Hebrew religion, such as peace offerings and certain divine titles, also made it difficult to maintain Israel’s cultural distinctiveness.</p>
<p>Except for the “ban” imposed at Jericho, the Israelites were able to use Canaanite equipment captured in battle. Hence their determination to destroy all traces of the Canaanites, including their corrupt religion, was gradually weakened. By the time of King Ahab, when the worship of the Tyrian Baal was firmly entrenched in the northern kingdom of Israel, the Hebrews were in serious danger of losing their spiritual and theological distinctiveness. Their priests, who should have played a major part in maintaining the uniqueness of the covenant faith, often lapsed into Canaanite ways, emulating the immorality of their pagan neighbors and encouraging the Israelite people to do likewise (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.22">1 Sm 2:22</a>).</p>
<p>As a result, Hebrew prophets proclaimed that their nation, which had almost completely succumbed to Canaanite blandishments, would have to be purified by exile before a renewed faith could become a possibility for Israel.</p>

  <title>Canaanite Deities and Religion</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CANAANITE DEITIES AND RELIGION</p>
<p class="fl">Study of the polytheistic religion of the Canaanites has contributed much to our understanding of the religion of ancient Israel. The Hebrew theological and religious structures were given by God to a people who were influenced and affected by other religions. To appreciate the Israelites’ monotheistic faith fully, one must understand the polytheistic setting that challenged their life and unity as a nation.</p>
<p>Contact among the many religions of the ancient Near East produced not only tension but also much syncretism or borrowing of concepts and practices. The Arameans and Philistines who settled in Canaan adopted the practices of the Canaanites; similarly the Amorites accepted much of the Sumerian religion as their own when they moved into Mesopotamia. Among all those peoples, however, the Hebrews took an independent course. Their God was the unique and cosmic deity who demanded exclusive allegiance. Such a concept ran against the grain of all the religions of the day.</p>
<p>Until the early part of the 20th century, most of what was known about Canaanite religion came from the Bible. In 1928 many clay tablets were found at a site called Ras Shamra, which was the ancient Syrian city of Ugarit. They contained abundant new information about the religious life of Canaan. Most of them were in a cuneiform alphabet and written in a previously unknown Northwest Semitic language quite similar to Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. The documents are often called the Ugaritic texts or the Ras Shamra tablets.</p>
<p>Discovery of these texts opened doors of understanding that had long been closed. The texts provided scholars with an important mythological literature that gave not only the names and functions of the gods but also much information on Canaanite society.</p>
<p>Canaanite deities had two striking features: an extraordinary fluidity of personality and function, and names whose meanings and sources could be easily traced. These facts, coupled with the nature of the mythology, mark Canaanite religion as relatively primitive.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="DagonTheFishGod"/>
<p>The general Canaanite word for “god” probably meant “the strong, powerful one.” The head of the pantheon, or array of gods, was called El (“the mighty one”). El, a remote and shadowy figure, lived far away from Canaan “at the source of the two rivers,” hence in paradise. He apparently had three wives who were also his sisters: Astarte, Athirat (Asherah, also called Elat), and Anath. He presided over a divine council of gods who were his children. Although he was brutal enough to slay his own son, he was called Lutpan (“the kindly one”) and was described as an old man with white hair and a beard.</p>
<p>Baal, the great storm god, king of the gods, was the central figure in the pantheon and was functionally far more important than El. Baal acted as El’s prime minister and eventually dethroned him. “Baal” means simply “lord” and could be applied to different gods. Soon, however, the ancient Semitic storm god Hadad became the “Baal” par excellence. Hadad was considered to be the “lord of heaven,” the “one who prevails,” the “exalted, lord of the earth.” He alone reigned over all else. His kingdom was “eternal to all generations.” He was the giver of all fertility. When he died, all vegetation and procreation ceased. He was the god of justice, the terror of evildoers. Baal was called the “son of Dagon.” Dagon, meaning “fish,” was the chief god of Ashdod (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.5.1-7">1 Sm 5:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>The Canaanites explained nature by reference to their gods. Each god represented some force of nature. The moon, sun, important stars, and visible planets were each considered a god or goddess. Baal, seen as god of the thunderstorm, personified the power of all nature.</p>
<p>The Canaanites’ personification of the forces of nature accounted for the succession of the seasons. The dry period from April to the end of October represented the duration of Baal’s death after his unsuccessful battle each spring with Mot (or with “the devourers,” who at Ras Shamra performed the same general function as Mot). Revival of the rain-and-vegetation deity Baal toward the end of October signaled commencement of the autumn rains, which continued intermittently until the following April. The Canaanites believed that the land regained its fertility because of the annual mating of Baal and Anath. What better form could their own religious activities take than that of imitating the sexual behavior of their chief deities? Hence there was always a pronounced orgiastic element in Canaanite religion.</p>
<p>The three goddesses—Athtarat (Astarte or Ashtaroth in the OT, <a href="?bref=Deut.1.4">Dt 1:4</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Astaroth”; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.13">Jgs 2:13</a>), Anath (appearing in the OT in the name of the town Anathoth and as Shamgar’s progenitor), and Athirat (Asherah in the OT)—presented an intricate set of relationships. Astarte was the same as Ashtar or Venus, the evening star. Anath’s original character is uncertain. Athirat was primarily goddess of the sea and the wife of El. She was also called Elat, the feminine form of El. All three goddesses were concerned mainly with sex and war. Their primary function was to have sexual relations with Baal on a continual yearly cycle, yet they never lost their “virginity”; they were “the great goddesses who conceive but do not bear.”</p>
<p>Ironically, the goddesses were considered sacred prostitutes and as such were called the “holy ones.” Idols representing the goddesses were often nude and sometimes had exaggerated sexual features. In what circumstances early cultic prostitution was practiced is a matter of some debate, but there is no doubt that both male and female temple prostitutes were used in the cult of Canaanite religion.</p>
<p>The fertility deities were also goddesses of war. In the Baal Epic of Ugarit, Anath has a gory thirst for blood. In New Kingdom Egyptian sources, Astarte appears as a nude and ferocious cavalry warrior, sporting shield and lance.</p>
<p>In the <span class="sc">kjv</span> the name Asherah was translated “grove,” following the Septuagint (third-century <span class="era">BC</span> Greek translation of the OT). She seems to have been represented by some kind of wooden cult object set up in “high places” beside incense altars and stone pillars.</p>
<p>Continual struggle for survival no doubt led the Canaanites to worship things that they felt would benefit them materially. If the gods and goddesses were pleased by the worship, the result would be a plentiful harvest. Canaanite worship centered on a cultic shrine or “high place” where sacrifices were offered. Archaeological evidence indicates that animals of all sizes were offered at great temple-shrines such as Beth-shan. The city received its name from the temple located there: <span class="hebrew">beth</span> means “temple,” and Shan was patron deity of the city.</p>
<p>As noted, human sacrifice became a part of religious practice in Canaan. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.27">Second Kings 3:27</a> mentions Mesha, king of Moab, who, after defeat at the hands of a confederation of kings, offered up his son as a burnt offering to his god Chemosh.</p>

  <title>Capernaum</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAPERNAUM</p>
<p class="fl">City of Galilee, mentioned only in the Gospels, which was the headquarters of much of Jesus’ ministry. It lay on the northwest side of the Sea of Galilee (or Lake of Gennesaret). Its name means “village of Nahum,” but it is impossible to say who this Nahum was, whether the OT writer or someone else. Matthew gives us the following information: Capernaum was located near the Sea of Galilee, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.13">Mt 4:13</a>). The west shore of the lake was settled by the tribe of Naphtali. Two of the characters described as being in Capernaum help to identify its location as being near the border of the Jordan and the political frontier. The story of the centurion (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.5">Mt 8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.2">Lk 7:2</a>) points to the small garrison of about 100 men found at such a frontier town. The story of Levi’s call to leave the customs post controlling the taxation of the area reflects on the same border character of the town (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.9">Mt 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mk 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27">Lk 5:27</a>).</p>
<p>Jewish evidence argued for Tell Hum as the site for ancient Capernaum. The Greek <span class="greek">Capharnaum</span> is rendered by the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">Kaphar nahum</span> in Midrash Kohelet 1.8 and 7.26 (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 110), proving that Capernaum still existed in the second century. There is no further mention until 1160, when Benjamin of Tudela refers to “Capharnaum which is Kaphar Nahum.” The Franciscans, who acquired the site, have found a considerable number of coins of that period at Tell Hum, and the ruins of the synagogue there may well date from the third century <span class="era">AD</span>. Recent excavations of Tell Hum have revealed that it is unquestionably the site for ancient Capernaum. During the excavations, a private house was uncovered beneath a fourth-century Jewish-Christian place of meeting. As early as the first half of the second century, it had served as an assembly hall for the early Christians. Inscriptions and the reports from early Christian travelers make it likely that it was the home of Peter.</p>
<p>Capernaum was an important settlement, with a Roman garrison, adopted by Jesus as his own city after his rejection by Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.1">Mt 9:1</a>). Here he was at home (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.1">Mk 2:1</a>) and performed many miracles (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.34">Mk 1:34</a>): the healing of the centurion’s servant (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.5">Mt 8:5</a>); the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.31">Mk 1:31</a>); and the exorcism of the unclean spirit (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.23">Mk 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.33">Lk 4:33</a>). Thus highly favored by the ministry of Jesus, there was also a heavy curse imposed on the city because of its unrepentance: “And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades” (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.23">Mt 11:23</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p class="fl">Place-name and the name of the people associated with the place. The Caphtorim among the Hamitic peoples in the “table of nations” are listed as the “sons” of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.13-14">Gn 10:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.12">1 Chr 1:12</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Caphthorim”). The text makes the Casluhim the parent people of the Philistines. However, prophets referred to the Philistines as colonists from Caphtor (<a href="?bref=Jer.47.4">Jer 47:4</a>; see <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Am 9:7</a>). This has been the basis for some translators to transpose the clause of <a href="?bref=Gen.10.14">Genesis 10:14</a> and to translate “Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines were descended” (<span class="sc">neb</span>). Others understand that although the Philistines may originally have been a Casluhian colony, they settled in regions that became known primarily as those of the Caphtorites.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfAncientSynagogueInCapernaum"/>
<p>Caphtor is referred to as <span class="ital">Kaptara</span> in Accadian, <span class="ital">kptr</span> in Ugaritic, and <span class="ital">Keftiu</span> in Egyptian. These references are to be dated from as early as 2200 <span class="era">BC</span> down to about 1200 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Egyptian sources are especially helpful in identifying Caphtor as Crete. On the other hand, there is a Jewish tradition that the Caphtorim were from Cappadocia; the Septuagint reads “Cappadocia” instead of “Caphtor.” This has led some to suggest that Caphtor is to be identified with a coastal region of Asia Minor or with the island of Carpathos. Perhaps by the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>, “Caphtor” was used in a broad sense for the Aegean area from which the Philistines came.</p>
<p>The Caphtorim are mentioned also as a people who invaded the region around Gaza, dispossessed the Avvim, and settled there (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.23">Dt 2:23</a>). It appears that the Caphtorim were firmly settled around Gaza before Israel crossed the Jordan at the time of the Conquest. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=CasluhimCasluhites_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Casluhim, Casluhites</a>.</p>

  <title>Cappadocia</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CAPPADOCIA</p>
<p class="fl">Plateau region of eastern Asia Minor intersected by mountain ranges. The name Cappadocia does not occur in the Hebrew OT. Passages that mention Caphtor or Caphtorim (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.23">Dt 2:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.9.7">Am 9:7</a>), however, were rendered “Cappadocia” in the Septuagint (ancient Greek translation of the OT). A few scholars suggest that Cappadocia was the original home of the Philistines.</p>
<p>In the NT, Cappadocia was the homeland of some of the visitors to Jerusalem who were amazed at hearing their own languages spoken on the day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.5-13">Acts 2:5-13</a>). Cappadocia was later one of the places in Asia Minor where Christians settled, people to whom the apostle Peter addressed his first letter (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.1">1 Pt 1:1</a>).</p>
<p>Cappadocia was bordered by Pontus on the north, Syria and Armenia on the east, Cilicia on the south, and Lycaonia on the west. Noted for its wheat, cattle, and horses, it also exported alabaster, mica, silver, and lead. The region was traversed by important trade routes, such as the route through the Cilician Gates northward to Pontus. The area was controlled or dominated in turn by Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Seleucids, and Romans.</p>
<p>Reference to a letter to Ariarathes, Cappadocia’s king (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.15.22">1 Macc 15:22</a>), may indicate that a significant Jewish settlement was there at the beginning of the second century <span class="era">BC</span>. Jews from that community were apparently visiting in Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost. Christianity seems to have spread northward into Cappadocia along the road from Tarsus. Cappadocia became a region of strong Christian church leaders by the fourth century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>

<p class="fl">Traveling group of merchants, pilgrims, or others in Bible times who joined together for mutual protection. Usually travelers used pack animals to carry their wares or personal belongings. To transport goods from one district to another, donkeys were mainly used until about 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, when the use of camels became more common. Ancient Palestine, situated between the Mediterranean Sea and Egypt on one side and Syria, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and lands farther east on the other, was crisscrossed by trade routes. The nation of Israel was thus intimately acquainted with caravans, many in OT times coming from Transjordan and Arabia. Arabian caravans often transported spices and incense, products that were particularly lucrative. The rulers of Sheba were engaged in that enterprise (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2">1 Kgs 10:2</a>). The size of a caravan depended on the amount of traffic, precariousness of the route, and availability of camels. Perhaps 40 camels might be joined by ropes attached from the saddle of one camel to the nose ring of the trailing camel. Caravans could travel in single file or with three to four camels abreast. In hot weather or on an extensive journey, a camel could carry about 350 pounds (159 kilograms); on short, cool trips, it could carry much more. Joseph was sold into slavery to a spice caravan going to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-28">Gn 37:25-28</a>). Raiding expeditions also formed caravans at times (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.3-5">Jgs 6:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.30.1-20">1 Sm 30:1-20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CARCHEMISH</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient city commanding an important ford on the west bank of the upper Euphrates River, about 65 miles (104.6 kilometers) northeast of Aleppo. Today part of the ruin is located in Turkey and part in Syria. The word is also written “Charchemish” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.20">2 Chr 35:20</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The meaning of the name is uncertain, although recent discoveries at Ebla suggest “city of Chemosh” (Moabite god).</p>
<p>A north-south trade route (roughly following the river) and an east-west route (connecting Nineveh with the Mediterranean Sea) both passed through Carchemish. Pottery finds indicate that the site was occupied in prehistoric times. The earliest reference to it is in the Ebla tablets (c. 2400 <span class="era">BC</span>). Since Carchemish is about 75 miles (120.7 kilometers) west of Haran, Abraham probably passed through Carchemish on his way to Canaan.</p>
<p>Early in its history Carchemish was allied first to Mari and then to Aleppo. In 1355 <span class="era">BC</span> it fell to the Hittites, became a regional capital of eastern Hatti, and adopted Hittite culture and language. After several centuries of unsuccessful attempts to incorporate Carchemish into their empire, the Assyrians under Sargon II finally conquered the city in 717 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.9">Is 10:9</a>) and made it their northwestern stronghold. When Nebuchadnezzar’s Neo-Babylonian kingdom succeeded the Assyrian Empire, Carchemish was the last city to fall (605 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Assyrians were aided in their defense by Pharaoh Neco II of Egypt (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.20">2 Chr 35:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.46.2">Jer 46:2</a>). Thereafter, the city decreased in importance.</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations show that the city had features of both Hittite and Assyrian architecture. It had a casemate wall atop sloping embankments to hinder attackers. Within the city on the highest point stood a citadel surrounded by its own wall, as well as a palace with its own temple and monumental staircase.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">CARMEL</p>
<p class="list">1. Mountainous ridge extending about 20 miles (32.2 kilometers) along the Mediterranean Sea and jutting southeastward into the Jezreel Valley. Its greatest width at the southeast is 13 miles (20.9 kilometers); its highest point, 1,742 feet (530.7 meters). Geologically, the ridge is of the same Cenomanian limestone formation as the central range of Palestine. Mt Carmel forms a headland south of the Bay of Acre. The modern city of Haifa, which rises in tiers on Carmel’s northwestern corner, has splendid harbor facilities. Nestled in Mt Carmel’s slopes are also several Jewish settlements and two large Druze villages. (Druzes are members of a particular Muslim sect.) The plain of Sharon extends to the south.</p>
<p class="list-text">Mt Carmel was renowned for its beauty and fertility (<a href="?bref=Isa.33.9">Is 33:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.35.2">35:2</a>); in ancient times it was forested with oak trees, olive groves, and vineyards. “Carmel” is a contraction of a Hebrew word meaning “vineyard” or “garden of God.” Parts of Carmel were so covered with dense wild vegetation that, with its gorges and caves, the ridge provided refuge to robbers and outcasts (<a href="?bref=Amos.9.3">Am 9:3</a>). Carmel is still forested, and large parts of it have been made a nature reserve. The biblical poet of love described his beloved by saying, “Your head is as majestic as Mount Carmel” (<a href="?bref=Song.7.5">Sg 7:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>)—perhaps likening her hair to the thick, luxuriant foliage of Carmel.</p>
<p class="list-text">Mt Carmel was an obstacle to north-south military and trade routes. Conquerors and traders commonly skirted its base and moved through the Jezreel Valley to the east or the Zebulun Valley to the northeast. Important passes cut through the mountain, however, such as the narrow pass through the lower slopes at its southern end linking the plains of Sharon and Esdraelon. That route was taken by Pharaoh Thutmose III early in the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span> and also by British Lord Allenby when he conquered Palestine in 1918. The tribal territories of Asher, Zebulun, Issachar, and Manasseh met at Mt Carmel, but evidently possession of the heights was never fully settled.</p>
<p class="list-text">Mt Carmel seems to have had special religious significance. It was the scene of a contest between Elijah and the prophets of Baal (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1-46">1 Kgs 18</a>); the site was fitting because Carmel was disputed territory between Israel and the Phoenicians, and thus between the Phoenician god Baal and Israel’s God. Elijah was not the first to build a Hebrew altar on the mountain; the narrative describes him as repairing a ruined “altar of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” before offering his sacrifice (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.30">30</a>). The traditional location of that contest is Qeren ha-Carmel at 1,581 (481.7 meters), overlooking the Jezreel Valley. The brook Kishon (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.40">40</a>) flows through that valley and around to the north of Carmel before emptying into the Bay of Acre.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.55">Jos 15:55</a>) identified with el-Kirmil (Kermel), seven miles (11.3 kilometers) south of Hebron. King Saul set up a memorial to his conquest of the Amalekites there (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.12">1 Sm 15:12</a>). Carmel was also the home of Nabal, a churlish man who refused kindness to David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.2-14">25:2-14</a>). After Nabal’s death, his beautiful wife, Abigail, married David. Carmel is mentioned as the home of Hezro, one of David’s 30 heroes (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.35">2 Sm 23:35</a>).</p>

The term “catholic” has been given various interpretations: (1) These letters express the views of all the apostles. (2) They are canonical or genuine. (3) Thus they were distinguished from contemporaneous heretical works. (4) They are encyclical, that is, addressed to general audiences of believers rather than to specific congregations, as were some of the apostle Paul’s letters. Of course, 2 John and 3 John are exceptions to this, for 2 John is addressed to a lady or a local church and 3 John is addressed to an individual.</p>

<p class="fl">Seaport city that served the maritime needs of the larger city of Corinth, about eight miles (12.9 kilometers) to the west. Cenchrea is known as early as the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> in connection with an Athenian attack on Corinth. Before the Corinthian Canal was cut through the isthmus, traffic to Europe from Asia often passed from Cenchrea through Corinth to Lechaion.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="HarborViewOfCenchrea"/>
<p>Excavations begun in 1963 have located the harbor mole (breakwater), warehouse remains dating to the early first century, and a large second-century stone building.

Portions of the ancient road leading southeast from the Cenchrean Gate in Corinth may still be seen among the ruins of that city’s <span class="greek">agora</span> (marketplace).</p>
<p>Cenchrea is mentioned twice in the NT.

  <title>Census</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CENSUS</p>
<p class="fl">Registration and enumeration of a people, usually for purposes of war or taxation. A few censuses are mentioned in the Bible.</p>
<p>The first census was held at Mt Sinai two years after the exodus. In order to assess Israel’s military potential, all Israelite males over 20 years old were counted—603,550 in all (<a href="?bref=Num.1.1-3,46">Nm 1:1-3, 46</a>). A special census was taken of the Levites, who were expected to serve in the tabernacle in place of military obligations. Every male Levite at least a month old was counted—22,000 in all, although of that number only 8,580 actually qualified for priestly service (<a href="?bref=Num.3.15,39">3:15, 39</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.46-48">4:46-48</a>).</p>
<p>A second census, conducted at the close of Israel’s 40 years of wandering in the wilderness, is recorded in <a href="?bref=Num.26.1-65">Numbers 26</a>. It, too, was primarily a military census, part of the strategic calculations made at Shittim in Moab just before the Israelite invasion of the Promised Land. The number of men able to bear arms was 601,730 (<a href="?bref=Num.26.51">Nm 26:51</a>), again excluding the Levites. The 23,000 Levites were counted separately because they were not going to receive an allotment of land (<a href="?bref=Num.26.62">26:62</a>). The rules for registration of the Israelites (given in <a href="?bref=Exod.30.11-16">Ex 30:11-16</a>) included payment of one-half shekel each, about one-fifth ounce (6 grams) of silver.</p>
<p>A third census occurred near the end of King David’s reign (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.1-17">2 Sm 24:1-17</a>). The two censuses under Moses had been conducted at God’s command; David’s census came at a time when God was angry at Israel. The record says that the Lord “incited David against them,” without specifying David’s own motivations for the census (cf. the later interpretation of <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.1">1 Chr 21:1</a>). It may have been for the purpose of conscription or taxation or simply to measure the extent of the king’s power by the number of his subjects. At any rate, Joab, David’s chief military commander, sensed that something was wrong about taking a census at that time and attempted to dissuade David. After the registration was conducted—there is some ambiguity as to whether it was ever completed (cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.21.6">1 Chr 21:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.23-24">27:23-24</a>)—David realized his mistake and repented. Nevertheless, the census angered God, and as a punishment he gave David the choice of three years of famine, three months of flight before an enemy, or three days of pestilence. David chose the pestilence, in which 70,000 men died. The census identified 800,000 able-bodied men in Israel and 500,000 in Judah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.24.9">2 Sm 24:9</a>). An alternate account reported a potential militia of 1,100,000 in Israel and 470,000 in Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.21.5">1 Chr 21:5</a>), plus a separate count of 38,000 Levites qualified to serve in the temple (<a href="?bref=1Chr.23.3">23:3</a>).</p>
<p>Scholars have puzzled over the fact that figures for the third census (despite their variation in the two different records) approximately double the figures for the first two. Many attempts have been made to explain those variations in the strength of the military and in the size of the total population they imply. So far, no explanation is fully satisfying.</p>
<p>A fourth census, recorded in <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.1-70">Ezra 2</a>, was taken on the return of the exiles to Jerusalem. The final total included 42,360 males of Israelite descent, 7,337 slaves (male and female), and 200 singers (male and female).</p>
<p>In the NT a census played a role in the circumstances of Jesus’ birth: “At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire. (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria.) All returned to their own towns to register for this census” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-3">Lk 2:1-3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Josephus, a first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Jewish historian, records that Quirinius completed a census under the emperor’s direction soon after his tenure as governor of Syria began in <span class="era">AD</span> 6. <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-23">Matthew 2</a>, however, places the birth of Jesus during the reign of Herod the Great, who died in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. There were probably two enrollments or censuses taken during this time. Luke’s reference to the “first enrollment” (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.2">Lk 2:2</a>) may have been made to distinguish it from the more famous enrollment of <span class="era">AD</span> 6–7. Luke was obviously aware of the later census, which he mentions in a passing reference in <a href="?bref=Acts.5.37">Acts 5:37</a>. A series of censuses known to have been made in Egypt about the same time lend credence to the theory of a similar series in Palestine. Thus, the most plausible solution suggests that an earlier census took place during the influential leadership of Quirinius before his full governorship.</p>
<p>Luke’s reference to the census under Quirinius serves two purposes in his Gospel. First, it provides a date for the birth of Jesus. Second, it explains why Joseph and Mary were in Bethlehem at that time. The census under Quirinius was probably for purposes of taxation, since the Romans exempted the Jews from military service. The requirement to return to one’s hometown, reflecting the patriarchal element in Hebrew religion, probably also reflects the general willingness of Caesar Augustus to let the Jews follow their own customs.</p>

<item typename="Article" product="TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary" name="Centurion">
  <title>Centurion*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CENTURION*</p>
<p class="fl">Commander of 100 men in the Roman army. There were generally six centurions in each cohort and ten cohorts in a legion. Each legion had six tribunes to whom its centurions were subordinate. In <a href="?bref=Acts.22.26">Acts 22:26</a>, for example, a centurion appealed to his tribune for a decision concerning the apostle Paul. A centurion’s authority was actually quite extensive because he was the working officer who had direct contact with the men. He went to the field with them and made spontaneous decisions according to each situation.</p>
<p>The office of centurion was normally the highest one within reach of the ordinary soldier. Centurions often rose from the ranks because of their experience and knowledge. After one became a centurion, further promotion could come by transfer to positions of increasing responsibility, the highest being senior centurion over the first of ten cohorts in a legion. Thus, a centurion might move about extensively throughout the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>A centurion had many duties besides maintaining discipline among the ranks. He had to oversee executions for capital offenses (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.54">Mt 27:54</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.39,44-45">Mk 15:39, 44-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.47">Lk 23:47</a>). He was responsible for his troops at all times, whether they were Roman citizens or recruited mercenary soldiers. The position of centurion was prestigious and high-paying; those who reached that rank usually made a career of it.</p>
<p>Six centurions are mentioned in the NT, at least two of whom seem to have become followers of Christ.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. A centurion at Capernaum pleaded for the life of his dying servant because he believed that diseases would obey Jesus just as his soldiers obeyed him (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.5-13">Mt 8:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.2-10">Lk 7:2-10</a>). In spite of his high-ranking position, he was a humble man, willing to admit his inadequacy and helplessness. He cared deeply for his servant’s welfare. Jesus marveled at that example of faith and healed the sick man.</p>
<p class="list">2. The centurion in charge of the squad that executed Jesus declared, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">Mk 15:39</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) and “Certainly this man was innocent!” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.47">Lk 23:47</a>). The apocryphal Acts of Pilate, probably dating from the fourth century, named the believing centurion as Longinus. He has been regarded as a saint in Roman Catholic tradition. A marble statue depicting his dramatic confession, sculpted by the 17th-century baroque artist Giovanni Bernini, is located in St Peter’s Basilica in Rome.</p>
<p class="list">3. A centurion in Caesarea named Cornelius was converted to Christ through the testimony of the apostle Peter, whose reluctance to share the gospel with Gentiles had been broken down by a vision from God (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">Acts 10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. A centurion in <a href="?bref=Acts.22.25-26">Acts 22:25-26</a> helped save the apostle Paul from a scourging when he reminded his tribune that the accused was a Roman citizen.</p>
<p class="list">5. Another centurion helped save Paul from a Jewish plot to murder him (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.17-22">Acts 23:17-22</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. A centurion named Julius was assigned to guard Paul on his journey from Caesarea to Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1">Acts 27:1</a>). When their ship broke up in a storm, Julius prevented the soldiers from killing all the prisoners on board, including Paul (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.42-43">42-43</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Gnostic heretic (died c. 100) whose heresy was condemned by the apostle John.

He apparently believed that the world was created not by God but by a lesser being (called the Demiurge) or by angels, one of whom gave the law to the Jews. Cerinthus also taught that Jesus was an ordinary man, upon whom “the Christ” descended at his baptism. This divine power revealed the transcendent and unknown God. This “Christ” abandoned Jesus before his crucifixion.</p>
<p>The church father Eusebius (c. 260–340) quotes a story from Irenaeus (who lived in the late second century), who heard it from Polycarp (a disciple of the apostle John). The story says that John heard that Cerinthus had come into an Ephesian bathhouse where he (John) was. John immediately rushed out of the bathhouse shouting, “The building will collapse because the enemy of truth is inside!” Some scholars believe that certain passages in John’s writings may have been directed against Cerinthus (see <a href="?bref=John.1.1-3,14">Jn 1:1-3, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1-3">1 Jn 4:1-3</a>).</p>

  <title>Chaldea*, Chaldeans</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CHALDEA*, CHALDEANS</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient region in Mesopotamia and its inhabitants. The name comes from the Chaldean (or Kaldu) tribes that shared Babylonia in southeastern Mesopotamia with several other peoples, especially the Sumerians and Akkadians. After the old Babylonian Empire was absorbed by the Assyrians, the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar’s leadership took control and built a Neo-Babylonian Empire that dominated the Near East for nearly a century. The region called Chaldea is also associated with the patriarch Abraham, whose Mesopotamian home was “Ur of the Chaldeans” (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.28">Gn 11:28</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheLandandPeople">The Land and People</p>
<p class="fl">Until the end of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Chaldea referred only to a small territory in southern Babylonia. Within 100 years, following a rapid and successful bid for power, it embraced all of Babylonia. At that time it included the territory from Baghdad on the Tigris River to the Persian Gulf and extended up the Euphrates River as far as the city of Hit. Although Chaldea is usually placed between the Tigris and Euphrates, it reached into the flatlands between the Tigris and the Zagros Mountains to the east and also included some land west of the Euphrates. The Arabian Desert formed its western boundary. Chaldea rarely exceeded 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) in width, having an area of about 8,000 square miles (12,872 square kilometers), approximately the size of New Jersey. On today’s map Chaldea falls inside Iraq, with its southwestern tip touching the small kingdom of Kuwait.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">First mention of the Chaldeans is found in the Assyrian annals of Ashurnasirpal II (885–860 <span class="era">BC</span>), leading some authorities to suggest that they entered Babylonia about 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>. They are usually associated (though not identified) with the Semitic Aramean tribes who were constantly pushing their way from the western deserts into Mesopotamia. They settled primarily in the southern tip of Babylonia, at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, perhaps centuries before the Assyrian annals mentioned them.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Job.1.17">Job 1:17</a> mentions three bands of Chaldeans who participated in a raid against Job’s camels and servants, probably in the vicinity of Edom or northern Arabia. Their presence in those regions does not necessarily mean they lived nearby, since armies from Babylonia (Sinar) and Elam ranged as far as Palestine centuries earlier (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-2">Gn 14:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Under Assyrian Rule</p>
<p class="fl">Living by the marshes and lakes of the extreme south, the Chaldeans maintained a high degree of independence, even when Assyrian dominion extended over them. It was difficult for invading armies to maneuver in the Chaldean marshes. As a result, the Chaldeans resisted paying taxes or providing any form of service to the Assyrian government. When the Assyrians sought to limit their freedom, the Chaldeans turned to guerrilla warfare and political intrigue. They were quick to disregard treaties or to switch alliances as circumstances dictated. Under Assyrian rule, whereas the native residents of Babylonian cities were generally content, the Chaldeans became the leaders of a national independence movement. For 250 years the Assyrians had to enforce their dominion against persistent Chaldean attempts to assert their autonomy and influence.</p>
<p>Finally, in 721 <span class="era">BC</span> the Chaldean leader Marduk-apla-iddina II (known as Merodach-baladan in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.12">2 Kgs 20:12</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1">Is 39:1</a>, who sent an embassy to Hezekiah, king of Judah) entered Babylon and claimed the kingship of Babylonia, a position long appointed by the Assyrian king. Crafty and resourceful, he successfully maintained his claim for 10 years before being driven back into his own southern territory by Assyria’s Sargon II. On Sargon’s death in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>, he reasserted his claim but was defeated by the new Assyrian king, Sennacherib, who destroyed Babylon as a lesson to the Chaldeans and their allies.</p>
<p>Sennacherib’s son and successor, Esarhaddon, pursued a policy of conciliation with the Babylonians and rebuilt their capital city, a gesture that effectively neutralized Chaldean agitation and inaugurated a period of peace that lasted over 30 years. The last unsuccessful revolt occurred under Ashurbanipal’s reign and was actually instigated by his brother, whom the Assyrian king had appointed to the Babylonian throne. The Chaldeans gladly joined the rebellion, which was crushed in 648 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h3">The Neo-Babylonian Empire</p>
<p class="fl">Two decades later, at the time of Ashurbanipal’s death, Assyrian power suddenly and dramatically slipped. Nabopolassar, a Chaldean governor, took the opportunity to drive the Assyrians out of Babylonia. He became king of Babylon in 625 <span class="era">BC</span>. Allied with the Medes, the Babylonians went on to destroy the Assyrian Empire, capturing the capital cities of Asshur in 614 and Nineveh in 612. They divided the conquered lands with the Medes and annexed the Assyrian regions west and south of the Tigris, creating a new Babylonian Empire. (The first Babylonian Empire, with which Hammurabi is associated, had flourished over 1,000 years earlier.) Throughout the Near East, Chaldea and Babylonia became synonymous.</p>
<p>During the long and brilliant reign of Nabopolassar’s son Nebuchadnezzar (or Nebuchadrezzar) II, the empire reached its zenith. As crown prince, he won a decisive victory in 605 <span class="era">BC</span> over the Egyptians at Carchemish (the battle mentioned in <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.20">2 Chr 35:20</a>), which effectively established Babylonian supremacy in the Near East (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.7">2 Kgs 24:7</a>). That same year the southern kingdom of Judah became a vassal nation to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar won the submission of King Jehoiachim, carried off the choicest articles from the temple for his own temple in Babylon, and took the outstanding leaders and youth of Judah captive (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1">2 Kgs 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.5-7">2 Chr 36:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.1.1-4">Dn 1:1-4</a>). When Judah revolted several years later at the instigation of Egypt, the Chaldean army captured Jerusalem in 597 <span class="era">BC</span>. Judah’s new king, Jehoiachin, was deposed at that time together with more of its leaders (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.8-16">2 Kgs 24:8-16</a>). A second revolt in 594 <span class="era">BC</span> by the Chaldean-appointed king (Zedekiah) resulted in a third invasion, the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, and the exile of most of Judah’s citizens (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.20-25.12">2 Kgs 24:20–25:12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.11-21">2 Chr 36:11-21</a>). With the booty from that and other conquests, Nebuchadnezzar built Babylon into one of the most dazzling cities in the ancient world. His projects included the Hanging Gardens (one of the seven wonders of the ancient world), the Ishtar Gate, and a 17-mile (27-kilometer) outer wall designed for defense of the city. His pride in such accomplishments eventually brought the judgment of God (<a href="?bref=Dan.4.30-33">Dn 4:30-33</a>).</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his son Amel-marduk (Evil-merodach in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27">2 Kgs 25:27</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.52.31">Jer 52:31</a>, remembered there for his special kindness to the exiled king Jehoiachin). After two years he was killed in an armed rebellion led by his brother-in-law, Nergal-shar-usur (Nergal-sharezer of <a href="?bref=Jer.39.3">Jer 39:3</a>), who attempted to establish his own dynasty. After a four-year reign Nergal-shar-usur was succeeded by his son, who lasted only a few months before being ousted by a usurper, Nabonidus.</p>

<p class="h3">The Fall of Babylon</p>
<p class="fl">Nabonidus was the last of the Chaldean monarchs. His installation as king was supported by many Babylonian officials. They were watching their former allies, the Medes, gradually become a rival power and saw in Nabonidus a ruler strong enough to meet their threat. Strong or not, his attempts to reform Babylonian religion proved extremely unpopular, and his efforts to strengthen the economy were unsuccessful. Both facts made Babylon an unpleasant residence for Nabonidus; during one extended absence from the capital city, he installed his son Belshazzar as co-regent. (Belshazzar’s position explains why he is described as the king of Babylon in the OT book of Daniel and why in <a href="?bref=Dan.5.7">Dn 5:7</a> he could make Daniel only “the third ruler in the kingdom.”)</p>
<p>While Belshazzar was handling government affairs, the famous incident of the “writing on the wall” occurred, ominously predicting Babylon’s downfall (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.1-31">Dn 5</a>). The Elamites, in fact, were already attacking the empire’s eastern flank. Rumors of Persian power in the north brought Nabonidus back to Babylon just in time for an invasion by the Persian king, Cyrus the Great. Cyrus took Babylon without a fight, putting an end both to Chaldean power and to the Neo-Babylonian Empire.</p>

Chaspho has been identified as el-Muzeirib in the Hauran plain and Tell el-Jamid on the Yarmuk River. But most today locate it at Khisfin, about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) east of the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<p class="h1">CHERUB*, CHERUBIM</p>
<p class="fl">Winged creatures mentioned occasionally in Scripture (“cherubim” is the plural form of the Hebrew “cherub”). They belong to a supernatural created order along with the seraphim and angels. Some scholars have argued that the term “cherub” had its origin in the <span class="ital">karibu</span> (“intercessor”) of Akkadian mythological texts, commonly represented in Mesopotamian art as a griffin (a creature half lion and half eagle) or as a winged human. The sphinx also appears to go back to this concept. The biblical evidence, however, does not seem to support that identification.</p>
<p>The prophet Ezekiel described four “living creatures,” each with four faces and four wings (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.5-24">Ez 1:5-24</a>); those creatures corresponded to cherubim (<a href="?bref=Ezek.10.2-22">10:2-22</a>). The splendor of Ezekiel’s vision was recaptured more modestly in his description of the king of Tyre, who in the midst of his own prosperity seemed to be playing the part of a towering or guardian cherub before being dispossessed (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.13-16">28:13-16</a>). That passage has been interpreted by some as a description of Satan’s “fall from grace” after he had once been in the service of God as a ranking member of a high celestial order.</p>
<p>Despite Ezekiel’s elaborate visionary descriptions, it is difficult to be certain about the form in which cherubim appeared. Thus, in <a href="?bref=Ezek.41.18">Ezekiel 41:18</a> the cherubim that were to decorate Ezekiel’s ideal temple had only two faces, a man’s and a young lion’s, in contrast to the four-faced creatures of the earlier visions. The four faces of <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.10">Ezekiel 1:10</a> were those of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, whereas in <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.14">Ezekiel 10:14</a> the cherub had its own face (“the face of the cherub”), along with the faces of a man, a lion, and an eagle. If the cherub’s face corresponded to that of an ox, that might account for the fact that cherubim in Near Eastern art were represented as four-footed creatures, though frequently different otherwise from biblical cherubim. In addition to their wings, the cherubim of Ezekiel’s vision had straight legs and feet with hooves like those of a calf (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.7">Ez 1:7</a>).</p>
<p>That complex description has led scholars to try to identify cherubim in the statues and carvings of non-Israelite peoples. The throne of Ahiram, king of Byblos, was flanked by sphinxes, which some have judged to be cherubim. The sphinx, however, seems to have been a popular decorative motif, as evidenced by an ivory box from Megiddo and ivories from Samaria, Nimrud, and elsewhere. Other decorative creatures have various combinations of human and animal bodies, with wings generally prominent. None of them adequately represents the OT descriptions of cherubim.</p>
<p>The four living creatures of the book of Revelation were similar to the cherubim of Ezekiel but lacked their whirling wheels (<a href="?bref=Rev.4.6-9">Rv 4:6-9</a>). Subsequent references to the creatures in Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.6-14">5:6-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.1-8">6:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.7.1-11">7:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.3">14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.15.7">15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.4">19:4</a>) add nothing to the initial description.</p>
<p>The cherubim of <a href="?bref=Gen.3.24">Genesis 3:24</a> acted as guardians or custodians. Supernatural guardians seem to have been common in Near Eastern thought. In <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1-22">Ezekiel 10</a> the cherubim were also executors of divine judgment, spreading burning coals over a city (<a href="?bref=Ezek.10.2,7">Ez 10:2, 7</a>).</p>
<p>In early Israelite thought the cherubim stretched out their wings and provided God with a throne (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.4">1 Sm 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.2">2 Sm 6:2</a>; etc.). God spoke to Moses from such a throne on the cover of the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.22">Ex 25:22</a>). In Ezekiel’s vision (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.26">Ez 1:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.1">10:1</a>) God was seated in a four-wheeled chariot moved by the cherubim and borne aloft by their wings. In Hebrew poetry God was portrayed as employing clouds for his chariot (<a href="?bref=Ps.104.3">Ps 104:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.19.1">Is 19:1</a>) or riding on a cherub in flight (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.11">2 Sm 22:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.10">Ps 18:10</a>). The idea of cherubim furnishing a seat or platform for the invisible deity found expression in Near Eastern art, where the pagan gods stood on the backs of animals.</p>
<p>In Israel cherubim were carved on the covenantal ark (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.18-20">Ex 25:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.37.7-9">37:7-9</a>), and representations of them were also embroidered on the curtains of the tabernacle and the veil that screened the innermost sanctuary in which the ark rested.</p>
<p>The Most Holy Place of Solomon’s temple was adorned by two large representations of cherubim, made of olive wood and covered with gold leaf. When placed side by side with outstretched wings, they spanned the entire width of the inner sanctuary. Smaller cherubim and palms were carved on the temple’s wooden panels and some of the doors, and were also represented on the sides of the laver stands (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.29,36">1 Kgs 7:29, 36</a>). Cherubim alternating with palm trees formed part of the decor of Ezekiel’s visionary temple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.41.17-20">Ez 41:17-20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CHRIST</p>
<p class="fl">Official title given to Jesus in the NT. It signifies his office as anointed Savior and alludes to his spiritual qualifications for the task of saving his people. The word derives from Greek <span class="greek">Christos</span><span class="ital">,</span> which translates Hebrew <span class="hebrew">Messiah</span> (<a href="?bref=John.1.41">Jn 1:41</a>). Both terms come from verbs meaning “to anoint with sacred oil”; hence, as titles they mean “the Anointed One.” Applied to Jesus, they express the conviction that he had divine appointment for his office and function.</p>
<p>In the NT the title is used in combination with the given name, as “Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mk 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.4">Rom 1:4</a>), “Christ Jesus” (<span class="sc">niv</span> <a href="?bref=Rom.1.1">Rom 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1">1 Cor 1:1</a>), with the article “the” (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.4">Rom 7:4</a>), or with another title “Lord” (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.18">Rom 16:18</a>). It is also used alone as the one favored substitute name or title for Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.20.31">Jn 20:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.3">Rom 15:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.6">Heb 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.11,19">1 Pt 1:11, 19</a>).</p>
<p>The Gospels portray Jesus as modestly accepting the title and role of the Messiah. His baptism should be understood as his anointing to the threefold office of prophet, priest, and king. At his baptism by John (the new Elijah, <a href="?bref=Matt.11.14">Mt 11:14</a>), Jesus received the outpouring of the Spirit and God’s mandate to begin his ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.16-4.17">Mt 3:16–4:17</a>). John himself denied being the anointed one but tacitly identified Jesus as the Christ (<a href="?bref=John.1.20">Jn 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.14-17">Lk 3:14-17</a>). Jesus’ first disciples followed him because they knew he was the Messiah (<a href="?bref=John.1.41">Jn 1:41</a>). The demons recognized him as “the Holy One [anointed] of God” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.24">Mk 1:24</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.8.29">Mt 8:29</a>). The crowds followed him as the Prophet, the new Moses (<a href="?bref=John.6.14,32">Jn 6:14, 32</a>), but deserted him when they understood that his kingdom was a spiritual, not a political realm (v <a href="?bref=John.6.66">66</a>). The Twelve remained loyal, saying, “We believe . . . you are the Holy One of God” (<a href="?bref=John.6.69">Jn 6:69</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The confession of the disciples voiced by Peter and approved by Jesus as a divine revelation is “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). At his trials the decisive factor in Jesus’ condemnation was his claim to be the Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.63-64,68">Mt 26:63-64, 68</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.11,17,22,37">27:11, 17, 22, 37</a>).</p>
<p>An important feature in the earliest Christian preaching was the proclamation that Jesus is the Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.36">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.18-20">3:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.9.22">9:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.28.23,31">28:23, 31</a>). This remains the earliest (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>) and most basic article of Christian confession (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.23">1 Cor 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.1">1 Jn 5:1</a>), affirming that Jesus perfectly fulfilled the role of anointed prophet, priest, and king as the servant of God for his people (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.16">Lk 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.25">1 Cor 15:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.22-28">Heb 7:22-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.16">Rv 19:16</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CHRISTIAN</p>
<p class="fl">Name first given to the followers of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">Acts 11:26</a>). When the Christian movement reached Antioch in Syria, the gospel was preached to Gentiles as well as Jews. Such evangelism marked the sect as more than a new type of Judaism; it was a new religion. The Gentiles in Antioch invented a name for the new group. Since members of the group constantly talked about Christ, they were called Christians, meaning the “household” or “partisans” of Christ. Some satire may have been intended in the name. For instance, since the “Augustinians” were an organized group who led the public praise of the emperor Nero Augustus, the citizens of Antioch may have made a comparable Latinized name out of Christ as a joke. Similar groups included Herod’s partisans, the Herodians. “Christ” was an unusual and meaningless name to Gentiles, but Chrestos (meaning “good” or “kind”) was a common name; some pagans called the new sect “Chrestians.” Thus, Suetonius wrote of the Jews being expelled from Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 49 on account of “Chrestus.”</p>
<p>The Christians themselves apparently did not appreciate the name, but like many other nicknames, “Christian” stuck. It appears only three times in the Greek NT: <a href="?bref=Acts.11.26">Acts 11:26</a> describes its origin; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.28">Acts 26:28</a> records Herod Agrippa II saying satirically to Paul, “In a short time you think to make me a Christian!”; <a href="?bref=1Pet.4.16">1 Peter 4:16</a> instructs believers not to be ashamed if they suffer because the name has been applied to them. No further record of the name appears until the second century, when Ignatius of Antioch became the first Christian to call believers Christians. The Roman governor Pliny (from the area to which 1 Peter was addressed) wrote to the emperor Trajan about people accused in his court of being Christians. From that time on, the nickname became popular among Christians. What better name could there be than one declaring that they belonged to Christ?</p>

<p class="h1">CHRISTOLOGY*</p>
<p class="fl">The study of the person and work of Jesus Christ. The confession that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, first ventured by Peter at Caesarea Philippi (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>), is the heart of the Christian faith. It is this confession that makes one a Christian, and all Christian theology is thinking, in the light of this confession, about the meaning of this confession. The first major theological decision of the church resulting from such believing thought was the affirmation of the essential deity of Jesus as the Son of God. As such he was declared to be of one essence with the Father and the Spirit (the dogma of the Trinity promulgated at Nicaea, <span class="era">AD</span> 325). Since this affirmation was made with reference to the man Jesus of Nazareth, it forced upon the church, inescapably, the further question: How could one and the same person be both God and man? How could he who is infinite become finite; he who is eternal become temporal; he who is God become man?</p>
<p>To answer this question, the church embraced the doctrine of the Incarnation. The statement of the doctrine was arrived at only after much controversy. In the course of the debate the church rejected all efforts, on the one hand, to preserve the deity of the Son at the expense of his humanity (docetism), and on the other, to preserve his humanity at the expense of his deity (adoptionism). In the former category were the doctrines of those who claimed that the Son only <span class="ital">seemed</span> to have a human body, or (like the Apollinarians) that while he had a true body and soul, the divine Logos took the place of the human spirit. In the latter category was the doctrine of those who claimed that the man Jesus, through the process of moral development, was elevated to divine sonship and so adopted into the Godhead. Some placed great stress on Jesus’ endowment with the Spirit at baptism as the moment of his adoption, while others, citing <a href="?bref=Acts.13.33">Acts 13:33</a>—“today I have begotten thee”—believed Jesus became the unique Son of God at the resurrection. The church also rejected all attempts to resolve the problem of the Savior’s divinity and humanity by suggesting that he was both a divine person and a human person (Nestorianism) or, contrariwise, that the unity of his person implied a fusion of the divine and human in one nature (monophysitism).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheChalcedonianCreed">The Chalcedonian Creed</p>
<p class="fl">At the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (<span class="era">AD</span> 451), the position was adopted that the Lord Jesus Christ was truly God and truly man <span class="ital">(vere Deo, vere homo).</span> The creed said:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">[He is] consubstantial with the Father as to his Godhead, and consubstantial also with us as to his manhood; like unto us in all things, yet without sin; as to his Godhead, begotten of the Father before all worlds; but as to his manhood, in these days, born for us men and for our salvation, of the virgin Mary, the mother of God, one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten, known in two natures, without confusion, without conversion, without severance, and without division; the distinction of the natures being in no wise abolished by their union, but the peculiarity of each nature being maintained, and both concurring in one person and subsistence. We confess not a Son divided and sundered into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only-begotten, and God-Logos, our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="fl">This confession was adopted in all its essential features by the Reformers at the time of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
<p>Chalcedonian Christology does not remove the mystery of the Incarnation but rather indicates, as it were, the boundaries of believing thought about the person of the Redeemer, boundaries that have proved significant in the history of Christian thought. As for the key terms in the creed, the following should be noted: the word “nature” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">physis</span><span class="ital">)</span> as used by the church fathers does not have reference to the physical, material order that is the object of investigation by the “natural” sciences. “Nature” rather refers to being or reality in distinction from appearance. To say that Jesus Christ has a divine nature is to affirm that all the qualities, properties, or attributes by which one describes the divine order of being pertain to him. In short, he is God himself, not <span class="ital">like</span> God, but just <span class="ital">God.</span> So also with the affirmation that Christ has a human nature. Christ is not God <span class="ital">appearing</span> as a man; he <span class="ital">is</span> a man. He is not <span class="ital">only</span> a man nor <span class="ital">only</span> God; he is the God who <span class="ital">became</span> a man. He did not cease to be God when he became a man; he did not exchange divinity for humanity. Rather, he assumed humanity, so that he is now both divine and human. He is the God-man.</p>
<p>The term “person” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">hypostasis</span><span class="ital">)</span> was used by the fathers to describe Jesus Christ as a self-conscious, self-determined Subject, one who designates himself by the word “I” over against a “thou.” The Mediator between God and man is <span class="ital">a person</span> who has a divine nature and a human nature. While there can be no “person” where there is no “nature,” it does not follow that there is no distinction between the terms, for there can be a “nature,” as defined above, where there is no “person.” (An object may have the properties of “nature” of a stone: grayness, hardness, roundness, smoothness. But this object, which has the “nature” of a stone, is not a “person”; it is not self-conscious and self-determined.)</p>
<p>The distinction between the “person” and the “nature” of the incarnate Christ speaks of him as being a “person” with a “divine nature” and a “human nature.” The fathers were teaching through this that while we must ascribe to Christ all the qualities that belong to the divine order of being and to the human order of being (including bodily, physical, objective being—the Word “became flesh,” <a href="?bref=John.1.14">Jn 1:14</a>), we cannot say that he is “two persons.” He is a divine person with a human nature, not a human person as such. All human persons have a first moment. Wheresoever and whensoever we may identify that first moment for a human “I,” whether at conception or at fetal quickening in the womb, whether at the moment of birth, or even as late as the first moment of self-awareness in the young child, no human “I” is aware of himself as a “subject,” as an “I,” before he is conceived in the womb of his mother. The man Jesus of Nazareth, however, unlike any mere man, could say, “Before Abraham was, I am” (<a href="?bref=John.8.58">Jn 8:58</a>). This affirmation is neither the late theological invention of Christian fancy nor the claim of a man suffering from delusions of grandeur, but rather the sober truth. This person sitting on a mountainside preaching, this person standing by the sea calling fishermen to be his disciples, is a person who always was a person, even before there were any fishermen by the sea to call or any people to preach to on the mountainside—in fact, before there was any sea or any mountain.</p>
<p>Christ is not the divine Logos, who inspires and uniquely endows the man, Jesus of Nazareth, with moral and religious insights. Rather, this man Jesus is the eternal Son of God, and God’s eternal Son has become this man, Jesus. The Son of God did not assume a man’s <span class="ital">person</span> to his own <span class="ital">nature,</span> but a man’s <span class="ital">nature</span> to his own <span class="ital">person.</span> He continues to be the same person, though he now assumes our humanity. Hence, he can speak both as a Subject consciously in history and as a Subject consciously transcending history, even in one and the same sentence. <span class="ital">“I</span> have glorified thee <span class="ital">on the earth: I</span> have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which <span class="ital">I</span> had with thee <span class="ital">before the world was”</span> (<a href="?bref=John.17.4-5">Jn 17:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>, emphasis added). Here the same person, Jesus, speaks as a person in the world, an “I” who has done certain things in the world, and as a person before there was any world, an “I” who shared his glory with a “thou” whom he calls “Father” before all time. All efforts at rational analysis of this mystery, which the church designates by the word “incarnation,” run the risk of losing the truth by explaining it. One arrives at a position in which Christ is a divine being who appears human (docetism) or a human being who either achieves divine status for himself (adoptionism) or divine worth for us (Ritschlianism).</p>
<p>In order to preserve fully both our Lord’s deity and his humanity, the creed employs four terms in which we are told what did <span class="ital">not</span> happen in the Incarnation. The union of the two natures is declared to be “without confusion,” “without conversion,” “without separation,” and “without division.” Some have ridiculed these “four bald negatives,” but they are by no means wholly without value. Should any of these basic negatives be violated, we would lose what is essential to Christian faith, the “one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, complete as to his Godhead, and complete as to his manhood.”</p>
<p>But the creed contains not only a negative affirmation—what did <span class="ital">not</span> happen in the Incarnation; it also contains a positive affirmation. The union of the two natures concurs in one Person, who is the eternal Son of the Father. The union, then, of the divine and the human in Christ is a personal one; more specifically, the union is the act of the divine Person who is the Son of God. Here we approach the very heart of the mystery of the Incarnation. No one can say how the infinite God could become a finite man. Naturally, however, theologians have thought a great deal about the matter; Chalcedon does not mark the end of all inquiry.</p>
<p>In theological parlance it has become customary to speak of the union of the divine and the human in the Person of the incarnate Redeemer as the “hypostatic” union <span class="ital">(unio hypostatica),</span> from the Greek word for “person.” It is important to note not only <span class="ital">that</span> the union is personal, but also <span class="ital">why</span> it is so. Theologians speak of the union as personal because it is the act of a Person, namely the Son of God, the Word who became flesh. This means that the Person of the incarnate Redeemer is divine, the object of Christian worship. He cannot, then, be a mere human being as other men are mere human beings. To worship one who is a man and only a man would be idolatry. And because this personal union of the divine and the human is truly a <span class="ital">union,</span> the Redeemer is one Person, not two. If to worship a human person would be idolatry, to worship two persons—one human, one divine—would be an absurdity. This Person, who unites in himself the divine and the human, is often described by theologians as a “theanthropic” person, the God-man. If one does not mean that he is a hybrid—half God, half man—then this mode of speaking is unobjectionable inasmuch as it simply says that this Person, Jesus Christ, is both divine and human, which is what the creed intends.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChristologyafterChalcedon">Christology after Chalcedon</p>
<p class="fl">Matters become more difficult and unanimity less in evidence, however, when the question is raised as to the personal qualities of Christ’s humanity. The formulation most consistent with Chalcedon and generally held by Protestants speaks of the “impersonal humanity” of our Lord. It has also been defended in modern times by the Swiss theologians Karl Barth and Emil Brunner and by G. C. Berkouwer of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Actually the meaning of the phrase “impersonal humanity” <span class="ital">(impersonalitas)</span> is not that in the case of the incarnate Son there is no manifestation of the personal at the human level. Rather, it means that this humanity, of itself, has no independent existence apart from the divine Person who assumed this humanity in the act of becoming incarnate. So far as Jesus of Nazareth is concerned, that which is human exists in and through the Word who is God himself. There is a sense in which God is present to <span class="ital">all</span> created reality (the doctrine of the divine immanence). But howsoever we may conceive of this divine presence of power (providence) and of grace (salvation), there can be no thought of <span class="ital">identity</span> between God and the creature. Even when the church, following the usage of the NT, speaks of the Christian as “indwelt by the Holy Spirit,” there is no identity of <span class="ital">being</span> affirmed; there is no ontological union of the human and the divine. But in the case of the man Jesus Christ, something absolutely unique is affirmed: this man is declared to be identical with God because he, the Person, is the “Word who was made flesh and dwelt among us.” “Therefore,” says Barth, “he does not only live through God and with God; he is himself God. Nor is he autonomous and self-existent. His reality, existence and being are wholly and absolutely that of God himself, the God who acts in his Word. His manhood is only the predicate of his Godhead, or better and more concretely, it is only the predicate, assumed in inconceivable condescension, of the Word acting upon us, the Word who is the Lord.”</p>
<p>In other words, Jesus our Lord is, as man, so united with God that he exists as man only and insofar as he exists as God. The doctrine of <span class="ital">anhypostasy</span> states this truth negatively. It affirms that the human nature of our Lord does not possess the mode of its being as personal in and of itself. The doctrine of <span class="ital">enhypostasy</span> states this truth positively. It affirms that the particular human nature that is our Lord’s acquires its personal mode of being by union with the personal Son of God. It is not Jesus of Nazareth who becomes the Son of God (adoptionism) but the Son of God who becomes Jesus of Nazareth. The Incarnation is a unique act of a divine Person, not a unique experience of the divine on the part of a human person. The Subject of the Incarnation is a divine Subject who acts, not a human subject who is acted upon. But inasmuch as the divine Subject, the eternal Son, so acts as to become this man, Jesus of Nazareth, this man is—not just symbolizes, but <span class="ital">is</span>—the Son of God as no other man is or ever can be the Son of God.</p>
<p>The scriptural basis of the doctrine of the Incarnation includes, of course, the entire range of data in the Gospels as well as several passages in the Pauline Epistles, especially <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-8">Philippians 2:6-8</a>, which is, perhaps, the single most important christological passage in the NT. Here Paul, using the words of a primitive Christian confession, speaks of him “who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The Chalcedonian Creed does not resolve the mystery of the Incarnation, and theologians have made many efforts to better understand the mystery. One of the best known is based on an inference drawn from the passage quoted above. It is known as <span class="ital">kenosis,</span> the theory that when the Son became man, he emptied himself of some aspect of his divinity. The text of Philippians does not say that he emptied himself <span class="ital">of</span> anything, but only that he emptied <span class="ital">himself,</span> a striking figure of speech denoting condescension (“made himself of no reputation,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>). In spite of the exegetical difficulties in this statement, kenotic theory has persisted, in one form or another, especially in British theology. Another effort at understanding suggests that our Lord’s humanity was the <span class="ital">incognito</span> (Kierkegaard’s term) that hid his identity as a divine person from all but the eyes of faith. Thus, the Incarnation was a revelation that veils as well as discloses the truth.</p>

  <title>Chronicles, Books of First and Second</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CHRONICLES, Books of First and Second</p>
<p class="fl">Two OT books, historical records of King David and his successors in the land of Judah. The books of Chronicles are among the most neglected books in the Bible, partly because most of the material can be found in Samuel, Kings, or elsewhere in the OT. Fourteen chapters (<a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-9.44">1 Chr 1–9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.23.1-27.34">23–27</a>) are little more than lists of names; the rest of the material is primarily historical narrative, which some people find almost as boring as lists. Yet the content of Chronicles is not history in a professional or academic sense because the materials used are comparable to the annals compiled by ancient Near Eastern court scribes. Those sources recorded each year’s most important events and were frequently more propagandistic than objectively historical. The records in Chronicles, somewhat eclectic in nature and ignoring certain facets of national history while emphasizing others, deal with only a selected portion of the history of the Israelites. A good deal of the criticism that the work is historically unreliable has come from lack of understanding the book’s character. Chronicles is not so much a history as a metaphysical interpretation of events in Israelite life in light of covenantal values. It was not sufficient for the Chronicler that kings rose and fell; the events were interpreted from a special religious standpoint.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">In the Hebrew Bible, 1 and 2 Chronicles form a single book. The Bible does not say who wrote that book or when it was written. According to the Jewish Talmud, Ezra wrote “his book and Chronicles—the order of all generations down to himself.” Although many scholars defend the view that Ezra wrote Chronicles, there is still no general agreement about the date and authorship of the book.</p>
<p>The author is usually called “the Chronicler,” a title suggesting that he was a historian. It is possible that he was a scribe, priest, or Levite. Evidently the writer had access to government and temple archives, because repeated references are made to a number of official records of kings (<a href="?bref=1Chr.9.1">1 Chr 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.27.24">27:24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.16.11">2 Chr 16:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.34">20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.26">25:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.27.7">27:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.26">28:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.32">32:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.18">33:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.35.27">35:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.8">36:8</a>) and prophets (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.29">1 Chr 29:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.29">2 Chr 9:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.15">12:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.22">13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.34">20:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.26.22">26:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.32">32:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.19">33:19</a>).</p>
<p>The evidence is suggestive, but not conclusive, that the author of Chronicles also wrote the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The last two verses of Chronicles are almost the same as the first three verses of Ezra. The language and literary style of all three books are similar. The same theological concerns for the temple and its worship and the same interest in lists and genealogies appear in all three books. In the Hebrew Bible, Ezra-Nehemiah is considered one book and stands before Chronicles. Chronicles stands at the very end of the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">It is not possible to determine precisely when the book of Chronicles was written. The book ends with a reference to the decree of Cyrus, king of Persia, permitting the Jewish captives in Babylon to return to their homeland. Since Cyrus’s decree is usually dated about 538 <span class="era">BC</span>, Chronicles could not have been written before that date. But if Ezra-Nehemiah is a part of the same work as Chronicles, the materials could not have been written until Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem in 444 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Genealogies in Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah may shed some light on the dating of the books. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.10-24">1 Chronicles 3:10-24</a> the lineage of David and Solomon is traced through the sixth generation after the exile, which would make the date for Anani (the last person in the list) about 400 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The language of Chronicles is definitely that of postexilic Hebrew. The use of the Persian word <span class="ital">daric</span> (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.7">1 Chr 29:7</a>), plus a lack of any Greek words, places Chronicles in the Persian period (538–331 <span class="era">BC</span>). The word <span class="hebrew">midrash</span> (“exposition”) appears in the OT only in Chronicles (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.22">2 Chr 13:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.27">24:27</a>) but is very common in postbiblical Hebrew. Around 400 <span class="era">BC</span> is probably the best estimate for the date of Chronicles, based on evidence now available.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">During the Persian period, some of the Jews returned to Jerusalem from Babylon soon after Cyrus’s decree. They rebuilt the temple and waited for the messianic age to come. But with drought, economic hardships, and moral and spiritual laxness, their hopes faded. Judah was stable politically as a part of the large, dominant Persian Empire. There was not the slightest possibility of restoring the Davidic kingdom.</p>
<p>If the kingdom of David could not be restored politically, how was a Jew of the early fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> to understand history and the place of the Jews in God’s plan? The Chronicler, living at that time, found the key to history in God’s covenant with David. The first 10 chapters of 1 Chronicles lead up to David; chapters <a href="?bref=2Chr.11.1-29.36">11–29</a> detail events of David’s rule. Moses is mentioned in Chronicles 31 times; David, more than 250 times. David planned the temple and collected money to build it. He appointed Levites, singers, and gatekeepers. He divided the priesthood into its orders. He was responsible for the temple worship, which was tremendously important to the Chronicler and his contemporaries.</p>
<p>The Persian period of Israel’s history is largely a silent one, both in other OT materials and in archaeological finds. Of course, all the evidence is not yet in, as archaeologists continue their investigations of the period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginandPurpose">Origin and Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The Chronicler must have lived in Jerusalem and written for the Jewish community there. He refers to Jerusalem about 240 times and to Judah more than 225 times. A negative feeling toward the northern kingdom of Israel can be seen in the almost total lack of references to any northern king. The Chronicler’s attitude toward the north is clearly expressed in the two following verses: “The northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David to this day” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.10.19">2 Chr 10:19</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>) and “Don’t you realize that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, made an unbreakable covenant with David, giving him and his descendants the throne of Israel forever?” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.5">13:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The Chronicler wanted the Jewish people to see that God was sovereign over all things. For example, he includes David’s affirmation: “Yours, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, is the greatness, the power, the glory, the victory, and the majesty. Everything in the heavens and on earth is yours, O <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and this is your kingdom. We adore you as the one who is over all things. Riches and honor come from you alone, for you rule over everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is at your discretion that people are made great and given strength” (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.11-12">1 Chr 29:11-12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Compiled in the postexilic period, Chronicles was meant to emphasize the significance of the theocracy seen in light of earlier history. The theocracy was a social configuration God planned for postexilic Judah, a religious rather than secular community. Instead of a king, the Jews had a priesthood of which the Lord approved (as distinct from the corrupt priests who had been to a large extent responsible for the preexilic moral and spiritual collapse of the nation).</p>
<p>The postexilic Judeans were to live as a holy nation, not as people with political and nationalistic ambitions. Therefore, the Chronicler demanded implicit obedience to the Mosaic covenant so that the returning Jews could find prosperity, divine blessing, and grace. The Jews were still the chosen people, purged by the experience of exile, with a new opportunity to fulfill the Sinai covenant.</p>
<p>The Chronicler gave great weight to divine retribution and was insistent that all action be guided by specific moral principles, to reflect God’s character clearly in his people. Because the writer saw God’s hand in all history, punishing the apostate and being gracious to the penitent, he saw in the chastened remnant of the exile the true spiritual heirs of the house of David. He insisted that the postexilic community adhere rigorously to the morality of Sinai, guarding against preexilic apostasy and ensuring divine blessing.</p>
<p>The writer wanted the Jews to know God’s power. He also wanted them to believe in the Lord so that they would be “established.” If they believed God’s messengers, they would succeed (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.20">2 Chr 20:20</a>). He also wanted the people to know that Jerusalem was God’s chosen place of worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.5.1-6.42">2 Chr 5–6</a>), and that the temple, priests, singers, Levites, and gatekeepers had been divinely appointed (<a href="?bref=1Chr.28.19">1 Chr 28:19</a>). The temple was meant to be a place where all their needs could be met (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.19-7.3">2 Chr 6:19–7:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">Chronicles can be briefly outlined as follows: 1 Chronicles—genealogies (<a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-9.44">1–9</a>); the reign of David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.10.1-29.30">10–29</a>); 2 Chronicles—the reign of Solomon (<a href="?bref=2Chr.1.1-9.31">1–9</a>); the kings of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.10.1-36.21">10:1–36:21</a>); epilogue on the exile and return (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.22-23">36:22-23</a>). Since the Chronicler’s writings do not have a didactic format, the reader must draw out those ideas and principles that are prominent and basic.</p>
<p>One important idea running through Chronicles is the greatness, power, and uniqueness of God. It is expressed most beautifully and forcefully in <a href="?bref=1Chr.29.11-12">1 Chronicles 29:11-12</a>, which declares that everything in heaven and earth belongs to God and he is head over all. Other passages make a similar claim. When Sennacherib, king of Assyria, attacked Judah and Jerusalem, King Hezekiah of Judah admonished his people not to fear the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>Several times the Chronicler repeats the idea that Israel’s God is unique: there is no other God like the Lord. In <a href="?bref=1Chr.16.25-26">1 Chronicles 16:25-26</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.96.4-5">Psalm 96:4-5</a> is quoted: “Great is the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>! He is most worthy of praise! He is to be revered above all gods. The gods of other nations are merely idols, but the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> made the heavens!” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Both David and Solomon are quoted as saying that there is no other God but the Lord (<a href="?bref=1Chr.17.20">1 Chr 17:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.14">2 Chr 6:14</a>).</p>
<p>Chronicles emphasizes that the Lord is “greater than all gods” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.5">2 Chr 2:5</a>). The classic passage that stresses the differences between God and the “god” of a nation is in <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.1-33">2 Chronicles 32</a>. When Sennacherib attacked Jerusalem, he asked the people what they were relying on to withstand the siege in Jerusalem. Sennacherib was saying, in effect, “Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you by telling you that your God will deliver you. No god of any nation so far has been able to stand against me. Your God is like the gods of all the other nations. He will not be able to deliver you from me.” The Chronicler observes that the Assyrians spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth. But God did deliver Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from Sennacherib.</p>
<p>Several passages declare that God rules over the nations (<a href="?bref=1Chr.17.21">1 Chr 17:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.6">2 Chr 20:6</a>). In fact, the Chronicler saw the Lord as the one who directs history. The Lord brought Israel out of Egypt and drove the Canaanites out of their land (<a href="?bref=1Chr.17.21">1 Chr 17:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.6.5">2 Chr 6:5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.7">20:7</a>). Some seeming quirks of history are explained with such phrases as “it was ordained by God” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.22.7">2 Chr 22:7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Over and over in telling the story of the struggles of the kings of Judah with other nations, Chronicles points out that the Lord always decided the battle (<a href="?bref=1Chr.10.13-14">1 Chr 10:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.6">18:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.2">2 Chr 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.13.15">13:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.15">20:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.11-14">21:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.18">24:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.1,5-6,19">28:1, 5-6, 19</a>).</p>
<p>To the Chronicler the Lord was a covenant-keeping God (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.14">2 Chr 6:14</a>). He was the God of justice and righteousness (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.6">12:6</a>), so human judges must judge honestly and fairly (<a href="?bref=2Chr.19.7">19:7</a>). The Chronicler made it clear that no individual or nation could succeed by opposing God (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20">24:20</a>); not only would people fail against God, but they were powerless without him (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.14">1 Chr 29:14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.12">2 Chr 20:12</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord is seen not only as a unique, righteous, and powerful God, but also as a wise God. God tests the human heart and knows when he finds integrity (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.17">1 Chr 29:17</a>). Solomon prayed for God to “hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men)” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.30">2 Chr 6:30</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p>Although God knows all about human beings, and has supreme power in heaven and on earth, men and women are still free to obey or disobey the Lord. The stories in Chronicles depict people who chose to obey or disobey God. Those who obeyed succeeded; but to the extent that others, even kings, disobeyed God, they failed. Three of the Chronicler’s heroes were Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah. Each was a great reformer, and each was commended for obeying the Lord. But each one sinned near the end of his life and incurred the disfavor of God. Jehoshaphat joined an alliance with a wicked king from the north (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.35-37">2 Chr 20:35-37</a>). Hezekiah sinned in receiving envoys from Babylon and “God left him to himself” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.32.31">32:31</a>). Josiah did not obey the word of God spoken by Pharaoh Neco and was killed (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.21-24">35:21-24</a>).</p>
<p>The Chronicler believed that all human beings have sinned (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.36">2 Chr 6:36</a>), and should repent with all their mind and heart (<a href="?bref=2Chr.6.38">6:38</a>). One of the greatest passages on repentance in all the Bible is in <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.14">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>.</p>
<p>A prominent theme in Chronicles is the importance of the temple as the place to meet God in worship. One could say that almost everything in Chronicles is related to the temple in one way or another. For a person living in Jerusalem in the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span> under the domination of the Persians, temple worship was very significant. The Chronicler expressed the importance of true community and institutional worship.</p>
<p>Worship was the dominant attitude of the Chronicler, whose God was worthy to be praised. A worship service is described in <a href="?bref=2Chr.29.20-30">2 Chronicles 29:20-30</a>. Hezekiah commanded a burnt offering and a sin offering to be made for all Israel. The Levites were stationed in the house of the Lord with cymbals, harps, and lyres. The priests had trumpets. “Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be placed on the altar. As the burnt offering was presented, songs of praise to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> were begun, accompanied by the trumpets and other instruments of David, king of Israel. The entire assembly worshiped the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> as the singers sang and the trumpets blew, until all the burnt offerings were finished. Then the king and everyone with him bowed down in worship. King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to praise the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> with the psalms of David and Asaph the seer. So they offered joyous praise and bowed down in worship” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.27-30">2 Chr 29:27-30</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">CHRONOLOGY OF THE BIBLE* (Old Testament)</p>
<p class="fl">Branch of biblical studies that attempts to assign dates and sequences to OT events. Chronology is a science. It deals with evidence, theories, assumptions, and the balance of probabilities. Often it boils down to a matter of choosing among theories that are equally unable to solve all the problems raised by other points of view. OT chronology is an accredited branch of biblical studies primarily because it is essential for understanding the proper historical background of the biblical texts. In general, the chronology of the OT is understood well enough to vindicate the basic accuracy and sequential order of Scripture.</p>
<p>Both biblical and nonbiblical materials are utilized by students of OT chronology. Biblical data include (1) genealogies showing personal and tribal affiliations among various peoples; (2) specific numbers given by biblical authors to indicate a person’s longevity, a king’s reign, or the duration of a specific event; (3) synchronizing statements that date an event in a specific year of a king’s reign or relate it to a natural phenomenon assumed to be common knowledge at the time of writing (e.g., <a href="?bref=Amos.1.1">Am 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.14.5">Zec 14:5</a>).</p>
<p>From the abundance of such chronological passages in the OT, one might conclude that establishment of OT dates and sequences would be a simple procedure. Each of the three kinds of biblical materials, however, exhibits special problems that must be solved first.</p>
<p>Nonbiblical materials that shed light on OT chronology are quite numerous, and more are discovered year by year. They include (1) official records of important affairs such as military campaigns from countries like Egypt or Babylonia; (2) official inscriptions that are dedicatory or commemorate a great victory; (3) annals listing major accomplishments of a ruler year by year; (4) ostraca (inscribed pieces of pottery) containing letters, tax transactions and economic records, military dispatches between field leaders and command headquarters, or other information. Ostraca may be dated archaeologically and are often used to supplement the biblical record.</p>
<p>The chronologist tries to examine the pertinent biblical and nonbiblical information, notes areas of correlation among all the data, and finally establishes a working system into which the most facts can be fitted. New evidence uncovered at any time may necessitate shifts in the present working system. Although the basic structure of biblical chronology seems reasonably firm, many details will no doubt be subject to change as new evidence is discovered.</p>
<p>As a general rule, the earlier the period, the less certain one can be of one’s dating. In the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, for example, many dates can be assigned within a range of about 100 years. By the time of David and Solomon (c. 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>), the margin of error over which scholars debate is a decade or less. The range narrows as one comes toward the present, so that, with the exception of one or two problem eras, dates accurate to within one or two years are possible by roughly the middle of the ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Such limitations must be kept in mind in any examination of the major periods of OT history.</p>

<p class="h3">Biblical Evidence</p>
<p class="fl">In the first 11 chapters of Genesis are found accounts of the Creation (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-2.13">1–2</a>), the fall (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-10">3</a>), Cain and Abel (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.4.1-14">4</a>), the Flood (chs <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-9.29">6–9</a>), and the Tower of Babel (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-17">11</a>). Those events are set within a certain chronological framework.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1-32">Genesis 5</a>, a period of 10 generations elapsed between the Creation and the Flood. Although the individuals listed enjoyed a total life span of a hefty 847 years plus, the total time elapsing between Adam and the Flood was only 1,656 years.</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-32">Genesis 11</a>, another 10 generations elapsed from the time of the Flood until the time of Abraham (at least in the Septuagint, the third-century <span class="era">BC</span> Greek translation of the OT; the Hebrew Masoretic text has 9). In that period the average age attained by individuals in the list is 346 years (using a figure of 460 for Arphaxad’s son Cainan, who is included in v <a href="?bref=Gen.11.13">13</a> of the LXX; cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.3.36">Lk 3:36</a>); the total elapsed time from the Flood to Abraham is only 520 years. Taken literally, that would mean that all of Abraham’s ancestors as far back as Noah’s son Shem were still alive at Abraham’s birth, and that a total of only 2,176 years elapsed from the time of Creation to Abraham.</p>
<p class="h3">Interpretation of the Biblical Data</p>
<p class="fl">A literalistic or slavishly mathematical interpretation of the figures, as has appeared in the margin of many <span class="sc">kjv</span> Bibles, requires a number of assumptions: that no names are omitted from the genealogies, that all the numbers given are consecutive, and especially that numbers used in an ancient biblical source carry the same meaning as that associated with them in the modern Western mind. Each assumption needs serious examination in the light of other established facts.</p>
<p>A cursory reading of other biblical genealogies, for example, reveals that not all the names of a given family were always included. Even Matthew recorded a total of 28 generations (two sets of 14 each) between David and Jesus, and comparison with OT genealogies reveals that Matthew omitted several names. Luke listed a total of 42 generations for the same interval. Omissions are also obvious when one compares the genealogical lists given in <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.1-8.40">1 Chronicles 1–8</a> with those recorded earlier in Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, 1 and 2 Samuel, and 1 and 2 Kings.</p>
<p>Further, ancient peoples thought of numbers in a schematic or stylized way. Use of numbers among the ancient Near Eastern nations differed sharply from current Western practice. Examples of that practice are known from both biblical and nonbiblical sources. For example, a list of eight Sumerian kings who ruled in the city of Shurruppak before the “great flood” of the Jemdet Nar era (c. 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>) assigns each man an average reign of more than 30,000 years. Berossus, a Babylonian priest of Marduk living in the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, added two names to the eight found in that earlier list of kings and assigned an average of 43,200 years to each king. Such extraordinarily high numbers provide a perspective for considering the numbers of Genesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, although one can assume that the numbers assigned to the ages of the patriarchs preceding Abraham in Genesis had real meaning for those responsible for their preservation, they should not be employed in a purely literal sense to compute the length of the various generations mentioned in the text. Further, the numbers given in the Septuagint and in the Samaritan Pentateuch, another early version of the Pentateuch, diverge in many details from those of the Hebrew Masoretic Text. That means, among other things, that the Genesis numbers caused problems for even the earliest scholars of Scripture.</p>
<p class="h3">Nonbiblical Evidence</p>
<p class="fl">Archaeology provides no evidence that may be used to date either the Creation or any other account preserved in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-11.32">Genesis 1–11</a>. The Flood is an example that illustrates some of the difficulties. Many claims have been made by persons from a wide variety of backgrounds (scientists, explorers, theologians, and others) to the effect that archaeology has proven the Genesis Flood narrative to be true. Yet no city so far excavated in Palestine and Syria (including some of the oldest towns in the world) shows archaeological evidence of the Flood.</p>
<p>Although several cities in Mesopotamia do exhibit evidence of a flood, three factors make it difficult to link that evidence with <a href="?bref=Gen.6.1-9.29">Genesis 6–9</a>. Each of the flood levels so far discovered dates from a different period. Further, since nearby sites show no evidence of flooding, all of the Mesopotamian flood evidence points to relatively small local floods. Finally, the evidence indicates no great cultural discontinuities of the sort that would result from destruction of an entire population. Thus, it seems that the ancient Mesopotamian floods discovered through archaeological research are of the same kind as the floods that still occur in the Euphrates River valley.</p>
<p>Clearly, certain questions one might ask of the Genesis narratives simply cannot be answered. Many who regard the Bible as the Word of God have concluded that the dating of events found in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-11.32">Genesis 1–11</a> must be less important than the theological truths of salvation, faith, and obedience that these accounts present.</p>

<p class="h2" id="FromAbrahamtoMoses">From Abraham to Moses</p>
<p class="h3">The Patriarchal Age</p>
<p class="fl">The date of Abraham is still a lively topic among biblical scholars who agree that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were indeed historical persons. Opinions range from an early-date view that estimates that the patriarchal age extended from 2086 to 1871 <span class="era">BC</span>, to a late-date view placing Abraham at around 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>. Since each position claims to fit the biblical data, a closer look at the two points of view is in order.</p>
<p>Many OT passages seem to support the view that puts Abraham at a comparatively early date. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">First Kings 6:1</a> computes 480 years back from the founding of the temple in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign (961 <span class="era">BC</span>, according to the early-date view) to the exodus from Egypt, which would then be dated 1441 <span class="era">BC</span>. Counting 430 years as the period of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt (see <a href="?bref=Gen.15.13">Gn 15:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Ex 12:40</a>) takes the date back to 1871 <span class="era">BC</span>. To that date are added the 215 years demanded by the total of (1) Abraham’s age upon entering Canaan (75 years according to <a href="?bref=Gen.12.4">Gn 12:4</a>); (2) 25 additional years before the birth of Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.5">Gn 21:5</a>); (3) 60 more years to the birth of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.26">Gn 25:26</a>); and (4) the appearance of Jacob before the pharaoh at age 130 (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.9">Gn 47:9</a>). Those 215 years added to the previous total give a date of 2086 <span class="era">BC</span> for the entrance of Abraham into Canaan and a date of 2161 <span class="era">BC</span> for his birth.</p>
<p>Such a calculation does not use all of the chronological evidence presented in the OT; consequently, the date for Abraham is open to challenge. For example, the 480 years between the exodus and Solomon’s fourth regnal year represent a period of time into which the wilderness wanderings, the career of Joshua and his immediate successors, the period of the judges, Samuel, Saul, and David must all be placed. Although the OT does not specifically say how long were the careers of Joshua, Samuel, or Saul, even a modest reckoning pushes the total years required by all the biblical data together to approximately 600.</p>
<p>In addition, the length of time to be assigned to the Egyptian sojourn is problematic. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the Septuagint both view the number 430 (in <a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Ex 12:40</a>) as applicable not only to the years in Egypt but to the years of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in Canaan as well. Evidently Paul followed the Septuagint tradition when he dated the giving of the law 430 years later than the time of God’s promise to Abraham (see <a href="?bref=Gal.3.15-18">Gal 3:15-18</a>). That means the Septuagint figure cannot be dismissed lightly.</p>
<p>The late dating of Abraham (c. 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>) is based on two propositions: (1) The picture of patriarchal society portrayed in Genesis most closely parallels that reflected in the cuneiform tablets recovered from Nuzi, a town in northeastern Mesopotamia about 175 miles (282 kilometers) north of Baghdad. (2) Because those tablets must be dated in the 15th and 14th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, the parallel patriarchal age must have fallen within the same general time period.</p>
<p>Those who hold the late-date view are aware that their date for Abraham cannot be equated with the set of numbers on which the early-date view depends. They point to other data, also from the OT. Joseph, who was already a highly placed Egyptian official when Jacob moved to Egypt, lived to be 110 years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.26">Gn 50:26</a>). Moses was a great-grandson of Levi, Joseph’s older brother. Since Joseph lived to see his own greatgrandchildren born (who would probably be younger than Moses since their great-grandfather was younger than his), the late-date view concludes that Joseph could have been alive when Moses was born. The four-generation genealogy of Moses (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Moses, in <a href="?bref=Exod.6.16-20">Ex 6:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.3.17-19">Nm 3:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.58-59">26:58-59</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.1-3">1 Chr 6:1-3</a>) was evidently thought to be complete according to <a href="?bref=Gen.15.16">Genesis 15:16</a>, which predicted that Abraham’s descendants would be freed from Egyptian bondage “in the fourth generation.”</p>
<p>However, a date of around 1400 <span class="era">BC</span> for Abraham cannot be aligned with certain other biblical data, including the long Egyptian sojourn demanded by <a href="?bref=Gen.15.13">Genesis 15:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.12.40">Exodus 12:40</a> and a 40-year (or “one-generation”) wilderness existence. Some normally moderate scholars are forced to reduce the wilderness time to two years in order to maintain their late date for Abraham.</p>
<p>In short, the late-date theory is consistent with part of the biblical evidence (the genealogies of Moses), but the early-date theory conforms to another part (the actual year figures listed in scattered verses from Genesis and Exodus). The late-date theory holds that the genealogies represent more reliable information in Semitic societies generally, whereas the early-date theory computes years given in the biblical account literally throughout its scheme.</p>
<p>Because of problems attached to both positions, a large group of scholars take a middle ground in dating the patriarchal age. Archaeologically, they say, Abraham and his life and times fit perfectly within the early second millennium, but imperfectly within any later period. By placing Abraham roughly between 1800 and 1600 <span class="era">BC</span>, they provide enough latitude for a merging of all the available evidence, biblical and nonbiblical, into a workable chronological scheme. Archaeology provides four major bits of evidence for an early second-millennium patriarchal era.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Though the Nuzi tablets furnish a clear parallel to patriarchal social life, other tablets from other towns and an earlier era reflect many of the same customs common to Nuzi and Genesis. Since the Nuzians were Hurrians who came to northeastern Mesopotamia from elsewhere (perhaps Armenia), their social customs originated no doubt much earlier than the time of their tablets now in our possession. Accordingly, the 15th-century <span class="era">BC</span> date of the Nuzi tablets does not preclude an earlier date for Abraham.</p>
<p class="list">2. The names of several of Abraham’s ancestors listed in <a href="?bref=Gen.11.1-32">Genesis 11</a> can now be identified with towns in the northern area of Mesopotamia around Haran, the city from which Abraham migrated to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.11.31-12.3">Gn 11:31–12:3</a>). Significantly, Haran flourished in the 19th and 18th centuries <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list">3. Shortly after 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> Semitic nomads from the desert invaded the civilized communities of the Fertile Crescent. Those invaders, called Amorites in the OT, established themselves in several cities in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. One of the Amorite cities was Babylon, ruled by Hammurabi sometime around the beginning of the 18th century <span class="era">BC</span>. Although the King Amraphel of <a href="?bref=Gen.14.1">Genesis 14:1</a> is not linguistically identifiable with the Babylonian king Hammurabi, as earlier scholars believed, the picture of the times following the Amorite invasion still accords well with the Genesis narratives generally.</p>
<p class="list">4. Mari, another Amorite town, is now well known because of more than 20,000 tablets recovered from its royal palace and archives. Geographically, Mari is located in the general area of Haran. Chronologically, the tablets recovered come from the 18th century <span class="era">BC</span>. One 18th-century king of Mari, Zimri Lim, carried on extensive correspondence with Hammurabi of Babylon. The tablets from Mari also furnish valuable information about tribal and ethnic groups and their movements in the general region. Of basic importance for dating the Genesis materials are certain documents from Mari that include personal names very similar to Abraham (Abi-ram), Jacob, Laban, and several other West Semitic names.</p>
<p class="sp">Archaeological evidence neither proves nor disproves the actual existence of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob. That is admitted on all sides. What archaeology has done is to provide a framework of probabilities within which the biblical patriarchal narratives appear more and more to be at home.</p>
<p class="h3">Date of the Exodus</p>
<p class="fl">The problem of dating the patriarchal age is closely related to the problem of assigning a date to the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. Since the evidence does not permit a precise date for Abraham, a precise date for the entry of Joseph or Jacob into Egypt is likewise unobtainable. Further, the biblical evidence does not yield an exact figure for the length of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt.</p>
<p>For many years biblical scholars viewed <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kings 6:1</a> as a foundation upon which to build an unshakable date for the exodus. Because Solomon’s fourth year could be unquestionably fixed to within at least a 10-year span (967–958 <span class="era">BC</span>), the exodus too could be dated with the same precision simply by adding 480 years. But other biblical data raise serious questions about that simple procedure. When the Bible deals with all the events between the time of the exodus and the founding of Solomon’s temple, that is, from Numbers to <a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.18">1 Kings 5:18</a>, the precise numbers given total not 480 but closer to 600 years.</p>
<p>Because the evidence is insufficient to allow a precise date for the exodus, scholarly opinion remains divided between two possibilities. A 15th-century exodus is supported by several pieces of evidence. The chronology in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kings 6:1</a> appears to be independently corroborated by a passage in <a href="?bref=Judg.11.26">Judges 11:26</a>. It claims that Israel had occupied the area around Heshbon for 300 years preceding Jephthah’s own day. If Jephthah is dated at roughly 1100 <span class="era">BC</span>, one is obviously led back to an exodus in the middle of the 15th century. Also, three successive generations of pharaohs who ruled in the 16th and 15th centuries produced no male offspring, making it more likely that Moses would have become the foster son of a royal princess during that time; all of the 19th-dynasty kings (1306–1200 <span class="era">BC</span>) had legitimate male heirs.</p>
<p>In addition, a 15th-century date makes possible a connection between the Habiru invasion of Canaan (1400–1350 <span class="era">BC</span>)—described in the Amarna letters found at Tell el-Amarna, Egypt—and the invasion of Canaan by the Hebrews described in the OT book of Joshua. Related to that is a reference to “Israel” in the Merneptah Stele, a stone pillar inscribed with the deeds of the Egyptian king, Merneptah, of about 1220 <span class="era">BC</span>. It implies that the people referred to, met by Merneptah in the course of a Canaanite military campaign, had been in existence for some time. Finally, an excavator of Jericho, John Garstang, placed the destruction of that city at around 1400 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Other evidence, however, strongly implies not a 15th- but a 13th-century date for the exodus. Many scholars assign a date between 1290 and 1275 <span class="era">BC</span> on the basis of that evidence. First, the 480 years of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kings 6:1</a> discussed above may be interpreted as schematically representing 12 generations, as indicated by <a href="?bref=1Chr.6.3-8">1 Chronicles 6:3-8</a>. Thus if 12 generations averaged 25 years instead of 40 years, the reduction of 480 schematized years to 300 actual years would point to an exodus date of around 1266 <span class="era">BC</span>. Second, archaeological evidence exists that dates destruction at the assumed sites of several cities conquered by Joshua (Lachish, Debir, Bethel, and Hazor) to the late 13th century. Third, there is no biblical mention of Egyptian military campaigns (such as Merneptah’s 1220 <span class="era">BC</span> incursion); Israelites living in Canaan before the time of the militarily active pharaohs Seti I (1319–1301 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Ramses II (1301–1234 <span class="era">BC</span>) would certainly have been affected by such activity. Fourth, <a href="?bref=Exod.1.11">Exodus 1:11</a> mentions the city of Rameses, the capital built by Ramses II, according to his own inscriptions. A fifth line of argument comes from archaeological conclusions that Transjordan and the Negev Desert were not occupied by sedentary people between 1900 and 1300 <span class="era">BC</span>, whereas the Bible states clearly that the Israelites encountered stiff opposition from groups in that same region. Thus, it is argued, the Israelites must have entered that region after 1300 <span class="era">BC</span>. Sixth, connecting the Habiru with the Israelites of the Conquest lacks weight because many texts besides the Amarna tablets attest to the existence of Habiru groups virtually all over the ancient Near East. “Habiru” seems to be a much broader term, possibly meaning “trespasser,” and is probably unrelated etymologically or semantically to “Hebrew.” Seventh, and finally, Garstang’s work at Jericho has now been revised by archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon, who showed that the fallen walls that Garstang had dated about 1400 <span class="era">BC</span> in reality were destroyed in 1800 <span class="era">BC</span> or earlier.</p>
<p>So far, it has been impossible to decide with precision between the two centuries proposed for the exodus. The majority opinion among OT scholars generally, including a growing number of moderate or conservative scholars, is in favor of the 13th-century option. On the other hand, many other conservative scholars continue to favor the 15th-century date. Dogmatism is unwarranted since problems remain unresolved with either option.</p>
<p>In accordance with the majority opinion, however, a date of about 1290 <span class="era">BC</span> for the exodus will be used in dealing with subsequent problems.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ConquestandConsolidation">Conquest and Consolidation</p>
<p class="fl">The chronological task for the period of conquest and consolidation is to fit all the events narrated by the OT, chiefly in Joshua and Judges, between the exodus (c. 1290 <span class="era">BC</span>) and the times of David (c. 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Solomon (d. 930 <span class="era">BC</span>). In other words, one must fit roughly 550 years of biblical events between Moses and David into a 290-year span.</p>
<p>Although assigning an early date for the exodus (c. 1447 <span class="era">BC</span>) would make the task somewhat easier, the mere addition of about 157 years does not by itself solve all the problems. Neither date allows enough time for all the OT events from Joshua to David to take place singly and consecutively. Accordingly, advocates of both dates assume that some of the judges ruled simultaneously rather than consecutively. The difference is one of degree only.</p>
<p>The book of Joshua furnishes most of the OT evidence regarding the conquest of Canaan by the Israelites. Unfortunately, the book of Joshua has no chronological notes that specify the amount of time elapsing during Joshua’s career. Further, there are no biblical references to major contemporary events in other parts of the ancient world, the dates of which could be used to fix the chronology. Rather, in what is obviously a telescoped account, the book of Joshua records the fall of Jericho and Ai, followed closely by a southern and then a northern campaign. After those victories, covering much of the total territory of Canaan, various parcels of land were distributed to the tribal groups of Israel; the tribes were expected to complete the task of destroying whatever Canaanite inhabitants remained in their particular region. One seeks in vain, however, for any statements indicating how long those events took.</p>
<p>In the book of Judges a slightly different circumstance prevails. There the OT furnishes a rather complete list of figures to indicate the duration of periods of foreign oppression, judgeships, and ensuing peace. The total number of years described for that period is 410, but that total does not include any time for the many “minor” judges. It seems obvious, therefore, that most if not all of the judges were simply local chieftains whose activity was simultaneous with that of other judges, at least for part of their reign. Unfortunately, the book of Judges provides no cross-reference system to indicate which judges were contemporaries of which others. Perhaps the best one can do is to assume general guidelines for the chronology of that period between Moses and David.</p>
<p>Two significant facts should be kept in mind. First, archaeological information seems to demand a Conquest date beginning about 1250 <span class="era">BC</span> rather than 200 years earlier. Assuming concurrent careers for the judges allows one to compress the literal OT figures into the general scheme demanded by other evidence.</p>
<p>Second, the ancient scribes evidently related the chronology of the period to a 40-year or generation-based schema, a practice that lasted until the time of the divided kingdom, when a regular dynastic chronology was introduced. In the face of so many careers being assigned exactly 40 years, the fact remains that the literal totals of such numbers cannot be harmonized with either the biblical or the archaeological evidence for the period. Accordingly, most scholars doubt that the number 40 was ever intended to be an exact mathematical calculation. That view permits enough leeway for cautious fitting of biblical and other evidence into a general timetable.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMonarchy">The Monarchy</p>
<p class="h3">Types of Evidence</p>
<p class="fl">For the period of the Israelite monarchy, chronological evidence is abundant.</p>
<p>The OT itself strives to provide all the information necessary for the chronology of the period, including (1) a complete list of all the kings in Israel and in Judah both before and after the division of the kingdom; (2) the age of each king (except Saul) at his accession; (3) synchronisms of the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah showing in what year of his contemporary in the other kingdom each king came to the throne; and (4) precise calculations of the length of each king’s reign. In addition some important events are dated by reference to another event; others are coordinated with concurrent events in secular history.</p>
<p>Outside the OT an abundance of material provides evidence for a chronology of the period. By far the most important single source is a collection of Assyrian <span class="ital">limmu</span> lists. In Assyria a record of each king’s reign was kept on a particular kind of annal. Each year of reign was named after an individual of high rank in the court; the first year was named after the king himself, the second after the next highest-ranking official (though that name appears to have been selected by lot originally), and so on, down until the death of the king. The word <span class="ital">limmu</span> was used to introduce the name of the official after whom the current year was to be named, hence the designation <span class="ital">“limmu</span> lists.”</p>
<p>Assyrian <span class="ital">limmu</span> lists are tied precisely to the solar year, making the documents highly reliable. Further, in addition to many events in Assyrian history, notable natural phenomena were dated on the basis of the <span class="ital">limmu</span> in which they occurred. For example, a solar eclipse dated by the Assyrian scribes in the <span class="ital">limmu</span> year of Bur-Sagale has been computed astronomically as June 15, 763 <span class="era">BC</span>. Beginning with the year 763, then, and working both backward and forward, a complete list of Assyrian <span class="ital">limmu</span> officials has been obtained for the period between 891 and 648 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>With the accuracy of the Assyrian <span class="ital">limmu</span> lists corroborated by a number of sources, they can be used with confidence in reconstructing the chronology of the corresponding period of biblical history. That is especially true where a biblical writer related an Israelite or a Judahite event to a particular year in the reign of an Assyrian king whose <span class="ital">limmu</span> list indicates the precise years of his reign.</p>
<p>There are also records from Chaldean (Babylonian) king lists and from later Greek historians. Ptolemy, in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>, for example, gave dates for Babylonian kings from 747 <span class="era">BC</span> and continued with dates for Persian, Greek, and Roman rulers down to <span class="era">AD</span> 161. Finally, useful information is found in inscriptions from monuments, stelae, and other artifacts from Assyria and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="h3">Monarchical Chronology</p>
<p class="fl">The <span class="ital">limmu</span> list of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III provides a basis for the first comparison of dates among Assyria, Israel, and Judah. In the <span class="ital">limmu</span> of Daian-Assur, Shalmaneser’s sixth year on the throne, Ahab of Israel was listed as one of the kings who fought against the Assyrians in the battle of Qarqar. Thus the date for that battle may be placed confidently in 853 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Assyrian records also indicate that Shalmaneser III came into contact with an Israelite king 12 years later, in 841 <span class="era">BC</span>. That king was Jehu. Thus two fixed points are available for correlating the biblical information. Following the death of Ahab, which is not dated exactly by reference to the Assyrian records, two of his sons came to power. The first, Ahaziah, reigned two years (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.51">1 Kgs 22:51</a>); the second, Joram (also called Jehoram), reigned a total of 12 years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.1">2 Kgs 3:1</a>). Recognizing a nonaccession-year reckoning by the Israelites in that era, the apparent total of 14 years may be reduced to an actual total of 12. Thus it seems evident that Ahab not only fought Shalmaneser III in 853 <span class="era">BC</span> but also died in that year. Ahab was then followed by his two sons for a total of 12 years before the accession of Jehu in time to account for his contact with Shalmaneser II in 841 <span class="era">BC</span>. Further, because Jehu murdered both the king of Israel (Jehoram) and the king of Judah (Ahaziah) at the same time (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.24-27">2 Kgs 9:24-27</a>), a fixed synchronism is provided between the two kingdoms for the year 841 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The first nine kings of Israel ruled an apparent total of 98 years or an actual total (taking into account Israel’s nonaccession-year policy) of 90 years. Zimri, who ruled only seven days (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.15-18">1 Kgs 16:15-18</a>), counts as one of the nine but does not insert an extra year in either the actual or apparent totals. The accession of Jeroboam I thus occurred in 930 <span class="era">BC</span> (adding 90 years to 841 <span class="era">BC</span>), and Rehoboam of Judah began to rule in that same year as well. Allowing Solomon the 40-year reign indicated in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.42">1 Kings 11:42</a> points to the year 970 <span class="era">BC</span> for his accession. The death of David would also be pinpointed in that period, although allowance must be made for the possibility of a short co-regency of David and Solomon before David’s death. The reign of Saul then falls approximately in the late 11th century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>In Judah the period between the death of Solomon in 930 <span class="era">BC</span> and the murder of Ahaziah by Jehu in 841 <span class="era">BC</span> was occupied by the kingships of six men whose time on the throne totals 95 biblical years. Computation of that era in Judah is not as simple as for the Israelite kings for several reasons. Problems include a change from accession- to nonaccession-year reckoning sometime around 850 <span class="era">BC</span>, at least two co-regencies (Jehoshaphat with Asa and then Jehoram with Jehoshaphat), and the calendar differences between the two kingdoms. It is clear that the 95 apparent years must be reduced, on the basis of the differences in computation and calendar, to 90 actual years in order to bring the Judahite figures into line with the established Assyrian and Israelite synchronisms.</p>
<p>After the year 841, the next biblical event to be certified by nonbiblical materials is the fall of Samaria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. That date is furnished by the annals of Sargon II of Assyria (722–705 <span class="era">BC</span>), successor to Shalmaneser V (727–722 <span class="era">BC</span>). Although that date comes just 120 years after the fixed point of 841 <span class="era">BC</span> in Israelite history, the chronological materials for that period are quite difficult to interpret accurately. In the past, scholars resorted to assumptions of extensive co-regencies, to presumed confusion on the part of certain scribes over methods to be followed in computations, or to other theories in attempting to understand the period. In spite of the many difficulties, however, all the biblical and Assyrian dates for the period of the divided monarchy have been harmonized—with the exception of four figures related to the closing years of the Israelite kingdom, all connected in some way with the problematic reign of Hoshea.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JudahaftertheFallofIsrael">Judah after the Fall of Israel</p>
<p class="fl">Following the fall of Samaria in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, OT chronology is concerned only with the southern kingdom of Judah until its destruction some 135 years later. Two events in the biblical record important for establishing a chronology for that period are the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib of Assyria in the late eighth century and the eventual fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in the early sixth century.</p>
<p class="h3">Sennacherib’s Invasion of Judah</p>
<p class="fl">The Assyrian invasion (704–681 <span class="era">BC</span>) is recorded in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13-16">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>, where verse <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13">13</a> dates the event to the 14th year of King Hezekiah. Sennacherib’s own inscriptions include a lengthier version of the affair. From them the date of 701 <span class="era">BC</span> is established, placing the accession of Hezekiah in 715 <span class="era">BC</span>. That much is simple, but problems still arise. For example, <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.9">2 Kings 19:9</a> reports that Sennacherib was in contact with an Ethiopian king, Tirhakah (c. 690–664 <span class="era">BC</span>), during the course of his campaign, which included a siege of Jerusalem. Obviously, contact with a ruler who came to power in 690 <span class="era">BC</span> at the earliest could not refer to events in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>. It is possible, however, that Sennacherib actually made two invasions of Judah, the first in 701 and the second sometime later. The date of that supposed second invasion is not assured, although <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.35-37">2 Kings 19:35-37</a> may imply that Sennacherib was murdered only shortly after his withdrawal from Jerusalem. Since Sennacherib was succeeded by his son Esarhaddon in the year 681, the presumed second invasion of Judah would have occurred somewhere in the last half of the same decade.</p>
<p>A number of scholars oppose the assumption of a second invasion of Jerusalem by Sennacherib. They suggest the possibility that Tirhakah, though king only from 690 <span class="era">BC</span>, may have led troops against Sennacherib as early as 701, before acceding to the throne. The reference to King Tirhakah in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.19.9">2 Kings 19:9</a> would then be understood as use of his eventual title in an effort to identify him to a later generation of readers.</p>
<p>However the question of the number of invasions is decided, it is certain that Sennacherib invaded Judah in 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, the 14th regnal year of Hezekiah. Such a synchronism establishes Hezekiah’s accession year as 715 <span class="era">BC</span>, but that date raises another problem. The fall of Samaria, now established at 722, is dated by <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.10">2 Kings 18:10</a> in the sixth year of Hezekiah’s reign. The most likely solution is that Hezekiah began a co-regency with his father, Ahaz, six years before Samaria fell. The possibility for confusion arises from the fact that one verse (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.13">2 Kgs 18:13</a>; repeated in <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1">Is 36:1</a>) synchronizes Sennacherib’s 701 <span class="era">BC</span> invasion with the 14th year of Hezekiah’s independent reign; another verse (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.10">2 Kgs 18:10</a>) correlates the fall of Samaria with the beginning of Hezekiah’s co-regency. Thus from about 728 to 715 <span class="era">BC</span> Hezekiah was co-regent with Ahaz. From 715 to 697 he reigned alone. From 696 to 686 his son Manasseh was co-ruler with him.</p>
<p>According to the chronological information given by a number of verses in 2 Kings, a total of 128 years and six months elapsed between the time of Hezekiah’s accession in 715 and the capture of King Jehoiachin in 597, a date to be discussed below. Thus another problem is to explain the more than 10-year excess apparently demanded by the biblical totals. The best solution appears to lie in the assumption that Manasseh first came to power in 697 as co-regent with his father, Hezekiah. Manasseh died in 642, following what <a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.1">2 Kings 21:1</a> states was a 55-year reign. Hezekiah, who came to the throne in 715, is said to have reigned 29 years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.2">2 Kgs 18:2</a>), which would mean that he was king until 686, roughly 11 years after the time when Manasseh must have come to the throne in order to have completed a 55-year reign by 642.</p>
<p class="h3">Fall of Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">Contemporary Babylonian records are available to shed valuable light on the last few years of Judah’s existence. For the years 626–623, 618–595, and 556 <span class="era">BC</span> the Babylonian Chronicle, a formal record of Babylonian affairs of state, has been recovered. From information contained in that chronicle and other cuneiform documents of the period, three dates in Judah’s history may be fixed firmly. The first is the death of Josiah in 609; the second is the battle of Carchemish in 605; the third is the end of the reign of Jehoiachin, which is dated by the Babylonian Chronicle to the second month of Adar in the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar, or March 16, 597.</p>
<p>After Jehoiachin’s capture, Zedekiah became puppet king of Judah for 11 years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.18">2 Kgs 24:18</a>). On the tenth day of the tenth month during Zedekiah’s ninth regnal year (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1">2 Kgs 25:1</a>), the final siege of Jerusalem was begun by the Babylonian army. That day was January 15, 588. On the ninth day of the fourth month during the 11th regnal year of Zedekiah, after a siege of almost 18 months, the wall of Jerusalem was broken through (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.3-4">2 Kgs 25:3-4</a>). The temple was burned on day seven of the following (fifth) month.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Beyond587bc">Beyond 586 <span class="era">BC</span></p>
<p class="fl">Following the tragedy of 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, several further developments are given chronological notice in the OT. <a href="?bref=Jer.52.30">Jeremiah 52:30</a> records a third deportation of Jews to Babylonia in the 23d year of King Nebuchadnezzar (582 or 581 <span class="era">BC</span>). Both <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27">2 Kings 25:27</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.52.31">Jeremiah 52:31</a> give evidence of the release of King Jehoiachin from prison; the Babylonian Chronicle dates that event at 27 Adar, or March 21, 561 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>In 539 <span class="era">BC</span> the Babylonians themselves were destined to learn the meaning of defeat. In that year a Persian ruler, Cyrus the Great, launched a successful campaign against Babylon and its king, Nabonidus. Inheriting control over the exiled Jews and many other groups of people conquered earlier by Babylonia, Cyrus moved quickly to initiate a policy of tolerance toward his new subjects. In the first year of his rule Cyrus issued an edict making it possible for Jews to return to their former land (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1">Ezr 1:1</a>). On the first day of the following year, 1 Tishri (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.6">Ezr 3:6</a>), an altar was set up in Jerusalem. In Iyyar of the following year (April/May 536) work was begun on the temple itself (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.8">Ezr 3:8</a>).</p>
<p>After a period of frustrating work stoppages of varying lengths, the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah spurred on the Jews to complete the temple. Work resumed in 520 (<a href="?bref=Ezra.4.24">Ezr 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1,15">Hg 1:1, 15</a>) and was finally completed on 3 Adar, or March 12, 515 (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.15">Ezr 6:15</a>). The final stages of OT chronology pertain to the careers of Ezra and Nehemiah. The traditional view of their era places Ezra in the seventh year of Artaxerxes I (458 <span class="era">BC</span>) and Nehemiah in the 20th (445 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">CHRONOLOGY OF THE BIBLE* (New Testament)</p>
<p class="fl">Branch of biblical studies that attempts to discover the sequence of NT events and the amount of time that elapsed between them. Chronology is essential to historians, whose task it is to determine the causes and effects of past events. Generally, for a historian’s purpose, assigning absolute dates is less important than knowing the sequence of events that may have influenced each other. Very few NT happenings, in fact, can be given exact dates.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="SignificantNewTestamentEventsAndDates"/>
<p>A remarkable testimony to the influence of Christianity is the fact that the entire Western world now divides history into <span class="era">BC</span> (before Christ) and <span class="era">AD</span> (<span class="ital">anno Domini,</span> “in the year of the Lord”). Before that method of dating became widespread in the Middle Ages, events were dated by their relation to other important events such as the founding of Rome or the beginning of a king’s reign. When a monk named Dionysius Exiguus (sixth century) invented our present method of dating, with the birth of Christ dividing history, he made a mistake in his computations. The odd result is the historical anomaly that Jesus himself was born no later than four years “before Christ.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChronologyofJesusLife">Chronology of Jesus’ Life</p>
<p class="h3">Birth</p>
<p class="fl">According to <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1">Matthew 2:1</a> Jesus was born “in the days of Herod the king.” A first-century <span class="era">AD</span> historian, Josephus, recorded that Herod died in the spring of the year we identify as 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. Hence, Jesus was born sometime before that, but how much before is uncertain. <a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-2">Luke 2:1-2</a> records that Jesus’ birth occurred when “Caesar Augustus,” the Roman emperor, decreed that a census, or enrollment, should be taken throughout the nation. “This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Those statements raise two questions: When was such a census taken, and when was Quirinius governor of Syria? Neither question has received a completely satisfying answer.</p>
<p>Census documents discovered in Egypt, together with earlier references, suggest that such enrollments were held every 14 years. That would put a census roughly in 8 or 9 <span class="era">BC</span>. In view of the time needed to carry out the census (which required a person to travel to his birthplace), the birth of Jesus may have been somewhat later than the actual year of the decree (perhaps 7 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>Josephus recorded that Quirinius became governor of Syria in <span class="era">AD</span> 6, rather late as a date for Jesus’ birth. But some scholars have argued from ancient inscriptions that Quirinius also served in Syria as a special legate of the emperor Augustus before 6 <span class="era">BC</span>. That could be the period referred to in <a href="?bref=Luke.2.2">Luke 2:2</a>. Why did Luke choose to cite Quirinius instead of the regular governor of Syria at that time? Perhaps by so doing he could provide a more exact date for the birth of Jesus, since Quirinius was in authority for a shorter time than the regular governor of Syria.</p>
<p>A reasonable conclusion is that Jesus was born about 7 or 6 <span class="era">BC</span>. That fits with <a href="?bref=Matt.2.16">Matthew 2:16</a>, which seems to say that Jesus was born at least two years before Herod’s death in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. No clear evidence exists concerning the day and month of his birth. Celebration of December 25 as Christmas originated in the fourth century, probably as a Christian alternative to the pagan winter solstice festival (Saturnalia).</p>
<p class="h3">The Beginning of Public Ministry</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Luke.3.23">Luke 3:23</a> says that Jesus, “when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age”; since the age given is only approximate, he may have been two or three years older or younger (cf. the pseudepigraphal Testament of Levi 2:2; 12:5). If exactly 30 is added to the suggested date of birth, one gets <span class="era">AD</span> 24. That date cannot be right, because Jesus’ ministry began after John the Baptist appears; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.1-3">Luke 3:1-3</a> dates John’s public appearance precisely in “the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberias Caesar” while Pilate was procurator (governor) over Judea. Pilate governed from <span class="era">AD</span> 26 to 36, and the 15th year of Tiberius was most likely <span class="era">AD</span> 27. Therefore Jesus did not begin his public ministry before <span class="era">AD</span> 27. If only a short time elapsed between the beginning of John’s ministry and the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, then Jesus probably began in <span class="era">AD</span> 27 or 28 when he was approximately 33 years old.</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus’ Death</p>
<p class="fl">All four Gospel records seem to imply that Jesus ate the Last Supper with his disciples on Thursday evening, was crucified on Friday, and rose from the dead early Sunday morning (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.1">Mt 28:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.1">Mk 16:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.1">Lk 24:1</a>). The claim that Jesus rose on the third day (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.4">1 Cor 15:4</a>) comes from the Jewish custom of counting a part of the day as a whole day. According to Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.19">26:19</a>), Mark (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.12">14:12</a>), and Luke (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.15">22:15</a>), the Last Supper was the Passover meal, a yearly celebration of Israel’s escape from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.1-15.27">Ex 12–15</a>). But according to <a href="?bref=John.13.1">John 13:1</a> and <a href="?bref=John.19.14">19:14</a>, the Passover meal had not yet been eaten on Friday; hence the Last Supper in John was not the Passover meal.</p>
<p>No completely satisfying solution to the apparent discrepancy has been put forward. Some scholars suggest plausibly that the use of two different calendars was responsible. According to that theory, Jesus was following a calendar that placed the Passover meal on Thursday night. Temple officials, on the other hand, followed an alternate calendar that placed the killing of sacrificial victims on the next day. John may have used the second system to emphasize the fact that Christ was offered as the Passover sacrifice (cf. <a href="?bref=John.19.36">Jn 19:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">1 Cor 5:7</a>).</p>
<p>To find out how long Jesus’ public ministry lasted and thus the year in which he died, one can turn to time references in John’s Gospel. John referred to at least three Passovers (<a href="?bref=John.2.13">2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.4">6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.1">13:1</a>) and possibly four (<a href="?bref=John.5.1">5:1</a>). Since the Passover was a yearly feast, the ministry of Jesus would have lasted at least two and possibly three years. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke the Friday of Jesus’ death occurred on the 15th of the Jewish month Nisan (which overlaps March and April). According to John, Jesus died on 14 Nisan. The question is: In which years from 26 to 36 (when Pilate was procurator in Judea) did 14 or 15 Nisan fall on a Friday? The answer is <span class="era">AD</span> 27, 29, 30, and 33. Of those, the year 27 is too early and 33 is probably too late. Thus Jesus was probably crucified in 29 or 30, his public ministry lasted two or three years, and he was 35 or 36 years old when he died.</p>
<p class="h2">Events from <span class="era">AD</span> 30 to 50</p>
<p class="fl">Acts is the only NT book that records how much time elapsed between Jesus’ death and his ascension: “To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.3">Acts 1:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The next key event after the ascension of Jesus into heaven was Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1">Acts 2:1</a>). Pentecost, the Greek word for “fiftieth,” referred to a celebration of the Feast of Weeks/Harvest (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.34.22">Ex 34:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.16.9-12">Dt 16:9-12</a>) 50 days after the Passover. Since Jesus was crucified during the Passover season, the Pentecost of <a href="?bref=Acts.2.1">Acts 2:1</a>, during which the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, took place in <span class="era">AD</span> 29 or 30, some 50 days after the Crucifixion and about 10 days after the Ascension.</p>
<p>After that, events of the early chapters of Acts are hard to date because no precise statements are made about the amount of time between various events. Therefore, the usual method for dating events of the apostolic age is first to find at least one event that can be dated with relative certainty from sources outside the NT; one then dates events before and after that event by figuring out how much time elapsed between them. Sometimes Acts records how much time passed between two events; usually it does not, so dating can only be approximate.</p>
<p>One pivotal starting point is the great famine prophesied by Agabus, which befell Palestine during the reign of the Roman emperor Claudius (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.28-29">Acts 11:28-29</a>). Josephus, who was alive at the time, gives enough information to locate the famine sometime between the years 46 and 48. We also know from the Mishnah, a collection of Jewish laws, that the autumn of 47 to the autumn of 48 was a sabbatical year, when the Jews let the land rest and harvested nothing (cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.25.2-7">Lv 25:2-7</a>). That could have aggravated and prolonged a famine, but one cannot be sure how early the famine started; some scholars propose 46 and some 47.</p>
<p>At first, it seems peculiar that Luke, the author of Acts, should have recorded that famine (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.28">Acts 11:28</a>) before recording the death of Herod Agrippa (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.20-23">12:20-23</a>). From facts reported by Josephus, the death of Herod (a grandson of Herod the Great) can be dated in <span class="era">AD</span> 44, probably in the spring. That means that Herod must have died several years before the famine Luke recorded earlier. Some scholars think that Luke simply got his chronological facts wrong. Others see <a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-24">Acts 12:1-24</a> as a kind of flashback to bring the history of the church in Jerusalem up to date. Such a practice was common among ancient historians, who often followed one source up to a suitable stopping point before moving on to another source. To charge Luke with inaccurate dating, it is argued, is to misunderstand the techniques of historical writing he was using.</p>
<p>Since Herod Agrippa died in <span class="era">AD</span> 44 (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.23">Acts 12:23</a>), the apostle James, whom Herod put to death with the sword (v <a href="?bref=Acts.12.2">2</a>), must have died soon before 44, perhaps during the Passover season of 43 (v <a href="?bref=Acts.12.3">3</a>). The apostle Peter’s imprisonment and his miraculous escape (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.12.3-17">3-17</a>) also belong to that period.</p>
<p>When the Christians of Antioch decided to send relief to the Christians in Jerusalem in the midst of the great famine (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.29">Acts 11:29</a>), Barnabas and Paul were appointed to transport the money to Jerusalem. That was Paul’s second visit to Jerusalem after his conversion. The first visit is recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.26-30">Acts 9:26-30</a>. The third comes in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> when Paul and Barnabas were sent to discuss with the apostles and elders whether gentile converts to Christianity had to be circumcised. How one dates the first and third visits to Jerusalem, as well as Paul’s conversion, depends on how those Jerusalem visits are related to those reported in Paul’s letter to the Galatians.</p>
<p>The basic problem, which still divides NT scholars, is this: In <a href="?bref=Gal.1.15-2.10">Galatians 1:15–2:10</a> Paul recounted that his conversion was followed by two visits to Jerusalem, one three years after his conversion (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.18">1:18</a>) and one 14 years after that (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">2:1-10</a>). All scholars agree that the first visit three years after his conversion is the same as the first visit recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.9.26-30">Acts 9:26-30</a>. Answers differ, however, to the question of whether <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</a> refers to the second (famine) visit to Jerusalem in <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a> (in which case the third visit of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> is the one omitted from Galatians) or whether <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</a> refers to the visit in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> (in which case the famine visit was the one omitted from Galatians).</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TwoPossibleReconstructions"/>
<p>Those who favor the first reconstruction offer six arguments: (1) The reason Paul gave such a rigorous account of his comings and goings in <a href="?bref=Gal.1.15-24">Galatians 1:15-24</a> was to show that he did not get his gospel from men, nor was he taught it (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.12">1:12</a>). In other words, his visits to the Jerusalem apostles were not for the purpose of receiving his gospel. If that is so, for Paul to omit the second Jerusalem visit would jeopardize his integrity and his authority with the Galatians. The first reconstruction avoids that difficulty; omission of a third Jerusalem visit from <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</a> could mean that it had not yet happened when Galatians was written. (2) <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</a> pictures a private meeting between Paul and Barnabas on one hand and the “pillar” apostles on the other. But the meeting in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> was public and before the whole church. Hence <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</a> more likely refers to a private meeting during the visit of <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a>, which Galatians does not record. (3) Paul’s eagerness to give to the poor mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.10">Galatians 2:10</a> connects naturally with the second Jerusalem visit, when he was in fact delivering relief to the poor (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a>). (4) If <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a> recorded the same trip as <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>, one would expect some mention of the decision reached by the Jerusalem Council, especially since that decision related directly to the problem of circumcision that Paul was handling in his Letter to the Galatians. (5) Further, it seems unlikely that the Jerusalem Council preceded the event of <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-21">Galatians 2:11-21</a>, when Peter was rebuked by Paul for withdrawing from fellowship with gentile believers; that incident could hardly have happened so soon after the issue of gentile status in the church had been settled in Jerusalem. (6) According to <a href="?bref=Gal.1.6">Galatians 1:6</a>, the letter was written “quickly” after Paul had established the Galatian churches. That makes sense if Galatians was written soon after the first missionary journey, hence just before the Jerusalem Council of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>; that would make Galatians Paul’s first letter.</p>
<p>Scholars who favor the second reconstruction offer four arguments: (1) The main purpose of Paul’s visit in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Galatians 2:1-10</a> appears to be the same as that in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-20">Acts 15:1-20</a>; both dealt with the issue of whether circumcision should be required of gentile converts (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.3-5">Gal 2:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1,5">Acts 15:1, 5</a>). That similarity is obvious, but there is no such explicit similarity between <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a>. (2) On the basis of form and content Galatians is similar to Romans and to 1 and 2 Corinthians; it would thus seem to come from the same period—considerably later than the Jerusalem Council. If so, it is likely that Paul would have included a reference to the Jerusalem Council (namely <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Gal 2:1-10</a>) in his recollections, since its outcome supported his own stance on circumcision set forth in the letter. (3) <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a> pictures Barnabas as the leader of the Barnabas/Paul team, since his name is given first place (as in <a href="?bref=Acts.12.25">Acts 12:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-2,7">13:1-2, 7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.11.25-26">11:25-26</a>). But in the description Paul gives of the visit in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a>, he sees himself as the leader of the team. Since Acts does picture Paul as the leader from the time of the first missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.9,13,43,46,50">Acts 13:9, 13, 43, 46, 50</a>), including the third Jerusalem visit (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.2">15:2</a>), it is more likely that <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a> records the trip of <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>. (4) Finally, in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.7-8">Galatians 2:7-8</a> Paul was recognized as an apostle to the Gentiles with a standing equal to that of Peter. But if <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a> recorded the events of <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a> and the first missionary journey had not yet occurred, the “pillar” apostles could hardly have recognized Paul’s authority as apostle to the Gentiles. It is more likely that <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-21">Galatians 2</a> followed the first missionary journey, just as <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a> followed the first missionary journey in Acts, and that both refer to the same event.</p>
<p>The significance of those arguments for chronology is that, according to the first view, Paul’s conversion came 17 years before the famine visit of <a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.1.18">Gal 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">2:1</a>). According to the second view, Paul’s conversion took place 17 years before the Jerusalem Council in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15</a>. The difference amounts to only one year, however.</p>
<p>It is helpful to consider one more date that can be fixed with high probability—namely, Paul’s arrival in Corinth on his second missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.1">Acts 18:1</a>). On the second missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.40-18.22">15:40–18:22</a>), Paul and Silas set out on land through Syria, Cilicia, Phrygia, and Galatia, visiting churches founded on the first missionary journey. They came to Troas, then passed over to Philippi and continued down the coast through Thessalonica and Berea. Paul went on to Athens before arriving at Corinth. From <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12">Acts 18:12</a> we know that Gallio was a proconsul in Corinth while Paul was there. An inscription discovered at nearby Delphi indicates that in all likelihood Gallio’s term of office was from mid-51 to mid-52. The incident recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">Acts 18:12-17</a> probably occurred at the beginning of Gallio’s term, since the Jews hoped to get a ruling against Paul from their new proconsul. Not long after that, Paul left Corinth, probably in the summer or autumn of 52. According to <a href="?bref=Acts.18.11">Acts 18:11</a> Paul had spent 18 months in Corinth; that means that he probably arrived in the early months of 50 or the end of 49. That arrival date is confirmed by <a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>, which says that Aquila and Priscilla had only recently been exiled from Rome when Paul came to Corinth. A fifth-century historian, Orosius, dated the edict of Claudius expelling the Jews from Rome in <span class="era">AD</span> 49. Therefore, Paul and Aquila and Priscilla probably arrived close together late in 49 or early in 50. Early in his 18-month stay Paul wrote his First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians.</p>
<p>The two fixed dates, then, are 46 or 47 for the famine visit (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.30">Acts 11:30</a>) and late 49 or early 50 for Paul’s arrival in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.1">Acts 18:1</a>). Taking into account the time gaps mentioned in <a href="?bref=Gal.1.18">Galatians 1:18</a> and <a href="?bref=Gal.2.1">2:1</a>, as well as the supposition that the first missionary journey lasted about a year, the two reconstructions are presented in the following table. Keep in mind that they are approximations and that they reflect the ancient custom of counting a part of a year as a whole year.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="TwoPossibleChronologies"/>
<p class="h2">Events from <span class="era">AD</span> 50 to 70</p>
<p class="fl"><a href="?bref=Acts.24.27">Acts 24:27</a> describes an event that helps us date events in the rest of the book, namely, Porcius Festus’s replacement of Felix as the governor of Judea. A careful analysis of the evidence given by Eusebius, a fourth-century historian, leads to the probable conclusion that Felix was replaced in the summer of 59.</p>
<p>Working backward from that date, Paul’s arrest in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.33">Acts 21:33</a>) must have occurred in 57, some two years before the coming of Festus. More precisely, Paul’s arrest probably occurred in the late spring or summer of 57; Paul’s goal (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.16">20:16</a>) was to arrive in Jerusalem by Pentecost of that year, and Pentecost occurred at the end of May. He was not long in the city before he was arrested.</p>
<p>The Passover festival, 50 days before Pentecost, was celebrated by Paul with the church in Philippi (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.6">Acts 20:6</a>). That would have been April 7–14, <span class="era">AD</span> 57. Only after the feast did he continue his hurried journey to Caesarea and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.6-21.16">20:6–21:16</a>). Before his Passover visit to Philippi, Paul had spent three months in Greece (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.3">20:3</a>). Allowing some time for him to travel through Macedonia and visit the Thessalonians and Bereans, those three months were probably the winter months of 56–57 (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.3">Acts 20:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.6">1 Cor 16:6</a>). No doubt they were spent in the main church of Greece, Corinth, and were used in part for the writing of the Letter to the Romans.</p>
<p>Between Paul’s departure from Corinth on the second missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">Acts 18:18</a>) in the autumn of 51 and his arrival in Corinth on the third missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.2">20:2</a>) in the late winter of 56 are five years of activities that cannot be given exact dates. Paul said that he worked during three of those years in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.31">20:31</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-20.1">19:1–20:1</a>). With enough time allowed for the travels before and after, that stay at Ephesus probably lasted from 52 or 53 to the summer of 55 or 56 (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.8">1 Cor 16:8</a>). During his long stay in Ephesus, Paul wrote his First Letter to the Corinthians. Then, on his way to Corinth in 56, he wrote 2 Corinthians from Macedonia.</p>
<p>Festus arrived as governor in the summer of 59, after Paul had been in prison in Caesarea for two years. Within a matter of days, Paul was tried before Festus (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-12">Acts 25:1-12</a>). Not wanting to be remanded to the Jewish authorities, Paul appealed to Caesar (v <a href="?bref=Acts.25.12">12</a>), which meant that he would go to Rome. The account in Acts gives no hint of a delay, so the voyage most likely began in the summer or fall of 59 (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.2">27:2</a>).</p>
<p>Luke reported that when Paul the prisoner got to Fair Havens on the island of Crete, the weather had become dangerous for sea travel “because the fast had already gone by” (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.8-9">Acts 27:8-9</a>). One ancient writer said that sailing became dangerous between mid-September and mid-November, and after that, impossible until spring. The fast referred to was no doubt the one in preparation for the Day of Atonement, which in the year 59 fell on October 5. It is not surprising that, 14 days after leaving Fair Havens, the ship in which Paul was traveling was wrecked on the coast of Malta, south of Sicily (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.27-44">27-44</a>). Three months later Paul set sail for Rome again in a ship that had spent the winter at Malta (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.11">28:11</a>). Soon he was welcomed into Rome by Christians who came out to meet him (v <a href="?bref=Acts.28.15">15</a>). Thus Paul arrived in Rome in the early part of <span class="era">AD</span> 60. The book of Acts closes with the remark that “For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.28.30">30</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The NT does not report the outcome of his trial. During that period, according to the traditional view, he wrote Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon.</p>
<p>Eusebius wrote, “Tradition has it that after defending himself the Apostle was again sent on the ministry of preaching, and coming a second time to the same city suffered martyrdom under Nero.” Nero, who was the Roman emperor from 54 to 68, put to death a multitude of Christians in Rome soon after a disastrous fire in July of 64, according to the Roman historian Tacitus. A number of early Christian writings (e.g., Clement) seem to indicate that Peter and Paul were both killed in Rome during that savage persecution. If so, and if Eusebius was right, then Paul may have spent the two years from 62 to 64 freely ministering back in the eastern provinces. Many conservative scholars date Paul’s First Letter to Timothy and his Letter to Titus from that period. Written from Rome shortly before Paul’s martyrdom in 64, 2 Timothy was probably his last letter (<a href="?bref=2Tim.2.9">2 Tm 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.4.6">4:6</a>).</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, within three years after Paul had been carried off to Rome, James the brother of Jesus was stoned to death by the Jewish authorities. According to Josephus, that occurred in 62. Not long afterward, according to Eusebius, the church in Jerusalem received a prophecy warning them to leave that doomed city and settle in Pella, one of the cities of the Decapolis (“ten cities”) east of the Jordan. Thus when war broke out between the Jews and the Romans in 66, the Christians for the most part escaped its fury. That war ended in 70 with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.13.2">Mk 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.24">Lk 21:24</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CHURCH</p>
<p class="fl">A group or assembly of persons called together for a particular purpose. The term appears in only two verses in the Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Mt 16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.17">18:17</a>) but frequently in the book of Acts, most of the letters of Paul, as well as most of the remaining NT writings, especially the Revelation of John.</p>
<p>One way of referring to the body of Israel in the OT was simply “the congregation.” Groups claiming to be the true Israel spiritually rather then naturally called themselves “the congregation.” The term was used by the writers of the Dead Sea Scrolls as well as by early Christians; it is the actual meaning of the word “church.” Christians often referred to themselves simply as the church or the congregation (with “of God” being understood). The term could be applied either to all believers in the world or to any local group of them. It meant the total presence of God’s people in a given location. That is why the NT often uses the singular “church” even when many groups of believers are included together (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.31">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1">2 Cor 1:1</a>); the term “churches” is rarely found (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.41">Acts 15:41</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.16.5">16:5</a>). Each group or the whole group was the place where God was present (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Mt 16:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.17">18:17</a>); God had purchased the congregation with the blood of his Son (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.28">Acts 20:28</a>). The use of the word “church” in the NT is also somewhat dependent upon the Greek world. In the Greek world the word translated “church” designated an <span class="ital">assembly</span> of people, a meeting, such as a regularly summoned political body, or simply a <span class="ital">gathering</span> of people. The word is used in such a secular way in <a href="?bref=Acts.19.32,39,41">Acts 19:32, 39, 41</a>.</p>
<p>The specifically Christian usages of this concept vary considerably in the NT. (1) In analogy to the OT, it sometimes refers to a church meeting, as when Paul says to the Christians in Corinth: “When you meet as a church . . .” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.18">1 Cor 11:18</a>). This means that Christians are the people of God especially when they are gathered for worship. (2) In texts such as <a href="?bref=Matt.18.17">Matthew 18:17</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.5.11">Acts 5:11</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.17">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>, and <a href="?bref=Phil.4.15">Philippians 4:15</a>, “church” refers to the entire group of Christians living in one place. Often, the local character of a Christian congregation is emphasized, as in the phrases, “the church in Jerusalem” (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1">Acts 8:1</a>), “in Corinth” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>), “in Thessalonica” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1 Thes 1:1</a>). (3) In other texts, house assemblies of Christians are called churches, such as those who met in the house of Priscilla and Aquila (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.5">Rom 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>). (4) Throughout the NT, “the church” designates the universal church, to which all believers belong (see <a href="?bref=Acts.9.31">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.4">1 Cor 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.22">Eph 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>). Jesus’ first word about the founding of the Christian movement in <a href="?bref=Matt.16.18">Matthew 16:18</a> has this larger meaning: “I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The church, both as a universal reality and in its local, concrete expression, is more specifically designated in Paul’s writings as “the church of God” (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.2">1 Cor 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.32">10:32</a>) or “the churches of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.16">Rom 16:16</a>). In this way a common, secular Greek term receives its distinctive Christian meaning and sets the Christian assembly/ gathering/community apart from all other secular or religious groups.</p>
<p>It is clear from the NT as a whole that the Christian community understood itself as the community of the end time, as the community called into being by God’s end-time act of revelation and divine presence in Jesus of Nazareth. So Paul tells the Christians in Corinth that they are those “upon whom the end of the ages has come” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.11">1 Cor 10:11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). That is, God had visited his creation, had called out of both Judaism and the gentile world a new people, empowered by his Spirit to be present in the world, sharing the Good News (gospel) of his radical, unconditional love for his creation (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-22">Eph 2:11-22</a>). The Gospels tell us that Jesus chose 12 disciples who became the foundation of this new people. The correspondence to the 12 tribes of Israel is clear, and it shows that the church was understood both as grounded in Judaism and as the fulfillment of God’s intention in calling Israel to become “a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth” (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">Is 49:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; <a href="?bref=Rom.11.1-5">Rom 11:1-5</a>). It is this recognition that allows Paul to call this new Gentile-Jewish community, this new creation, “the Israel of God” (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.15-16">Gal 6:15-16</a>). In this new community the traditional barriers of race, social standing, and sex—barriers that divided people from one another and categorized them into inferior and superior classes—are seen to be shattered: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Gal 3:28</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). This one entity is called “the body of Christ.”</p>
<p>Paul is alone among NT writers in speaking of the church as Christ’s body (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.5">Rom 12:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27">1 Cor 12:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.22-23">Eph 1:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.12">4:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16-17">1 Cor 10:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-13">12:12-13</a>), or as “the body” of which Christ is the “head” (<a href="?bref=Eph.4.15">Eph 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.18">Col 1:18</a>). The origin of this way of speaking about the church is not clear. Among a number of suggestions, two are particularly revealing about Paul’s thought: (1) The Damascus road experience. According to the accounts in Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.3-7">9:3-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-11">22:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.12-18">26:12-18</a>), Jesus identifies himself with his persecuted disciples. By persecuting these early Christians, Paul was actually fighting against Christ himself. It is possible that later reflection on this experience led Paul to the conviction that the living Christ was so identified with his community that it could be spoken of as his “body,” that is, the concrete expression of his real presence. (2) The Hebrew concept of corporate solidarity. Paul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>), and his thinking was thoroughly Jewish. In that context, the individual is largely thought of as intimately tied into the nation as a whole; the individual does not have real existence apart from the whole people. At the same time, the entire people can be seen as represented by one individual. Thus, “Israel” is both the name of one individual and the name of a whole people. The “servant” of <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-53.12">Isaiah 42–53</a> can be both an individual (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-4">Is 42:1-4</a>) and the nation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-6">49:1-6</a>). This idea of corporate solidarity (or personality) is the background for the intimate connection Paul makes between “the first Adam” and sinful humanity as well as between “the last (or second) Adam” (Christ) and renewed humanity (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45-49">1 Cor 15:45-49</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-21">Rom 5:12-21</a>).</p>
<p>The reality of the intimate relation between Christ and his church is thus expressed by Paul as the organic unity and integration of the physical body (<a href="?bref=Rom.12.4-8">Rom 12:4-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-27">1 Cor 12:12-27</a>). For Paul, the Lord’s Supper is a specific manifestation of this reality: “The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16b-17">1 Cor 10:16b-17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Since this is the case, Paul goes on to argue, all the functions of the body have their legitimate and rightful place. Division within the body (i.e., the church) reveals that there is something unhealthy within. It is this image of the church as the “body of Christ” that lies behind Paul’s repeated call for and insistence upon unity within the Christian community.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">CHURCH MEETINGS</p>
<p class="fl">The assembling together of the believers. In the NT, the Greek word <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> (usually translated “church”) is used primarily in two ways: (1) to describe a meeting or an assembly, and (2) to designate the people who participate in such assembling together—whether they are actually assembled or not. The NT contains a few places that speak of a secular Greek assembly (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.32,41">Acts 19:32, 41</a>); every other instance speaks of a Christian assembly. Sometimes the word <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> is used to designate the actual meeting together of Christians. This is certainly what Paul intended in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.19,28">1 Corinthians 14:19, 28</a>, and <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.35">35</a>, in that the expression <span class="greek">en ekklesia</span> must mean “in a meeting” and not “in the church.” To translate this phrase “in the church” (as is done in most modern English versions) is misleading, for most readers will think it means “in the church building.” The NT never once names the place of assembly a “church.” Aside from the few instances where the word clearly means the actual meeting together of believers, <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> most often is used as a descriptor for the believers who constitute a local church (such as the church in Corinth, the church in Philippi, and the church in Colosse) or all the believers (past, present, and future) who constitute the universal church, the complete body of Christ.</p>
<p>When reading the NT, Christians need to be aware of the various ways in which the word <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> (“church”) is used. On the most basic level, the <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> is any gathering of believers. On another level, the <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> is an organized local entity—comprised of all the believers in any given locality, under one pluralistic eldership. On another level, the <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> is the universal church whose constituents are all the believers who have ever been, are now existing, and will ever be. The word <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> was used by the NT writers with these various aspects of meaning, though, at times, it is not possible to differentiate one from the other. Nevertheless, students of the NT could avoid some confusion if they used discrimination in their exegesis of the text. Some interpreters have taught that the smallest unit of the church is the local church, but the NT writers sometimes used the word “church” to indicate a small home gathering. Other interpreters confuse the local church with the universal church. But some things in the NT are addressed to a local church that do not necessarily apply to the whole church, and some great things are spoken of the universal church that could never be attained by any particular local group. The things Paul said about the church in the Epistle to the Ephesians (which was written as an encyclical for several churches and not just for the church in Ephesus) could never be attained by a local church. For example, what local church could attain to the fullness of the stature of Christ?</p>
<p>There is much to be said about how interpreters have confused the local church with the universal church, but this article is devoted to clearing up the confusion about what constitutes the smallest unit of the church—the local church, or what could be called the house church or home gathering.</p>
<p>The NT seems to present the fact that a particular local church (i.e., a church comprising all the believers in a given locality under one eldership) could and did have several <span class="greek">ekklesiai</span>—“meetings” or “assemblies” (carried on in homes of the local Christians). Thus, the smallest unit to comprise a “church” was one of these home meetings. However, there is no indication in the NT that each of these home meetings had its own eldership or was a distinct entity separate from the other gatherings <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">ekklesiai</span><span class="ital">)</span> in the same locality. According to <a href="?bref=Acts.14.23">Acts 14:23</a> and <a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Titus 1:5</a>, elders were appointed for every local church (compare the expressions “appointed elders in every church” and “appoint elders in every city”)—not for every house church. Nevertheless, it appears that every local church of some size had several such <span class="greek">ekklesiai</span> (“meetings”) going on within that locality.</p>
<p>The church in Jerusalem must have had several home meetings (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.46">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.42">5:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.3">8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.5,12">12:5, 12</a>), as did the church in Rome (see <a href="?bref=Rom.16.3-5,14-15">Rom 16:3-5, 14-15</a> and comments below). A small local church may have had only one home gathering—as was probably the case with the church at Colosse (see <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.2">Phlm 1:2</a> and comments below), but this would have been impossible for large local churches like those in Jerusalem, Rome, and Ephesus, in which there must have been several “house churches” (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19-20">1 Cor 16:19-20</a> [1 Cor was written from Ephesus] and comments below). An examination of the passages that deal with the issue of the “house church” should affirm this. These passages are <a href="?bref=Rom.16.3-5,14-15">Romans 16:3-5, 14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19-20">1 Corinthians 16:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.15-16">Colossians 4:15-16</a>; and <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1-2">Philemon 1:1-2</a> (all quoted from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2"><a href="?bref=Rom.16.3-5,14-15">Romans 16:3-5, 14-15</a></p>
<p class="fl">In the last chapter of Romans, Paul asked the believers in Rome, to whom he had written this epistle, to greet Priscilla and Aquila and the church that met in their home (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.3-5">16:3-5</a>). The entire church in Rome could not have met in Priscilla and Aquila’s home, for the church was much too large to have assembled in a single home. Rather, the church in Priscilla and Aquila’s home must have been one among several such “house churches” in Rome. The following discussion should substantiate this position.</p>
<p>Paul’s Epistle to the Romans was addressed to “all God’s beloved in Rome” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.7">1:7</a>), not to “the church in Rome.” At the time of writing, Paul had not been to Rome—nor had any other apostle. The church was probably started there by Jewish Romans who had been converted during their visit to Jerusalem during Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>) and then returned to Rome. Since the church had not been started by an apostle, it could have been that there were no “ordained” elders in the church at Rome and that there were several gatherings of believers in various parts of Rome and its suburbs. Paul knew some of the saints in Rome (whom he addressed by name in the last chapter) and thus addressed an epistle to all the saints in that locality, instead of to the church in that locality—which was his usual practice (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1">1 Cor 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1">2 Cor 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.1">1 Thes 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.1.1">2 Thes 1:1</a>). Nonetheless, “all the saints in Rome” would comprise “the church in Rome” (cf. <a href="?bref=Phil.1.1">Phil 1:1</a>, in which Paul addressed his epistle to all the saints in Philippi).</p>
<p>In the final chapter of Romans, Paul asks all the believers in Rome (which equals the “local” church in Rome) to greet the church in Priscilla and Aquila’s house. Later in the chapter, Paul asks the church to greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers with them; and then again he asks the church to greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, Olympas, and all the saints with them (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.14-15">16:14-15</a>). Evidently, Paul was identifying two other groups of believers who must have met together. (And perhaps Paul was referring to two more groups in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.10-11">16:10-11</a>, which in the Greek could mean the ones of Aristobulus’s and Narcissus’s <span class="ital">households</span> or the ones of their <span class="ital">fellowships.</span>) It seems that the church in Rome, like the church in Jerusalem and Ephesus, had several home <span class="greek">ekklesiai</span> (meetings).</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Romans was written around <span class="era">AD</span> 58. The Neronian persecution began around <span class="era">AD</span> 64. Secular historians such as Tacitus tell us that a vast multitude <span class="ital">(ingens multitudo)</span> of Christians were tortured and killed during this persecution (<span class="ital">Annals</span> 15.44). Seutonius (in his book <span class="ital">Nero,</span> ch 16) said that the rapid increase of the Christians in Rome had made them unpopular. Indeed, at the time Paul penned the Epistle to the Romans he said their faith was known throughout the world (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.8">1:8</a>), which indicates that the church in Rome had already made an impact on the Mediterranean world. When Paul came to Rome three years later (<span class="era">AD</span> 61), he came to a city that had a large church there already. From <a href="?bref=Rom.15.23">Romans 15:23</a>, we know that the church had been in existence for many years even before Paul wrote his epistle to them. In short, the church in Rome was a large church around the time Paul wrote his epistle to them. The entire church could not have met in the home of Aquila and Priscilla, who would have had only a modest-sized dwelling (for they were tentmakers). Besides, Paul greeted over 25 individuals by name in chapter <a href="?bref=Rom.16.1-27">16</a>—and he had not yet even been to Rome!</p>
<p>There must have been several <span class="greek">ekklesiai</span> in Rome, i.e., several home churches all unified as the one local church in Rome. For example, the Christians in Rome apparently worshiped in numerous homes such as Priscilla and Aquila’s. Other churches in homes are mentioned in <a href="?bref=Col.4.15">Colossians 4:15</a> and <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.2">Philemon 1:2</a>. Groups of Christians met in houses of prominent believers or in other available rooms (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.16">Mt 26:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.12">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19">1 Cor 16:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.15">Col 4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.2">Phlm 1:2</a>). The church in Priscilla and Aquila’s house is the first of five groups of believers in Paul’s list, but the only one referred to definitely as a church (see <a href="?bref=Rom.16.5,10-11,14-15">Rom 16:5, 10-11, 14-15</a>). Priscilla and Aquila opened their home for Christian meetings. The church mentioned there was obviously only a part of the total number of Christians in Rome. Verses <a href="?bref=Rom.16.10-11">10-11</a> and <a href="?bref=Rom.16.14-15">14-15</a> seem to refer to two other household churches in Rome. Apparently, there were at least three churches there, and probably more. Each house church could not have been a separate entity with a separate church government; rather, each house church must have been simply one home meeting of some of the saints in the one local church at Rome.</p>
<p class="h2"><a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19-20">1 Corinthians 16:19-20</a></p>
<p class="fl">In this passage we again see Aquila and Priscilla and again discover that a church met in their house. According to Romans, their house church was, of course, in Rome. According to 1 Corinthians (written from Ephesus), their house church was in Ephesus. Many scholars think Aquila and Priscilla left Rome around <span class="era">AD</span> 49 at the time of Claudius’s edict expelling Jews from Rome. They very well could have already been Christians at this time. According to <a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-28">Acts 18</a>, they joined Paul in Corinth (where they all worked together in their craft of tentmaking) and then went on with him to Ephesus, during the time (around <span class="era">AD</span> 51) the church in Ephesus was first established. Paul continued on with his second missionary journey, while Aquila and Priscilla remained in Ephesus. No doubt, the early church there first met in their home. Paul returned to Ephesus a few years later and remained there for two years (around <span class="era">AD</span> 53–54). During this time, Paul’s proclamation of the gospel went out from Ephesus (as a center) to all of Asia Minor (see <a href="?bref=Acts.19.8-10">Acts 19:8-10</a>). As this was going on, the church in Ephesus grew (see vv <a href="?bref=Acts.19.18-20">18-20</a>).</p>
<p>It was during these years that Paul wrote to the Corinthians, in which he sent greetings from the churches in Asia, from Aquila and Priscilla—and the church in their house, and from all the brothers (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19-20">1 Cor 16:19-20</a>). In giving this kind of greeting, it seems that Paul was sending greetings from (1) all the churches in Asia Minor, (2) the church in Ephesus (equivalent to “all the brothers”), and (3) those believers who gathered with Aquila and Priscilla in their home. It would be hard to imagine that all the saints in Ephesus met at Aquila and Priscilla’s home. The church probably began that way, but as it grew, so did the number of home meetings. From other portions of the NT (specifically 1 Timothy, which was written around <span class="era">AD</span> 64 by Paul to Timothy while Timothy was leading the church in Ephesus), we discover that there must have been several home meetings in Ephesus because there were so many saints there (see <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.1-6.21">1 Timothy 5–6</a>, which reveal that there must have been a large number of saints in Ephesus—young men, young women, older men, widows, and so forth). At any rate, several saints must have hosted an <span class="greek">ekklesia</span><span class="ital">,</span> a meeting, in their home. (Aquila and Priscilla left Ephesus around <span class="era">AD</span> 56/57 and returned to Rome, where again they hosted a church in their home. Others in Ephesus would have to open their homes.) But each such <span class="greek">ekklesia</span> did not have its own eldership; rather, all of the church in Ephesus was under one eldership—headed up by Timothy, Paul’s coworker.</p>
<p class="h2"><a href="?bref=Col.4.15-16">Colossians 4:15-16</a></p>
<p class="fl">In this portion, we again read about a church existing in the home of one called Nymphas. In his final remarks to the church in Colosse, Paul asked the saints in Colosse to send his greetings to (1) the brothers that are in Laodicea, (2) Nymphas in particular, and (3) the church in Nymphas’s house. According to the structure of <a href="?bref=Col.4.15">Colossians 4:15</a>, it seems evident that the first greeting included all the believers in Laodicea (a neighboring church to Colosse), who would comprise the entire church in Laodicea (called “the church of the Laodiceans” in <a href="?bref=Col.4.16">Col 4:16</a>), and that the second and third greetings were to a specific individual (Nymphas) in the church in Laodicea and a church meeting in Nymphas’s house. This church meeting in Nymphas’s house would probably be one of several home meetings—all part of the one local church in Laodicea.</p>
<p>There is a textual problem in this passage that could have some effect on the interpretation of it. Some manuscripts read “his house”; others read “her house”; still others read “their house.” Because it cannot be determined from the Greek text whether Nymphas was male or female, various scribes used different pronouns before “house.” Between the readings “her” and “his,” it is far more likely that the pronoun “her” was changed to “his” than vice versa. Some scholars say that “their” refers to “the brothers” at Laodicea. But that does not make sense if we understand that “the brothers in Laodicea” is equal to the church in Laodicea. How could the church in Laodicea have the church in their house? Other scholars indicate that the Greek word for “their” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">auton</span><span class="ital">)</span> refers to the ones with Nymphas—i.e., the members of his household. Whether the reading was “her house” or “their house,” a particular group of believers within the church of Laodicea met there. Their meeting could legitimately be called an <span class="greek">ekklesia</span>—an assembling together.</p>
<p class="h2"><a href="?bref=Phlm.1.1-2">Philemon 1:1-2</a></p>
<p class="fl">This is the last time in the NT we read about a church in a particular home. Paul wrote a short epistle to Philemon, an elder of the church in Colosse, on behalf of Onesimus, Philemon’s runaway slave converted by Paul to Christ. In his introduction to this short epistle, Paul sends his greetings to Philemon, Apphia, Archippus, and the church in Philemon’s house. It is important to note that Paul did not send greetings to all the saints in Colosse and then to the church in Philemon’s house (as is the pattern in <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.19-20">1 Cor 16:19-20</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.4.15">Col 4:15</a>); instead, he just sent greetings to Philemon and to the church in his house. Therefore, we can assume that the entire church in Colosse must have met at Philemon’s house.</p>
<p class="h2">Worship in the Home Meetings and Church Meetings</p>
<p class="fl">When the church first began in Jerusalem, the believers met in homes for fellowship and worship. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.42-47">Acts 2:42-47</a> tells us that the early Christians met in homes to hear the apostles’ teachings and to celebrate Communion (which is called “the breaking of bread”). During such gatherings, the Christians often shared meals with one another in what was called a love feast (<a href="?bref=2Pet.2.13">2 Pt 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.12">Jude 1:12</a>). At these meetings, the Christians recited Scripture, sang hymns and psalms, and joyfully praised the Lord (see <a href="?bref=Eph.5.18-20">Eph 5:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.16-17">Col 3:16-17</a>). Christians also gathered together in homes to pray (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.12">Acts 12:12</a>) and read the Word.</p>
<p>Small groups of believers met in homes for worship quite regularly; in a city where there were several such <span class="greek">ekklesiai</span><span class="ital">,</span> all the believers would gather together for special occasions. Scripture tells us that all the believers would come together to hear an epistle from the apostles read out loud (see <a href="?bref=Acts.15.30">Acts 15:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.16">Col 4:16</a>), and we can surmise from the NT record that all the Christians in a city met together once a week on Sunday, which was called the Lord’s Day. First Corinthians provides several insights about how the early Christians worshiped together when all the believers in one city met together. We know that 1 Corinthians pertains to this larger gathering because in <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.20">11:20</a> Paul spoke of all the believers coming together in one place and in <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.23">14:23</a> he spoke of the whole church coming together in one place.</p>
<p>Paul used this epistle to correct the Corinthians’ behavior in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.17-34">1 Cor 11:17-34</a>) and in the exercising of spiritual gifts during church meetings (ch <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.1-40">14</a>). Paul’s adjustments reveal his perceptions of a model Christian meeting, and his preceptions were probably developed from actual experience in other church meetings. Paul urged the Corinthians to celebrate the Lord’s Supper together in a manner that reflected Jesus’ institution of that meal. They were to remember the Lord and his death for them, and they were to partake of the bread and wine with all seriousness. At the same time, they were to be conscious of the fact that they were members of the same body of Christ—joined to one another, and also to Christ.</p>
<p>According to Paul’s presentation in chapter <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.1-40">14</a>, this “body consciousness” should be evident in the way the believers worshiped together. One’s personal experience and liberty should not hinder the coordination of the body in worshiping God corporately. Thus, when the believers exercised their spiritual gifts—whether it be prophesying, speaking in tongues, providing interpretations of the tongues, or teaching—it should be done in good order and for the edification of the congregation, not personal edification. When all the church assembled together to worship God, it should be a display of spiritual unity.</p>

<p class="fl">Province of the Roman Empire, located in southeastern Asia Minor. Its capital was Tarsus, Paul’s hometown (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.39">Acts 21:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">22:3</a>), hence permitting Paul Roman citizenship (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37">16:37</a>) even though he was a Jew.</p>
<p>Jewish presence in the area probably dated to the time when Antiochus the Great settled 2,000 Jewish families in the Asia Minor regions of Lydia and Phrygia in the second century <span class="era">BC</span> (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 12.3.4).</p>
<p>In antiquity Cilicia (called Kue in OT times) formed a bridge between the country now known as Turkey and Syria, its neighbor to the southeast. Geographically the country was divided between Cilicia Tracheia, the mountainous region in the western half, and Cilicia Pedias, the lovely plains to the east. Entrance into Turkey (ancient Asia Minor) was possible through the Cilician Gates, a narrow pass in the Taurus Mountains. Cilicia Pedias was early attached to the province of Syria (c. 38 <span class="era">BC</span>) and was known in the NT times as Syria and Cilicia (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.21">Gal 1:21</a>). The western part, Cilicia Tracheia, was given by Mark Antony to Cleopatra in 36 <span class="era">BC</span>, but by the time of Paul, it was ruled by the Hellenist king Antiochus IV of Commagene (<span class="era">AD</span> 38–72). In <span class="era">AD</span> 72 the two areas were unified into one Roman province, called Cilicia, by the Roman emperor Vespasian.</p>
<p>Jews from Cilicia participated in the persecution of Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>). After his conversion to Christianity, Paul eventually returned to Tarsus, later accompanying Barnabas to Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.25-26">Acts 11:25-26</a>). Syria and Cilicia thus became the first major center of non-Jewish Christianity, and from this region Christianity spread to the rest of the gentile population of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class="fl">Surgical removal of the foreskin of the male reproductive organ. In Bible times circumcision was the seal of God’s covenant with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-14">Gn 17:1-14</a>). While circumcision originated as an ancient tribal or religious rite, since the early part of this century it has been practiced in Western nations for hygienic purposes. Many physicians believe that circumcision helps prevent genital cancers in both men and their wives, so that this minor operation is performed a few days after birth on nearly all newborn males in North America. Outside of Judaism the procedure no longer carries religious significance.</p>

<p class="h2" id="CircumcisionintheAncientWorld">Circumcision in the Ancient World</p>
<p class="fl">The rite of circumcision is far older than the Hebrew people. Cave paintings give evidence that it was practiced in prehistoric times. Egyptian temple drawings show that the operation was common in 4000 <span class="era">BC</span> and probably earlier. Peoples practicing circumcision lived on almost every continent. The rite was observed among Central and South American Indians, Polynesians, the peoples of New Guinea, many Australian and African tribes, Egyptians, and pre-Islamic Arabs. The rite is not mentioned in the Koran, but because Muhammad was circumcised, tradition dictates that male Muslims follow the ancient custom. Arab ancestry is traced to Abraham through Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.20">Gn 17:20</a>), so a common age for Muslim circumcisions is 13, because Ishmael was circumcised at that age (v <a href="?bref=Gen.17.25">25</a>).</p>
<p>Among the West Semitic people, the Ammonites, Edomites, Midianites, Moabites, and Phoenicians all practiced circumcision (<a href="?bref=Jer.9.25-26">Jer 9:25-26</a>). The Philistines, however, did not (<a href="?bref=Judg.14.3">Jgs 14:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.18">15:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.14.6">1 Sm 14:6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.17.26,36">17:26, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.25,27">18:25, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.31.4">31:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.20">2 Sm 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.14">3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.10.4">1 Chr 10:4</a>).</p>
<p>Young men were usually circumcised at puberty, evidently in preparation for marriage and entrance into full tribal responsibilities. The Hebrews were the only ancient practitioners of circumcision to observe the rite in infancy, thus freeing it from association with fertility rituals.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CircumcisionintheOldTestament">Circumcision in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the Bible the practice of circumcision began in <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">Genesis 17</a> as a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham. God promised Abraham a land and, through a son yet to be conceived, numerous descendants, from whom kings would come. Blessings would come upon Abraham and through him to all nations (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>). After the covenant was formally inaugurated (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">15</a>), God sealed it, ordering Abraham to be circumcised along with all the males in his household (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-13">17:9-13</a>).</p>
<p>Circumcision was to be an expression of faith that God’s promises would be realized. Because Abraham’s faith had lapsed (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-16">Gn 16</a>) even after he had seen the awesome display of God’s majesty (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.9-17">15:9-17</a>), a permanent reminder of God’s covenant promises was placed on his body and the bodies of his male descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.11">17:11</a>). This sign was so closely related to God’s covenant promise that the rite itself could be termed the “covenant” (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.10">Gn 17:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>).</p>
<p>Circumcision was to be performed on the eighth day after birth (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.12">Gn 17:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.12.1-3">Lv 12:1-3</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.21.4">Gn 21:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.59">Lk 1:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.21">2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>), customarily by the boy’s father (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.23">Gn 17:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.21.4">21:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>), at which time a name would be given (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.59">Lk 1:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.21">2:21</a>). Flint knives were used in the early days (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.25">Ex 4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.2-3">Jos 5:2-3</a>). Later, the rite was carried out by a trained practitioner called a <span class="hebrew">mohel</span><span class="ital">.</span> Medical research has determined that prothrombin, a substance in the blood that aids in clotting, is present in greater quantity on the eighth day than at any other time in life.</p>
<p class="h3">Theological Meaning</p>
<p class="fl">Circumcision had to do with the fulfillment of God’s promise concerning Abraham’s descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-12">Gn 17:9-12</a>). Because it was applied to the reproductive organ, the sign involved the propagation of the race. Its application to the eight-day-old infant demonstrates the gracious character of God’s promise to Abraham’s descendants and indicates that God’s people are in need of cleansing grace from birth (<a href="?bref=Lev.12.1-3">Lv 12:1-3</a>). The promises of the covenant were reaffirmed to each generation before the recipients were able to respond in either faith or unbelief; nothing in the hearts of the chosen people could either bring about or thwart the ultimate fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham and his posterity.</p>
<p>Circumcision also had to do with the fulfillment of God’s promise concerning the land (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.8">Gn 17:8</a>). The land was God’s holy possession, and the Israelites had to be holy to possess it. When Joseph and his descendants were in Egypt, they continued to circumcise their sons. But following the great sin at Mt Sinai after the exodus, the unbelieving Israelites failed to place the covenant sign upon their children as they wandered in the wilderness. Because the new generation had not been circumcised, the people were unprepared to enter the Promised Land. Therefore, God ordered Joshua to circumcise the men of Israel. The people’s obedient response was an act of faith, since the armies of the enemy were camped nearby as the Israelite warriors lay incapacitated by the surgery (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.2-9">Jos 5:2-9</a>).</p>
<p>From the beginning, participation in the covenant promises was open to persons outside Abraham’s household (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.12-13">Gn 17:12-13</a>). <a href="?bref=Exod.12.43-49">Exodus 12:43-49</a> gives non-Israelites the opportunity to participate in the Passover if they are willing to fulfill the same stipulation placed upon the Jews—that of circumcision.</p>
<p>The provision for admission to God’s people by reception of the covenant sign was abused by Jacob’s sons when circumcision was made a precondition for intermarriage with the Shechemites. While the Shechemites were disabled by their wounds, Simeon and Levi killed them, plundering the city to exact retribution for the rape of their sister Dinah (<a href="?bref=Gen.34.1-31">Gn 34</a>).</p>
<p>The sign of the covenant was not to be treated lightly. The penalty of excommunication rested upon the uncircumcised (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.14">Gn 17:14</a>). The strange incident recorded in <a href="?bref=Exod.4.24-26">Exodus 4:24-26</a> seems to have been God’s reminder to Moses of the stipulations of the covenant made with Abraham. Moses had proved an unfaithful servant of the Lord by neglecting to circumcise his son but was rescued from judgment when his wife Zipporah took a flint rock and circumcised the boy, throwing the bloody foreskin at her husband’s feet.</p>

<p class="h2" id="CircumcisionintheNewTestament">Circumcision in the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">John the Baptist was circumcised, as were Jesus and Paul (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.59">Lk 1:59</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.21">2:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>). Jesus recognized the cleansing significance of circumcision (<a href="?bref=John.7.22-23">Jn 7:22-23</a>), contrasting the rite with his healing ministry that made a man completely well and therefore ceremonially “clean.” Just before he was stoned, Stephen referred to the covenant of circumcision, charging that his Jewish accusers, like their ancestors, were stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, always resisting the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.8,51">Acts 7:8, 51</a>).</p>
<p>For a time the first Christians continued to participate in the Jewish rites and customs, even attending the services of the temple (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.5.21,42">5:21, 42</a>). As Gentiles came to Christ, controversy arose between those who said that participation in the covenant community required circumcision and those who believed the rite was unnecessary. It was argued that since the covenant promise of the Messiah was given to the Jews, Gentiles must first be circumcised and become Jews before they could receive salvation in Christ.</p>
<p>In the time of Christ, many Jews misunderstood the significance of circumcision, believing that the physical act was necessary for and a guarantee of salvation. Thus for Jews the observance became not only a symbol of religious privilege but also a source of racial pride (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.4-6">Phil 3:4-6</a>). These Jews associated the ceremony with the Mosaic law rather than the promise to Abraham (<a href="?bref=John.7.22">Jn 7:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.1">Acts 15:1</a>). Because Greeks and Romans did not practice circumcision, Jews had come to be called “the circumcision” (<span class="sc">kjv</span> <a href="?bref=Acts.10.45">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.2">11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.8">Rom 15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.7-9">Gal 2:7-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11">Eph 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.10">Ti 1:10</a>), and following OT practice (<a href="?bref=Ezek.28.10">Ez 28:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.31.18">31:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.32.19-32">32:19-32</a>), Gentiles were termed “the uncircumcision” (<span class="sc">kjv</span> <a href="?bref=Gal.2.7">Gal 2:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.11">Eph 2:11</a>).</p>
<p>While visiting Caesarea, Jewish believers were amazed to realize that uncircumcised Gentiles received the purifying gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.44-48">Acts 10:44-48</a>). Moses had promised that God would circumcise the hearts of his people to love the Lord with heart and soul (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.6">Dt 30:6</a>), and Ezekiel had prophesied that the Lord would sprinkle clean water on his people, giving them a new heart and putting his Spirit within them (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25-27">Ez 36:25-27</a>). As these Jewish believers saw the prophecy that God would pour out his Spirit upon all flesh (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.17">Acts 2:17</a>) being fulfilled, they realized that the inward reality symbolized by circumcision could be accomplished without the physical sign. Thus, the gentile believers were immediately baptized.</p>
<p>Not all the Jewish believers were immediately willing to accept Gentiles into the church. When Peter returned to Jerusalem after his visit to Caesarea, “the circumcision party” criticized him. But after telling how the Spirit had fallen upon the Gentiles, Peter declared that he could not stand against God. At this the Jewish believers were silenced and glorified God that repentance unto life had been granted to Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.1-3,15">Acts 11:1-3, 15:8</a>).</p>
<p>Certain “Judaizers” of the Pharisaic party taught the Christians in Antioch that circumcision was necessary for salvation (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1,5">Acts 15:1, 5</a>). After debating these persons, Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to consult with the other apostles and elders (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.2">2</a>). Peter argued that God had given the Spirit to Gentiles and “cleansed their hearts by faith,” affirming that “we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will” (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.8-9">8-9</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.15.11">11</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Therefore, James and the other Jerusalem leaders agreed that circumcision should not be imposed on the Gentiles (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.13-21">13-21</a>).</p>
<p>It was decided that Peter, James, and John would be entrusted with the gospel to “the circumcised,” while Paul and Barnabas would preach to “the uncircumcised” (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.7-9">Gal 2:7-9</a>). Because of his evangelistic policy to be “all things to all people” with respect to spiritually indifferent matters of custom (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.19-23">1 Cor 9:19-23</a>), Paul had Timothy circumcised. Timothy was reckoned by Jews as one of their race because his mother was Jewish (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-2">Acts 16:1-2</a>). But Paul resisted attempts to have Titus circumcised, since he was a Gentile (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.3">Gal 2:3</a>). Paul apparently allowed Jewish believers to circumcise their sons (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.21">Acts 21:21</a>).</p>
<p>Yet Paul charged that those who argued that the Galatian Christians must be circumcised and keep the law did not keep it themselves but wanted to boast in the Galatians’ flesh and avoid persecution for the cross of Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.12-13">Gal 6:12-13</a>)—persecution Paul was willing to bear (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.11">5:11</a>). Granting for the sake of argument the Pharisaic assumption that salvation could be merited by keeping the law, Paul declared that those who received circumcision must obey every other Jewish law (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.5.2-3">2-3</a>). Christ would be “of no advantage” to those who “would be justified by the law”; this attempt at works righteousness would evidence that the Galatians were “severed from Christ,” having “fallen from grace” (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.5.2-4">2-4</a>). These Christians were being tempted to turn to “a different gospel” (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.6-7">1:6-7</a>).</p>
<p>Because of the serious threat the Judaizers posed to the gospel of free grace, Paul wished that those who unsettled the Galatians would “mutilate themselves” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.12">Gal 5:12</a>). He termed the Judaizers “dogs” and “evil workers” (<span class="sc">kjv</span> “concision”), asserting that Christians are “the true circumcision,” because they worship God in spirit and glory in Christ Jesus, putting no confidence in human works to merit salvation (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.2-3">Phil 3:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>Paul taught that circumcision was indeed of value to Jews, for it was the sign that to them had been committed the “oracles of God,” that is, God’s word concerning the promise of salvation (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.1-3">Rom 3:1-3</a>). He reminded the prideful Ephesians that as Gentiles they had once been “strangers to the covenants of promise,” not bearing the covenant sign in their flesh (<a href="?bref=Eph.2.11-12">Eph 2:11-12</a>; see <a href="?bref=Col.2.13">Col 2:13</a>). Likewise, Jews had no cause for pride, for disobedience could cause outward circumcision to be counted as uncircumcision (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.25">Rom 2:25</a>).</p>
<p>Paul and the other apostles followed Moses and the OT prophets in teaching that true circumcision was a matter of the heart. The teaching of the NT goes further to affirm that a faithful believer, though physically uncircumcised, is regarded by God as circumcised, “for he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical” (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.28">Rom 2:28</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Both Jews and Gentiles are saved by grace (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.11">Acts 15:11</a>), and circumcised and uncircumcised alike are justified on the ground of their faith, apart from works of the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.28-30">Rom 3:28-30</a>).</p>
<p>Abraham served as an example of a person whose faith was reckoned to him as righteousness (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.3">Rom 4:3</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gn 15:6</a>). Paul argued that both Gentiles and Jews are justified by faith, because Abraham was accounted righteous before he was circumcised. Abraham did not receive circumcision to obtain righteousness, but as a sign or seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Thus, Abraham is the father of all who believe without being circumcised, as well as those who are circumcised but also follow the example of Abraham’s faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.9-12">Rom 4:9-12</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-9">Gal 3:6-9</a>).</p>

<p>Leaky or abandoned cisterns were often used as burial, torture, or prison chambers. For example, the dungeon into which the prophet Jeremiah was lowered was an abandoned muddy cistern (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.6">Jer 38:6</a>). Ishmael threw the bodies of 70 murdered men into a large cistern originally constructed by King Asa for a wartime water supply (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.4-9">41:4-9</a>).</p>
<p>Cisterns were vitally important in the arid Near East. King Uzziah of Judah is described as hewing out many cisterns in areas where springs or wells were lacking (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.10">2 Chr 26:10</a>). An Assyrian general taunting King Hezekiah and his people promised that, if they would submit, everyone would drink the water of his own cistern (<a href="?bref=Isa.36.16">Is 36:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.31">2 Kgs 18:31</a>).

  <title>Cities of Refuge</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CITIES OF REFUGE</p>
<p class="fl">Six cities, three in Canaan and three in Transjordan (area east of the Jordan River), designated as places of safety for persons suspected of manslaughter. The six cities were among the 48 assigned to the Levites (<a href="?bref=Num.35.6">Nm 35:6</a>). The three Transjordanian cities were Bezer, Ramoth, and Golan (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.43">Dt 4:43</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.20.8">Jos 20:8</a>). The three cities west of the Jordan were Kedesh, Shechem, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.7">Jos 20:7</a>). They were distributed so that east of the Jordan, Golan was located in the north, Ramoth in the center, and Bezer in the south. West of the Jordan, Kedesh, Shechem, and Hebron were located north, center, and south respectively. That made it possible for an accused manslayer to reach a city of refuge quickly.</p>
<p>In ancient Israel the nearest relative of a murder victim was required to take the life of the murderer (<a href="?bref=Num.35.19-21">Nm 35:19-21</a>). It was his duty to the widow, other family members, and to society. Murderers were not allowed to live, and there was no way to ransom them (v <a href="?bref=Num.35.31">31</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="CitiesofRefuge"/>
<p>Accidental death, however, was another matter. Manslaughter without malice or premeditation had a special provision in the law of Moses. A man who accidentally killed someone could flee to the nearest city of refuge, where the local authorities would grant him asylum (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.4-6">Dt 19:4-6</a>). When the case came to court, if the man was found guilty of premeditated murder, he was handed over for execution (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.11-12">19:11-12</a>). If the death was deemed accidental, the person was acquitted. Nevertheless, he had to pay a penalty. The manslayer had to stay in the city of refuge as long as the current high priest was in office (<a href="?bref=Num.35.22-28">Nm 35:22-28</a>). That would be a considerable hardship in some cases. It meant either separation from one’s family or the expense and risk of moving from one’s ancestral land and trying to make a livelihood in a new city.</p>

  <title>Cities of the Plain</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CITIES OF THE PLAIN</p>
<p class="fl">Group of five cities in the plain or basin of the Jordan River which were also referred to as “cities of the valley.” Since the region in which these cities were located was particularly fruitful, it attracted Abraham’s nephew Lot when the growing size of the flocks and herds forced a division of these two patriarchal communities (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.10-12">Gn 13:10-12</a>). The cities are enumerated as Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela or Zoar. Evidently each was a city-state with its own king.</p>
<p>These cities entered the biblical narrative in four connections. (1) They provided a region where Lot could settle; he ultimately decided to make his home in Sodom. (2) The five kings of the cities of the plain fought with a superior force led by four kings of lands far to the east. In the struggle they were defeated and their cities ransacked. The plunder was great, as was the number of captives, especially women and children (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.1-24">Gn 14</a>). Since Lot was among those carried off, Abraham felt an obligation to launch a rescue operation. In this he was immensely successful, recovering not only Lot but also the other captives and the booty. (3) The wicked cities of the plain later came in for God’s judgment. Their evil was so great that Abraham’s intercession on their behalf was to no avail (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.22-33">Gn 18:22-33</a>). Their depravity is illustrated by the account of the homosexual mob at Lot’s door in Sodom (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">19</a>). Soon thereafter, Lot and his family were ordered to flee before the cities were wiped out. Brimstone and fire obliterated the cities, changing the composition of the whole area. (4) References to the destruction of these cities appear in numerous passages in both the OT and NT to serve as a warning of divine punishment for sin (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.9">Is 3:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.50.40">Jer 50:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.46-56">Ez 16:46-56</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.15">Mt 10:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.9.29">Rom 9:29</a>).</p>

  <title>Citizenship</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CITIZENSHIP</p>
<p class="fl">In NT usage (1) designation of belonging to the city or city-state where one was born and reared, and (2) status of sharing in the privileges and responsibilities of the Roman Empire. Thus the apostle Paul claimed to be a citizen of both Tarsus (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.39">Acts 21:39</a>) and Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.27-28">22:27-28</a>).</p>
<p>The right of Roman citizenship most commonly was acquired by birth, as was true of Paul. The status of a child whose parents were married was determined by the status of the father at the time of conception. The status of a child born out of wedlock was determined by that of the mother at the child’s birth. Slaves automatically became citizens when freed by their masters. Although known as “freedmen,” they were often denied the rights of regular freeborn citizens. Greedy magistrates frequently sold the right of citizenship for a high price. The tribune Claudius Lysias received his citizenship in that manner (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.28">Acts 22:28</a>). Citizen rights could also be granted by treaty or imperial declaration. Following the Social War (about 90–85 <span class="era">BC</span>), citizenship was granted to all the inhabitants of Italy. Julius Caesar extended the right to colonies in Gaul (France) and provinces in Asia Minor. According to the census of the emperor Augustus (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1">Lk 2:1</a>), there were approximately 4,233,000 Roman citizens at the time of Christ’s birth. By the time of Paul’s ministry, the number had reached 6,000,000.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="WhereAreTheseCities"/>
<p>Roman citizens were often required to give proof of their citizenship. That was usually accomplished by reference to the census archives, where the name of every citizen was recorded. In addition, freeborn citizens possessed a small wooden birth certificate containing information about their status at birth. Military documents and taxation tables also carried the names of registered citizens. Further, every Roman citizen had three names, whereas noncitizens generally had only one.</p>
<p>The rights of Roman citizenship were extensive, including the right to vote; to hold office; to serve in the military; to purchase, possess, sell, and bequeath property; to enter into a legal contract; to have a fair trial; and to appeal to Caesar. Thus Paul, upon mention of his Roman citizenship, received an apology from magistrates at Philippi for having imprisoned him without a trial (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.38-39">Acts 16:38-39</a>). He also avoided a scourging in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.24-29">22:24-29</a>) and was able to request a trial before Caesar (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.10-12">25:10-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.26.32">26:32</a>).</p>

The emphasis upon walls (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.29-31">Lv 25:29-31</a>) and fortifications (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.35">Jos 19:35</a>), with repeated references to towers, gates, and sieges, indicates that cities provided the primary security for the surrounding towns and villages.</p>

<p class="fl">The existence of settled communities depended upon a controlled food supply. In contrast to the city dweller, the nomad lived in a portable tent, appropriate for a never-ceasing search for food. The contrast between settled city life and the nomadic experience is illustrated by a NT reference to the seminomadic Abraham: “He looked forward to the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.10">Heb 11:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">The First Biblical City</p>
<p class="fl">The first biblical reference to a city is in <a href="?bref=Gen.4.17">Genesis 4:17</a>. The Hebrew verb indicates that Cain “was building” the city. Probably he did not complete it, nor did he permanently reside there; he had earlier been condemned to a vagabond’s existence (v <a href="?bref=Gen.4.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>The Genesis account, affirming that city life came early in human existence, is internally consistent. The first human offspring, Cain and Abel, were involved in food production (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.2">Gn 4:2</a>). Cain was an agriculturist, and Abel tended domesticated flocks. <a href="?bref=Gen.4.1-26">Genesis 4</a> shows both the prerequisite of food production and the resulting specialization. With Jabal, tentmaking was associated (v <a href="?bref=Gen.4.20">20</a>); with Jubal, music (v <a href="?bref=Gen.4.21">21</a>); and with Tubal-Cain, metalworking (v <a href="?bref=Gen.4.22">22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Archaeological Evidence</p>
<p class="fl">The testimony of archaeology generally agrees with an early date for the origin of cities. The oldest city thus far discovered in Canaan was Jericho. Using carbon-14 analysis of wood materials from the site, Kathleen Kenyon assigned a date prior to 7000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Although less than 10 acres (4 hectares), it was a well-developed city with an impressive wall 6 feet (1.8 meters) thick and a round stone tower almost 30 feet (9 meters) high equipped with an inside staircase from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Jericho seems to be 3,000 years older than other Canaanite cities. Most of the great Sumerian cities such as Ur, Ish, Lagah, and Uruk were founded later, in the fourth or early third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LocationandName">Location and Name</p>
<p class="h3">Topographical Prerequisites</p>
<p class="fl">There were four primary considerations in the selection of a site for a city.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The topographical situation of the ancient city had to contribute to its defense. A city built on a natural hill tended to be less vulnerable than one in the valley. Substantial advantage was given to the defenders if an enemy was forced to attack up an incline.</p>
<p class="list-text">The topography of Jerusalem illustrates the factor of security in the selection of a site. Although surrounded by higher mountains (<a href="?bref=Ps.125.2">Ps 125:2</a>), Jerusalem originally was established on a limestone ridge protected on the east by the deep Kidron Valley and on the west by the equally formidable Tyropoean Valley. The two valleys met, thus affording Jerusalem protection from the south. To complete the security, walls were constructed around the city, with special emphasis on the northern side, where Jerusalem was otherwise exposed (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6">2 Sm 5:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. A water source conveniently located was an absolute necessity for a city’s existence. The city spring or well became the center of social intercourse, particularly for the women, who were traditionally the water carriers. Biblical examples of socializing at the village well are numerous (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-12">Gn 29:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.38-39">1 Kgs 1:38-39</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In general, water sources were located in valleys, so the nearest spring to a city was frequently outside the walls. If an attacking enemy seized the water source, a city could be forced to surrender when the water supply stored within the walls ran dry. In Jerusalem, King Hezekiah constructed a water tunnel to neutralize the impending attack of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kgs 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.30">2 Chr 32:30</a>). His amazing engineering feat, more than 1,700 feet (518 meters) long and over 2,500 years old, can still be seen by visitors to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="list">3. Every city needed adequate food for its inhabitants. Ancient agriculturalists lived in a village or city and walked each day to their fields. The existence of a city, therefore, depended upon nearby cultivable fields adequate to meet the needs of the population.</p>
<p class="list">4. To facilitate importation of raw materials and exportation of finished products, proximity to local and international roads was desirable if not imperative. The important cities of the Bible were located along primary arteries of commerce.</p>
<p class="sp">The relative importance of these four factors has changed over the centuries. With the appearance of strong nation-states such as Rome, cities could depend upon standing armies and thus give up their inconvenient hilltop sites. Development of plastered cisterns and aqueducts made possible the founding of cities some distance from water sources; for example, Caesarea, built by Herod the Great, was 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) from Mt Carmel’s springs. Trade routes shifted with changing international conditions, causing the demise of some cities and the development of others.</p>

<p class="h1">CIVIL LAW AND JUSTICE*</p>
<p class="fl">Civil law deals with private disputes between individuals occasioned by debt, divorce, inheritance, or other relationships. In contrast, criminal law deals with crimes such as murder, treason, or theft. In civil cases the guilty party is asked to compensate the victim in an appropriate way.</p>
<p>This distinction between civil and criminal law is quite foreign to biblical thinking. Nearly all offenses were matters for private prosecution. If someone was murdered, his relatives were responsible for killing the murderer or chasing him to the nearest city of refuge, where a trial would be held. All offenses in Israel had a religious dimension: theft or adultery was not merely an offense against one’s neighbor but was a sin against God. This meant, in theory, that every Israelite would be shocked by such behavior and would want it punished. If such acts continued, God himself might step in to punish the individual, his family, or even the whole nation. This religious dimension gave an aura of criminality to every offense, even though in most cases prosecution was left in the hands of individuals.</p>

  <title>Cleanness and Uncleanness, Regulations concerning</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CLEANNESS AND UNCLEANNESS, Regulations Concerning</p>
<p class="fl">Aspect of Hebrew religion having physical, ceremonial, moral, and spiritual significance. Though these senses of clean and unclean can be distinguished with reference to their contexts, they also merge into and illustrate each other; the physical and ceremonial contexts point to a moral state of the worshiper and to a spiritual relationship between God and his people.</p>
<p>The OT vision of a people’s relationship with God is along moral and personal lines—God’s personal nature being expressed in his giving of the law to Moses. The personal and uniquely consistent character of Israel’s Lord made him morally a completely different being from the many gods of pagan cultures. Unlike the Lord, the Baals of the Canaanites were capricious and vicious; nobody expected them to be ethically consistent. Israel’s Lord, on the other hand, could be trusted to keep his word (a verbal communication through his chosen prophets). Nobody, not even the high priest or the king, was above the law, which expressed not only God’s character but also his sovereign will for the individual and the nation. His moral consistency carried over into his miraculous interventions into history to protect his people, to judge them and their enemies, and to redeem humanity itself.</p>
<p>Cleanness as defined in the book of Leviticus, therefore, was always conditioned by the presence of the personal God who gave the law. As the people sought to approach the Lord, they necessarily did so on his terms and therefore within the framework of the cultic ceremonies he had prescribed. Details of the Levitical ceremonies were designed to illustrate the moral implications of the sinner’s approach to God and God’s provision for his people to become morally clean in his sight.</p>
<p>The meaning of the Levitical system was stated clearly in the psalmist’s words: “Who shall ascend the hill of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>? And who shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false, and does not swear deceitfully” (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.3-4">Ps 24:3-4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). One’s state of cleanness depends not only on external actions but also on an internal relationship with God. As a result, the sinner’s inability to satisfy the moral demands of a holy God leads to his or her complete dependence on God and on God’s provision for satisfying his own demands. That provision was detailed in the law.</p>

<p class="h2" id="EarlyHistory">Early History</p>
<p class="h3">Gentile Religious Background</p>
<p class="fl">The gentile conscience was no doubt a strong influence on the development of ethnic notions of clean and unclean. The subjective sense of sin’s uncleanness is universally encountered in one form or another in the literature of every great religion, whatever explanation is given for it. Many religions have rites of purification based on water and washings. The Hebrews’ ritual avoidance of certain objects, some because of their holiness and others because of their unholiness, finds an analogy in the taboos of many primitive religions, including some of those with which the early Hebrews came into contact.</p>
<p>The similarities between the Hebrew and other ancient religions are easily established by superficial comparison. It would be surprising if there were none. Those differences that give biblical religion its distinctive character, however, must be accounted for.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LeviticalPrescriptions">Levitical Prescriptions</p>
<p class="h3">Ceremonial and Moral Law</p>
<p class="fl">The relationship between the external ceremonial details of the Mosaic law and the internally directed moral requirements of such parts of it as the Ten Commandments is one of the fundamental issues of OT theology. It is possible to demonstrate that, throughout the OT, uncleanness and sin are virtually synonymous. In many passages sin is described as uncleanness (e.g., <a href="?bref=Lev.16.16,30">Lv 16:16, 30</a>; the ordeal of the bitter water in <a href="?bref=Num.5.11-28">Nm 5:11-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.1">Zec 13:1</a>).</p>
<p>The relationship between ceremonial and moral cleanness can be illustrated from passages mentioning clean hands on the one hand (<a href="?bref=2Sam.22.21">2 Sm 22:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.17.9">Jb 17:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.22.30">22:30</a>) and a clean heart on the other (<a href="?bref=Ps.24.4">Pss 24:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.10">51:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.73.13">73:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.9">Prv 20:9</a>). The prophet Isaiah felt convicted of “unclean lips” when he was in God’s presence; a purifying coal, perhaps representing forgiveness and atonement, cleansed him (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.5-7">Is 6:5-7</a>). In many passages cleanness represents innocence before God (<a href="?bref=Job.11.4">Jb 11:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.33.9">33:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.7-10">Ps 51:7-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.9">Prv 20:9</a>), and uncleanness is said to come from sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.2">Ps 51:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.16">Is 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.64.6">64:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Causes of Uncleanness</p>
<p class="fl">From the Mosaic law a number of causes of uncleanness can be derived.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Some foods were not to be eaten. Various laws concerning animals make a “distinction between the unclean and the clean and between the living creature that may be eaten and the living creature that may not be eaten” (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.47">Lv 11:47</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Permitted food was what was acceptable to God (see also <a href="?bref=Deut.14.3-21">Dt 14:3-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.28-29">Acts 15:28-29</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Diseases, especially leprosy, produced an unclean state (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.1-14.57">Lv 13–14</a>). The story of Naaman refers to leprous defilement (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.1-14">2 Kgs 5:1-14</a>). The Gospels refer often to lepers (e.g., <a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-4">Mt 8:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.8">10:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.5">11:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.27">Lk 4:27</a>). Many swellings, sores, and rashes were included under that heading, including Hansen’s disease (modern leprosy). The defilement of disease included all things touched by a diseased person (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.33-57">Lv 14:33-57</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Bodily discharges were unclean, and contact with them defiled a person for various periods of time. Emission of semen produced uncleanness until the evening, whether in intercourse (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.16-18">Lv 15:16-18</a>) or inadvertently during the night (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.10">Dt 23:10</a>). An unnatural discharge, since it usually indicated disease, made a person unclean for seven days after it had ceased (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.1-15">Lv 15:1-15</a>). Menstruation also produced uncleanness lasting seven days after it ceased (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.19-24">Lv 15:19-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.4">2 Sm 11:4</a>). Sexual intercourse during that time made both partners unclean (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.19-24">Lv 15:19-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.18">20:18</a>). Contact with the spittle of an unclean person produced uncleanness for a day (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.8">15:8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Dead bodies, or even parts of them such as bone, caused uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Num.19.16">Nm 19:16</a>). Persons who touched a dead body were unclean for a month, and only after that period could they celebrate their own Passover if they had missed it (<a href="?bref=Num.9.6-11">9:6-11</a>). The high priest could not even bury his own parents because of his special ritual responsibilities (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.10-11">Lv 21:10-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.6.6-7">Nm 6:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.13">Hg 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.27">Mt 23:27</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Idolatry was the greatest source of spiritual defilement. The entire nation of Israel was defiled because of it (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.38">Ps 106:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.30.22">Is 30:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25">Ez 36:25</a>), as were the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.12">Jer 43:12</a>). Consequently, contact with Gentiles was thought to produce defilement. The gospel’s universal appeal confronted that conviction (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.4.9">Jn 4:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.28">Acts 10:28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.2.11-14">Gal 2:11-14</a>). Closely related to the defilement of idolatry was the defilement caused by unclean spirits (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.2">Zec 13:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.10.1">Mt 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.23-27">Mk 1:23-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Laws about Objects</p>
<p class="fl">Certain laws illustrate the principle that uncleanness was transmitted much like a contagion. Dead bodies contaminated what they touched, as did dead insects and certain crawling things (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.29-38">Lv 11:29-38</a>). It is interesting that dry grain, running springwater, and water in a cistern were expressly excluded from that law of contamination; perhaps otherwise, starvation would have resulted, dead insects and mice being found in grain and water every day in an agricultural community. Unclean pottery had to be broken, but wooden vessels merely required washing (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.12">Lv 15:12</a>). Even uncovered pots in a house where a person had died became unclean (<a href="?bref=Num.19.15">Nm 19:15</a>); everyone who entered the house was unclean.</p>
<p>Because of their idolatrous associations, the possessions of pagans were unclean; therefore, booty taken in war had to be cleansed by fire or washing (<a href="?bref=Num.31.21-24">Nm 31:21-24</a>). Clothing of wool, linen, or leather could contract unclean “leprosy” from diseased persons and had to be tested. If the leprous spots (greenish or reddish patches) spread after a test period, the garments had to be burned (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.47-59">Lv 13:47-59</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.14.33-53">14:33-53</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Laws about Places</p>
<p class="fl">The land and people of Israel were holy; they could be defiled by the uncleanness of economic oppression or idolatry (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.17-19">Jos 22:17-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.27">Jer 13:27</a>). Jerusalem was a holy city, but it could be defiled by the sins of its people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.22.2-4">Ez 22:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.1.8">Lam 1:8</a>) or by the blood of its slaughtered inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.15">Lam 4:15</a>).</p>
<p>The temple could be defiled by unclean persons. It was necessary for Hezekiah to cleanse the temple after Ahaz’s idolatrous worship (<a href="?bref=2Chr.29.15-19">2 Chr 29:15-19</a>); Nehemiah had to cleanse the rooms in which Tobiah had been living (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.9">Neh 13:9</a>). One of the functions of the Day of Atonement was removal of impurities transferred to the temple by the sins of the Israelites during the past year (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.16-19">Lv 16:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.16.31-33">31-33</a>).</p>
<p>An unclean place received the pieces of a leprous house after its demolition (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.45">Lv 14:45</a>). The valley of Hinnom became Jerusalem’s garbage dump in later years, giving rise to the visions of “Gehenna” as a place of eternal punishment in NT eschatology. Since the Israelite camp was a holy place, care was taken to bury human excrement outside its boundaries (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.12-14">Dt 23:12-14</a>). The value of that simple expedient in preventing disease during military excursions can hardly be exaggerated, since plagues were a great scourge of ancient armies.</p>
<p class="h3">Laws about Food</p>
<p class="fl">Certain kinds of animals were unclean and thus could not be eaten (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.1-47">Lv 11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.14.3-21">Dt 14:3-21</a>). Animals that died of old age, disease, or injury, or had been wounded by predators, were unclean. Animals that did not both chew the cud and have a cloven hoof were unclean, a definition that included pigs, camels, badgers, and rabbits among others. Israelites could eat only those fish that had both fins and scales. Birds of prey and scavengers were unclean. All winged insects were unclean except hopping insects (locusts, grasshoppers, and crickets). A large classification of “crawling things” was prohibited, including worms, lizards, snakes, weasels, and mice. In addition to all those was the ancient prohibition against eating blood (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.4">Gn 9:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.17.14-15">Lv 17:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.16-23">Dt 12:16-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.28-29">Acts 15:28-29</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurificationRites">Purification Rites</p>
<p class="h3">Purification by Lapse of Time</p>
<p class="fl">Secondary contamination could often be canceled simply by waiting until the evening (<a href="?bref=Lev.11.24">Lv 11:24</a>) or for 7, 14, 40, or 80 days. Dead bodies contaminated what they touched for 7 days (<a href="?bref=Num.19.11">Nm 19:11</a>), as did menstruation (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.19">Lv 15:19</a>). When a child was born, the mother’s unclean condition lasted 7 days for a boy and 14 days for a girl. An additional 33 days for a male child and 66 days for a female were required before the mother could touch any sacred thing.</p>
<p class="h3">Purification by Water</p>
<p class="fl">Contact with unclean things, such as bodily discharges, often required washing of hands and clothing, usually accompanied by the lapse of a day (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.5-11">Lv 15:5-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Purification by Ceremonial Substances</p>
<p class="fl">Ceremonial substances used in purification rites included the ashes of a red heifer mixed with water (<a href="?bref=Num.19.1-10">Nm 19:1-10</a>), and (in cases of leprosy) cedarwood, scarlet cloth, hyssop, and blood (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.2-9">Lv 14:2-9</a>). When the altar was used in a purification ceremony, only blood was suitable, since the altar was the place of sacrifice for sin (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.18-19">Lv 16:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.43.20">Ez 43:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Purification by Sacrifice</p>
<p class="fl">Sacrifice was the ultimate source of both ritual and moral purification. All bodily discharges except sexual ones were purified by offerings of doves and pigeons (<a href="?bref=Lev.15.14-15,29-30">Lv 15:14-15, 29-30</a>). Childbirth required a lamb and a bird (<a href="?bref=Lev.12.6">12:6</a>). Poor people could offer birds in place of an animal (<a href="?bref=Lev.12.8">Lv 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.14.21-32">14:21-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.2.24">Lk 2:24</a>).</p>
<p>In sacrifice, blood was symbolic of a life given and therefore a death experienced; the uncleanness of disease or sin was thought of as being transferred to the victim, thus removing the uncleanness (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.7">Lv 14:7</a>). Sacrificial death, therefore, always had a substitutionary element. Only blood sacrifice could provide the moral cleansing necessary for sin itself; such sacrifice was therefore the basis of all cleansing, including that of disease.</p>
<p class="h3">Purification by Fire</p>
<p class="fl">Some contamination could be removed only by fire, such as contamination of metal pots (<a href="?bref=Num.31.22-23">Nm 31:22-23</a>). Incest was punishable not only by death but also by burning the bodies (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.14">Lv 20:14</a>). Idolatry had to be put away by total destruction of the objects and by burning (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.20">Ex 32:20</a>). Cities consecrated to pagan deities were to be burned.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentPerspective">New Testament Perspective</p>
<p class="fl">The NT did not reject the OT concept of clean and unclean, but rather reinterpreted it in a new context. It stressed in particular the moral sense of the concept as well as the identification of uncleanness with sin.</p>
<p>The Gospels were written in the context of OT law and its Pharisaic and Sadducean accretions. Jesus obeyed the law but was often at odds with the practical casuistry (system) that had grown up around it. Jesus taught that true defilement came from the sinner’s heart and not from outside contamination (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.14-23">Mk 7:14-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.39-41">Lk 11:39-41</a>). A central element in his teaching was his attack on the ceremonial externalism of the Pharisees. Thus it has been said that Jesus “internalized” the law. It would be more correct to say that he forced attention to the law’s demands on people’s inner lives.</p>
<p>The intrinsic wickedness of demons is underscored by the use of the term “unclean spirit” throughout the Gospels. In fact, the word “unclean” itself always appears in the Gospels in the context of spirit, a detail that illustrates the NT shift of emphasis from ritual uncleanness to sin and its guilt.</p>
<p>An important episode in the life of the early church came in <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">Acts 10</a>, when God taught the apostle Peter that Gentiles were not unclean in themselves and that Peter was obliged to receive them. The result was Cornelius’s conversion.</p>
<p>Jesus’ assertion that uncleanness originates in the heart bore fruit in the apostle Paul’s doctrine of Christian freedom. Paul, a Pharisee who could say of himself that he had never broken an external law, came to see that nothing is unclean in itself (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.14-20">Rom 14:14-20</a>). Throughout his epistles, cleanness is the result of obedience of the heart flowing from regeneration; it is based on the cleansing power of the Atonement (see <a href="?bref=Rom.6.19">Rom 6:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.3-4">1 Thes 2:3-4</a>, where uncleanness is strictly moral).</p>
<p>Christ’s atonement was the final cleansing agent for sin and its moral results (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.14,22">Heb 9:14, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">1 Jn 1:7</a>), doing in reality what the blood of bulls and goats only typified. Thus those who are washed in the blood of the Lamb (<a href="?bref=Rev.7.14">Rv 7:14</a>) are seen as wearing clean white robes (<a href="?bref=Rev.15.6">15:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.8-14">19:8-14</a>). His blood, symbolizing the life given and the death died by the Son at the behest of the Father, satisfies the attributes of personal justice of the triune God. Because the personal character of a righteous Father was vindicated, the personal forgiveness of sinners is morally possible. God can be in history only what he is eternally: he is both just and the justifier of believers in Christ (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.24-26">Rom 3:24-26</a>).</p>

  <title>Clement*, Epistle of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CLEMENT*, Epistle of</p>
<p class="fl">Letter written by Clement of Rome to the church at Corinth around <span class="era">AD</span> 96. This letter is probably the earliest extant Christian epistle outside the NT. Around <span class="era">AD</span> 170, Dionysius of Corinth recorded the earliest claim that Clement was the author of this letter. Origen and Eusebius also identified Clement as the epistle’s author.</p>
<p>Clement’s epistle to the Corinthians admonishes several younger believers who led a revolt and ousted the leading elders of the Corinthian church. These young men may have wanted a more flexible system of ministry and recognition of their spiritual gifts. They were ascetics and claimed a secret knowledge <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">gnosis</span><span class="ital">)</span> of the faith that was revealed only to the elite.</p>
<p>This letter was sent from the entire Roman church rather than from a single individual. The early churches did not consider themselves to be isolated loners. They knew they were a part of the universal church and were not immune to the events and conditions of their sister congregations. They felt responsible to warn and advise each other.</p>
<p>The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT) is cited often in this letter. The heroes of the OT are held up as patterns for Christian conduct, thereby mingling NT and OT themes. The apostle Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians is the pattern for Clement’s letter to the same church. Clement closely imitates <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">1 Corinthians 13</a> in chapters 49 and 50, and he grounds many of his beliefs in Paul’s writings regarding the resurrection and schisms. But Clement’s writing is moralistic and ethical and often more akin to Hellenistic Judaism and Stoicism than to Pauline theology. Clement also describes a hierarchical form of ministry and endorses the doctrine of apostolic succession.</p>
<p>Clement quoted extensively from the words of Jesus, using sayings found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. He also quoted Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Hebrews. Thus, Clement provides important evidence that books that later became part of the NT canon were circulating among the churches by the end of the first century. Clement’s letter also provides important evidence for the martyrdom of the apostles Peter and Paul and for Paul’s mission to the “western boundary” (Spain?).</p>

  <title>Cloth and Cloth Manufacturing*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CLOTH AND CLOTH MANUFACTURING*</p>
<p class="fl">Since antiquity, cloth has been made from such natural fibers as flax, wool, cotton, silk, and hair. Linen (spun from flax), wool, and sackcloth (woven from goat’s or camel’s hair) are the fabrics most frequently mentioned in Scripture. The Bible also refers to silk and cotton.</p>
<p class="h2" id="FibersforWeaving">Fibers for Weaving</p>
<p class="h3">Linen</p>
<p class="fl">Flax was cultivated extensively in the Near East. In Palestine it flourished around the Sea of Galilee. The stalks were gathered into bundles and steeped in water, causing the fibers to separate from the nonfibrous stem. The bundles were then opened and spread out to dry in the sun. Rahab hid Hebrew spies on the roof of her house amid stalks of flax laid out to dry (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.6">Jos 2:6</a>). After drying, the stalks were split and combed to separate the fibers for spinning and weaving into linen. Biblical references to flax include <a href="?bref=Exod.9.31">Exodus 9:31</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.15.14">Judges 15:14</a>, and <a href="?bref=Pr.31.13">Proverbs 31:13</a>.</p>
<p>The type of fabric from which the priestly coats, girdles, and caps (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.40">Ex 28:40</a>) were made is not stated, though the mention of linen breeches may imply that most, if not all, of the priestly garments were made of linen. The finest linen, worn by kings and nobles, served as a mark of honor or as a special gift. Joseph was given a garment of fine linen when he was made ruler of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">Gn 41:42</a>). When the Hebrews left Egypt at the time of the exodus, they took with them a high-quality linen and donated it to the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.4">Ex 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.35.6">35:6</a>). A craftsman who was trained to work in fine linen came from Tyre to work for Solomon on temple hangings (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.14">2 Chr 2:14</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Wool</p>
<p class="fl">Wool was another extremely important fiber in the Near Eastern economy. Wool could come in any shade from creamy yellow to tan or black. Sometimes to obtain pure white wool a sheep was kept wrapped to prevent its fleece from being soiled. Preparation of wool was a home craft in antiquity (<a href="?bref=Pr.31.13">Prv 31:13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.35.25">Ex 35:25</a>). Wool had to be washed thoroughly, dried, and then beaten to detach the fibers and remove the dirt before being carded and spun. Women spun their own yarn and wove garments for their families. Wool was the fabric of seminomadic, sheep-raising people; by contrast, the growing of flax required a more settled lifestyle.</p>
<p class="h3">Goat’s Hair</p>
<p class="fl">A thick cloth that was extremely warm as well as waterproof was woven from goat’s hair (<a href="?bref=Exod.35.23,26">Ex 35:23, 26</a>). Clothing worn by the poor was often manufactured from goat’s or camel’s hair. That coarse-haired fabric (sackcloth) on occasions was worn next to the skin as a form of penitence (<a href="?bref=Neh.9.1">Neh 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.3">Dn 9:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.21">Mt 11:21</a>), as a mourning vestment (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.34">Gn 37:34</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.31">2 Sm 3:31</a>), or even as a prophetic protest against luxurious living (<a href="?bref=Rev.11.3">Rv 11:3</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Cotton, Silk, and Gold Thread</p>
<p class="fl">The people of Judea would certainly have been aware of cotton during their Persian exile (beginning in 538 <span class="era">BC</span>). Cotton is mentioned once in a description of elaborate hangings in the Persian king’s palace (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>). It is doubtful, however, that cotton was cultivated in ancient Palestine or even found there until after the exile.</p>
<p>Earlier in Israel’s history, part of the tabernacle fabric was woven with gold thread, made from thin sheets of beaten gold cut into fine wire strips (<a href="?bref=Exod.39.3">Ex 39:3</a>). A wider type of gold wire with a flat surface was used to adorn expensive Palestinian and Syrian garments. An ancient hank of fine gold thread was uncovered during excavations at Dura on the Euphrates River.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Spinning">Spinning</p>
<p class="fl">In Bible times a spindle was a slender rounded stick, tapered and notched at one end and weighted at the other end with a “whorl” of clay, stone, glass, or metal to serve as a kind of flywheel. The thread spun at the tapered end was wound on the spindle. Another thin stick, called a distaff, held the fibers to be fed onto the twirling spindle.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LoomsandWeaving">Looms and Weaving</p>
<p class="fl">Weaving is the interlacing of “warp” threads stretched on a loom with threads of “weft” or “woof” passed from side to side over and under the warp. A primitive warp could be stretched around pegs or rods tied to a tree or roof beam and sometimes connected to the weaver’s waist.</p>
<p>As weaving technique developed, three types of loom emerged: the horizontal ground loom, the vertical two-beamed loom, and the warp-weighted loom. In a horizontal ground loom the warp was stretched between two wooden beams fastened to the ground by four pegs. Traveling nomads could pull out the pegs and roll up the unfinished weaving on the beams. Delilah wove Samson’s hair on a horizontal ground loom (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.13-14">Jgs 16:13-14</a>).</p>
<p>The vertical two-beamed loom had its warp stretched on a rectangular wooden frame. In addition to the two uprights and two warp beams, another beam was often used to maintain the tension of the warp, especially on longer lengths.</p>
<p>The warp-weighted loom, also on a vertical frame, was worked from the top down. The lower edge was weighted with loom weights, often shaped lumps of clay.</p>
<p>The degree of sophistication in weaving techniques in biblical times is seen in the specifications regarding fabrics for the tabernacle and its court. Hangings for the court were to be 50 yards (45.7 meters) long and probably a standard 2 yards (1.8 meters) wide (<a href="?bref=Exod.27.9-18">Ex 27:9-18</a>). The tabernacle veil (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.31">26:31</a>) and screen for the entrance (v <a href="?bref=Exod.26.36">36</a>) were to be of “blue and purple and scarlet stuff,” probably highlighted or embroidered with linen.</p>
<p>Garments such as the tunic that Jesus wore were woven in one piece with the selvage (edge of the weaving) coming at the neck and hem, the areas of greatest wear. A tunic woven on a narrow loom would be constructed of three pieces.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ClothDyesandDyeing">Cloth Dyes and Dyeing</p>
<p class="fl">Like the fibers, the dyes used in antiquity were also of animal or plant origin. A red dye was obtained from the body of an insect. Purple came mainly from two kinds of mollusks found in many parts of the eastern Mediterranean seaboard. The purest shade of purple could be obtained from mollusks found on the shore at Tyre, so a large industry developed there (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.1-3">Ez 27:1-3</a>,16). Purple, the most expensive dye, remained the distinguishing color of kings and nobles. The first Christian convert in Europe, Lydia, was a businesswoman who sold the costly purple cloth (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14">Acts 16:14</a>). Yellow was obtained from the petals and flower heads of the safflower. Saffron (orange-yellow) came from the stigmas of the crocus that grew extensively in Syria and Egypt. Green was usually concocted from a mixture of other dyes. In Hellenistic times woad, a plant of the mustard family, was cultivated in Mesopotamia for its blue dye. Indigo was grown in Egypt and Syria. Dyeing in antiquity was often carried out in large vats, pictures of which have been found in paintings and on pottery. The ruins of structures including vats have been excavated at some Palestinian sites.</p>

<p>Many ancient Near Eastern peoples (including the Israelites) kept flocks of sheep before the discovery of spinning and weaving and used the leather of their hides for clothing. Later, wool plucked from the sheep and from branches on which the fleece had accumulated as the animals brushed past was made into a feltlike fabric. Wool remained one of the most important fabrics for clothing throughout the biblical period.</p>
<p>As the seminomadic Israelite tribes became more sedentary in nature, flax was cultivated. It was woven into linen, which became a commonly used fabric. At the beginning of the middle Bronze Age (c. 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>), fine silks began to be imported from China, and wild silk was produced in some areas of the Near East. Cotton was known in Egypt, but it does not appear to have been produced anywhere in Palestine in the biblical period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MaleClothing">Male Clothing</p>
<p class="fl">Early in biblical times the loincloth formed an important item of male clothing that was worn by all levels of society. Prior to 2000 <span class="era">BC</span>, a type of loincloth was also the customary piece of clothing for all Egyptians, from the lowliest laborer to the pharaoh. At a later period, however, it appeared only as part of military dress (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.15">Ez 23:15</a>). The inner garment (a tunic or shirt) was made of wool or linen. It had openings for the neck and arms, and appears to have had long sleeves, although some styles had half sleeves. It was worn next to the skin and fell either to the knees or, more often, to the ankles, frequently being belted at the waist. The Greek <span class="greek">chiton</span> (“coat”) and the Roman tunic would have been undergarments of a similar character. A man who was wearing nothing except this undergarment was considered “naked.” The young man who followed after Jesus at Gethsemane at his arrest was probably attired in this manner (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.51-52">Mk 14:51-52</a>).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the outer garment, formed out of a square-shaped piece of cloth, was referred to as a cloak or mantle. It had openings for the arms and was draped over one or both shoulders.</p>
<p>A Hebrew man was considered improperly dressed without his cloak, and one was forbidden to demand another’s mantle as a loan or pledge. At night, when the other items of clothing were removed, the cloak, which was often made of animal skin or wool, was used as a blanket (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.26-27">Ex 22:26-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.13">Dt 24:13</a>). Cloaks made of goat’s hair or camel’s hair, such as John the Baptist wore (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.4">Mt 3:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>), would have been particularly warm at night.</p>
<p>The coat of many colors that Jacob gave to Joseph was probably a striped shirt or tunic made of leather or wool felt. The entire garment may have been bound with a woolen border (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.3">Gn 37:3</a>). The garment Hannah made each year for the young Samuel was probably a coat or mantle (<a href="?bref=1Sam.2.19">1 Sm 2:19</a>).</p>
<p>Cloaks were usually made with a hem; it was this that the woman touched when she came to Jesus for healing (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.20">Mt 9:20</a>). The robe that Roman soldiers placed derisively upon Jesus to symbolize his kingship was probably a purple military cloak such as Roman officers commonly wore (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.28-31">Mt 27:28-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.17">Mk 15:17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.2">Jn 19:2</a>).</p>
<p>The Greeks used the term <span class="greek">himation</span> for an outer garment, similar to the robe that was placed on the prodigal son (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.22">Lk 15:22</a>) when his father celebrated the son’s return with his best food, clothing, and jewelry. The cloak that Paul wore (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.13">2 Tm 4:13</a>) may well have been a circular style of cape that was popular in the first century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>Garments were of different qualities and signified rank or office (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.6">Is 3:6</a>). The scribes and prophets wore special mantles symbolic of their professions. Elijah wore a prophet’s mantle (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.13,19">1 Kgs 19:13, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.8,13-14">2 Kgs 2:8, 13-14</a>). In NT times scribes wore special robes (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.38">Mk 12:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.46">Lk 20:46</a>).</p>
<p>Christ and his disciples probably wore tunics and sandals, and carried moneybags and staffs (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.9-10">Mt 10:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.8">Mk 6:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.3">Lk 9:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.4">10:4</a>). When Roman soldiers divided Jesus’ clothing after the Crucifixion (<a href="?bref=John.19.23-24">Jn 19:23-24</a>), they cast lots for the inner garment, one woven without any seams and probably made of wool. This was the most valuable of Jesus’ items of clothing.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Footwear">Footwear</p>
<p class="fl">In Bible times footwear consisted of shoes and sandals, which were an essential part of a person’s wardrobe (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.15">2 Chr 28:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.12.8">Acts 12:8</a>). Occasionally sandals had wooden soles, but usually they were leather. Sometimes they had an enclosed upper front and open back. The upper part was typically made of open strips of leather, and sometimes the sandal merely consisted of a sole with thongs laced around the leg or ankle. A woman’s sandals were considered an attractive and fashionable part of her wardrobe (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.10.4">Jdt 10:4</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.16.9">16:9</a>).</p>
<p>On a long journey through the country, one’s sandals might be carried and saved for arrival in the next town, so that they would not be worn out. (Being barefoot in a town or city was a sign of abject poverty.) Since sandals were so open in design, one can easily understand the necessity for the ritual foot washing of a guest.</p>
<p>Shoes were not worn in the temple or on any holy ground (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.5">Ex 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.15">Jos 5:15</a>) and were also taken off when a person was in a house. It was customary to remove the sandals at a time of mourning. The shoes that the Israelites wore in their wilderness wanderings did not wear out (<a href="?bref=Deut.29.5">Dt 29:5</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Literally, the term means “hollow Syria.” It was used somewhat loosely in referring to parts of the Jordan Valley. This designation is not found in the Bible but is mentioned a number of times in the Apocrypha, by itself in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.69">1 Maccabees 10:69</a> and together with Phoenicia elsewhere (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.2.17,24,27">1 Esd 2:17, 24, 27</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.4.48">4:48</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.6.29">6:29</a>: <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.7.1">7:1</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Esd.8.67">8:67</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.3.5,8">2 Macc 3:5, 8</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.4">4:4</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.8.8">8:8</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.10.11">10:11</a>). It was the name commonly given to the approximately 100-mile-long (161-kilometer) valley that stretches between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains after the time of Alexander the Great, but it is apparent from the use of the term by ancient writers that it did not always indicate the same territory.</p>

<p class="h2" id="EarliestCoinsinPalestine">Earliest Coins in Palestine</p>
<p class="fl">Not until the time of Darius the Great (Darius I of Persia, 521–486 <span class="era">BC</span>) did an official government-sponsored coinage become current in Palestine. Those earliest coins were oval-shaped gold darics, along with some silver coins.</p>
<p>“Dram” is another term for the Persian gold daric. It is mentioned in <a href="?bref=Ezra.2.68-69">Ezra 2:68-69</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>), where Zerubbabel’s caravan offered gold darics amounting to $30,000 toward rebuilding the temple. This passage is the first mention of an actual coin in the Bible.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time that the Persian coins became current in Palestine, the widely popular silver tetradrachmas (four-drachma pieces) of Athens began to find their way to the mercantile centers of the Phoenician, Israelite, and Philistine coasts. Archaeologists have unearthed them in hoards throughout the eastern Mediterranean region. They continued to be used through the Persian period, which lasted until the Persian Empire was conquered by Alexander the Great in 334–330 <span class="era">BC</span>. The coin was thick and heavy in appearance, but being of high-quality silver, it was in great demand for international commerce. Presumably Greek merchants found they could obtain the most desirable Asiatic imports in exchange for that particular form of currency.</p>
<p>The silver didrachma, or half-drachma, in general use in the Greek Empire from the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, continued through Roman times. After Alexander’s conquests, of course, Greek coins were used throughout the Macedonian Empire from present-day Yugoslavia to Pakistan. They were almost certainly employed for business purposes in Judea, for example.</p>
<p>The shekels of the Phoenician trade centers of Tyre and Sidon, which had contributed substantially to the money supply in the Persian period, continued to be accepted in Judea even after the Alexandrian conquest. Typical of Sidon was a silver shekel portraying the battlements and walls of Sidon’s harbor, with a ship lying at anchor and two prancing lions in the foreground. A typical Tyrian shekel showed the god Baal robed and wearing a tiara. He was riding a hippocamp (winged horse with the tail of a fish) on the sea, with a fish or dolphin beneath. The reverse showed an Egyptian-type owl facing right, plus a shepherd’s crook and flail, both royal insignia in Egypt. The stater (or tetradrachma) found by the disciple Peter in a fish’s mouth and used to pay the temple tax for himself and Jesus may have been a Tyrian coin (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.27">Mt 17:27</a>; <span class="sc">rsv</span> “shekel”).</p>
<p>The talent, which represented a certain weight of gold or silver, was a common medium of exchange before the development of coinage. During the Maccabean period, John Hyrcanus saved the city of Jerusalem from destruction in 133 <span class="era">BC</span> by paying a ransom from a 900-year-old hoard stored in David’s sepulcher. Three thousand talents of silver were sent to the Seleucid king Antiochus VII Sidetes in return for his promise to withdraw his troops. Treasure plundered from the temple by the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 66 is recorded as amounting to 17 talents. In gold talents that sum would represent the equivalent of the purchase price of about 15 large houses in a modern Western city.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CoinagefromtheMaccabeestoHerodAgrippaI">Coinage from the Maccabees to Herod Agrippa I</p>
<p class="fl">Even though a native Jewish dynasty assumed the government of the Holy Land, it was many years before any indigenous Jewish coinage was minted. Presumably the inhabitants continued to use the coinage of Tyre and Egypt and of the Seleucid Empire for their commercial transactions. It was formerly supposed that silver shekels bearing images of the chalice and pomegranate cluster dated from the reign of Simon Maccabeus (142–134 <span class="era">BC</span>); more recent archaeological discoveries prove that those coins date from the first Jewish revolt (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70).</p>
<p>When the time came to issue the first Jewish coins, the die makers faced several problems. No mint was available, and no local people were skilled in design or die sinking. Coins current in the Near East at that time, which showed a high degree of design and craftsmanship, each bore the portrait head of a ruler or a god. For the Jews to make such coins would have meant contravening the second commandment, “You shall not make for yourself a graven image” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4">Ex 20:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Not until well into Roman times was a coin struck in Palestine bearing a portrait head of a Roman emperor.</p>
<p>The earliest coinage of the Hasmonean dynasty (the regnal name of the Maccabees) was the small bronze lepton (plural, lepta) of John Hyrcanus I (134–104 <span class="era">BC</span>), son of Simon Maccabeus. The obverse showed two cornucopias with a pomegranate between them. That image symbolized the fertility that God had granted to the land. The reverse contained an inscription within a wreath, “John the high priest and the community of the Jews.” Small bronze lepta from the reign of Alexander Janneus, son of Hyrcanus I, have been found in great numbers. They were evidently much in demand for transactions at the temple, where money changers converted the gentile currency of visiting worshipers into the more acceptable Jewish money. Undoubtedly Hasmonean lepta were the coins Jesus scattered over the pavement of the Court of the Gentiles when he overturned the tables of the money changers (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12">Mt 21:12</a>; <a href="?bref=John.2.15">Jn 2:15</a>). The lepton, or “mite,” of bronze or copper, worth <span class="sup">1</span>/<span class="sub">400</span> of a shekel, was mentioned by Jesus on another occasion. He praised a widow’s gift of two mites to the temple treasury with the comment that the rich “contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, her whole living” (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.44">Mk 12:44</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Herod I came to power in Judea under the patronage of Mark Antony and secured the allegiance of the pro-Hasmonean Jews by marrying Mariamne, granddaughter of Hyrcanus II, in 38 <span class="era">BC</span>. Herod was empowered to strike his own bronze coins. Although he had a free hand to introduce innovations, Herod’s lepta followed tradition quite faithfully. The lepta carried an anchor with letters meaning “Of King Herod.” The reverse bore the double cornucopias with a pomegranate (or poppy) between them. Herod also minted a large bronze coin with what appears to be a Macedonian helmet on the obverse and a slender tripod on the reverse, along with an inscription of Herod’s name. Other designs he employed included wheat, eagles, and wreaths. He issued no silver coinage, relying instead on the available supplies of silver coins from Tyre, Syria, Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome.</p>
<p>After Herod’s death in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, his son Herod Archelaus assumed control. Lepta from that period bore a hanging cluster of grapes with a Greek inscription, and on the reverse a two-plumed Macedonian helmet. Grapes were an allusion to Israel as the Lord’s vine (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.1-30">Is 5</a>).</p>
<p>When Herod Antipas began his rule, also in 4 <span class="era">BC</span>, he had no authority in Judea or Samaria. That portion of the former Jewish kingdom was placed under the control of Roman governors, or procurators, appointed directly by the emperor himself. Most familiar of the Roman procurators of Judea was Pontius Pilate (<span class="era">AD</span> 26–36). His bronze coinage showed some bold innovations; his designs included representations of instruments used in the Roman religion such as the augur’s wand (resembling a shepherd’s crook in shape) and a ladle used in connection with broth prepared at sacrifices. The reverse bore a wreath enclosing the regnal date of <span class="era">AD</span> 30–31. The two lepta put into the temple treasury (<a href="?bref=Luke.21.2">Lk 21:2</a>) could have been lepta issued by Pilate or his predecessor. More likely, however, they were the Hasmonean lepta of Hyrcanus or Janneus, which were free of any taint of pagan Roman influence.</p>
<p>Herod Agrippa I (<span class="era">AD</span> 37–44), grandson of Herod the Great, continued the family tradition of ingratiating himself with the Roman overlords. Many of Herod Agrippa’s lepta have been found, showing a conical tasseled umbrella (perhaps symbolizing his royal protection of the people of Palestine) plus a Greek inscription indicating his reign. The reverse showed a bound cluster of three wheat ears and bore the regnal year as the legend.</p>
<p class="h2" id="RomanCoinsinNewTestamentTimes">Roman Coins in New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">The Roman “as” came into circulation about 348 <span class="era">BC</span> as a bronze coin bearing the figure of an animal. The coin was named after the Roman one-pound weight, equivalent to 12 ounces (340 grams) in our modern system. At the time of Christ’s birth, the Roman “as” minted for use in the Asiatic provinces bore the head of the emperor Augustus, with a laurel wreath on the reverse. A smaller bronze quadrans, or quarter “as,” was also minted by the Romans.</p>
<p>Another bronze coin found in Greek and Roman currency was the assarion, first minted in the first century <span class="era">BC</span> but still in use in the Christian period. One type was stamped with a winged sphinx, with an amphora on the reverse. It is still debated whether the coin described as a “farthing” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> was in fact a Greek assarion or a Roman “as” or quadrans. The coin is mentioned four times in the NT, most familiarly in the question “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?” (see <a href="?bref=Matt.5.26">Mt 5:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.10.29">10:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.42">Mk 12:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.6">Lk 12:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span> “penny”). There is no doubt that the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translators decided to make the coin seem more familiar to their readers by using the name of the smallest copper coin in circulation in England at that time.</p>
<p>The word translated “penny” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> is the Greek form of “denarius,” the normal daily wage for a laborer in NT times. In the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, for example, the master agreed to pay each man “a penny” for his day’s work (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.2">Mt 20:2</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <span class="sc">rsv</span> “a denarius”). “Two pence” was the amount paid to the innkeeper by the good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.35">Lk 10:35</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Because of the influence of the Roman denarius on British currency, the English penny has always been represented by the initial letter of its Roman equivalent.</p>
<p>When the denarius, or “penny,” is recognized as a normal day’s wage, the astonishment of Jesus’ disciples when they were expected to find food for 5,000 people is better understood. They exclaimed that “two hundred pennyworth” of food would not feed such a crowd (<a href="?bref=John.6.7">Jn 6:7</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>); that sum represented more than six months’ work.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the silver and gold coinage current in Palestine during the time of Christ and for the remainder of the first century <span class="era">AD</span> came primarily from Rome. The larger silver coins, however, that are referred to as tetradrachmas or staters in the NT came from Egypt, Phoenicia, or Antioch. The silver coin most frequently mentioned in the NT was the Roman denarius or the Greek drachma. Since few drachmas have been found in excavations dating from the first century, it is possible that the term was used in popular speech to refer to the denarius (plural, denarii), which was approximately the same size as the average Greek drachma. Actually, few Greek cities were permitted by their Roman overlords to continue minting drachmas.</p>
<p>Caesar Augustus issued a decree for all the Roman world to be enrolled (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-2">Lk 2:1-2</a>) in an empire-wide census just about the time that Jesus was born (6 or 5 <span class="era">BC</span>). During his long reign (27 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 14), Augustus authorized a large variety of denarii. They generally carried his likeness on their obverse with the inscription “Augustus, son of the divine one” (that is, son of Julius Caesar, who had been voted divine honors by the Roman Senate).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Matt.22.19">Matthew 22:19</a> Jesus asked those trying to trick him with a question to show him a coin used to pay the government tax. They handed him a denarius bearing the portrait and inscription of Caesar (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.21">Mt 22:21</a>). That coin could have been a denarius of Augustus, who had died some 16 years before, or of Tiberius (<span class="era">AD</span> 14–37), who was then on the throne. The silver denarius of Tiberius read “Tiberius Caesar Augustus, son of the divine Augustus.” The reverse showed the high priestess of the vestal order, flaming torch in hand, seated on her throne facing right. The title “pontif(ex) maxim(us)” referred to Tiberius rather than to the priestess.</p>

<p class="h1">COLOR</p>
<p class="fl">The OT and NT have no exact word for “color,” although the word appears several times in our English Bibles. The words translated “color” have quite different meanings in the original languages.</p>
<p>The word most frequently translated “colour” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> literally means “eye” and suggests “appearance” (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.55">Lv 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.7">Nm 11:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.23.31">Prv 23:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.1.4,7,16,22,27">Ez 1:4, 7, 16, 22, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.2">8:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.10.9">10:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.10.6">Dn 10:6</a>). Only <a href="?bref=Lev.13.55">Leviticus 13:55</a> retains the translation “color” in the <span class="sc">rsv</span>. Other words translated as “color” in the <span class="sc">rsv</span> refer to facial appearance (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.6-10">Dn 5:6-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.28">7:28</a>), fabrics of variegated colors (<a href="?bref=Pr.7.16">Prv 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.3">Ez 17:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.24">27:24</a>), stones (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.2">1 Chr 29:2</a>), and breastplates (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.17">Rv 9:17</a>). Joseph’s “coat of many colours” (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.3">Gn 37:3</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) and Tamar’s “garment of divers colours” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.13.18-19">2 Sm 13:18-19</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>) were either long-sleeved robes or richly ornamented tunics that served as a mark of preferred status.</p>
<p>In the NT, a word that means “pretense” is used archaically in <a href="?bref=Acts.27.30">Acts 27:30</a> and was interpreted as “colour” by the <span class="sc">kjv</span> translators. They also added the word “colour” to <a href="?bref=Rev.17.4">Revelation 17:4</a>, evidently to clarify the meaning.</p>
<p>Though many colors are mentioned in the Bible, colors are not particularly singled out for emphasis. Natural colors are seldom mentioned in descriptions. Colors that appear frequently and that are most carefully differentiated are manufactured colors, especially dyes.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ColorsMentionedintheBible">Colors Mentioned in the Bible</p>
<p class="fl">Because the Hebrews perceived color differently than we do in Western culture, it is sometimes difficult to translate precisely the various Hebrew words denoting colors. Thus there is often a wide variation in translations of such words in English Bibles. To provide a base for comparison, this article will follow the <span class="sc">rsv</span> except as noted.</p>
<p>Colors mentioned most often in the OT and NT are the following:</p>
<p>“Black” is the translation of five words in the OT and one in the NT, expressing varying degrees of darkness. The words describe the color of lambs (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.32-33,35,40">Gn 30:32-33, 35, 40</a>), hair (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.31,37">Lv 13:31, 37</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.5.11">Sg 5:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.36">Mt 5:36</a>), skin (<a href="?bref=Job.30.30">Jb 30:30</a>), horses (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.2,6">Zec 6:2, 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.5">Rv 6:5</a>), the sky (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.45">1 Kgs 18:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.3">Is 50:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.28">Jer 4:28</a>), the day (<a href="?bref=Job.3.5">Jb 3:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.3.6">Mi 3:6</a>), the darkened sun (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.12">Rv 6:12</a>), and an invading army (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.2">Jl 2:2</a>). Job’s “blackness” (<a href="?bref=Job.30.28">Jb 30:28</a>) has been understood as disease or sadness.</p>
<p>“Blue” probably refers to a blue-purple dye obtained from Mediterranean mollusks. A popular color, it was considered less desirable in antiquity than “royal” purple. Both dyes were produced in Tyre, which at one time had a monopoly on the manufacture of blue and purple dye (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.7,14">2 Chr 2:7, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.24">Ez 27:24</a>). Ships of Tyre had awnings of blue and purple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.7">Ez 27:7</a>). Blue was used in the tabernacle fabrics (<a href="?bref=Exod.26.1">Ex 26:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.4.6-9">Nm 4:6-9</a>), the priests’ garments (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.5-6">Ex 28:5-6</a>), in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.7,14">2 Chr 2:7, 14</a>), and in the Persian court (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.8.15">8:15</a>). Blue is not mentioned in the NT.</p>
<p>“Crimson” is the English translation of three different Hebrew words. This red color of varying shades was derived from certain insects. The word describes certain fabrics in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.7,14">2 Chr 2:7, 14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.14">3:14</a>) and was used figuratively to describe sin (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>). The word translated “crimsoned” to describe garments from Bozrah (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.1">63:1</a>) probably means “vivid colors” rather than a specific hue.</p>
<p>“Gray,” a color found only in the OT, is used exclusively to describe old age—as in gray hair or gray-headed (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.38">Gn 42:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.44.29-31">44:29-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.25">Dt 32:25</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.12.2">1 Sm 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.6,9">1 Kgs 2:6, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.15.10">Jb 15:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.71.18">Ps 71:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.29">Prv 20:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.46.4">Is 46:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.7.9">Hos 7:9</a>). A different word used to describe dappled gray horses (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.3">Zec 6:3</a>) probably means “spotted” or “speckled.”</p>
<p>“Green” translates seven words in the OT and two in the NT. Most of the words refer to vegetation and are descriptive of the fresh or moist condition of plants rather than their color. The following are described as “green”: plants (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.30">Gn 1:30</a>), trees (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.23">1 Kgs 14:23</a>), branches (<a href="?bref=Job.15.32">Jb 15:32</a>), pastures (<a href="?bref=Ps.23.2">Ps 23:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.22">Jl 2:22</a>), herbs (<a href="?bref=Ps.37.2">Ps 37:2</a>), olive trees (<a href="?bref=Ps.52.8">Ps 52:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.11.16">Jer 11:16</a>), thorns (<a href="?bref=Ps.58.9">Ps 58:9</a>), leaves (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.8">Jer 17:8</a>), grass (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.39">Mk 6:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.7">Rv 8:7</a>), and wood (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.31">Lk 23:31</a>). In addition to various plants, a dove’s wing (<a href="?bref=Ps.68.13">Ps 68:13</a>), a couch (<a href="?bref=Song.1.16">Sg 1:16</a>), and a righteous person (<a href="?bref=Ps.92.14">Ps 92:14</a>) are also described as “green.” Idolatrous worship practices took place under “every green tree” (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.2">Dt 12:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.4">2 Kgs 16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.57.5">Is 57:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.20">Jer 2:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.6.13">Ez 6:13</a>), although the word actually describes the luxurious growth of the leaves rather than their color.</p>
<p>Another word, “greenish,” is derived from one of the OT words for “green” and refers to disease (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.49">Lv 13:49</a>) and fungus that forms on the walls of houses (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.37">14:37</a>).</p>
<p>“Purple” was the most highly valued dye in the ancient world. Encompassing shades varying from actual purple to red, it was obtained from mollusks of the Gastropoda class. The first people to use the dye were perhaps the ancient Phoenicians, whose name may come from a Greek word meaning “bloodred.” At any rate, the Phoenicians monopolized the purple industry for many years. Some fabrics were described as being purple: those used in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.4">Ex 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.26.1">26:1</a>), in the garments of the priests (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.5-8,15,33">28:5-8, 15, 33</a>), in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.7">2 Chr 2:7</a>), in the upholstery of Solomon’s chariot (<a href="?bref=Song.3.10">Sg 3:10</a>), and in decorations of the Persian court (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>). Purple was customarily worn by wealthy people and royalty (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.26">Jgs 8:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.31.22">Prv 31:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.7">Dn 5:7</a>). Mordecai was rewarded with a garment of purple (<a href="?bref=Esth.8.15">Est 8:15</a>). Daniel was given a similar garment (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.29">Dn 5:29</a>). It was worn by Assyrian soldiers (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.6">Ez 23:6</a>). Jeremiah described idols that were robed in blue and purple garments (<a href="?bref=Jer.10.9">Jer 10:9</a>). Ships of Tyre had awnings of blue and purple (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.7">Ez 27:7</a>), and purple dye was an item of trade between Tyre and the people of Aram (v <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.16">16</a>). It is used once to describe the color of hair (<a href="?bref=Song.7.5">Sg 7:5</a>).</p>
<p>References to purple in the NT are fewer than in the OT but affirm the continued economic importance of the dye. Purple clothing denoted wealth (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19">Lk 16:19</a>). Jesus was robed in purple by Roman soldiers (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.17,20">Mk 15:17, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.2,5">Jn 19:2, 5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.28">Mt 27:28</a>, “scarlet”). The purple and scarlet garment of the harlot Babylon symbolized royal rank (<a href="?bref=Rev.17.4">Rv 17:4</a>). Lydia of Thyatira was a seller of purple fabrics (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.14">Acts 16:14</a>).</p>
<p>“Red” frequently refers to the natural color of certain objects mentioned in the Bible: skin (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.25">Gn 25:25</a>), pottage (v <a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">30</a>), the eye (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.12">49:12</a>, though the word used here may mean “sparkling” or “dark”), a sacrificial heifer (<a href="?bref=Num.19.2">Nm 19:2</a>), water (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.22">2 Kgs 3:22</a>), the face of a weeping person (<a href="?bref=Job.16.16">Jb 16:16</a>), wine (<a href="?bref=Pr.23.31">Prv 23:31</a>), the eyes of one drinking wine (v <a href="?bref=Pr.23.29">29</a>), clothing (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.2">Is 63:2</a>), a shield (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.3">Na 2:3</a>), and horses (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.8">Zec 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.2">6:2</a>). It is used figuratively to describe sin (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>). A leprous disease (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.49">Lv 13:49</a>), a spot on the skin (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.13.19,24,42-43">19, 24, 42-43</a>), and fungus on the wall of a house (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.37">14:37</a>) were discolored with a reddish hue. The Red Sea is mentioned frequently in the OT (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.19">Ex 10:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.15.4">15:4</a>), but the Hebrew words thus translated actually mean “Sea of Reeds.” However, in the NT the Greek word is actually the word “red” (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.36">Acts 7:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.29">Heb 11:29</a>). In the NT, red is used to describe the color of the sky (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.2-3">Mt 16:2-3</a>), a horse (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.4">Rv 6:4</a>), and a dragon (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.3">12:3</a>).</p>
<p>“Scarlet,” a brilliant red hue derived from certain insects, was used for fabrics and yarns and was highly valued in the ancient world (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.12">Rv 18:12</a>). It is difficult to distinguish between “scarlet” and “crimson” in the Bible. A scarlet thread was bound to the hand of Zerah at birth (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.28,30">Gn 38:28, 30</a>). The word describes certain fabrics in the tabernacle (<a href="?bref=Exod.25.4">Ex 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.26.1,31,36">26:1, 31, 36</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.27.16">27:16</a>), the priests’ garments (<a href="?bref=Exod.28.5-8,15,33">28:5-8, 15, 33</a>), rope (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.18,21">Jos 2:18, 21</a>), clothing (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.24">2 Sm 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.31.21">Prv 31:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.30">Jer 4:30</a>), lips (<a href="?bref=Song.4.3">Sg 4:3</a>), and soldiers’ uniforms (<a href="?bref=Nah.2.3">Na 2:3</a>). Some kind of scarlet material was used during the ratification of the covenant at Sinai (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.19">Heb 9:19</a>), for the cleansing of a leper (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.4-6">Lv 14:4-6</a>) and of a house (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.14.49-52">49-52</a>), for covering the articles on the table of the bread of the Presence (<a href="?bref=Num.4.8">Nm 4:8</a>), and for the ritual of the red heifer (<a href="?bref=Num.19.6">19:6</a>). Matthew described Jesus’ robe at his trial as scarlet (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.28">Mt 27:28</a>). The woman of <a href="?bref=Rev.17.3-4">Revelation 17:3-4</a> was dressed in purple and scarlet and seated upon a scarlet beast. The luxury associated with Rome is suggested by the description of clothing of purple and scarlet (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.16">Rv 18:16</a>). Scarlet, like crimson and red, is also used figuratively of sins (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>).</p>
<p> “White” translates a number of words found in the Bible. It is generally the color of natural objects such as goats (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.35">Gn 30:35</a>), hair (<a href="?bref=Lev.13.10">Lv 13:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.36">Mt 5:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.1.14">Rv 1:14</a>), diseased skin (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.6">Ex 4:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.13.4,17">Lv 13:4, 17</a>), manna (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.31">Ex 16:31</a>), snow (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.27">2 Kgs 5:27</a>), milk and teeth (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.12">Gn 49:12</a>), horses (<a href="?bref=Zech.1.8">Zec 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.3">6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.6.2">Rv 6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.19.11">19:11</a>), a donkey (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.10">Jgs 5:10</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>; <span class="sc">rsv</span> “tawny”), wool (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.18">Ez 27:18</a>), special stones (<a href="?bref=Rev.2.17">Rv 2:17</a>), light (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.2">Mt 17:2</a>), clouds (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.14">Rv 14:14</a>), and fields ready for harvest (<a href="?bref=John.4.35">Jn 4:35</a>). It is used to describe the color of curtains (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.6">Est 1:6</a>), clothing (<a href="?bref=Esth.8.15">Est 8:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.9.8">Eccl 9:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.9">Dn 7:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.16.5">Mk 16:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.5,18">Rv 3:5, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.4.4">4:4</a>), the garments of angels (<a href="?bref=John.20.12">Jn 20:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.10">Acts 1:10</a>), and a throne (<a href="?bref=Rev.20.11">Rv 20:11</a>). It is used figuratively to describe cleansing from sin (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.7">Ps 51:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.18">Is 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.12.10">Dn 12:10</a>) and the appearance of princes (<a href="?bref=Lam.4.7">Lam 4:7</a>).</p>

  <title>Colossae*, Colosse</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">COLOSSAE*, COLOSSE</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient city in Asia Minor, located in the southwestern part of present-day Turkey, and remembered primarily for the apostle Paul’s letter to the church there (<a href="?bref=Col.1.2">Col 1:2</a>). Colosse was near the Lycus River, a tributary of the Meander. The city flourished during the sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>. According to Herodotus, an ancient Greek historian, when the Persian king Xerxes came to Colosse, it was a city of great size. Another Greek historian, Xenophon, related that Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire, had passed Colosse still earlier on his way to Greece.</p>
<p>Colosse was situated in the region known as Phrygia and was a trading center at a crossroads on the main highway from Ephesus to the east. In Roman times relocation of the road leading north to Pergamum brought about both the growth of Laodicea, a city 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, and Colosse’s gradual decline. Colosse and Laodicea shared in the wool trade. Thus, the name Colosse was derived from a Latin name <span class="ital">collossinus,</span> meaning “purple wool.”</p>
<p>In the apostle Paul’s time Colosse was a small city with a mixed population of Phrygians, Greeks, and Jews. During his extended stay in Ephesus, Paul may have taught Jews and Greeks who lived in Colosse (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.10">Acts 19:10</a>). Epaphras, a Colossian, visited Paul in Rome and informed him about the condition of the church at Colosse (<a href="?bref=Col.1.7">Col 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.12">4:12</a>), then was later imprisoned with Paul (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.23">Phlm 1:23</a>). Others from the Colossian church included Philemon, Apphia, Archippus, and Onesimus, a slave who became a Christian (<a href="?bref=Phlm.1.16">Phlm 1:16</a>). Subsequent history is silent on the church at Colosse. The city was weakened under Islamic rule and was eventually destroyed in the 12th century.</p>

  <title>Colossians, Letter to the</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">COLOSSIANS, Letter to the</p>
<p class="fl">NT epistle, one of four “prison letters” attributed to the apostle Paul. As with Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon, Paul said he was in prison when he wrote Colossians (<a href="?bref=Col.4.3,10">Col 4:3, 10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.3.1">Eph 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.4.1">4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.6.20">6:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.1.12-14">Phil 1:12-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.9-10">Phlm 1:9-10</a>).

That seems to indicate that he wrote them at approximately the same time and that Tychicus delivered them.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Though the tradition that Paul wrote Colossians stands on solid ground, many scholars today debate its authorship. Reasons for their doubts fall into two main categories—theology and style.</p>
<p>First, some scholars question Paul’s authorship on theological grounds. Development of certain major theological themes in Colossians differs from the way they are set forth in the undisputed letters of Paul. In Colossians the doctrine of Christ is developed on the basis of a hymn about Christ in <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">1:15-20</a>. There he is seen as the “firstborn of all creation”; all things owe both their origin and continuing existence to him. In him resides all the fullness of deity. His death is interpreted not as a victory over sin, law, and death, but as a triumph over the cosmic authorities and powers.</p>
<p>To some scholars that suggests that the Christology in Colossians is much more “exalted” than in any of the undisputed letters. Yet Paul characteristically regarded Christ as highly exalted. He declared Christ to be creator of all things (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.6">1 Cor 8:6</a>) and set forth his lordship over the whole cosmic order by citing another hymn (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Phil 2:6-11</a>). Further, the kind of statements made about Christ in Colossians was demanded by the situation that had arisen in the city of Colosse. The heresy that had broken into the congregation required such statements.</p>
<p>Colossians also appears to teach doctrines about “the last things” and baptism that are somewhat different from the doctrines in the undisputed letters. In Corinthians, Paul based his teaching about the last things on the Jewish doctrine of the “two ages.” Judaism taught that in “this age” the world is under the tyranny of the evil powers, but that in “the age to come” God would set it free. In contrast, Paul’s teaching was unique in holding that the age to come had already come in the advent of Christ—though not in its fullness. Paul saw the time between the first and second advents of Christ as a period of conflict. Christ “must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.25">1 Cor 15:25</a>). Christ by his mission is liberating the present age from the evil powers, but the conflict will not end until his second coming. Therefore Christians live in hope of his future appearing. That future element of hope is not stressed in Colossians (though see <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>); rather, the emphasis is on a hope already present in heaven (<a href="?bref=Col.1.5">1:5</a>).</p>
<p>The doctrine of baptism in Colossians has been influenced by the stress on the realized aspect of hope. In his Letter to the Romans, Paul taught that baptized Christians live by faith in the resurrected Lord and are filled with hope for their future resurrection (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-11">Rom 6:1-11</a>). In Colossians he declared that baptized believers have not only died with Christ but have already been raised with him (<a href="?bref=Col.2.12-13">Col 2:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1">3:1</a>). The hope for the future is not for resurrection but for the manifestation of the life that is already hidden with Christ in God (<a href="?bref=Col.3.2-3">3:2-3</a>). Further, in Romans Paul stated that in baptism Christians have died to sin, so they no longer need serve it. Colossians, on the other hand, states that in Christ, Christians died to what can literally be translated as the “rudiments of the universe” (<a href="?bref=Col.2.20">2:20</a>). Many interpret that phrase to mean the basic religious teaching of the world. In Colossians, however, a strong case can be made that the phrase means “the elemental spirits of the universe” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). In either case, the emphasis, if not the meaning, differs from Romans.</p>
<p>Such theological matters have led many to believe that Paul could not have written the Letter to the Colossians. Rather, they see the letter as the product of a disciple of Paul who wrote at a later time. It should be noted, however, that the differences are of perspective or emphasis, not differences that result in contradiction.</p>
<p>The second reason for questioning Paul’s authorship of Colossians is literary, pertaining to vocabulary and style. The brief letter uses 34 words that occur nowhere else in the NT. Also, common Pauline terms are absent from passages where they might logically be expected. Further, the style of the letter, though similar to Ephesians, is notably different from other undisputed letters of Paul. In those letters the thoughts are usually developed in an argumentative style similar to the discussions of the Jewish scribes. Colossians is marked by stylistic features that one finds in hymns, liturgies, and early Jewish and Christian catechisms. But some obvious differences in theological perspective and literary style do not force one to conclude that someone other than Paul wrote Colossians.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">The date of Colossians depends on where Paul was imprisoned when he wrote. Traditionally scholars have held that all four “prison letters” came from Rome. If so, Paul would have written them between <span class="era">AD</span> 60 and 62.</p>
<p>The book of Acts indicates three places where Paul was imprisoned: Philippi, Caesarea, and Rome. Paul, writing 2 Corinthians before either of the last two imprisonments, suggested that he had already been in prison many times (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.23">2 Cor 11:23</a>). Ephesus is a likely place for one of those imprisonments (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-20.38">Acts 19–20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.32">1 Cor 15:32</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8-10">2 Cor 1:8-10</a>). Consequently, an increasing number of scholars name that city as the probable place where Paul wrote the prison letters. If that is correct, Paul wrote Colossians sometime between <span class="era">AD</span> 52 and 55. But the general consensus is that all the Prison Epistles were written in Rome, thus leading to <span class="era">AD</span> 60–62 as the date of Colossians.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">To identify the teaching that endangered the church at Colosse is a difficult task. The problem is not insufficient data but the opposite. Historical research has uncovered a wealth of information about the religious beliefs and practices that proliferated in the first-century Roman world. Asia Minor was a particularly fertile region for religions. Many people even belonged to more than one religious sect, and it was common to select ideas and practices of several religions. Christians were not exempt from those tendencies.</p>

<p class="h3">Colossian Heresy</p>
<p class="fl">Paul gave no formal definition of the Christian heresy in Colosse. Rather, he dealt with a number of issues without precisely identifying them. If one is given only the answers to a number of questions, however, it may be possible to recreate the questions from them. The reader of Colossians must attempt to define the tenets of the false teaching on the basis of Paul’s response to them.</p>
<p>Some scholars have concluded that the heresy rose out of the flesh-spirit dualism that became characteristic of later Greek and oriental Gnosticism. The later Gnostics taught that the material order of things is evil, so only what is free from matter is good. Other scholars, noting Paul’s injunctions against certain food laws, festivals, sabbaths, and external circumcision, have concluded that the false teaching rose out of Jewish beliefs. Since the tendency to blend a variety of ideas was so prevalent, both theories are probably true.</p>
<p>Paul regarded the heretical teaching as a “philosophy” based on human tradition (<a href="?bref=Col.2.8">2:8</a>). His prayer for the Colossians (<a href="?bref=Col.1.9-11">1:9-11</a>) and certain other remarks (<a href="?bref=Col.1.26-28">1:26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.2-3">2:2-3</a>) suggest that he was countering the notion that for certain people “philosophy” led to some special, perhaps magical, understanding. That philosophy was based on “the rudiments of the universe.” This phrase is open to two main lines of interpretation. First, the basic meaning of “rudiments” is “objects that stand in a row or series,” such as the letters of the alphabet. It can readily be extended to mean rudimentary principles or basic teaching. Such is the meaning in <a href="?bref=Heb.5.12">Hebrews 5:12</a>, where the term refers to the “first principles” of God’s Word. Second, the Greeks applied the phrase to the four physical substances they thought made up the world: earth, water, fire, and air.</p>
<p>A first-century <span class="era">BC</span> Greek text, referring to the followers of the philosopher Pythagorus, uses several of the same words that Paul applied to the Colossian heresy. A messenger of the highest gods carries the soul through all the elements of the world, from the lowest of earth and water to the highest. If the soul is pure, it remains in the highest element. If not, it is returned to the lower ones. The required purity is achieved by self-denial and certain cultic observances. The upper air contains the sun, moon, and stars, regarded as gods who control human destinies. In addition, the atmosphere around the earth is filled with spirit powers who are to be revered. In that way, the elements of the world become associated with the gods and spirit-powers who hold all people captive and determine their fate. With the help of magical knowledge and cultic ceremonies, human beings could not only escape from the destiny imposed by the spirit powers but even manipulate them for their own advantage.</p>
<p>To summarize, the phrase “rudiments of the universe” can refer either to basic religious teaching or to the spirit powers of the universe. The statements in Colossians make the latter meaning probable. Through his cross, Christ has triumphed over the rulers and authorities and has publicly exposed them (<a href="?bref=Col.2.15">2:15</a>). They do not rule the world order; he does (<a href="?bref=Col.1.16-20">1:16-20</a>). The divine “fullness” dwells in Christ, not in a remote deity (<a href="?bref=Col.1.19">1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">2:9</a>). The spirit powers are under the authority of Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.2.10">2:10</a>) and owe their existence to him (<a href="?bref=Col.1.16">1:16</a>). The “worshiping of angels” (a practice probably including homage paid to heavenly powers) is so wrong that it may have disastrous consequences (<a href="?bref=Col.2.18">2:18</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Main Features of the Heresy</p>
<p class="fl">A major dogma of the Colossian philosophy seems to have asserted that God was remote and inaccessible. Two factors point in that direction. First, the fascination with the angels and spirit-powers just discussed seems to indicate that the remote God was accessible only through a long chain of intermediaries. Christ seems to have been regarded as one of them, perhaps enthroned above them. Second, the philosophy evidently held to a dualism that separated the high God from creation. To approach him, seekers first had to be delivered from the evil influence of the material order.</p>
<p>How could human beings short-circuit or manipulate the angelic star powers who hindered them from reaching the high God? How could they be delivered from the enslaving power of matter? The philosophy evidently offered magical wisdom and insight as the answer. Through worshiping angels and observing special days and cultic practices (<a href="?bref=Col.2.16-18">2:16-18</a>), seekers could placate or please the intermediaries and get through to the divine “fullness.” By voluntary self-abasement, self-denial, and the achievement of visions (<a href="?bref=Col.2.18,21-23">2:18, 21-23</a>) they could escape the pull of the material order. The practice of self-denial through abstinence from food and possibly from sexual relations (“touch not” in <a href="?bref=Col.2.21">2:21</a>) seems to have been limited to special seasons for attaining the “vision” of God. Otherwise, the philosophy seems to have permitted freedom to engage in libertine practices (<a href="?bref=Col.3.5-11">3:5-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTeaching">Purpose and Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">A warning in <a href="?bref=Col.2.8">Colossians 2:8</a> points to the main purpose of the Colossian letter. The readers are admonished against following anyone who “makes a prey of you by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the universe, and not according to Christ” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). A false teaching was settling in and threatening the health of the congregation, so Paul wrote Colossians to counter it.</p>
<p>Paul approached the heresy by contrasting its teachings with the correct teaching his readers had received in the traditions previously delivered to them, probably by Epaphras (<a href="?bref=Col.1.7">1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.12-13">4:12-13</a>). God through Christ had qualified them to be uniquely his own people, his church (<a href="?bref=Col.1.12-14">1:12-14</a>). The proponents of the false teaching threatened to disqualify the Colossians from that favored position by persuading them not to hold fast to Christ, the Head of the church (<a href="?bref=Col.2.18-19">2:18-19</a>). Consequently, the traditions Paul cited mainly teach about Christ or about the church. The former are primarily related to the impressive hymn about Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">1:15-20</a>; referred to again in <a href="?bref=Col.2.9-10">2:9-10</a>, the latter mainly associated with baptism).</p>
<p class="h3">Christ</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">1:15-20</a> Christ is celebrated as the preexistent Creator of all and as the divine Redeemer of all. The “all” has cosmic dimensions. It includes the earth and the heavens, the visible and the invisible, the church and the universal powers. All things, including the heavenly powers, owe their existence, sustenance, and destiny to Christ. He is not to be regarded as one of the heavenly mediaries. He is the preeminent one in whom all the fullness of God dwells (<a href="?bref=Col.1.19">1:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.9">2:9</a>) and in whom human beings find fulfillment (<a href="?bref=Col.2.10">2:10</a>).</p>
<p>Paul gave special attention to the significance of Christ’s death. In the hymn of <a href="?bref=Col.1.1-29">Colossians 1</a> he explained the reconciling work of Christ by the phrase “making peace through the blood of his cross” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.20">1:20</a>). He contrasted the past and present experiences of the readers. Formerly they were alienated from God both in attitude and behavior. Now they are reconciled “in his body of flesh by his death” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.21-22">1:21-22</a>). As a consequence of that reconciliation, God transforms human character.</p>
<p>The death of Christ not only brings about restored relationships between individuals and God, but it also liberates them from the hostile intentions of the “principalities and powers.” Those powers seem to be demonic agents who bring accusations against human beings—accusations grounded on a “certificate of indebtedness” based on ordinances (laws). Paul proclaimed to the Colossians that God had removed the ground of those accusations, nailing it to the cross (<a href="?bref=Col.2.14">2:14</a>), and that in the cross he had publicly exposed and triumphed over the accusers (v <a href="?bref=Col.2.15">15</a>). Christ’s death was not a tragedy but a life-changing, liberating triumph over sin and evil powers.</p>
<p class="h3">The Church</p>
<p class="fl">The church is the “body” of Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.1.18,24">1:18, 24</a>), over which Christ is the Head and source of life (<a href="?bref=Col.2.19">2:19</a>). It is a community that the Father has qualified to participate in the heavenly inheritance with the saints; he has delivered it from the powers of the evil age and made it participate in the power of the age to come, “the kingdom of his beloved Son” (<a href="?bref=Col.1.13">1:13</a>). The church, therefore, should not live in fear of the “rulers” and “authorities,” but should participate in Christ’s triumph over those hostile powers.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">In writing to the Colossians, Paul followed a standard letter form of salutation, thanksgiving, prayer, main body, and concluding remarks. The salutation (<a href="?bref=Col.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>) carries greetings to the church from himself and Timothy. Then follows a statement of thanksgiving for the good condition of the community (<a href="?bref=Col.1.3-8">1:3-8</a>) and a prayer that the Colossians may be filled with a knowledge of God’s will, which will result in worthy conduct (<a href="?bref=Col.1.9-11">1:9-11</a>).</p>
<p>The first part of the body of the letter summons the Colossians to praise and then quotes and applies the great hymn about Christ (<a href="?bref=Col.1.12-23">1:12-23</a>). Specifically, the first part begins with a confessional thanksgiving to the Father for calling them to be his own unique people (<a href="?bref=Col.1.12-14">1:12-14</a>). A hymn follows, celebrating Christ as the sovereign Creator and Redeemer of all that exists (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">1:15-20</a>). The Colossians are participants in the results of Christ’s reconciling ministry (<a href="?bref=Col.1.21-23">1:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>The second part of the body of the letter describes Paul’s apostolic ministry (<a href="?bref=Col.1.24-2.5">1:24–2:5</a>). His was the task of making known the mystery of God concerning Christ to the Gentiles in general (<a href="?bref=Col.1.24-29">1:24-29</a>) and to the churches of Colosse and Laodicea in particular (<a href="?bref=Col.2.1-5">2:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>The third part of the body of the letter introduces Paul’s primary concern for the Colossian congregation: they are to follow the received tradition about Christ (that is, the teachings about Christ they had first accepted), and not to fall prey to the current false teaching (<a href="?bref=Col.2.6-23">2:6-23</a>). They are to walk in the light of the received tradition (vv <a href="?bref=Col.2.6-7">6-7</a>), and they are warned against the false philosophy (v <a href="?bref=Col.2.8">8</a>). The hymn of <a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">1:15-20</a> is again referred to, here stressing Christ’s divine lordship (<a href="?bref=Col.2.9-10">2:9-10</a>) and proclaiming his victory over the principalities and powers (vv <a href="?bref=Col.2.11-15">11-15</a>). Because of such a Christ, the Colossians are exhorted not to submit to the regulations and tenets of the false teaching (vv <a href="?bref=Col.2.16-23">16-23</a>).</p>
<p>The fourth part of the body of the letter summons the church to a life befitting Christians (<a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4.6">3:1–4:6</a>). Those who have been raised with Christ are to seek the things that are above (<a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">3:1-4</a>). That means they are to put off the traits and attitudes listed in a catalog of vices (vv <a href="?bref=Col.3.5-11">5-11</a>) and to put on the traits and attitudes listed in a catalog of virtues (vv <a href="?bref=Col.3.12-14">12-14</a>). In worship they are to conduct themselves in a unified and orderly way (<a href="?bref=Col.3.15-4.1">3:15–4:1</a>). The so-called “household code” concerning marriage, children, and slavery (<a href="?bref=Col.3.18-4.1">3:18–4:1</a>) appears in a context dealing with worship (<a href="?bref=Col.3.15-17">3:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.2-6">4:2-6</a>). The most pressing admonitions in the code are addressed to wives and slaves, groups that especially would crave the equality promised in the gospel (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.28">Gal 3:28</a>; note <a href="?bref=Col.3.11">Col 3:11</a>). So Paul probably used the code to call for order in the public worship service.</p>
<p>Paul concluded his letter by first stating that Tychicus and the recently converted slave, Onesimus, would inform the church about his circumstances (<a href="?bref=Col.4.7-9">4:7-9</a>), and then added a series of greetings (vv <a href="?bref=Col.4.10-18">10-18</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">COMMANDMENT, The New</p>
<p class="fl">Christ’s commandment for Christians to love each other. The phrase “new commandment” occurs four times in the NT, all in the writings of John (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.7,8">1 Jn 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.5">2 Jn 1:5</a>). Initially, it was a command given by Jesus to his disciples on the night of his arrest: “I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other” (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The same command occurs elsewhere (<a href="?bref=John.15.12,17">Jn 15:12, 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.8">Rom 13:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.22">1 Pt 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.11,23">1 Jn 3:11, 23</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.7,11-12">4:7, 11-12</a>) but is not called “new” in those passages.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LoveasaCommandment">Love as a Commandment</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus had already commanded his disciples to love their enemies (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.43-45">Mt 5:43-45</a>) and to love their neighbors as themselves (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.25-37">Lk 10:25-37</a>). The “new commandment” demanded that Christians love each other. In no sense did it overrule the other two love commands. Jesus’ command to love those within the church was intended to produce a compelling testimony to those outside the church. It would offer them demonstrable proof (1) that his followers were Christlike in their love toward one another; (2) that the basis for vital human community could be found “in Christ”; and (3) that, by extension, what Jesus said about himself and his work was really true (<a href="?bref=John.13.35">Jn 13:35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.21-23">17:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus chose the word used to describe the OT law, giving similar authority to his new commandment. In fact, the law included commands to love (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.18,34">Lv 19:18, 34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.19">Dt 10:19</a>). The apostle Paul thought of love as the “law of Christ” (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.2">Gal 6:2</a>), and James called the love command “the royal law” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.8">Jas 2:8</a>) and “the perfect law of liberty” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.25">1:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.12">2:12</a>).</p>
<p>The word “commandment” had another meaning as well. Many Jews in Jesus’ day wrongly supposed that the commandments were given in order that men, by obeying them, could show themselves worthy of God’s blessing (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.3">Rom 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.2">Gal 3:2</a>). Jesus made it clear, however, that love was a natural result of God’s blessing, not a necessary condition for it. For Jesus, the commandment expressed how one who is already living in the joy of God’s blessing should act. Disciples were commanded to love in the same sense that branches were “commanded” to bear fruit: the branch by abiding in the vine, the Christian by abiding in Christ (<a href="?bref=John.15.4">Jn 15:4</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="WhatMadeItNew">What Made It New?</p>
<p class="fl">The character of the new commandment comes from the “new covenant” (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>), which Jesus inaugurated at the Last Supper. Under the new covenant, God “writes” his law on the hearts of believers (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.16">Heb 10:16</a>). That is, he actively works in them in the person of the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.27">Ez 36:27</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.3">2 Cor 3:3</a>), and gives them a new willingness to obey him (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.4">Rom 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16">Gal 5:16</a>). The new commandment of love is the all-embracing, single requirement of the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.8,10">Rom 13:8, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.14">Gal 5:14</a>). Obedience, therefore, is a gift, because “love is from God; and every one who loves is born of God” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.7">1 Jn 4:7</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>). It is the fruit of faith (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.23">3:23</a>) and part of the gospel itself (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.11">11</a>).</p>
<p>The close relationship between the new covenant and the new commandment may explain partly why the command to love was called “new.” Christ’s incarnation inaugurated a new age. “The darkness is disappearing,” John wrote, “and the true light is already shining” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.8">1 Jn 2:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Anticipating his ascension into heaven (<a href="?bref=John.13.33-35">Jn 13:33-35</a>), Jesus left one inclusive commandment to preserve his disciples in the new age until its consummation at the Judgment Day (<a href="?bref=John.5.28-29">Jn 5:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.17">1 Jn 4:17</a>). Obedience to the new commandment was supposed to identify them as Jesus’ disciples during his absence (<a href="?bref=John.13.35">Jn 13:35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.21-23">17:21-23</a>). The love command was thus new in the sense that it had a special function in the new age.</p>
<p>What made the age new was that Jesus Christ’s coming had revealed God the Father with an unprecedented and incomparable clarity (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">Jn 1:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.10.30">10:30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.6-8">17:6-8</a>). No prophet had ever been able to say, “Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father” (<a href="?bref=John.14.9">14:9</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Therefore Jesus’ demand that the disciples love each other “as I have loved you” (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">13:34</a>) was, by every human standard, new and astonishing. No human had ever loved perfectly like Jesus (v <a href="?bref=John.13.1">1</a>). To follow his example of love, then, was a new commandment. The greatness of Jesus’ love moved him to “lay down his life for his friends” (<a href="?bref=John.15.13">15:13</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Accordingly, John drew the conclusion that “we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.16">1 Jn 3:16</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). It follows that love means never shutting one’s heart against another Christian in need (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.17">17</a>), but rather rejoicing to sacrifice one’s temporal good for another’s blessing.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">COMMANDMENTS, The Ten</p>
<p class="fl">List of commands given by God to Moses. The Ten Commandments are stated twice in the OT; first in the book of Exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-17">20:2-17</a>), in a passage describing God’s gift of the commandments to Israel, and second in Deuteronomy (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.6-21">5:6-21</a>), in the context of a covenant renewal ceremony. Moses reminds his people of the substance and meaning of the commandments, as they renew their covenant allegiance to God. In the original language, the commandments are called the “Ten Words” (from which comes the name Decalogue). According to the biblical text, they are “words,” or laws, spoken by God, not the result of human legislative process. The commandments are said to have been written on two tablets. This does not mean that five commandments were written on each tablet; rather, all ten were written on each tablet, the first tablet belonging to God the lawgiver, the second tablet belonging to Israel the recipient. The commandments pertain to two basic areas of human living: the first five concern relationships with God, the last five, relationships between human beings. The commandments were given first to Israel in the making of the covenant at Mt Sinai, shortly after the exodus from Egypt. Though the date of the Sinai covenant cannot be fixed with certainty, it was probably around 1290 <span class="era">BC</span>. In order to understand the commandments, it is necessary first to understand the context in which they were given.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheContextoftheCommandments">The Context of the Commandments</p>
<p class="fl">The commandments are inseparable from the covenant. The making of a covenant between God and Israel at Sinai was the formation of a particular relationship. God made certain commitments to Israel and in return imposed certain obligations upon Israel. Although Israel’s obligations are expressed in detail in a mass of precise legal material, they are given their most precise and succinct expression in the Ten Commandments. The commandments set down the most fundamental principles of all Hebrew law, and the detailed laws contained in the Pentateuch are for the most part applications of the principles to particular situations. Thus, the role of the Ten Commandments in ancient Israel was to give direction to a relationship. They were not to be obeyed simply for the sake of obedience, as though obedience accumulated some kind of credit. Rather, they were to be obeyed in order to discover the fullness and richness of life in a relationship with God.</p>
<p>The commandments in ancient Israel were not an ethical code or compilation of advice on the fundamentals of morality. The covenant was between God and a nation; the commandments were directed toward the life of that nation and its citizens. Consequently, the initial role of the commandments was similar to that of criminal law in a modern state. Israel was a theocracy, a state whose king was God (<a href="?bref=Deut.33.5">Dt 33:5</a>). The commandments provided guidance to the citizens of that state. In addition, to break a commandment was to commit a crime against the state and the ruler of that state, God. Thus, the penalties were severe, for the breaking of the commandments threatened the covenant relationship and the continued existence of the state. This state context is important for understanding the commandments in their initial form.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheMeaningoftheCommandments">The Meaning of the Commandments</p>
<p class="fl">The commandments begin with a preface (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2">Ex 20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.6">Dt 5:6</a>) that identifies the lawgiver, God, who gave the commandments to a people with whom he already had a relationship. The lawgiver is the God of the exodus, who redeemed his people from slavery and granted them freedom. The preface is vital, for it indicates that God’s gift of law was preceded by an act of love and grace. The commandments were given to a people who had been redeemed; they were not given in order to achieve redemption. There are some variations in the manner of numbering the commandments. According to some systems, the preface is identified with the first commandments. It seems preferable, however, to understand the opening words as a preface to all ten commandments. In the notes on the Ten Commandments that follow, there is first an explanation of the original meaning, then some indication of the contemporary meaning.</p>
<p class="h3">First Commandment: Prohibition of Worshiping Gods Other Than the Lord (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.3">Ex 20:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.7">Dt 5:7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The first commandment is in negative form and expressly prohibits the Israelites engaging in the worship of foreign deities. The significance of the commandment lies in the nature of the covenant. The essence of the covenant was a relationship, and the essence of relationship, from the biblical perspective, is faithfulness. God’s faithfulness to his people had already been demonstrated in the exodus, as indicated in the preface to the commandments. In turn, God required of his people, more than anything else, a faithfulness in their relationship with him. Thus, though the commandment is stated negatively, it is full of positive implications. And its position as first of the ten is significant, for this commandment establishes a principle that is particularly prominent in the social commandments (six through ten).</p>
<p>The contemporary significance of the commandment is in the context of faithfulness in relationship. At the heart of human life, there must be a relationship with God. Anything in life that disrupts that primary relationship breaks the commandment. Foreign “gods” are thus persons, or even things, that would disrupt the primacy of the relationship with God.</p>
<p class="h3">Second Commandment: Prohibition of Making Images (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4-6">Ex 20:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.8-10">Dt 5:8-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The second commandment prohibits the Israelites from making images of the Lord. To make an image of God, in the shape or form of anything in this world, is to reduce the Creator to something less than his creation and to worship the created instead of the Creator. The temptation for Israel to worship God in the form of an image must have been enormous, for images and idols flourished in all the religions of the ancient Near East. But the God of Israel was a transcendent and infinite being, and could not be reduced to the limitations of an image or form within creation. Any such reduction of God would be so radical a misunderstanding that the “god” worshiped would no longer be the God of the universe.</p>
<p>In the modern world, the shape of the temptation has changed. Few are tempted to take power tools and shape from wood an image of God. Nevertheless, the commandment is still applicable and the danger against which it guards is always present.</p>
<p class="h3">Third Commandment: Prohibition of the Improper Use of God’s Name (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.7">Ex 20:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.11">Dt 5:11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">There is a popular understanding that the third commandment prohibits bad language or blasphemy; however, it is concerned with the use of God’s name. God had granted to Israel an extraordinary privilege; he had revealed to them his personal name. The name, in Hebrew, is represented by four letters, <span class="ital">YHWH,</span> which are variously rendered in English Bibles as <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, Yahweh, or Jehovah. The knowledge of the divine name was a privilege, for it meant that Israel did not worship an anonymous and distant deity but a being with a personal name. Yet the privilege was accompanied by the danger that the knowledge of God’s personal name could be abused. In ancient Near Eastern religions, magic was a common practice. Magic involved the use of a god’s name, which was believed to control a god’s power, in certain kinds of activity designed to harness it for human purposes. Thus, the kind of activity that is prohibited by the third commandment is magic, namely, attempting to control God’s power, through his name, for a personal and worthless purpose. God may give, but must not be manipulated or controlled.</p>
<p>Within Christianity, the name of God is equally important. Through God’s name is access to God in prayer. The abuse of the privilege of prayer, involving calling upon the name of God for some selfish or worthless purpose or swearing falsely by it, is tantamount to the magic of the ancient world. In both, God’s name is abused and the third commandment is broken. Positively, the third commandment is a reminder of the enormous privilege of knowing God’s name, a privilege not to be taken lightly or abused.</p>
<p class="h3">Fourth Commandment: Requirement to Observe the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.12-15">Dt 5:12-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This commandment, once again, has no parallels in ancient Near Eastern religions; furthermore, it is the first of the commandments to be expressed in a positive form. While most of life was characterized by work, the seventh day was to be set aside. Work was to cease and the day was to be kept holy. The holiness of the day is related to the reason for its establishment. Two reasons are given, and though at first they appear different, there is a common theme linking them. In the first version of the commandment (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.11">Ex 20:11</a>), the Sabbath is kept in commemoration of Creation; God created in six days and rested on the seventh day. In the second version (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.15">Dt 5:15</a>), the Sabbath is observed in commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. The theme linking the two versions is creation: God not only created the world but also “created” his people, Israel, in redeeming them from Egyptian slavery. Thus, every seventh day throughout the passage of time, the Hebrew people were to reflect upon Creation; in so doing, they were reflecting upon the meaning of their existence.</p>
<p>For most of Christianity, the concept of “sabbath” has been moved from the seventh to the first day of the week, namely Sunday. The move is related to a change in Christian thought, which is identified in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on a Sunday morning. The change is appropriate, for Christians now reflect each Sunday, or “Sabbath,” on a third act of divine creation, namely the “new creation” that is established in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>
<p class="h3">Fifth Commandment: Requirement to Honor Parents (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.12">Ex 20:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.16">Dt 5:16</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The fifth commandment forms a bridge between the first four, concerned primarily with God, and the last five, concerned primarily with human relationships. On first reading, it appears to be concerned with family relationships only: children are to honor their parents. Although the commandment establishes a principle of honor or respect in family relationships, it is probably also related to the responsibility of parents to instruct their children in the faith of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.7">Dt 6:7</a>), so that the religion could be passed on from one generation to another. But instruction in the faith required an attitude of honor and respect from those who were being instructed. Thus, the fifth commandment is concerned not only with family harmony but also with the transmission of faith in God throughout subsequent generations.</p>
<p>With the fifth commandment, there is little need to convert its meaning into contemporary relevance. At a time in which so much education is undertaken beyond the confines of the family unit, the commandment serves a solemn reminder, not only of the need for harmonious family life, but also of the responsibilities of religious education which rest upon both parents and children.</p>
<p class="h3">Sixth Commandment: Prohibition of Murder (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.13">Ex 20:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.17">Dt 5:17</a>).</p>
<p class="fl">The wording of this commandment simply prohibits “killing”; the meaning of the word, however, implies the prohibition of murder. The word used in the commandment is not related primarily to killing in warfare or to capital punishment, both of which are dealt with in other portions of the Mosaic law. The word could be used to designate both murder and manslaughter. Since manslaughter involves accidental killing, it cannot be sensibly prohibited; it, too, is dealt with in other legislation (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.1-13">Dt 19:1-13</a>). Thus, the sixth commandment prohibits murder, the taking of another person’s life for personal and selfish gain. Stated positively, the sixth commandment preserves for each member of the covenant community the right to live.</p>
<p>In the modern world, a similar statute prohibiting murder exists in almost all legal codes, having become a part of state law, in addition to purely religious or moral law. Jesus, however, pointed to the deeper meaning implicit in the commandment. It is not only the act, but also the sentiment underlying the act, that is evil (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.21-22">Mt 5:21-22</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Seventh Commandment: Prohibition of Adultery (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.14">Ex 20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.18">Dt 5:18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The act of adultery is fundamentally an act of unfaithfulness. One or both persons in an adulterous act are being unfaithful to another person or persons. Of all such crimes, the worst is that which signifies unfaithfulness. It is for this reason that adultery is included in the Ten Commandments while other sins or crimes pertaining to sexuality are not included. Thus, the seventh commandment is the social parallel to the first commandment. Just as the first commandment requires absolute faithfulness in the relationship with the one God, so the seventh requires a similar relationship of faithfulness within the covenant of marriage.</p>
<p>The relevance of the commandment is apparent, but again Jesus points to the implications of the commandment for the mental life (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.27-28">Mt 5:27-28</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Eighth Commandment: Prohibition of Theft (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.15">Ex 20:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.19">Dt 5:19</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The eighth commandment establishes a principle within the covenant community concerning possessions and property; a person had a right to certain things, which could not be violated by a fellow citizen for his or her personal advantage. But while the commandment is concerned with property, its most fundamental concern is human liberty. The worst form of theft is “manstealing” (somewhat equivalent to modern kidnapping)—that is, taking a person (presumably by force) and selling him or her into slavery. The crime and the related law are stated more fully in <a href="?bref=Deut.24.7">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>. The commandment is thus not only concerned with the preservation of private property but is more fundamentally concerned with the preservation of human liberty, freedom from such things as slavery and exile. It prohibits a person from manipulating or exploiting the lives of others for personal gain.</p>
<p>Just as the sixth commandment prohibits murder, so the eighth prohibits what might be called “social murder,” that is, the cutting off of a man or woman from a life of freedom within the community of God’s people.</p>
<p class="h3">Ninth Commandment: Prohibition of False Witnessing (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.16">Ex 20:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.20">Dt 5:20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The commandment is not a general prohibition against lies. The wording of the original commandment sets it firmly in the context of Israel’s legal system. It prohibits perjury, or the giving of false testimony within the proceedings of the law court. Thus, it establishes a principle of truthfulness and carries implications with respect to false statements in any context. Within any nation, the courts of law must be able to operate on the basis of true information. If law is not based on truth and righteousness, then the very foundations of life and liberty are undermined. If legal testimony is true, there can be no miscarriage of justice; if it is false, the most fundamental of human liberties are lost. Thus, the commandment sought to preserve the integrity of Israel’s legal system while guarding against encroachments on personal liberties.</p>
<p>The principle is maintained in most modern legal systems—for example, in the taking of an oath before giving evidence in court. But in the last resort, the commandment points to the essential nature of truthfulness in all interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p class="h3">Tenth Commandment: Prohibition of Coveting (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.21">Dt 5:21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The tenth commandment is curious in its initial context. It prohibits the coveting, or desiring, of persons or things belonging to a neighbor (that is, a fellow Israelite). To find such a commandment in a code of criminal law is unusual. The first nine commandments prohibited acts, and a criminal act can be followed by prosecution and legal process if detected. But the tenth commandment, in contrast, prohibits <span class="ital">desires,</span> or covetous feelings. Under human law, it is not possible to prosecute upon the basis of desire, since proof would be impossible. While the crime involved in the tenth commandment could not be prosecuted within the limitations of the Hebrew system, it was nevertheless known by God, the “Chief Judge.” The genius of the commandment lies in its therapeutic nature. It is not enough merely to deal with crime once it has been committed; the law must also attempt to attack the roots of crime.</p>
<p>The root of almost all evil and crime lies within the self, in the desires of the individual. Thus evil desires are prohibited. If covetous desires are gradually eliminated, then natural desires may be directed toward God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePrincipleoftheCommandments">The Principle of the Commandments</p>
<p class="fl">The relevance of each commandment is understood in the underlying principle of the whole Decalogue. The principle of the whole is the principle of love, the heart of Israel’s religion. God loved Israel and called them in love. In return, he imposed one commandment upon Israel that superseded all others: “You shall love the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might” (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Dt 6:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). That is the central commandment of Israel’s religion. How to love the invisible, intangible God is partly explained in the Decalogue. For the person who loves God, the Ten Commandments provide guidance; they point to a way of life that, if lived, reflects love for God and leads to a deeper experience of God’s love. Therefore, the Ten Commandments continue to be a central part of Christianity. Jesus repeated the commandment to love from <a href="?bref=Deut.6.5">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and he called it “the first and greatest commandment” (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.37-38">Mt 22:37-38</a>). Consequently, the Ten Commandments still serve as a guide for the Christian community.</p>

  <title>Communication</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">COMMUNICATION</p>
<p class="fl">The act of transmitting a message. Fire, light, and smoke signals were probably the earliest methods of communicating over any distance. The Babylonians were the first to employ a primitive heliograph system (reflected sunlight) for signaling over short distances. A classic use of fire beacons was related by Aeschylus, a Greek dramatist, who described the news of the fall of Troy being relayed to Clytemnestra of Mycenae (c. 1084 <span class="era">BC</span>) by a dozen or more fires lighted on mountaintops. Similarly, the Lachish letters mention the use of fire signals to coordinate Israel’s defense against the Babylonians in 587 <span class="era">BC</span>. One letter concludes, “Let my lord know that we are watching for the fire signals of Lachish according to the signs my lord has given, because we do not see Azekah” (see <a href="?bref=Jer.6.1">Jer 6:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.34.7">34:7</a>). Later, fire signals were communicated from lighthouses such as the famous one at Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>Projected sounds have been used as a means of communication for thousands of years. Around 550 <span class="era">BC</span>, Cyrus of Persia built a network of towers from which a soldier shouted a message to a soldier in a nearby tower. According to legend, Alexander the Great had a giant megaphone that could carry a voice several miles. The historian Severus said that the Romans had brass speaking tubes to aid in defense along the northern wall in England. The Hebrews used the <span class="hebrew">shofar</span><span class="ital">,</span> a ram’s horn trumpet, to announce the new moon, the beginning of the Sabbath, and the approach of danger (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.4">Jos 6:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.7.16">Jgs 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.8.1">Hos 8:1</a>). Also, drum tattoos were used in communication. Even today Ashanti drummers in Ghana can render high and low tones that correspond to the tonal values of their language.</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations have uncovered thousands of ancient business and family letters written on clay tablets. As early as 2000 <span class="era">BC</span> the Assyrians maintained an informal postal service with eastern Anatolia (Asia Minor), using the caravans that frequently went between them. Later, Assyrian roads used by the army were also traveled by royal messengers of an efficient government mail service. A network of postal officials stationed in key population centers supervised the couriers and the mail. Clay tablets listing the place-names along a given route and the distances between them served as travel guides. Many royal letters of Assyria and other parts of the Middle East now help to reconstruct ancient history.</p>
<p>After the Persians ascended to power, they expanded the Assyrians’ postal service. The Persian “royal road” was built for government messengers, but it was open to all. It extended more than 1,600 miles (2,574 kilometers) from Sardis in Asia Minor to Susa, the Persian capital located near the head of the Persian Gulf (<a href="?bref=Esth.3.13">Est 3:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.8.10">8:10</a>). Royalty and officials traveling that highway found rest houses and inns about 15 miles (24 kilometers) apart, forts at strategic points, and ferries for river crossings. Ordinary travelers, averaging 18 miles (29 kilometers) a day, would spend three months traveling the full length of the road. The Persian dispatch service, however, relaying messages on fresh mounts between regular stages, probably traversed the same distance in two or three weeks. Describing a Persian messenger, the Greek historian Herodotus in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> reported that neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night prevented the swiftest possible completion of their appointed rounds.</p>
<p>At the same time as the Persians, the Chou dynasty in China had built up an efficient postal system. By the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Han dynasty of China and the Ptolemies of Egypt were operating the closest thing to a modern postal system that the ancient world was to know. A system of communication, necessary to rule the large Roman Empire, was devised in the reign of Caesar Augustus (27 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 14). The idea for the system came after the Romans annexed Egypt in 30 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Roman system did not stress speed or regularity, and although the mail moved speedily over short distances, it could take weeks over long distances or over water. Usually the mail system of the emperors did not benefit the ordinary public; rather, it was an added tax burden. Wealthy families had their own slaves deliver mail, businesses employed letter carriers, and the poor asked traveling friends to carry messages.</p>
<p>A letter written by Christian leaders in Jerusalem to the churches of Asia Minor was delivered by the apostle Paul and Barnabas (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.22-29">Acts 15:22-29</a>). Later, Paul requested Timothy (<a href="?bref=1Thes.3.2">1 Thes 3:2</a>), Tychicus (<a href="?bref=Col.4.7,9">Col 4:7, 9</a>), and Epaphroditus (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.25">Phil 2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.4.18">4:18</a>) to serve as messengers.</p>
<p>One means of local communication was the Roman <span class="ital">album</span> (Latin for “white”), a white-painted public bulletin board displayed in the center of a city on which messages were painted in black.</p>

  <title>Compassion</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">COMPASSION</p>
<p class="fl">Quality of showing kindness or favor, of being gracious, or of having pity or mercy. In the Bible, God is described as being like a compassionate father to those who revere him (<a href="?bref=Ps.103.13">Ps 103:13</a>). Jesus Christ exemplified God’s compassion in his preaching and healing (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.36">Mt 9:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.14.14">14:14</a>), in his concern for the lostness of humanity (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.41">Lk 19:41</a>), and finally in his sacrifice on the cross (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.8">Rom 5:8</a>). The church is to demonstrate compassion as one facet of the love Jesus commanded (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.4-7">Mt 5:4-7</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.8-18">Jas 2:8-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.18">1 Jn 3:18</a>). In scriptural usage compassion is always both a feeling and the appropriate action based on that feeling.</p>
<p>In the OT, compassion describes one aspect of God’s covenantal relationship with his people. One of the Hebrew words translated “compassion” is derived from a root word meaning “womb,” thus comparing God’s love with maternal love. God’s compassion, however, went beyond simply feeling the emotion; it was always demonstrated by definite acts that testified to his covenant with Israel. In spite of Israel’s rebellions, God still had compassion on his people (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.23">2 Kgs 13:23</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.15">2 Chr 36:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.78.38">Ps 78:38</a>), as well as on all his creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.145.9">Ps 145:9</a>). When Israel was chastised, the nation often feared that God had permanently withdrawn his favor (<a href="?bref=Ps.77.9">Ps 77:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.27.11">Is 27:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.63.15">63:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.13.14">Jer 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.21.7">21:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.13.14">Hos 13:14</a>). Yet God’s compassion would revive, and he would restore his people (<a href="?bref=Deut.30.3">Dt 30:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.135.14">Ps 135:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.1">Is 14:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.49.13">49:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.7-8">54:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.15">Jer 12:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.30.18">30:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.7.19">Mi 7:19</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, exactly reflected the Father’s compassion in his dealings with a fallen humanity. Jesus healed diseases and infirmities, cast out spirits, empowered others, and sent them out to do likewise. He fed hungry people and, in response to a mother’s grief, raised her only son from the dead. Following Jesus’ example, Christians are to show compassion in dealing with others. Jesus set forth the example in the parables of the Good Samaritan, who had compassion on a wounded traveler (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.33">Lk 10:33</a>), and the Prodigal Son, whose father had compassion on him when he returned home (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.20">15:20</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul listed a number of qualities that the Colossian church “as God’s chosen ones” was to incorporate; the first was compassion (<a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>). It was to be an integral part of the concept of Christian community. The Greek word means literally “to be moved in one’s bowels.” The term points to the very core of one’s inner feelings, much as the term “heart” does today. One’s intense inner feelings should always lead to outward compassionate acts of mercy and kindness.</p>

  <title>Concubinage*, Concubines</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CONCUBINAGE*, CONCUBINES</p>
<p class="fl">Practice of a man cohabiting with a woman (concubine) who is regarded only as his sexual partner or as a secondary wife in his household, of lower station than his primary wife. Concubinage was practiced in many ancient cultures, especially in Mesopotamia, where the king maintained a harem and where a private citizen might have one or two concubines in addition to his primary wife. Both types of concubinage are referred to in the Bible. A concubine was often a slave or part of the booty of war (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.30">Jgs 5:30</a>).</p>
<p>A man might have a concubine simply as an economical form of marriage, since no dowry, or bride-price, was required. A concubine could add to a man’s prestige by giving him two wives and thus an increased capacity for children. Such offspring were normally delivered onto the knees of the legal wife, thus establishing their legitimacy as family members. The concubine was also another servant to add to the man’s work force.</p>
<p>In the patriarchal period, concubinage was customary (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.24">Gn 22:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.22">35:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.12">36:12</a>), especially when the primary wife was childless (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-3">Gn 16:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.5-6">25:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.32">1 Chr 1:32</a>). A concubine could exercise certain rights and secure recognition and inheritance for her offspring (note <a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-28">Gn 49:1-28</a>, where the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah were included along with the sons of Leah and Rachel; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.35.22-26">Gn 35:22-26</a>). The custom was not suppressed by the Mosaic law, which must have included concubines in its treatment of multiple wives (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.17">Dt 17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.15-17">21:15-17</a>).</p>
<p>Concubinage continued through the period of the judges. Gideon had a concubine (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.31">Jgs 8:31</a>), as did an unnamed man of Levi’s tribe (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-30">Jgs 19</a>). Abuse of that man’s concubine by men from Benjamin’s tribe caused a bloody civil war (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.1-21.25">Jgs 20–21</a>). During the period of Israel’s monarchy, the luxury of concubines could be afforded only by kings such as Saul (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.7">2 Sm 3:7</a>), David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.13">5:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.15.16">15:16</a>), Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.3">1 Kgs 11:3</a>), and Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.21">2 Chr 11:21</a>). Royal harems existed in many other cultures of that time, including Egypt, Persia (<a href="?bref=Esth.2.14">Est 2:14</a>), and Babylon (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.2-3,23">Dn 5:2-3, 23</a>).</p>
<p>Concubines were thus a legitimate part of many ancient cultures, even when a society acknowledged the superiority of monogamous marriage. Concubinage was fostered by a desire for prestige and a large family, but could at times degenerate into a license for sexual freedom (cf. <a href="?bref=Eccl.2.8">Eccl 2:8</a>). Concubinage was part of the contemporary Greek and Roman cultures, but it was not in keeping with the teachings of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.1-9">Mt 19:1-9</a>).</p>

<p>A water tunnel was constructed during King Hezekiah’s reign to bring water from the Gihon Spring, once located outside the walls of Jerusalem, to inside the city proper (“pool,” <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.17">2 Kgs 18:17</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.14">Neh 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">Is 7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.22.9-11">22:9-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.2">36:2</a>).

  <body>
<p class="h1">CONFESSION</p>
<p class="fl">Admission, especially of guilt or sin; also, a statement of religious belief. “To confess” can mean to agree, to promise, or to admit something.</p>
<p>Two types of confession occur in the Bible. First, individuals confess that they have sinned and are therefore guilty before God, often confessing a particular sin (<a href="?bref=Lev.5.5">Lv 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.9">1 Jn 1:9</a>). In such confession one agrees or acknowledges that he or she has broken God’s law (<a href="?bref=Ps.119.126">Ps 119:126</a>), that its penalty is justly deserved (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.23">Rom 6:23</a>), and that in some specific way God’s standard of holiness has not been met (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.2">Lv 19:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.5.48">Mt 5:48</a>).</p>
<p>In OT times the high priest would confess the sins of the whole nation (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.21">Lv 16:21</a>); the nation of Israel was expected to confess when it had rebelled against the law of God (<a href="?bref=Lev.26.40">Lv 26:40</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.7.14">2 Chr 7:14</a>). Pious Jews were quick to confess; Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah confessed their nation’s sins, agreeing with God that his punishment of the people (including themselves) was just, yet praying for God’s mercy and deliverance (<a href="?bref=Dan.9.20">Dn 9:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.1">Ezr 10:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.1.6">Neh 1:6</a>).</p>
<p>Second, individuals confess that God is God and that he rules the world (<a href="?bref=1Chr.29.10-13">1 Chr 29:10-13</a>), that he is faithful in showing his love and kindness (<a href="?bref=Ps.118.2-4">Ps 118:2-4</a>), and that he has helped his people (<a href="?bref=Ps.105.1-6">Ps 105:1-6</a>). Such confession or agreement, expressed publicly in worship or song (<a href="?bref=Ps.100.4">Ps 100:4</a>), is spoken of in the OT as “blessing the Lord.”</p>
<p>The two types of confession are often combined in the Bible, producing many psalms of thanksgiving. In general those psalms contain some or all of the following ideas: (1) I have sinned; (2) I became ill and nearly died; (3) I prayed to God, who delivered me; and (4) now I offer this song of confession, which I promised him (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.1-31">Pss 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.30.1-12">30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.32.1-11">32</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.34.1-22">34</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">51</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.116.1-19">116</a>). The same Hebrew word means both “praise” and “confession of sin”; the two meanings were part of a single concept. The psalmist began by admitting sin and God’s justice, and he ended by confessing God’s forgiveness and delivering power.</p>
<p>Both those meanings also occur in the NT. Christians confess (that is, they declare as a matter of conviction and allegiance) that Jesus is the Christ and that they belong to him. “Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.32">Mt 10:32</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Not to confess Christ is the same as denying him (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.33">Mt 10:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.8">Lk 12:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.11-13">2 Tm 2:11-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.5">Rv 3:5</a>). The Christian life therefore begins with a confession of faith, a public declaration before witnesses (<a href="?bref=Rom.10.9-10">Rom 10:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.6.12">1 Tm 6:12</a>). An additional dimension of the Christian’s confession is provided in <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2">1 John 4:2</a>: one must confess that “Jesus Christ has come in the flesh,” that is, acknowledge Jesus’ divinity and preexistence as the Son of God (that he “has come”; see also <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.15">1 Jn 4:15</a>) as well as Jesus’ humanity and incarnation (that he has come “in the flesh”). The Greek word “confession” literally means “saying the same thing.” The Christian’s “good confession” is modeled after the pattern of Christ’s confession (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.12-13">1 Tm 6:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>In only a few passages does the NT discuss confession of sin. Those being baptized by John the Baptist publicly admitted their sins and repented (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.4-5">Mk 1:4-5</a>). All Christians, in fact, must agree with God that they are sinners (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.8-10">1 Jn 1:8-10</a>). James presented a fuller picture: when a Christian is ill, the elders are to visit and give the person opportunity to confess any sins. As in the Psalms, forgiveness and healing (the moral and the physical) are tied to confession. Recalling that principle, James urged Christians to confess their sins to one another.</p>

<p class="h1">CONFORM*, CONFORMATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Spiritual process of molding the believer into the image of Jesus. Paul speaks of this in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.28-30">Romans 8:28-30</a>:</p>
<p class="extract-fl-space">And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified (<span class="sc">niv</span>).</p>
<p class="fl">Since it is God’s desire and plan to have many sons and daughters, each believer has to be conformed to the prototype, Jesus. Note how the words “predestined,” “called,” “justified,” and especially “glorified” in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.29-30">Romans 8:29-30</a> are in the past tense. That is because God, from his eternal perspective, sees this process as having been completed already. From God’s perspective, believers have been glorified already because he sees them like his Son. But still, in the reality of time, they must undergo the process of being conformed to the image of God’s Son. God is working together all things in the lives of those who love him and are called according to his purpose. His goal is to conform each son and daughter to the image of his beloved Son.</p>
<p>When one continues to read the rest of <a href="?bref=Rom.8.1-39">Romans 8</a>, it is quite evident that the “things” God uses to conform Christians involve various kinds of suffering. Conformity to the image of Jesus Christ necessitates conformity to his death (see <a href="?bref=Phil.3.10">Phil 3:10</a>). Whereas transformation involves an inward, life-imparted change in our essential constitution, conformation entails outward pressure that works the image of Christ into his children. If they are to be made like him, they must have both. To know Jesus, as far as Paul was concerned, was to know both the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings. No one likes to suffer; no one wants to be a Job. But Job was insightful when he said, “When he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold” (<a href="?bref=Job.23.10">Jb 23:10</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Suffering produces an element in the believer that they do not inherently possess. God uses sufferings to conform them to the image of his Son.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus left his followers a pattern of suffering that cannot be avoided. This is the path that he, the pioneer of salvation, took. The Father perfected him through suffering (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.10">Heb 2:10</a>)—i.e., he, as a man, was made fully qualified to be our leader and even our merciful High Priest because of what he suffered on our behalf. Christians should expect to suffer, at least in part, some of the things Jesus suffered. Of course, this does not mean that any believer can repeat his unique act of suffering on the cross for redemption. Peter says that “Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21">1 Pt 2:21</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Greek word underlying “example” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">hupogramma</span><span class="ital">)</span> in common Greek usage designated a tracing tablet that contained the entire Greek alphabet. Students would use this to trace the alphabet. They would have to learn each letter, from alpha to omega. The life of Jesus, a life of suffering, is just such a tracing tablet. Those who learn to follow Jesus will be those who know what it is to suffer, for suffering is the means by which God conforms us to the image of Jesus.</p>

<p class="h1">CONGREGATION</p>
<p class="fl">Assembly of people, particularly for religious purposes. The Bible describes Israel as the congregation of the Lord because it was a covenant nation. The whole nation was considered to be the people of God (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.6-8,15-16">Ex 3:6-8, 15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.12.6">12:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.2-4">Is 1:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.1">14:1</a>).</p>
<p>As a chosen nation, Israel was to display God’s greatness in the midst of other nations (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.6-14">Dt 4:6-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1">Is 42:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.4">45:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.65.9,22">65:9, 22</a>). Because of this, the whole nation was called “the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel” (<a href="?bref=Num.14.5">Nm 14:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see also <a href="?bref=Lev.4.13">Lv 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.16.3">Nm 16:3</a>).</p>
<p>The church of the NT owes much to the spiritual heritage transmitted by the OT congregation of God’s people. This relationship of the church to the OT people of God is highlighted in several places (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.10-13">Heb 2:10-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9-10">1 Pt 2:9-10</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.9.1-8">Rom 9:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.16">Gal 6:16</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Conquest">Conquest</p>
<p class="fl">The conquest of Canaan by the Israelites is one of the most remarkable events of OT history: a loosely organized nomadic people successfully invaded a long-established culture secure in its protected urban centers. That achievement, according to the Scriptures, was the result of a promise God had made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that their descendants would possess the land (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.8">Gn 17:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.26.4">26:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.13">28:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.15-17">Ex 3:15-17</a>). Dispossession of the pagan inhabitants was a divine judgment on false religion and its associated immorality (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.1-5">Dt 7:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>Scholars who attempt to reconstruct the history of the Conquest face certain problems. Critical scholarship has run into conflict with statements in the Bible at three key points: chronology, rate of occupation, and the issue of Israel’s military annihilation of portions of the population of the Canaanite city-states.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheConqueredLand"/>

<p class="fl">Reference works and scholarly treatments of OT history often suggest a date for the exodus from Egypt in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> (1280 <span class="era">BC</span> or later). Several biblical references to that event would seem to call for an earlier date. According to <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kings 6:1</a>, construction of Solomon’s temple was begun in the fourth year of his reign, 480 years after the exodus. Since Solomon’s fourth year was about 960 <span class="era">BC</span>, that would place the exodus at 1440 <span class="era">BC</span>. In <a href="?bref=Judg.11.26-28">Judges 11:26-28</a>, when Jephthah, eighth of the named judges, argued with the king of Ammon about Israelite possession of land east of the Jordan River, he indicated that Israel had occupied this territory 300 years. Saul’s accession to kingship about 1020 <span class="era">BC</span> was still some decades off, so the later date proposed for the exodus does not allow sufficient time for the period of the judges. Further, the apostle Paul referred to a period of about 450 years from the exodus to Samuel’s day (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.20">Acts 13:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JoshuasCampaigns">Joshua’s Campaigns</p>
<p class="fl">A picture of a concentrated period for the Israelite conquest of Canaan is given in the book of Joshua. Yet many scholars insist that an earlier gradual penetration occurred (by Hebrews who supposedly did not accompany Jacob into Egypt), plus an extended mopping-up procedure that continued down to the time of the monarchy. Although the biblical record allows for later acquisitions in some areas (e.g., Megiddo and Beth-shan), there is no valid reason for rejecting the description of the major Conquest given in <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-12.24">Joshua 1–12</a>.</p>
<p>The Conquest began on the east side of the Jordan River under Moses. After Moses’ death, Joshua led Israel across the river, capturing first the fortified cities of Jericho and Ai. Those strategic victories provided access to the hill country and drove a wedge into the middle of Canaan. Two major campaigns followed—a southern and then a northern—which won for Israel in six years’ time the key cities of Canaan, defeating 31 kings and concluding the initial and principal stage of the Conquest.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Numbers 32</a> records the earlier assignment of territory east of the Jordan (Gilead and Bashan, acquired by the defeat of two kings, Sihon of the Amorites and Og of Bashan) to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Though their land had already been acquired, the men of those tribes were obligated to cross the Jordan with the rest to participate in the military conquest of Canaan itself.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Josh.2.1-8.35">Joshua 2–8</a> records the unusual events of the destruction of Jericho and Ai in the initial thrust westward. Those victories tended to demoralize the remaining cities of the land. Chapters <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">9</a> and <a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-43">10</a> describe the southern campaign, including the Gibeonites’ procurement of a treaty by deception. <a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-43">Joshua 10</a>, with its account of the remarkable rout of the enemy forces (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.10.9-12">9-12</a>) and miraculous prolonging of daylight, is the central passage about the southern campaign. In the subsequent battle, an alliance of five Amorite kings was crushed, the kings were killed, and the city-states of the area were destroyed, except for Jerusalem (later captured by David).</p>
<p>In his northern campaign, Joshua confronted a more formidable alliance. Yet even Jabin, the powerful king of Hazor, largest of the Canaanite cities, supported by his local vassals, was no match for Israel’s armies. <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-23">Joshua 11</a> describes that phase, then sums up the entire Conquest in verses <a href="?bref=Josh.11.16-23">16-23</a> and on through chapter <a href="?bref=Josh.12.1-24">12</a>.</p>

  <title>Conscience</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CONSCIENCE</p>
<p class="fl">Self-awareness that judges whether or not an act one has carried out or plans to carry out is in harmony with one’s moral standards. The conscience also functions to make a person aware of actions taken that were wrong.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="LetYourConscienceBeYourGuide"/>
<p>Both the English word “conscience” and the Greek word translated as “conscience” in the NT literally mean “to be with knowledge.” In the OT, Adam and Eve hid themselves from God in shame because their consciences passed moral judgment on their disobedience (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.8-10">Gn 3:8-10</a>). All human beings normally have the power of moral judgment: “The spirit of man is the lamp of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, searching all his innermost parts” (<a href="?bref=Pr.20.27">Prv 20:27</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Conscience, then, is a gift of God to provide light in matters of good and evil.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The word “conscience” is found 32 times in the NT (see <span class="sc">kjv</span>), especially in the writings of the apostle Paul. Conscience, in Paul’s writings, is regarded as passing judgment not only on conduct that has already taken place but also on what ought to be done in the future. The behavior of people who are without God’s law shows that the law’s requirement is “written on their hearts” (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.14-15">Rom 2:14-15</a>). Paul’s statement that every person should “be subject to the higher authorities” to avoid God’s judgment and “for the sake of conscience” presupposes that conscience can establish obedience as a moral requirement (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.5">13:5</a>).</p>
<p>To approve, or pronounce “not guilty,” is a function of conscience just as important as self-condemnation. Paul said, “I am not aware [using the same root word from which ‘conscience’ is derived] of anything against myself” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.4">1 Cor 4:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Yet conscience is neither a final court of appeal nor an all-sufficient guide: Paul went on to say, “I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.” In another passage Paul called on his conscience to verify his truthfulness, linking the verdict of conscience with the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.1">Rom 9:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.12">2 Cor 1:12</a>) without developing the nature of that relationship.</p>
<p>Justifying his ministry to the Corinthians, Paul asked them to judge his conduct in the light of their own consciences (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.1-2">2 Cor 4:1-2</a>). Insisting that God knew the motivation behind his conduct (that is, the “fear of the Lord”), he hoped that the Corinthians’ conscience would also recognize it (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.11">5:11</a>). When Paul wrote to Timothy, he linked a good conscience with sincere faith (<a href="?bref=1Tim.1.5">1 Tm 1:5</a>); when people depart from the faith, their consciences can become “seared” or rendered insensitive by their persistence in evil (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.2">4:2</a>).</p>
<p>Answering a question about meats offered to idols, Paul spoke of the conscience as exercising judgment on prospective as well as on past behavior (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-10.33">1 Cor 8-10</a>). Some had a conscience that was “weak” due to ignorance (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.7">1 Cor 8:7</a>); they failed to understand that everything is clean (<a href="?bref=Rom.14.20">Rom 14:20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CONSECRATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Separation of persons, utensils, buildings, or places from everyday secular uses for exclusive dedication to holy or sacred use. In the Bible consecration was demonstrated by an appropriate rite or vow. Hebrew expressions imply “separation” (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.2">Ex 13:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.8.10-12">Lv 8:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.19">Dt 15:19</a>), “dedication” (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.12">Lv 21:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.6.9">Nm 6:9</a>), or “ordination” (lit. “filling the hand,” <a href="?bref=Exod.28.41">Ex 28:41</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.33">1 Kgs 13:33</a>). NT references are fewer, but they frequently connote the idea of holiness (<a href="?bref=John.10.36">Jn 10:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.14">1 Cor 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.4.5">1 Tm 4:5</a>).</p>
<p>In church usage, especially among hierarchical denominations, the term describes solemn rites that establish a bishop. It is also used to describe dedication of shrines, reliquaries, cathedrals, elements of the Mass, or buildings set aside for ecclesiastical functions.</p>
<p>Protestant teaching stresses the priesthood of every believer. Thus all Christians are “saints” (from the same root word as “consecration”), that is, devoted to God for life. In Roman Catholic doctrine the church consecrates (canonizes) great Christians as saints after they have died.</p>
<p>Consecration is significant in relation both to God and to the world. The apostle Paul spells out the term’s meaning in <a href="?bref=Rom.12.1-2">Romans 12:1-2</a>, stressing that consecration involves a living sacrifice to God. Its importance in relation to people and things is a basic theme of the apostle Peter’s first letter. In everyday life each Christian is meant to live out a “holy” and “royal” priesthood for God’s glory (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>). Christians consider the consecration of one’s own personality by the work of the Holy Spirit to be an important mark of spiritual maturity.</p>

  <title>Conversion</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CONVERSION</p>
<p class="fl">Total change in one’s direction in life or moral orientation. For Christians this means a change from an orientation that does not take God into account to one in which the person is submitted to Christ. Conversion is the result of repentance.</p>
<p>In the OT conversion is basically a turning or returning from one’s former course of life toward the Lord, the God of Israel. Israel often had to return to their God (<a href="?bref=Deut.4.30">Dt 4:30</a>), either as individuals (<a href="?bref=Ps.51.1-19">Ps 51</a>) or as a nation (<a href="?bref=Jer.4.1">Jer 4:1</a>); foreign nations needed to turn to God for the first time (<a href="?bref=Ps.22.27">Ps 22:27</a>). The characteristic feature is that one turns from wickedness (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.3">Jer 26:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.36.3">36:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.18.21,27">Ez 18:21, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.33.9,11">33:9, 11</a>), from a life of disloyalty to God to a life of obedience to God (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.20-21">Is 10:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.2">14:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.34.15">Jer 34:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.14.4">Hos 14:4</a>). Conversion means a change in inward orientation that finds expression in a changed lifestyle.</p>
<p>In the NT John the Baptist begins the call to conversion (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.4">Mk 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.3">Lk 3:3</a>), giving a prophetic call for people to change their minds (which is the root meaning of the Greek term) in the light of the nearness of God’s kingdom. This change of life must include a change in actions to prove its reality (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.8">Mt 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.8">Lk 3:8</a>). Jesus preached the same message (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17">Mt 4:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.15">Mk 1:15</a>), adding that since the kingdom had arrived in his person, obedience to him was part of the good news of conversion. Yet it could also be bad news, for one would be damned if he failed to make this radical change (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.20">Mt 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.3-5">Lk 13:3-5</a>). Conversion is radical but also simple, for it requires the simplicity of a child who commits his whole self, not the calculating self-protectiveness of the adult (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.3">Mt 18:3</a>).</p>
<p>Outside the Gospels, “conversion” is not a frequently used term except in the book of Acts, where it forms the call to commitment climaxing evangelistic sermons (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.38">2:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.19">3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.22">8:22</a>), describes the commitment of new Christians to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.35">9:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.21">11:21</a>), and pictures the change of life as a turning from darkness to light (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.18-20">26:18-20</a>). Later writers look back upon conversion (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.16">2 Cor 3:16</a>), worry about Christians converting to paganism or Judaism (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.9">Gal 4:9</a>), and call for the reconversion of Christians who have left the faith and are in danger of judgment (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.19-20">Jas 5:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.5,16,22">Rv 2:5, 16, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.19">3:19</a>).</p>
<p>As in the OT and in the preaching of John and Jesus, conversion has three factors. First, it is a turning <span class="ital">from</span> something, which includes specific sins, false gods, or simply a life lived for oneself (<a href="?bref=1Thes.1.9">1 Thes 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.9.20-21">Rv 9:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.16.11">16:11</a>). Second, conversion is a product of the will of God and his gracious working in the world (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.18">Acts 11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.2.4">Rom 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.10">2 Cor 7:10</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.25">2 Tm 2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.9">2 Pt 3:9</a>). Third, conversion is a turning <span class="ital">to</span> someone, a commitment of one’s whole life to God in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.15">Acts 14:15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.9">1 Thes 1:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.25">1 Pt 2:25</a>). It is thus a total reorientation, whether spectacular or undramatic, sudden or gradual, emotional or calm, in which a person transfers his or her total allegiance to God.</p>

<p class="fl">Greek transliteration of a Hebrew term <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">korban</span><span class="ital">)</span> that occurs only in <a href="?bref=Mark.7.11">Mark 7:11</a>, where Mark provides an editorial explanation: corban is “given,” that is, “dedicated or given to God.” Hence, corban is an offering.</p>
<p>Jewish law allowed individuals to earmark their service or property as “dedicated to God,” thus removing it from profane use and giving it the character of an offering intended for God. To do this was a serious decision (according to the Mishnah, <span class="hebrew">Nedarim</span>) and was rarely reversed (<span class="hebrew">Nedarim</span> 5), for violation of a corban vow risked the severe consequences of divine judgment. In <a href="?bref=Mark.7.1-37">Mark 7</a> Jesus chastises the scribes because, theoretically, a son could exclude his parents from gaining any benefit from his estate by declaring his property “corban to them.” This in effect nullifies the fifth commandment (see <a href="?bref=Exod.20.12">Ex 20:12</a>), setting rabbinic traditions against the law of Moses. Worse still, if the son repented of his vow—arguing that it had been given in haste—a rabbinic tribunal would no doubt forbid a reversal of corban (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.12">Mk 7:12</a>; cf <a href="?bref=Num.30.1-2">Nm 30:1-2</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Prominent city of Greece, formerly the capital of the ancient province of Achaia, in which the apostle Paul preached. The site of ancient Corinth lies to the west of the isthmus separating the Peloponnesian Peninsula from mainland Greece. The ancient ruins, largely of Roman origin, are situated about four-fifths of a mile (1,285 meters) from present-day Corinth. The area was inhabited from Neolithic times. Corinth is dominated by an outcrop of rock known as Acrocorinth (Upper Corinth). The grandeur of the Greek period is evident in the remains of the temple of Apollo, whose massive columns dominate the site. Entrance to the ancient city is by means of a very broad avenue that lies in a straight line from the city gate. That avenue ends in the marketplace, with roads leading from there to the Acrocorinth. In the apostolic period the city was a bustling commercial and industrial center boasting a population of almost 700,000.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoryandArchaeology">History and Archaeology</p>
<p class="fl">By the mid-eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Corinth, strategically located along east-west trade routes, was a flourishing city-state. From 350–250 <span class="era">BC</span> it was the most prominent city in Greece. Then the Roman military machine began a relentless march to forge a vast empire. In 146 <span class="era">BC</span> Corinth was completely destroyed and lay in ruins for a century. In 46 <span class="era">BC</span> Julius Caesar moved a mixed group of Italians and dispossessed Greeks onto the site, and once more a magnificent city arose, this time as a Roman colony. As in most Roman cities, marble temples dominated the landscape. The city was supplied with water from an underground well. It became a cosmopolitan city attracting tradespeople from all over the world, though its reputation grew simultaneously as a center of luxury, indulgence, and vice. A large colony of displaced Jews (part of the Diaspora) developed in the city, the group that undoubtedly attracted the apostle Paul.</p>
<p>In 1896 the American School of Classical Studies at Athens secured permission to begin excavation of the ancient site. The finds are of special interest for study of the NT Corinthian epistles. An important archaeological find was a doorway lintel bearing a portion of an inscription designating the building as the “Synagogue of the Hebrews.” It may have marked the synagogue in which the apostle preached (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">Acts 18:4</a>). Another discovery was the <span class="greek">bema</span><span class="ital">,</span> or judgment place (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">12-17</a>), located in the center of the <span class="greek">agora</span><span class="ital">,</span> or marketplace. There Paul appeared before Gallio, proconsul of Achaia. The dates of Gallio are well established by other inscriptions. He must not have arrived in Corinth before July, <span class="era">AD</span> 51. Paul appeared before him after having ministered in the city for almost 18 months. That would date Paul’s arrival in Corinth as the beginning of <span class="era">AD</span> 50.</p>

<p>Corinth is significant in the history of the church because of the ministry of the apostle Paul in response to his Macedonian vision (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.9-10">Acts 16:9-10</a>). He established churches in Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, and possibly Athens on his way to Corinth. <a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-28">Acts 18</a> describes Paul’s work at Corinth, first with the Jews, who violently opposed him (v <a href="?bref=Acts.18.6">6</a>). At Corinth, Paul engaged in the longest ministry up to that time in either of his first missionary journeys. The Corinthian church, born in such a crucible of paganism, had to go through serious birth pangs. Paul’s letters to the group of believers there reflect a large catalog of troubles for Christians in the first century, a list not unlike the problems of Christians today.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">There is no doubt about who wrote 1 Corinthians, for all scholars agree that the apostle Paul wrote it on his third missionary journey while he was living in Ephesus. By this time Paul was a mature, middle-aged (perhaps 55 years old) missionary, fully seasoned from planting churches around a quarter of the Mediterranean world.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateandOrigin">Date and Origin</p>
<p class="fl">Paul worked in Corinth from about <span class="era">AD</span> 50 to 52. After a brief stay in Jerusalem, he returned to his missionary work, this time at Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.1-41">Acts 19</a>), where he ministered for three years (<span class="era">AD</span> 53–55/56). During this period, he wrote at least three letters to Corinth and made a visit as well. His first letter, often called “the previous letter,” is referred to in <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.9-11">1 Corinthians 5:9-11</a>. We know from this reference that the letter was misunderstood, but we know little of its content, for it has been lost.</p>
<p>Sometime in <span class="era">AD</span> 55, after hearing reports from Chloe’s household (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.11">1 Cor 1:11</a>), who were probably members of Chloe’s house church, he dictated a second letter to Corinth, our 1 Corinthians. This was probably sent off in the hands of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.17">16:17</a>). Paul would later write a third letter to Corinth, called “the letter of tears” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.2-3">2 Cor 2:2-3</a>), and then finally 2 Corinthians.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Corinth was a seaport city, destroyed by the Romans in 146 <span class="era">BC</span> and rebuilt in 46 <span class="era">BC</span> by Julius Caesar. After 27 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was the Roman capital of Achaia, where the proconsul had his residence (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12">Acts 18:12</a>). The city itself was really three cities: the port of Cenchrea, about eight miles (13 kilometers) to the east, where ships from the Aegean would unload; the port of Lechaion, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) to the west on the Gulf of Corinth, where the ships would be reloaded, their goods having been transported in wagons over the isthmus and the ships on rollers; and the city itself on the high ground in between.</p>
<p>The acropolis of the city, on top of the steep, high Acrocorinth, contained the temple of Aphrodite, where 1,000 female slaves were dedicated to the service of this goddess of love. This distinctive cult of Corinth was dedicated to the veneration of Aphrodite, goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, who is identified with the Roman Venus. Associated with such religious practices was a general moral degradation. Corinthian morals were notoriously corrupt, even when compared with pagan Rome. Down in the city was the synagogue (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.4">Acts 18:4</a>); for while the city as a Roman colony was largely populated by Italians, it had attracted other peoples from the Mediterranean, among whom were the Jews.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTeaching">Purpose and Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The main concern of Paul in 1 Corinthians was the unity of the church. There was a self-centeredness in Corinth that resulted in building cliques within the church, in flaunting knowledge and liberty in the face of others scandalized by it, and in selfish displays in the worship services.</p>
<p>Two other major concerns also surface in the book. First, along with other pagan practices, the lax sexual ethics of Corinth had influenced the church; Paul needed to erect some barriers. Second, there was a problem in accepting the resurrection of the body; Paul realized that this issue had implications for the core of the faith and vigorously affirmed the resurrection.</p>
<p>Both of these latter two areas, as well as aspects of the unity issue (particularly their concern with knowledge), have been identified by some scholars as Gnostic motifs, leading to the conclusion that Paul was opposing a Gnostic party in Corinth. Careful examination reveals, however, that while some of the elements floating in the Corinthian milieu would later contribute to the development of Gnosticism, it would be anachronistic to call them gnostic. While recognizing protognostic ideas in the Corinthian situation, it is important to keep interpretation within the first-century context.</p>
<p>Thus, the focus of Paul’s concern was the church, its unity and purity. Paul was fighting to keep this church from disintegrating into a number of competing and bickering factions divided over moral and doctrinal issues. Furthermore, he wanted to keep the focus of the church on Jesus, the exalted Lord.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Greeting, <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-9">1:1-9</a></p>
<p class="fl">Paul begins with a standard greeting, followed by his usual thanksgiving prayer. Two features stand out. First, the greeting associates Sosthenes with Paul. While we cannot be sure who Sosthenes was, he was surely well known to the Corinthians; probably he was the Sosthenes whom <a href="?bref=Acts.18.17">Acts 18:17</a> identifies as the ruler of the synagogue, following the conversion of Crispus.</p>
<p>Second, Paul stresses the Corinthians’ abilities in speech, knowledge, and spiritual gifts. They had all of these, and these were genuine, but it was precisely these good things that they were abusing. Paul’s solution is not to suppress these gifts (indeed, he thanks God for them), but to place them in a new context.</p>
<p class="h3">Report from Chloe’s People, <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.10-4.21">1:10–4:21</a></p>
<p class="fl">The Corinthians had made Paul, Cephas (Peter), Apollos, and even Christ into party leaders. We are not sure what each of these groups stood for, but one might guess that the Pauline group stressed Paul’s slogans of liberty; the Petrine group, the need to hold to Jewish practices; and the Apollos group, the value of philosophical understanding and oratory. Whatever they stood for, Paul is appalled that it breaks their unity. His first response is to argue that his behavior was not calculated to build a following but to point to Christ. That is, he did not insist on personally baptizing converts; who performed these acts did not matter, since they were all baptized into Christ.</p>
<p>Paul immediately moves to the underlying issue, that of various persons wanting to show themselves better or wiser than others who did not have the insights of their party in the church. Their seeking for wisdom contradicts Paul’s preaching of the gospel.</p>
<p>First, the message of a crucified Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.18">1:18</a>) made no sense within the wisdom and values of either Jews or Greeks. It demanded a whole new way of looking on life—God’s way.</p>
<p>Second, God had not chosen them on the basis of their status in society; quite the contrary, he had made their only status the equal status they received from him (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.26-31">1:26-31</a>).</p>
<p>Third, their faith had not been based on Paul’s oratory but on the gifts of the Spirit that Paul had manifested (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.4">2:4</a>), which had convinced them that God was acting in Paul. Thus, it was not argument that led them to God, but God’s Spirit. Therefore it was the Spirit, not human reasoning, that would continue to reveal God to them. Unless they became fools with respect to the world’s ways of reasoning, they would never be able to rethink life from the perspective of the Spirit, who gives true wisdom.</p>
<p>Fourth, they were not acting on this spiritual level when they claimed Paul and others as party leaders; this activity demonstrates the evil impulse in human beings (“the flesh” or “fallen human nature”) at work since it elevates human servants rather than the God who works equally in each of them.</p>
<p>Fifth, these servants were working together to build one “temple” for God based on the one foundation in Jesus Christ, that is, the church. God alone will judge how each Christian contributes to the work of building the church. But woe to the person who divides the church, for “if anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.3.17">3:17</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). (Note that here the temple imagery is used collectively; the church is the temple. In chapter <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.1-20">6</a> it will be used individually; each Christian is the temple.)</p>
<p>Finally, he points to their overrealized eschatology, for with their spiritual gifts (which were genuine) and vaunted wisdom (which was worldly) they claimed they were reigning with Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.4.8-13">4:8-13</a>). Paul, with ironic sarcasm, points out how different this claim is from the lifestyle of the apostles. The apostles lived like Jesus—a life of suffering, expecting exaltation later. The Corinthians were trying to have their exaltation now without crucifixion.</p>
<p>Paul closes this section with an admonition. He softens his words toward some who would be responsive, urging them to copy his lifestyle. The teacher was the message (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.14-16">14-16</a>). Timothy will also faithfully live the truth before them. Then he threatens the “arrogant” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.4.18">18</a>), pointing out that he will not challenge their words but their spiritual power if he comes.</p>
<p class="h3">The Report from the Corinthian Messengers, <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-6.20">5:1–6:20</a></p>
<p class="fl">Paul now turns to three issues raised by oral reports from the messengers bearing the Corinthians’ letter to him.</p>
<p>The first issue is that of church discipline (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.12-13">5:12-13</a>). Paul cites a case of flagrant immorality—that of incest. This immorality was so clear (even pagans considered it immoral), that it was not a case of ignorance of Christian principles. Further, the church had taken no action but rather boasted in its tolerance, perhaps on the basis of a misunderstanding of Paul’s teaching on freedom from the law.</p>
<p>Paul presents three principles in this section: (1) the primary goal of church discipline is the repentance and restoration of the offender; (2) the secondary goal of church discipline is the protection of the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.6-8">5:6-8</a>); and (3) the church is not to seek to judge or control the actions of evil persons in the world—they are God’s responsibility—but to discipline those within the church (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.9-13">9-13</a>). Paul will use these principles also in the following chapters (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.12-16">7:12-16</a>).</p>
<p>The second issue is that of lawsuits between Christians (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.1-11">6:1-11</a>). The Corinthian society was as prone to litigation as our own, and Christians did not see anything wrong in suing each other. Paul was troubled. If Christians are to judge the world, they certainly should not bring the world in to judge issues within the church. Rather than put their cases before “those who are least esteemed by the church” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.4">6:4</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>, i.e., pagan judges), they should decide the cases within the church.</p>
<p>Paul has an even better way than bypassing the pagan courts, and that is to simply suffer the wrong (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.7">1 Cor 6:7</a>). Applying the teaching of Jesus quite literally (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.38-42">Mt 5:38-42</a>), Paul argues that it would be best to allow themselves to be defrauded. Instead, the Corinthians are willing to step on their brothers in Christ to get what they feel are their rights. This raises the issue as to whether greed is not still in their hearts (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-11">1 Cor 6:9-11</a>). While Paul accepts people who formerly did all sorts of evil (for Jesus has cleansed them), he makes it very clear that anyone presently practicing greed or immorality is not part of the kingdom, whatever their doctrinal commitments may be.</p>
<p>The final issue in this section is that of casual sexual intercourse (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-20">6:12-20</a>). In a world where virginity was important if a woman wished to be married and where slaves in the temple of Aphrodite were available as prostitutes, prostitution was the major form of casual sex. The libertine party used two slogans: “All things are lawful for me,” a saying that may well have been derived from Paul’s teaching, and “Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—that is, since the body works this way, it must be the Creator’s purpose. Paul qualifies rather than contradicts their slogans. Freedom is subordinate to other goals (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12,20">6:12, 20</a>). The body is not made to be used as we wish, but is to be dedicated to the Lord, as the doctrine of the resurrection demonstrates (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.13-14">13-14</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, sexual intercourse is an act of the whole person, unlike eating (Paul cites <a href="?bref=Gen.2.24">Gn 2:24</a>; cf. Jesus in <a href="?bref=Matt.19.5">Mt 19:5</a>). Therefore, this act takes a member (i.e., the person) from the body of Christ and makes him a unity with a prostitute (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15-17">1 Cor 6:15-17</a>). Thus immorality is unlike other sins that are external to the self, for it changes the self and thus defiles the body, the place where the Holy Spirit dwells. It disregards the fact that Christ has redeemed the body, and that the whole of the Christian belongs to God, not to the Christian.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Answers to the Corinthians, <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1-16.4">7:1–16:4</a></p>
<p class="fl">Now Paul turns to the Corinthians’ own issues, building on the answers he has already given to questions they did not ask.</p>
<p>The first issue is that of marriage (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1-24">7:1-24</a>). The slogan of the ascetic party in Corinth (perhaps a reaction against the libertines of ch <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.1-20">6</a>) was “It is good for a man not to touch a woman” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1">7:1</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). The Corinthians applied this slogan to both married and unmarried, arguing that married Christians should abstain from sexual relations. Paul clarified the matter with three points. First, he said that this was totally unrealistic, for total abstinence would lead to immorality (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.2,7-9">2, 7-9</a>). Second, when people get married they no longer own their own bodies; their bodies belong to each other for their mutual benefit (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.3-4">3-4</a>). Sexual refusal denies a spouse what rightly belongs to him or her. Third, abstinence is allowed for limited periods by mutual agreement as a type of fast to help focus on Christ (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.5">5</a>).</p>
<p>While Paul will address the issue of the unmarried more fully in <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.25-40">7:25-40</a>, in a side remark he indicates that he is himself content to be unmarried. But since some do not have this gift, full sexual expression in marriage is far better than fighting passion (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.7-9">7:7-9</a>). Once two Christians are married, divorce is unthinkable. A clear word of Christ proves this (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.31-32">Mt 5:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.11-12">Mk 10:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.16.18">Lk 16:18</a> and parallels), so there are no exceptions (Paul either does not know of the exception clause in <a href="?bref=Matt.19.9">Mt 19:9</a> or he understands it as referring to something like premarital unchastity discovered before the wedding, not to adultery after the wedding). Although in some cases a Christian couple must live separately, it is always with a view to reconciliation. The teaching of Jesus does not allow him to think of the marriage as ending (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.10-11">1 Cor 7:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>But what if the spouse is not a Christian? Paul applies his principles to a situation for which Jesus did not leave a clear word. First, since Jesus told Christians not to divorce, even in this situation the Christian may not initiate a divorce (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.12-13">7:12-13</a>). Second, since Christians are not to control or judge non-Christians (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.12-13">6:12-13</a>), the Christian does not need to continue the relationship if the non-Christian insists on a divorce (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.15">7:15</a>). Third, far from defiling the Christian (as the relationship in <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.15">6:15</a> does), the Christian will make the relationship holy, with positive results for the children and the possible salvation of the spouse (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.14,16">7:14, 16</a>). While this is no call to remain in situations of physical or sexual abuse, it is a call to remain faithful to a mixed marriage situation.</p>
<p>Paul does not believe that one normally needs to change one’s life situation to serve Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.17-24">7:17-24</a>). Therefore, normally each person should remain in that state of life in which he or she was when called to Christ. Paul’s examples show that he was thinking in terms of marriage or singleness, Jew (circumcision) or Gentile, slave or free, not in terms of situations that might be immoral in themselves. In the case of slaves, they can accept freedom if it becomes available, but it does not make an essential difference in their real state before God or their ability to serve Christ (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.21-23">21-23</a>).</p>
<p>The second issue is that of the unmarried (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.25-40">7:25-40</a>). Paul argues that single people and widows may marry—it is not wrong. Yet he advises them to remain single. Since all in this age is passing away, it would be good to stay single so as to avoid the extra suffering to which marriage exposes a person (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.25-31">25-31</a>). What is more, marriage always divides one’s attention between the Lord and the legitimate needs of the spouse. One must not abandon the spouse or ignore his or her needs in order to serve the Lord, but one can remain single so that the Lord can be the sole focus of life and devotion (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.32-35">32-35</a>). Finally, if one is in a situation in which marriage is expected, the person must make his own decision as to whether he should marry the woman for her sake (and perhaps that of the wider family) or whether he can and should simply care for her as a single person (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.36-38">36-38</a>). Paul closes this section by repeating his general principles (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.39-40">39-40</a>).</p>
<p>The third issue Paul deals with is that of food that has been offered to idols (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-11.1">8:1–11:1</a>). Most meat that was available in the marketplace came either from animals slaughtered as sacrifices in the temples or from groups of animals from which one was offered as a dedicatory sacrifice. To scrupulous Jews, all of this meat would be untouched. Furthermore, pagans invited Christians to feasts in their homes and to private feasts held in the precincts of pagan temples, where trade guilds also held feasts. Paul discusses these issues and uses them to teach wider principles of Christian conduct.</p>
<p>First, love, not knowledge, is the key to correct behavior (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1-13">8:1-13</a>). Some Corinthians felt superior because they were convinced that idols had no reality (there is only one God), and therefore any food offered to them was still fit to eat. Paul again accepts their slogans, but counters with the statement, “Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1">1</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). God is not concerned with what we know or eat, but he is concerned with whether or not we love our fellow Christians. The concern is not that a fellow Christian might become enraged because one indulged, but that he or she might have a vulnerable conscience and indulge himself, even though he believed it wrong and thus in his own eyes apostasizes from the faith (i.e., rebels against Christ). Such leading astray is not love. It would be better never to eat meat than to lead a fellow Christian into sin.</p>
<p>Second, he points out that one should subordinate one’s own interests to those of others, especially those of Christ and his gospel (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1-23">9:1-23</a>). Both the examples of the apostles, who expected the church to support them and their families (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.10.5-7">Lk 10:5-7</a>), and Scripture prove that Paul had the right to demand support from the Corinthians. This had not been his practice, for he had normally made tents to support his ministry, though he did accept gifts from other churches. Paul did this to prevent people from thinking he was peddling religion for profit (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.12">9:12</a>) and for the personal satisfaction of doing more than he had to do (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.16-17">16-17</a>). This was part of Paul’s larger policy of subordinating his own personal preferences and interests to those of Christ and his gospel (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.19-23">19-23</a>).</p>
<p>Third, the bravado of the strong who demonstrate their liberty with disregard of fellow Christians is spiritually dangerous (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.24-10.22">9:24–10:22</a>). It is not who begins but who completes the Christian life that counts; therefore, it is a life of discipline, not relaxed license (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.24-27">9:24-27</a>). Israel in the wilderness presents an example of failure in this regard. They had “baptism” and “the Lord’s Supper” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.2-4">10:2-4</a>), just like the church, yet most of them did not make it to the Promised Land. The reason God destroyed them was simple: they turned to sin. Likewise, the Christian has to be careful not to be so proud about faith and freedom that he becomes careless about sin and falls from the faith (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.12">12</a>). On the other hand, Christians need not be fearful, for the temptation is not more powerful than they are; God has provided a way of escape, if they will take it (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.13">13</a>).</p>
<p>Another link between the Israelites and the Corinthians pertains to partaking of a sacrificial meal (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.14-22">10:14-22</a>). In the Lord’s Supper there is a sharing of the blood and body of Christ, just as real as Israel’s sacrifices on the altar. Food offered to idols is also a sharing, not with the supposed god, but with the real demon that is behind the idol. To try to share at both tables is to provoke God’s jealousy just as Israel did (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.22">22</a>).</p>
<p>A summary of the discussion draws the three chapters together (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.23-11.1">10:23–11:1</a>). Since the food is not changed by being offered to idols, and since all food really belongs to God, one may eat anything sold in the market—do not ask any questions (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.25-26">10:25-26</a>). Likewise, the Christian may eat anything served at a dinner in the home of an unbeliever. However, if someone points out that the food was offered to idols, the Christian should pass it by, not because it would hurt him, but because it is an issue with the person who raised the question, and the Christian is concerned about the good of his neighbor (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.27-30">27-30</a>). In other words, follow Paul’s example as he patterns himself in turn after Christ, who served others rather than himself. Act so that God’s reputation and character shine through even in what one eats (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.31">31</a>); try to offend no one but to benefit each person in moving him toward salvation (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.32">32</a>).</p>
<p>The fourth issue Paul deals with is that of order in church meetings (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.2-14.40">11:2–14:40</a>). The Corinthians’ house churches had lively meetings, but rather than showing unity in Christ, they demonstrated selfishness. Paul had no desire to change what they did; he did want to change how they did it.</p>
<p>The first problem in the meetings was the behavior of married women (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.1-16">11:1-16</a>). The sign of marriage in that day was the wearing of a veil or distinctive hairstyle, as a ring is today. Women praying and delivering prophecies in church was no issue for Paul, but the women may have felt that this loosed them from their husbands (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.12.25">Mk 12:25</a>) and therefore was a reason to set aside their veils. Paul argues that husband and wife are intimately joined, just as humans are to God (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.3">1 Cor 11:3</a>). Therefore as humans should not shame but glorify God, so the wife should act toward her husband. Thus, while Paul approves of ministry by women, he puts marriage first.</p>
<p>The second problem in the meetings was that of making class distinctions (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.17-34">11:17-34</a>). Until the weekly Lord’s Supper began to be turned into the sacrifice of the Mass in the third and fourth centuries, it was a full shared meal. Middle- and upper-class Christians could come earlier to the church gatherings and also provide better food and drink for themselves. Following the customs of pagan clubs, they had no scruples against starting early and feasting as befit their class, so long as at least simple food was provided for the slaves and peasants who could not come as early (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.21">21</a>). This shamed the poorer Christians and made them feel class distinctions keenly (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.22">22</a>). This, argues Paul, is not the Lord’s Supper but a sham (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.20">20</a>).</p>
<p>Paul repeats the words of institution to point out that they all are participating in Christ’s body and blood (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16-17">10:16-17</a>), not their own meal. To do it in an unworthy manner, with divisions and class distinctions among them, is to profane his meal by failing to demonstrate the unity of his body, the church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.29">11:29</a>), and thus invite his judgment, which they were already experiencing. Instead, they should examine their own motives and truly gather as one to eat this common meal.</p>
<p>The third problem in their meetings was the use of spiritual gifts (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.1-14.40">12:1–14:40</a>). It is possible that some people in these house churches, under the influence of Gnostic ideas in which the spiritual is good and the material evil, and feeling inspired by a spirit, cried out, “Jesus [meaning the human Jesus as opposed to the spiritual Christ] be cursed.” It is not the Spirit of God saying this, argues Paul, for the Spirit in us cries the basic Christian confession, “Jesus is Lord.”</p>
<p>Others in these churches were exalting their own particular gift, especially the gift of tongues, shouting down others or refusing to give them a turn. There is only one Spirit and he gives all the gifts, Paul argues (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.4-6">12:4-6</a>). The Spirit manifests himself sovereignly in each Christian, not simply for the Christian’s own benefit, but for the good of all (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.7">7</a>). Since it is the Spirit, not a given manifestation, that the Christian has, the gifts manifested could change from meeting to meeting.</p>
<p>That same Spirit has made all Christians into one organic unity in Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.12-13">12:12-13</a>). Thus not only does the one Spirit give all the gifts—all are equally inspired—but all the gifts are equally needed for the proper functioning of the body of Christ (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.14-26">14-26</a>). No one can say that his lack of a given gift makes him less a part of the body; indeed, the less noticeable gifts may well be the more important. Thus, within the body of Christ, there are not only different manifestations of the Spirit through individuals in a given meeting, but different ministries or functions of individuals in the body (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.27-31">27-31</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not the demonstration of a particular gift that shows one’s spirituality, but how one demonstrates it—that is, whether one manifests it with love (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-13">13:1-13</a>). Any gift exercised for selfish purposes may be a genuine gift of the Spirit, but it is worthless to the individual (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.1-3">1-3</a>). This is because love is the opposite of selfishness (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.4-7">4-7</a>). In fact, the gifts of the Spirit are only for the period between Jesus’ first coming and his second coming, when the kingdom of God will be perfectly revealed and the King will be present in person, and thus the intermediary gifts of the Spirit will be no longer necessary (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.10,12">10, 12</a>). It is not giftedness but faith and hope that will have a reward then, and love, which is the greatest, because it will continue as Christians live in perfect love with each other and with Jesus (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.13.13">13</a>).</p>
<p>Applying this to Corinth, Paul argues that while one should desire all the gifts, love dictates that prophecy should be the gift of choice in the church meetings (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.1-25">14:1-25</a>). The Corinthians had evidently been stressing tongues. Tongues without interpretation is of little value to anyone except to the speaker himself. It does not build anyone up; its confusion seems madness to outsiders. Outside the church meetings there is a role for tongues, both as a sign of judgment (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.21">21</a>) and for private devotion (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.18">18</a>), but inside, only with interpretation. Prophecy, however, both builds up and convicts, and thus is to be sought in the meetings.</p>
<p>In the church meetings, then, both gifts and order are to prevail (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26-40">14:26-40</a>). All types of gifts are allowed expression with a goal of mutual edification, not selfish demonstration (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.26">26</a>). Tongues speakers must have an interpreter; both they and prophets must speak in turn, with time being taken to evaluate the utterances after every few speakers (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.27-33">27-33</a>). Furthermore, the women, who were perhaps chatting in the service (perhaps due to habits learned in Jewish synagogues, where they were segregated and did not participate) are to cease their chattering, pay attention, and learn, asking questions at home if they do not understand (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.34-36">34-36</a>). In his concluding summary, Paul states that all should be done in an orderly manner (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.14.37-40">37-40</a>).</p>
<p>The fifth issue Paul deals with is that of the resurrection of the dead (ch <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">15</a>). Some of the problems mentioned earlier concerning loose morals (chs <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-6.20">5–6</a>), ascetic denial, sexuality (ch <a href="1Cor.7.1-40">7</a>), or feeling one was resurrected already (ch <a href="1Cor.11.1-34">11</a>) point to the fact that some Corinthians did not believe in the resurrection of the body, though they apparently believed in the resurrection of Jesus and the immortality of the human soul.</p>
<p>Paul reaffirms that the resurrection of Jesus is an essential part of the gospel message (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-19">15:1-19</a>). The unified voice of the church was that Jesus not only died but rose again and appeared to numerous witnesses (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3-11">3-11</a>). If they were consistent in their antiresurrection argument, Christ could not have been raised. Yet if this were the case, the whole gospel message is false and all their hopes for salvation are in vain (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.12-19">12-19</a>).</p>
<p>Since Christ has been raised, Christians will also be raised because of their solidarity with him (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.20-28">15:20-28</a>). As they had experienced the results of being in Adam, so now they will experience the results of being in Christ. But resurrection does not happen at once. There are progressive stages: (a) Christ was first; (b) Christians will be raised at his coming; (c) Christ must reign until he extends kingdom rule over the whole world, destroying all demonic powers (including death itself); and (d) then he will turn over the perfected kingdom to the Father (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23-28">23-28</a>).</p>
<p>Resurrection hope also explains Christian practices such as baptizing people on behalf of others who had died (probably people who had turned to Christ but had died before they could be baptized, <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.29">15:29</a>), and willingness to risk death for Christ (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.30-32">30-32</a>).</p>
<p>Paul admits that there are intellectual problems involved, but these are solved when one realizes that resurrection includes both continuity and discontinuity (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.35-50">15:35-50</a>). Just as seed and plant are the same and yet different, and just as many types of bodies exist, so it is with the resurrection. What was perishable, dishonorable, weak, and physical (i.e., in Adam) will be raised imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual (i.e., in Christ). Indeed, it is only as Christians thus become like Christ, the heavenly man, that they can become part of God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>With excitement Paul shares his real hope, that of transformation (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.51-58">15:51-58</a>). At the coming of Christ the dead will be raised and transformed. But the living will also need transformation, and this will happen in a split second, making all of them impervious to death. Then they will truly know the victory already present in Jesus’ resurrection (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.54-57">54-57</a>). A concluding summary draws the practical conclusion that this teaching should give them assurance of a reward for anything done for Christ now (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.58">58</a>).</p>
<p>The sixth issue Paul deals with is that of the collection for the needy Jerusalem church (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>). Because of famine in Judea in the 40s, the church there had become impoverished. Partly because of the need and partly to further the unity of the church, Paul took up a collection in some of his churches for the Judean church. He answers the Corinthians’ practical queries by stating that the collection should be made weekly according to ability, not all at once when Paul arrives (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.2">16:2</a>). When he comes, he will send off the money with their own messengers. Paul remains vague about whether or not he will accompany them, allaying suspicions that somehow he plans to profit from it (cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-9.15">2 Cor 8–9</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Final Remarks and Closing, <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.5-24">16:5-24</a></p>
<p class="fl">Having come to the end, Paul discusses his travel plans, including his intention for a lengthy visit whenever he leaves Ephesus (cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-24">2 Cor 1</a>). Timothy was either coming with the letter or else would arrive shortly after another mission; they were to respect him and help him return. Paul points out that he urged Apollos to visit Corinth, in case some suspect Paul is against him. A closing formal exhortation to firm faith and love leads into his final customary greetings. He praises the Corinthian messengers who had brought him their letter (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.15-18">16:15-18</a>) and sends greetings from Aquila and Prisca (Priscilla), his comissionaries who had helped him found the church in Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2-3,18">Acts 18:2-3, 18</a>). Referring to the customary greeting in the church, he tells them to greet each other with a kiss on each cheek (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.20">16:20</a>). Paul then takes the pen from the scribe, as was normal, and writes the closing exhortation—placing a curse on those who do not love Jesus, the common Aramaic expression used in the church “Come, O Lord” (<span class="ital">Marana tha,</span> perhaps used to close services), and providing an assurance of his own love for them (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.21-24">21-24</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The apostle Paul is the acknowledged author of 2 Corinthians. While some scholars argue that <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.14-7.4">2 Corinthians 2:14–7:4</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1-13.14">10–13</a> are separate letters, only in the case of <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-7.1">6:14–7:1</a> is Paul’s authorship disputed. This section is admittedly a strange digression, but stranger still would be the thought that an editor could have inserted it in such an unusual place. Also the repetition of thought in <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.2">7:2</a> from <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.13">6:13</a> indicates that Paul is aware that he has digressed from his topic and is repeating a phrase to bring his readers back to the subject.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateandOrigin">Date and Origin</p>
<p class="fl">After writing both the “previous letter” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.9">1 Cor 5:9</a>) and 1 Corinthians from Ephesus in <span class="era">AD</span> 55, Paul continued to work there. Sometime during the next year a crisis arose in Corinth. Paul made a quick trip across the Aegean Sea, but he could not resolve the crisis, and due to the personal opposition of a leader in the church (likely an interloper bearing letters of recommendation from Jerusalem), he had to withdraw (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.1,5">2 Cor 2:1, 5</a>). Returning to Ephesus from this “painful visit,” Paul dispatched Titus with a blistering “letter of tears,” his third letter to that church (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.4">2 Cor 2:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.8,12">7:8, 12</a>), which led to the excommunication of the leader and the repentance of the church. This letter has been lost. Meanwhile a situation erupted in Ephesus during which death (probably execution) seemed so certain that Paul despaired of life (see <a href="?bref=Acts.19.23-41">Acts 19:23-41</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.16.4">Rom 16:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8-9">2 Cor 1:8-9</a>). Paul was not killed, but his escape seemed miraculous.</p>
<p>Leaving Ephesus in early <span class="era">AD</span> 56, Paul traveled north to Troas seeking Titus and news of Corinth. Unable to endure without news, he abandoned a promising mission in Troas and sailed to Philippi. There he met Titus, who explained the change of heart in Corinth. <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-9.15">Second Corinthians 1–9</a> responds to this situation, with chapters <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-9.15">8–9</a> preparing the Corinthians for an upcoming visit. Later Paul received further news from Corinth that renewed opposition to him was present. In response he penned the self-defense found in <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1-13.14">2 Corinthians 10–13</a>. Paul followed up the letter with a visit later in the year (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.2-3">Acts 20:2-3</a>). We do not know the response to 2 Corinthians or the outcome of his final visit, but later the troubled history of the Corinthian church continued, with another Christian leader needing to write a letter at the end of the century (Epistle of Clement).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The Corinthian house churches always had great diversity. While those who liked Apollos undoubtedly despised Paul’s crude style, others who preferred Peter likely appealed beyond Paul to the more genuine “original” apostles in Jerusalem with their Jewish customs (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.1-31">1 Cor 1</a>). Traveling teachers with letters of commendation from these apostles easily drew a following when they came to Corinth and undermined Paul’s authority and even his character. Furthermore, because of this outside influence, the collection for the poor in Jerusalem that Paul had initiated (<a href="?bref=1Cor.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>) was left in abeyance, both because it was connected to Paul and because the teachers themselves were taking money from the church. Paul writes to reaffirm his love and to repair the damage caused by the interloper.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTeaching">Purpose and Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">In the first section of the letter, Paul has two main purposes. The first is to cement his restored relationship with Corinth, explaining situations, forgiving those who opposed him, and reflecting on the nature of ministry. For Paul, ministry meant both intense suffering and comfort. Physical and emotional suffering came from the situations and people he worked with, but his knowledge of future reward and his experience of the power of God working in him brought profound joy and comfort. Due to his own recent brush with death, Paul also reflects on what happens at death. His expectation is to receive a resurrection body and be in the presence of Jesus at death.</p>
<p>The second purpose of this section is to get the collection for Jerusalem on track again. In this context he gives major teaching on giving and Christian economics: Christians are to follow Christ in giving freely; economic equality is the principle governing who gives to whom.</p>
<p>The second section of the letter is an impassioned self-defense, refuting the interloper’s claims to superiority. Neither oratory nor pedigree counts in Christian ministry, but only the call of God.</p>
<p>In both sections one observes Paul’s deep desire for the unity of the church, both unity within the local community and unity with leaders appointed by God, such as Paul.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Greeting, <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-7">1:1-7</a></p>
<p class="fl">A standard greeting (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-2">2 Cor 1:1-2</a>) comes before Paul’s usual thanksgiving (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.3-7">3-7</a>). The topic of the thanksgiving—comfort in the midst of suffering—is the topic of chapters <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-7.16">1–7</a>. Paul knows what it is to suffer, but it is in suffering that he has experienced God’s comfort, which he passes on to the Corinthians.</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Explanation, <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8-2.13">1:8–2:13</a></p>
<p class="fl">Paul informs them of the danger he had suffered in Ephesus, one so great that he did not believe he would survive. His eventual survival seemed like a virtual resurrection, reinforcing his conviction that God, not human strength, is the only Christian refuge (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.8-11">1:8-11</a>). In that and in all situations, Paul’s one boast is that of a clear conscience before God (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.12-14">12-14</a>).</p>
<p>Paul had told them of plans for a double visit (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.16.5-6">1 Cor 16:5-6</a>), but except for his brief “painful visit,” he had not fulfilled his plan (<a href="?bref=2Cor.1.15-2.4">2 Cor 1:15–2:4</a>). He defends himself from charges of either not planning in the Spirit or hypocritical vacillation. He was indeed as good as his word (cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.5.12">Jas 5:12</a>), for his life reflected God’s fulfilled promise in Jesus, but he had changed plans so as not to repeat the “painful visit” of the previous year. It was love, not fickleness, that motivated the delayed visit.</p>
<p>The Corinthians had responded to Paul’s “letter of tears” by excommunicating the person who had opposed Paul (not the same person as in <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-13">1 Cor 5</a>). Since the person became repentant, Paul called for his restoration to the community, freely and graciously forgiving the man who had hurt him. Excommunication is for the unrepentant; its purpose is complete once the person repents (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.5-11">2 Cor 2:5-11</a>).</p>
<p>Paul then recounted his journey from Ephesus to Philippi, when he sought news of the response to the “letter of tears” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.12-13">2:12-13</a>). After telling how he left an opportunity to minister in Troas to go to find Titus in Philippi, he breaks the narrative with a long digression.</p>
<p class="h3">Nature of Apostolic Ministry, <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.14-7.4">2:14–7:4</a></p>
<p class="fl">The apostolic ministry in which Paul took part is like the ministry of Jesus, one of suffering and glory. Even in suffering there is triumph in Christ, for Christians share Christ’s triumph. Yet just like the perfumes of a Roman triumph were joy to the victors but meant death for prisoners on their way to execution, so Jesus’ triumph is life to the believer and death to the unbeliever (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.14-17">2:14-17</a>).</p>
<p>This triumph may have sounded like a boast, but Paul is not engaging in self-exaltation. Indeed, he has no need of the letters of commendation that the interloper in Corinth carried from Jerusalem, for the Corinthians are themselves the proof of his ministry (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.1-3">3:1-3</a>). His boast is not in himself but in the new covenant in the Spirit, which unlike the old covenant is not fading (here Paul follows one Jewish interpretation of <a href="?bref=Exod.34.29-35">Ex 34:29-35</a>, that Moses put the veil over his face so the people would not see the glory fade), nor does it veil the presence of God. The new covenant is permanent; it reveals God directly in the Spirit. There is no deceit or hiddenness, for the message is not about Paul but about Jesus, who is light itself (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.4-4.6">2 Cor 3:4–4:6</a>).</p>
<p>Paul the messenger, however, is simply the cheap, breakable pot that contains the priceless treasure, revealing by way of contrast that the only power in the gospel is God’s power. This contrast of weakness and power is seen in the sufferings of the apostle, a type of living death modeled after the sufferings of Jesus, out of which the life of Jesus flows to others (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.7-15">4:7-15</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, despite intense suffering, Paul has courage, for he looks beyond this life to the rewards of the coming life. His whole motivation is one of faith, not sight, for he lives already for unseen realities (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.16-18">4:16-18</a>). When he dies, Paul expects to receive an eternal resurrection body. His hope is not of becoming a disembodied soul (“naked”) but of passing immediately into a glorified bodily life, already guaranteed by the presence of the Spirit. This hope was likely the fruit of his near brush with death in Ephesus, when he must have meditated and prayed about what would come at death (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-5">5:1-5</a>). Because this future includes Christ’s judgment, Paul wanted to make every effort to live in the light of that judgment, which he already saw by faith (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.6-10">6-10</a>).</p>
<p>Far from trying to commend or exalt himself, Paul was simply presenting what he was—a person filled with the love of Christ and convinced that all should live not for themselves but for Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.11-15">5:11-15</a>). No one should be valued from a merely human point of view, not Paul, nor even Christ (for Paul before his conversion had a human opinion of Christ that his conversion had radically changed); everyone should be valued from the point of view of the new creation. Paul’s job was simply to announce the reconciliation of the new creation, which God has already effected on his side and which only awaits a person’s ratification on the human side (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.16-20">5:16-20</a>).</p>
<p>Paul, then, was a coworker with God, announcing salvation, using every means consistent with God’s character to proclaim the message, and suffering everything imaginable to demonstrate the extent of God’s love (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.1-10">6:1-10</a>). Therefore, Paul had nothing against the Corinthians. If there was any blockage in their relationship with him, it must be on their side (<a href="?bref=2Cor.6.11-13">6:11-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Digression on Purity, <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14-7.1">6:14–7:1</a></p>
<p class="fl">Perhaps suspecting that the real block in the relationship was their love of the world, or that the Corinthians might not be totally over the problems mentioned in 1 Corinthians, Paul digressed into a discussion about the purity and sanctification of believers. There are two groups, light and darkness, Christ and the devil, believers and unbelievers. Therefore, as <a href="?bref=Exod.25.8">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Lev.26.11-12">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.52.11">Isaiah 52:11</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.27">Ezekiel 37:27</a>, and <a href="?bref=Hos.1.10">Hosea 1:10</a> show (phrases from these passages flow into each other in a style of chain quotation familiar to Jews), Christians should not be closely bound to unbelievers in marriage or in business, for it will affect their moral purity.</p>
<p class="h3">Return to the Nature of the Apostolic Ministry, <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.2-4">7:2-4</a></p>
<p class="fl">Picking up from <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.13">6:13</a>, Paul points out that the Corinthians have nothing substantial against him. He is not criticizing but simply appealing to them in love; even now he is prepared to die for them.</p>
<p class="h3">Explanation Concluded, <a href="?bref=2Cor.7.5-16">7:5-16</a></p>
<p class="fl">Having concluded his digression, Paul now returns to his journey, which he left in <a href="?bref=2Cor.2.13">2:13</a>. When he met Titus, he received good news about Corinth. He was relieved that his “letter of tears” had been effective, not in simply making them sorry but in bringing them to true repentance that yielded zeal, moral purity, and joy. Furthermore, their behavior toward Titus had been so impressive that Titus’s enthusiastic report of his own impressions had further cheered Paul.</p>
<p class="h3">Collection for Jerusalem, <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-9.15">8:1–9:15</a></p>
<p class="fl">In the context of restored relationships Paul turns to the sensitive topic of the collection for the church in Jerusalem, which had been impoverished through famines in Judea in the 40s. This collection was both an act of charity (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.11.27-30">Acts 11:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.10">Gal 2:10</a>) and a symbolic act of unity and fellowship between the Gentile and Jewish branches of the church.</p>
<p>The impoverished and suffering church in Macedonia (Philippi) had given eagerly. Therefore, Titus was coming back to help the Corinthians complete what they had begun the previous year (and probably dropped during the controversy with Paul, <a href="?bref=2Cor.8.1-7">2 Cor 8:1-7</a>). The principles of the collection are (1) the Corinthians should follow the example of Jesus, who became poor for them; (2) they should give freely what they can without regretting that they cannot give more, for God values the eagerness to give expressed in action, not the net amount of the gift; and (3) there should be an economic equality among sections of the church, no one section being enriched at the expense of another (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.16.18">Ex 16:18</a>). This economic equality extends to the relationship between two churches a continent apart (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.8-15">2 Cor 8:8-15</a>).</p>
<p>Titus and two absolutely trustworthy men appointed by the churches for this work will come to supervise the final gathering—Paul would have nothing to do with the money personally—for it is important that not only God but the world be able to see the honesty and integrity of the way the church handles money (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.16-24">8:16-24</a>).</p>
<p>In this section Paul points out that he does not need to argue the reasons for this collection; they were aware of them when they began to gather money the year before. This letter is not an argument for the collection but an encouragement to finish the work, so that when Paul arrives with representatives of other churches carrying their contributions, the Corinthians would not be embarrassed by their relatively wealthy churches not being ready or able to give generously, despite Paul’s boasts about their previous eagerness. In saying this, Paul shows himself diplomatic and insightful in motivating human behavior; he makes the best assumptions possible about the present situation (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.1-5">9:1-5</a>).</p>
<p>Paul would not want the Corinthians giving out of guilt, although he, like Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.19-20">Mt 6:19-20</a>), pointed out that the only real value of money is in giving it to help others. Rather, he wanted them so convinced of God’s generosity and ability to provide that they give freely and joyfully. God wanted to enrich them so they could give more. The giving would result in thanksgiving to God by the recipients, who would also pray for those who gave the gift, thereby binding the church together. A closing reminder of the extent of God’s own giving finishes the section (<a href="?bref=2Cor.9.6-15">2 Cor 9:6-15</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Self-Defense, <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1-13.14">10:1–13:14</a></p>
<p class="fl">There is an abrupt change in tone between <a href="?bref=2Cor.9.15">9:15</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1">10:1</a>. Now, instead of the tone of conciliation found in <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.1-7.16">1:1–7:16</a>, there is argument and defense, even threat. Paul’s apostleship has been attacked, and he will defend it with vigor.</p>
<p>Paul was indeed a humble person who preferred not to use his authority. Yet when forced, he had something more than authority; he had spiritual power, capable of destroying opposing arguments and bending all to obedience to Jesus. He would use that power in Corinth if he must, though up to that time he had been gentle and had shown this side of his ministry only in letters (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1-11">10:1-11</a>).</p>
<p>His opponents talked of their qualifications and compared themselves favorably with other ministers. Paul would not enter into this game of comparisons. God had set the sphere of his labors, which was the area in which he founded churches. He was the one who pioneered the church in Corinth, so it is his sphere of ministry, not the interloper’s (and such like him). They boasted in having reaped the benefits of his ministry; Paul could point to an original ministry given by God, for it is God’s commendation in the end that counts (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.13-18">10:13-18</a>).</p>
<p>Yet the Corinthian rebellion is serious enough to force him into self-defense, ridiculous as such an exercise is. He was shocked by how readily they turned away to every novel doctrine that came along. This tendency strikes fear in Paul’s heart (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.1-6">11:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>Paul had been criticized for refusing financial support from Corinth (even though he accepted gifts from other churches; cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1-27">1 Cor 9</a>). He would continue to refuse such support, for he wanted to undermine the claims of the interloper. If the interloper was really serving God alone, let him work on the same basis as Paul! But since the interloper was false at heart, serving Satan and not God, he sought money from the church. Paul was astonished that in the Corinthians’ vaunted wisdom they did not see through this hypocrisy, yet he hoped that even if he must play the fool in making a self-defense, they would at least accept a fool like Paul. The irony is that his very tender care and concern for the church, his gentleness, was being used against him as a supposed “weakness.” Paul, the opponent argued, knew he was false, so therefore did not dare take money from the Corinthians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.7-21">11:7-21</a>).</p>
<p>Interlopers claimed to come with authority from Jerusalem. They had letters from the apostles; it is unlikely, however, that the apostles would have approved of their activities. Still, they were Jews with respectable authority behind them. Paul felt compelled to state his own credentials. If they were Jews, he was just as pure a Jew. If they served Christ, could their work and sufferings match his? The list of sufferings both gives historical information not found in Acts and points to tireless labor, including days of fasting (“gone without food”) and nights spent in prayer (“gone without sleep”) (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.21-29">11:21-29</a>).</p>
<p>But this boasting was repulsive to Paul, so he isolated one particular suffering—his escape from Damascus, when he had to hide and slip out of the city in a basket. The story at once shows his effectiveness as an evangelist (in that he was a target of persecution) and shames him, for he could not defend himself and had to slip away under cover of darkness. Yet that weakness was indeed his glory (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.30-33">11:30-33</a>).</p>
<p>His opponents boasted in revelations from God. Paul knew that this boasting was senseless; however, if he must, he would tell them of a revelation superior to theirs, a time when he actually saw the inside of heaven (he is not sure whether it was a vision or an actual bodily experience). This probably happened about <span class="era">AD</span> 42, while Paul was in Tarsus, before Barnabas came for him (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.30">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.25">11:25</a>). Paul disliked telling about this, for God’s power is more easily seen in his weakness. In fact, Paul’s opponents were an affliction of Satan that God allowed to keep Paul humble and to demonstrate his power in Paul’s weakness. (The image of a “thorn in my flesh” is one of enemies—<a href="?bref=Num.33.55">Nm 33:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.13">Jos 23:13</a>; Paul also describes what he means more clearly in <a href="?bref=2Cor.12.10">2 Cor 12:10</a>). If vulnerability shows God’s power, Paul willingly accepts the weakness (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.1-10">12:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>Paul felt ashamed that he had to boast. The opponents boasted in coming from the Jerusalem “superapostles.” Paul pointed out that he was their equal, although both are nothing. God had set his mark upon Paul’s work. With biting irony he asks forgiveness for not having taken money from the Corinthians (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.11-13">12:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>Yet Paul would come a third time, and he would keep to the same policy of not taking any support from them but giving himself freely to them, just as Jesus had done on earth. Not only he, but all his envoys, kept to the same policy. No one could accuse him of deceit or inconsistency (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.14-18">12:14-18</a>). However, he feared coming to them, for he knew that the community had not just rebelled against him but was also in internal disorder. This disunity and immorality would humble and pain Paul (<a href="?bref=2Cor.12.19-13.4">12:19–13:4</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the Corinthians had better examine themselves. Were they really following Jesus or not? If so, they should see that Paul was also following Jesus. Yet Paul’s concern was not for his own position—he was content to be rejected (“weak”)—but for their following the truth. He hoped for their repentance, not to protect himself, but so that he need not be severe when he came (<a href="?bref=2Cor.13.5-10">13:5-10</a>).</p>
<p>Probably taking the pen from the scribe at this point, Paul closes with a final appeal to repent and come to unity as a church. Brief greetings from the church in Macedonia and a formal blessing closes his correspondence with the Corinthians (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.11-13">11-13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CORNELIUS</p>
<p class="fl">Roman centurion and the first gentile Christian mentioned in the book of Acts.</p>
<p>The story of Cornelius’s conversion through the preaching of the apostle Peter is recorded in <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-11.18">Acts 10:1–11:18</a>. Before his conversion, Cornelius was well known to the Jews as a person who feared God, prayed continually, and gave alms.</p>
<p>At first the church was composed only of Jews, who were reluctant to preach the gospel to Gentiles because law-abiding Jews never had fellowship with “pagans.” Peter, a law-abiding Jew, had scruples about entering a Gentile’s house and eating “unclean” food. Through a vision, however, God led Peter to Cornelius’s house to preach the gospel to him and his family and close friends. Before Peter had finished speaking, and before baptism or the laying on of hands could be administered, God dramatically demonstrated his acceptance of Gentiles into the fellowship of the church by giving them the gift of the Holy Spirit. Peter remained several days in Cornelius’s house, no doubt rejoicing in the centurion’s conversion and instructing him in his newfound faith.</p>
<p>Cornelius’s conversion represented a significant step in the separation of the early church from Judaism. Cornelius did not have to submit to any of the Jewish practices, such as circumcision or eating only ritually “clean” animals. For the first time a gentile believer was accepted into the church on equal terms with Jewish Christians.</p>

Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.38">Jer 31:38</a>) foretells a time when the Jerusalem wall will be rebuilt from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. Zechariah (<a href="?bref=Zech.14.10">Zec 14:10</a>) also envisions a period of security and prosperity epitomized by the presence of the Jerusalem wall, including the Corner Gate.</p>

  <title>Cornerstone</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CORNERSTONE</p>
<p class="fl">Term used in the NT to describe the exalted position of Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus used this term to speak of himself in the parable of the wicked tenants (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.42">Mt 21:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.10">Mk 12:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.17">Lk 20:17</a>). The setting for this parable was his final ministry in Jerusalem after he had cleansed the temple. The Jewish leaders had questioned him about his actions, and part of his reply was this parable, which symbolically addressed the situation between Jesus and the leaders. The Jewish leaders were represented in the parable as the tenants who were caring for the vineyard, which symbolized God’s people. Those tenants wickedly refused to honor the owner, who represented God, ultimately putting his son to death. The parable speaks of the coming death of Jesus in symbolic terms, and Jesus concluded it by referring the Jewish leaders back to their own Scriptures, specifically <a href="?bref=Ps.118.22-23">Psalm 118:22-23</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.28.16">Is 28:16</a>), which he understood as speaking of his rejection and exaltation. The Jewish leaders rejected Jesus, but God would exalt him as the cornerstone.</p>
<p>Second, the term is used in <a href="?bref=Acts.4.11">Acts 4:11</a>, which describes Peter’s defense before the Jewish rulers in Jerusalem. Peter explained to them the healing of the lame beggar by the temple gate, stressing that the healing took place by the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene whom they had crucified but whom God had raised from the dead (v <a href="?bref=Acts.4.10">10</a>). He then quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.118.22">Psalm 118:22</a> to confirm the events as being according to Scripture. It seems clear that Peter intended the rejection of the stone to refer to Jesus’ death and the placing of the stone as the cornerstone to refer to Jesus’ resurrection and exaltation. Thus, “cornerstone” designates Jesus in his exalted position with the Father.</p>
<p>The term is also used in <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.6-7">1 Peter 2:6-7</a>. In verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.4">4</a> Peter combines the idea of the rejection of the stone in <a href="?bref=Ps.118.22">Psalm 118:22</a> with the idea of the chosen and precious stone in <a href="?bref=Isa.28.16">Isaiah 28:16</a>, adding the idea of living from his own experience of Jesus’ resurrection. Peter is encouraging his readers to come to Jesus, that they may be built up as a spiritual house to God. This imagery is used to bring out the exalted nature of Jesus. In verse <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.6">6</a> Peter quotes <a href="?bref=Isa.28.16">Isaiah 28:16</a>, which speaks of the chosen and precious cornerstone, and related this to believers. In verses <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.7-8">7-8</a> he quotes <a href="?bref=Ps.118.22">Psalm 118:22</a>, referring to the rejection of the stone, and <a href="?bref=Isa.8.14">Isaiah 8:14</a>, which speaks of a stone of stumbling, and relates these to unbelievers. Peter’s purpose is to set before his readers the exalted position of Jesus and to encourage them to remember him to whom they were called.</p>
<p>It is evident that the OT concept of cornerstone is applied to Jesus to emphasize his exalted position with the Father and so to encourage the believer. In <a href="?bref=Eph.2.20">Ephesians 2:20</a> brief reference is also made to Christ Jesus as the cornerstone upon which the church is built.</p>

<p>Eye paint originally served the medical purpose of preventing flies from spreading infection by settling on the eyes, especially of sleeping persons. Substances such as kohl, malachite, and stibium had astringent and antiseptic properties and so were useful medications. These minerals were found and made into a paste by mixing them with gum arabic or water. The paint was compounded in a small bowl and applied either with a spatula or with the finger. Many such bowls dating to 800 <span class="era">BC</span> have been found at various Palestinian sites. Much earlier ones have been recovered from Egypt, where women used green malachite as an eye paint. In the Roman period antimony came into popular use.</p>
<p>When eye makeup became fashionable as a cosmetic procedure, the eyes were outlined in black, using galena or lead sulphide to make them look large, a practice that was followed particularly in Egypt, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. Eyebrows were also darkened by the application of a black paste. Jezebel decorated her eyes with cosmetics just before her dramatic death in about 841 <span class="era">BC</span> (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.30">2 Kgs 9:30</a>). In biblical Jewish society, painted eyes were associated with women lacking in virtue (<a href="?bref=Jer.4.30">Jer 4:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.23.40">Ez 23:40</a>). Henna was used as a paint and was applied to parts of the body, including the hands and feet, as well as the fingernails and toenails.</p>
<p>Oils, often perfumed, were used as a protection for the skin against the sun. Anointing with oil was considered so important that when the troops of the Israelite king Ahaz were repatriated in about 730 <span class="era">BC</span>, they were clothed, fed, and anointed (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.15">2 Chr 28:15</a>). Anointing a guest’s feet was a normal act of hospitality. The process may also have had hygienic significance. Many persons found it far more convenient to apply perfumes than to wash the body, particularly when water was in short supply.</p>
<p>An alabaster jar of ointment (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.37">Lk 7:37</a>) was an extremely expensive gift since it would have to be imported. At the archaeological dig of Lachish an excellent ivory ointment flask from about the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> was unearthed. A Babylonian inscription described a fragrant ointment made from the root of ginger grass, which was imported from Arabia. In NT times costly ointments most probably came from India.</p>

<p class="h1">COUNSEL, COUNSELOR</p>
<p class="fl">Advice; adviser, especially on legal matters (such as a lawyer). In Bible times a counselor in a king’s court was like a U.S. cabinet member today. A counselor might at times have been in line to succeed the king. Ahithophel, counselor to David and Absalom, gave advice as sound as the “oracle of God” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.23">2 Sm 16:23</a>). The elders of Israel counseled King Rehoboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.6">1 Kgs 12:6</a>), as did the friends with whom Rehoboam had grown up (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.7-8">7-8</a>), although his friends gave poor advice. The Bible mentions official counselors in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.11">Is 19:11</a>) and Babylon (<a href="?bref=Dan.3.2-3">Dn 3:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>A wise person seeks counsel when making plans: “Plans go wrong for lack of advice; many counselors bring success” (<a href="?bref=Pr.15.22">Prv 15:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). One’s counselors may be one’s parents (<a href="?bref=Pr.1.8">1:8</a>), older people (<a href="?bref=Ezek.7.26">Ez 7:26</a>), prophets (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.16">2 Chr 25:16</a>), wise men (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.18">Jer 18:18</a>), or friends (<a href="?bref=Pr.27.9">Prv 27:9</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Some counselors are evil, giving deceitful advice (<a href="?bref=Pr.12.5">Prv 12:5</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God also counsels. He frustrates the counsel of the nations who oppose him (<a href="?bref=Ps.33.10">Ps 33:10</a>), but his own counsel endures for many generations (v <a href="?bref=Ps.33.11">11</a>). No one may counsel the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.13">Is 40:13</a>). His Messiah is called “Wonderful Counselor” (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6">9:6</a>).</p>
<p>According to the NT, the Spirit counsels or comforts believers (<a href="?bref=John.14.16-17">Jn 14:16-17</a>). Christ sends the Holy Spirit to his people (<a href="?bref=John.16.7">16:7</a>), and the Spirit, also called the Spirit of truth, bears witness to Christ (<a href="?bref=John.15.26">15:26</a>). The ascended Jesus Christ is seen as a counselor in God’s heavenly court (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 Jn 2:1</a>, “advocate”).</p>

<p class="fl">Legal disputes were as much a part of life in Bible times as they are today. The ways that courts operated and trials were conducted, however, were quite different. Unless those customs are understood, modern readers of the Bible, thinking of contemporary legal procedures, may misunderstand the judicial accounts contained in the Bible.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OldTestamentLegalProcedures">Old Testament Legal Procedures</p>
<p class="h3">Exodus to Deuteronomy</p>
<p class="fl">The books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy contain most of the law in the OT, plus much other information about courts and legal procedures. Those books reveal how trials were conducted before Israel had kings. Certain changes in the legal system occurring after the establishment of the monarchy (c. 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>) are described in other OT books.</p>
<p>The OT depicts God as supreme lawgiver and judge, with Moses and later the kings as God’s deputies. But Moses did not create the law or decide the most difficult cases, which were referred directly to God for the decision (see <a href="?bref=Lev.24.10-23">Lv 24:10-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.32-36">Nm 15:32-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-11">27:1-11</a>). When disputes arose between Israel’s leaders, God intervened, judging the guilty party directly (<a href="?bref=Num.16.1-17.13">Nm 16–17</a>). Thus law is seen in the OT as a divine revelation, not a human creation, as it was regarded in ancient Babylon.</p>
<p>Usually it was not necessary to seek God’s direct guidance; precedent was sufficient. Elders were appointed in Israel to serve as judges of all but the most serious cases, relieving Moses of the burden of judging all the people himself (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-27">Ex 18:13-27</a>). <a href="?bref=Deut.16.18">Deuteronomy 16:18</a> specifies that “judges” be appointed in every town; in other passages those responsible for punishing criminals are called “the elders” (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.12">Dt 19:12</a>). The local judges were obviously nonprofessionals selected from the most respected members of each tribe or village. Difficult cases were referred to a central court of justice to be decided by the priests and, in the period of the judges, by the civil and military leader (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.8-12">17:8-12</a>). Deborah and Samuel were both examples of such “judges of Israel.” Samuel even conducted a circuit court in a number of different centers (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.4-5">Jgs 4:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.15-17">1 Sm 7:15-17</a>).</p>
<p>In Israel, as in other ancient societies, private prosecution was the norm. An individual with a grievance had to bring the case before the court. Only in situations of idolatry or other serious religious crimes were public prosecutions instituted (<a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-18">Dt 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.2-7">17:2-7</a>). Even in murder cases prosecution was left in the hands of the victim’s relatives. One relative, called the “avenger of blood,” had to pursue the alleged murderer to the nearest city of refuge, where a trial was held (<a href="?bref=Num.35.10-34">Nm 35:10-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.19.1-13">Dt 19:1-13</a>).</p>
<p>Trials were held in a public place, such as the open space near a city gate (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.19">Dt 21:19</a>). During the trial, the judges were seated, but the parties to the dispute and the witnesses stood. At least two witnesses were required to convict (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.15">19:15</a>). They had to be eyewitnesses who had caught the accused red-handed. Where such clear-cut evidence was lacking (for example in disputes over ownership), the litigants could take an oath to demonstrate their honesty (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.8-13">Ex 22:8-13</a>). If a husband suspected his wife of infidelity but had no proof, he could require her to undergo an ordeal of drinking “bitter water” to demonstrate her innocence (<a href="?bref=Num.5.6-31">Nm 5:6-31</a>).</p>
<p>When all the evidence had been presented, the judges gave their verdict. Those who had brought the accusation had the duty of enforcing the court’s sentence. Thus, a witness of idolatry had to throw the first stone at the guilty person’s execution (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.7">Dt 17:7</a>). Certain administrative officials may have had the job of writing down the court’s decision and seeing that it was enforced (<a href="?bref=Deut.16.18">16:18</a>). At times it may have been difficult for people to uphold their legal rights if their opponent came from a strong and wealthy family.</p>
<p class="h3">Other Old Testament Books</p>
<p class="fl">When Israel became a kingdom, certain changes were made in its judicial system. Most obviously, the king became the supreme judge who dealt with the most difficult cases. Solomon demonstrated his great wisdom in adjudicating between two women who both claimed to be the mother of a particular baby (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.16-28">1 Kgs 3:16-28</a>). Kings, who had all the power necessary to enforce their decisions, were expected to use it to help the weak members of society, such as orphans and widows (<a href="?bref=Ps.72.12">Ps 72:12</a>).</p>
<p>In practice, however, Israel’s kings did not always live up to that ideal. Absalom sowed the seeds of a revolution by telling those who came to the royal court that his father, King David, did not administer justice well (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-6">2 Sm 15:1-6</a>). One notable trial in the OT illustrates how royal judicial powers could be completely misused by unscrupulous rulers. Naboth was put to death on a trumped-up charge of blasphemy so that King Ahab could extend his palace grounds by taking over Naboth’s vineyard. Though the charge was false, the trial followed correct legal procedures. Two scoundrels were found to give evidence that they had heard Naboth curse God and the king (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.10">1 Kgs 21:10</a>); one witness would have been insufficient to secure conviction. Naboth was tried by the elders of the city in a public place. After being convicted he was taken outside the city and executed (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.11-13">11-13</a>). In other trials the prophet Jeremiah was charged with subversive activities more than once (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.1-24">Jer 26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.37.11-38.28">37:11–38:28</a>).</p>
<p>The prophets sometimes pictured God as taking Israel to court to answer for the nation’s misdeeds. God would list Israel’s sins and invite the people to explain their behavior. Sometimes heaven and earth, or the mountains, were called to be witnesses confirming the truth of God’s accusations. Finally judgment was pronounced (e.g., <a href="?bref=Isa.1.2-26">Is 1:2-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.43.1-28">43</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.2.4-37">Jer 2:4-37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.1-16">Mi 6</a>).</p>
<p>A theme running through the book of Job is Job’s request for a trial. Job thought that if he were given a fair hearing, his innocence would be demonstrated and God would stop causing him so much suffering (cf. <a href="?bref=Job.13.23">Jb 13:23</a>). Eventually God heeded Job’s request and a long cross-examination began, finally reducing Job to silence (<a href="?bref=Job.42.1-6">42:1-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentLegalProcedures">New Testament Legal Procedures</p>
<p class="fl">Numerous trials occur in the NT. Jesus was tried by the Sanhedrin (the supreme Jewish religious court) and also by the Roman governor. The book of Acts mentions various court actions designed to stop the spread of Christianity. Luke, the author of Acts, presents a vivid and accurate description of how courts operated in provinces of the Roman Empire. Acts reaches a climax with Paul traveling to Rome to have his case heard by the Roman emperor Nero. Legal procedures in Roman courts were governed by complicated rules broadly resembling modern judicial technicalities. Serious crime was handled by public prosecutors, and trials were usually conducted by one judge. There were lawyers for the prosecution and lawyers for the defense.</p>
<p>In Judea and other provinces of the empire, the local legal system was not suppressed. Traditional Jewish courts were allowed to try minor and religious offenses (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-37">Acts 4</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.6.12-7.60">6:12–7:60</a>) but were not permitted to handle serious cases where the death penalty might be involved. For that reason, when the Sanhedrin found Jesus guilty of blasphemy for claiming to be the Son of God and the Messiah, they had to transfer the case to Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator (governor) of Judea. The Jews considered blasphemy worthy of death, but as they admitted to Pilate, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death” (<a href="?bref=John.18.31">Jn 18:31</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The rule throughout the Roman Empire was that only governors could pronounce the death sentence. Execution of the apostle James by Jewish authorities, mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus, took place during an interregnum between two governors. The stoning of Stephen was done in haste, without the consent of Pilate (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-60">Acts 7</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Trials of Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus was first tried by the Sanhedrin, presided over by the high priest. By later standards of Jewish legal practice, that trial was somewhat irregular. For example, it seems to have been held both at night and on the eve of a festival. Criminal trials were not supposed to take place at such times. It is uncertain that those rules existed in Jesus’ day, but even if they did, little can be made of that technicality since the Jewish court had no power to carry out its sentence.</p>
<p>After conviction by the Sanhedrin, Jesus was taken to Pilate, whose Jerusalem residence, the old royal palace called the Praetorium, was on the western side of the city near the modern Jaffa Gate. The Romans were unlikely to sentence anyone to death in a religious matter, so the Jewish authorities presented their charges against Jesus in political language: he violated the law by “forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.2">Lk 23:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Perhaps sensing something false about those charges (they were actually religious rather than political), Pilate sent Jesus to Herod, the ruler of Galilee, who was in Jerusalem at the time. Pilate, who did not have to send Galileans to Herod for trial, probably saw this as a means of avoiding an uncomfortable decision. Herod, however, pronounced Jesus innocent and returned him to Pilate.</p>
<p>Pilate offered to give Jesus a disciplinary beating traditionally given to troublemakers as a warning to behave themselves in the future (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.16">Lk 23:16</a>). But that did not satisfy Jesus’ accusers, who pressed the charge of insurrection, threatening to report Pilate to the emperor if he did not convict Jesus. Pilate, who had not been a very successful governor, feared official complaints about his administration, so the threat worked. He sentenced Jesus to be crucified on the charge of being king of the Jews. The heavy scourging that preceded the Crucifixion was never a punishment by itself but was a frequent accompaniment to other punishments. Another feature of Roman legal practice illustrated in the Gospels was the division of Jesus’ clothes among the soldiers; executioners were allowed to keep such personal effects as a fringe benefit.</p>
<p class="h3">The Trials of the Apostle Paul</p>
<p class="fl">Paul’s trials recorded in the book of Acts also reflect the division between Jewish and Roman authority in legal matters. When arrested, Paul had a preliminary hearing before the Sanhedrin (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.1-35">Acts 23</a>). He was then transferred to the governor for a formal trial in Caesarea, the governor’s usual headquarters. There he was tried before Felix, who adjourned the case for two years until a new governor could be appointed. Luke reported that Felix (another unpopular governor) did that to please the Jews, but it was quite common for governors to leave cases to be dealt with by their successors.</p>
<p>When Festus, the new governor, arrived, he suggested that Paul be tried in Jerusalem. Paul, disliking the prospect of being tried there, exercised his right as a Roman citizen to be tried in Rome before the emperor (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-20">Acts 25:1-20</a>). The rest of the book of Acts tells how Paul eventually reached Rome and had to wait another two years before his case was heard. No details of Paul’s trial in Rome are known, but Nero, who was emperor when Paul arrived, tried very few cases himself. He appointed judges to handle appeals cases such as Paul’s, so it is unlikely that Paul was actually tried by Nero.</p>
<p>The right of appeal to the emperor was not the only legal right possessed by Roman citizens. They were also protected from being beaten without a trial, a right asserted by Paul in Philippi and Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37">Acts 16:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.24-29">22:24-29</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">COVENANT</p>
<p class="fl">Arrangement between two parties involving mutual obligations; especially the arrangement that established the relationship between God and his people, expressed in grace first with Israel and then with the church. Through that covenant God has conveyed to humanity the meaning of human life and salvation. Covenant is one of the central themes of the Bible, where some covenants are between human beings, others between God and human beings.</p>
<p>The covenant theme in the OT is developed from Noah to Abraham and reaches its first climax in the covenant formed between God and Israel at Mt Sinai. After King David’s time, the history of the covenant becomes a less prominent theme.</p>
<p>At a low point in covenant history the Bible introduces the prophet Jeremiah’s prophecy of a “new covenant” in Israel’s future. Christians believe that Jeremiah’s prophecy eventually found fulfillment in the person and work of Jesus Christ. It is not accidental that the two volumes of the Christian Bible have been called the Old Covenant and New Covenant (the word commonly translated “testament” means “covenant”).</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheMeaningofCovenant">The Meaning of Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">The essence of covenant is to be found in a particular kind of relationship between persons. Mutual obligations characterize that kind of relationship. Thus a covenant relationship is not merely a mutual acquaintance but a commitment to responsibility and action. A key word in Scripture to describe that commitment is “faithfulness,” acted out in a context of abiding friendship.</p>
<p>In the OT the word “covenant” was used in an ordinary human sense as well as in a theological sense. An understanding of human covenants provides a starting point for understanding the covenant between God and human beings.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HumanCovenants">Human Covenants</p>
<p class="fl">A variety of human relationships, from profoundly personal to distantly political, may be described as covenantal. The deep brotherly love that David and Jonathan shared led to a formal covenant between them (<a href="?bref=1Sam.18.3">1 Sm 18:3</a>). Their covenant of friendship was more than a token of esteem; it bound them to demonstrate mutual loyalty and loving-kindness in certain tangible ways. Jonathan’s covenant faithfulness was typified on an occasion when David was out of favor with the king; Jonathan braved his father’s wrath to speak favorably for his friend. Subsequently, he warned David secretly to flee into hiding (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.1-20.42">1 Sm 19–20</a>).</p>
<p>To appreciate the many OT laws on marriage and divorce, one must understand that marriage itself was a covenant relationship (<a href="?bref=Mal.2.14">Mal 2:14</a>). The solemn promises exchanged by a man and woman became their covenant obligations. Faithfulness to those promises brought marital blessing (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.128.1-6">Ps 128</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.18.22">Prv 18:22</a>); violation brought a curse.</p>
<p>An individual could, at least figuratively, make a covenant or vow with himself or herself (something like a New Year’s resolution). Job, arguing his integrity before God, referred to a covenant he had made with his eyes to keep him from looking at women licentiously (<a href="?bref=Job.31.1">Jb 31:1</a>).</p>
<p>Covenants could also have a national or international character. The elders of Israel made a national covenant with King David in Hebron (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.3">2 Sm 5:3</a>). Probably it contained explicit promises both from the elders on behalf of the people to submit themselves to the king’s authority and from David to rule the nation justly and according to the law of God (<a href="?bref=Deut.17.15-20">Dt 17:15-20</a>). The covenant relationship described mutual obligations between a senior partner (the king) and junior partners (the Israelites). In international relationships OT covenants were similar to modern treaties or alliances. King Solomon entered into such a covenant with Hiram, king of Tyre; that covenant, like many modern international treaties, was a trade agreement between the two nations (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.12">1 Kgs 5:12</a>).</p>
<p>Covenant is thus an interpersonal framework of trust, responsibilities, and benefits, with broad application to almost every human relationship from personal friendship to international trade agreements. In Scripture covenant is also the most comprehensive concept covering an individual’s relationship to God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Divine-HumanCovenants">Divine-Human Covenants</p>
<p class="fl">The same basic characteristics of a strictly human covenant are present in a divine covenant: (1) a relationship between two parties (God and a human being or nation), and (2) mutual obligations between the covenant partners. To the OT believer, religion meant covenant. OT religion was faithfulness to the covenant relationship between God and his chosen people; religious responsibilities for both the faith and practice of Israel were covenant responsibilities.</p>
<p>The concept of a divine-human covenant in the OT was not static. Although the fundamental character of covenant remains the same throughout the Bible, the specific nature and form of the covenant changed and developed in the course of ancient Israel’s history. A brief survey of covenant history will further clarify its dimensions.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BeginningsoftheCovenantTradition">Beginnings of the Covenant Tradition</p>
<p class="h3">Adam</p>
<p class="fl">Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden. God was their Creator; they were his creatures. The meaning of their lives was to be found in relationship with each other and with God, the giver of the Garden. The fall, however, brought a disruption of the divine relationship, and they were expelled from the Garden.</p>
<p>The fall substantially influenced the nature of subsequent religious covenants. The separation of humankind from God clarifies the nature of the human predicament. Created for a relationship with the Creator, sinning humans are excluded from that relationship and cannot, on their own accord, reestablish it. From that circumstance emerges a distinctive feature of divine-human covenants, namely, that God alone can initiate the relationship of covenant.</p>
<p class="h3">Noah</p>
<p class="fl">The first explicit mention of covenant in Scripture refers to the initiative taken by God to bind himself again to human beings in a covenant, despite human faithlessness. When God warned Noah to build an ark in order to escape the impending Flood, he also promised to establish a covenant with him (<a href="?bref=Gen.6.18">Gn 6:18</a>). The corruption and violence of the human race had provoked God’s anger, but his grace was shown in his dealings with Noah. The promised covenant provided that God would maintain a relationship with one family, even though other divine-human relationships were being formally severed. Significantly, God’s covenant promise to Noah came in a context of demand: God ordered Noah to build an ark (v <a href="?bref=Gen.6.14">14</a>). Noah’s receipt of the covenant blessing depended on his obedience to a divine command.</p>
<p>The covenant was elaborated only after the Flood, when Noah had made an offering to God (<a href="?bref=Gen.8.20-22">Gn 8:20-22</a>). The covenant with Noah was in fact a universal covenant with humankind and all living creatures (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.8-10">9:8-10</a>). God promised never to send such a flood again as judgment on the world. The sign of that covenant was the rainbow.</p>
<p>The covenant with Noah affords some perspective for understanding the “covenant God.” Although human beings may deserve destruction because of their wickedness, God withholds that destruction. The covenant of Noah did not establish an intimate relationship between God and each living being; nevertheless, it left open the possibility of a more intimate covenant. Human beings, in spite of their evil, are allowed for a time to live in God’s world; during those years, they may seek a deeper relationship with that world’s Creator.</p>
<p class="h3">Abraham</p>
<p class="fl">The first explicit reference to God’s covenant with Abraham is in <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Genesis 15</a>. When the Lord called the 75-year-old Abram (as he was first called) to leave his home city of Ur and set out on a journey, a relationship already existed between God and Abram. In that relationship, which enabled God to command Abram’s obedience, God made certain promises to him: “I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">Gn 12:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Formal establishment of the covenant with Abram is described in <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Genesis 15</a> as a profound religious experience. The initiative lay entirely with God, who approached Abram in a vision and spoke with him. Abram raised a fundamental objection: how could he experience the blessing of God if it was to come to him through a son he did not have? His wife Sarai was past the childbearing age, and he himself was “as good as dead” (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.19">Rom 4:19</a>). God assured the old man that he would have a son through whom his descendants would eventually be as numerous as the stars of heaven. Abram’s belief at that point introduced the theme of righteousness central to the covenant concept: Abram “believed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and he reckoned it to him as righteousness” (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gn 15:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). At the end of that day, Abram knew that his own future and the future of his descendants were firmly in the hands of the covenant God. “On that day the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> made a covenant with Abram, saying, ‘To your descendants I give this land’ ” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.15.18">18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The covenant is more fully expressed in <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">Genesis 17</a>, which probably records a renewal of God’s covenant with Abram. The initiative once again lay with God (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">Gn 17:1</a>). God addressed the 99-year-old Abram in words that made clear that the covenant was not a relationship between equal partners. God was the Almighty; Abram was a human being to whom an extraordinary privilege had been granted.</p>
<p>Yet the details of the covenant in <a href="?bref=Gen.17.1-27">Genesis 17</a> show that both partners assumed responsibilities. God committed himself voluntarily to Abram and his descendants while requiring certain commitments from Abram. The blessing Abram would receive as a covenant partner became clear from the new name God gave him. “I am changing your name. It will no longer be Abram; now you will be known as Abraham, for you will be the father of many nations” (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.5">Gn 17:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). God would give to Abraham, through his descendants, the land of Canaan as an everlasting gift and would be the personal God of Abraham and his family in perpetuity (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.17.7-8">7-8</a>).</p>
<p>God’s giving required a response of obedience from Abraham: “Live a blameless life” (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.1">Gn 17:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Those simple words indicate the essence of covenant relationship: to relate to God is to live in his presence; since God is holy, one who knows him is expected to live a life of integrity and blamelessness.</p>
<p>The covenant also had a more formal aspect. Abraham and the male members of his household were to undergo the rite of circumcision as a symbol of covenant commitment. Abraham was an old man when he was circumcised (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.24">Gn 17:24</a>), though male children born into the covenant family were to be circumcised when they were eight days old (v <a href="?bref=Gen.17.12">12</a>). Circumcision was not in itself a ritual peculiar to the Hebrews; it was practiced in most societies in the ancient Near East (the Philistines were one exception). The distinctiveness lay in what the act symbolized: among other things, a continuing and faithful relationship with the living God.</p>
<p>God’s covenant with Abraham was characterized by both present and future realities. The covenant established a continuing relationship between Abraham and his Creator. Yet its thrust pointed to future blessing—in the children yet to be born, the “chosen people,” and in the land that eventually his descendants would call their own.</p>
<p>Another dimension of the covenant lay still further in the future: “All the families of the earth will be blessed through you” (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gn 12:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Early in the OT, the idea of election (God’s unconditional preference; cf. <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13">2 Thes 2:13</a>) is present. God chose to enter into a covenant relationship with a particular man and his particular descendants. Yet God always elects a person to serve: Adam, to cultivate the Garden; Noah, to build an ark; Abraham, to leave his home for another land and to live blamelessly before God (cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.2.8-10">Eph 2:8-10</a>). Further, the “particularity” of Abraham’s election contained within it a universality: through his descendants the blessing of God would be offered to all.</p>
<p>Thus, the future aspects of Abraham’s covenant reflect two stages. From Abraham’s perspective, in the relatively near future his descendants would possess a land given them by God. But in the more distant future was the prospect of a universal blessing, the culmination of God’s work in the world. The initial fulfillment of that distant future is perceived in the NT, but the more immediate fulfillment of God’s promise was the Sinai covenant at the time of Moses.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSinaiCovenant">The Sinai Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">The covenant established between God and Israel at Mt Sinai is the focal point of the covenant tradition in the OT. It was anticipated in the covenant of Abraham and lay behind the covenant of David and the proclamation of the prophets. It was central to OT religion, laying down the foundations of Judaism that continue into the modern world. The Sinai covenant was the formal institution of a relationship between God and his chosen people, Israel.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the impact of the Sinai covenant, one must understand its historical context. It was preceded by the exodus of the Hebrew people from Egypt under the leadership of Moses. The exodus was an extraordinary act of liberation in which God intervened in the normal course of history to free his people from slavery in Egypt. The exodus is interpreted in the OT as a divine act comparable to Creation, the act through which God “created” the nation of Israel. Examination of the two versions of the fourth commandment (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">Ex 20:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.12-15">Dt 5:12-15</a>) shows that the exodus from Egypt directly parallels the creation of the world as a basis for Sabbath observance. Although Israel was created in the exodus, the nation had neither a constitution nor land. The covenant provided the nascent state of Israel with a constitution, making it a theocratic state (a state ruled by God).</p>
<p>The basic account of the Sinai covenant is contained in <a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-25">Exodus 19</a> and <a href="?bref=Exod.20.1-26">20</a>. The initiative came from God, who gave instructions through Moses to prepare for the covenant; God spoke the words that contained the covenant offer. There was no doubt that the God of Israel was the senior partner in the relationship made formal at Sinai. The God who had revealed himself through his acts in the exodus then revealed himself in words. Those two aspects—the God who acts and speaks—are central to OT theology. And although the covenant contained law, it was preceded by the exodus, an act of divine grace.</p>
<p>God’s offer of covenant carried with it a divine promise: “You will be to me a kingdom of priests, my holy nation” (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Ex 19:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The promise was one of extraordinary privilege; an entire nation was called upon to represent all other nations before the God of the universe. But the priestly office, though it carried privilege, was also a demanding office. A priest had to be pure and had to know the God whose presence he was required to enter. Thus Israel, the priestly nation, received a law that would provide direction in living, in loving God, and in serving all people. The law given with the covenant expressed the requirements for God’s covenant people.</p>
<p class="h3">The Covenant Law</p>
<p class="fl">The covenant law had two principal parts. First, the Ten Commandments expressed God’s requirements of Israel in a concise form (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.2-17">Ex 20:2-17</a>). The commandments specified the covenant people’s relationship both to God and to other human beings. Although the tendency in the present day is to view the Ten Commandments as a system of ethics or morality, they had a different role in ancient Israel. The covenant law was the foundation or constitution of a new nation, a special “nation of priests.” The head of the nation-state was God. Hence, in ancient Israel the status of the Ten Commandments was approximately that of the code of criminal law in a modern nation-state. To break one of those laws was to commit a crime against God, the head of the state. Yet the laws had a positive purpose. They set down a way of life that would result in a full and rich communion with God and community with others.</p>
<p>The second part of the covenant law was a detailed law code covering the activities of everyday life. Examples of such laws are found in <a href="?bref=Exod.21.1-23.33">Exodus 21–23</a>. These laws were compiled and recorded in the “Book of the Covenant” (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.7">Ex 24:7</a>). Although many laws were contained in this book, it was impossible to codify every aspect of human behavior. The diversity of the examples given indicates that for the covenant member no area of human life was beyond the influence of the covenant. Persons who entered into a relationship with God entered into a relationship that impinged on every possible aspect of their lives.</p>
<p class="h3">Covenant Renewal</p>
<p class="fl">The covenant at Sinai was made with a particular group of people under the leadership of Moses but was binding on future generations. Consequently, the covenant was renewed from time to time. Covenant renewals are recorded in the time of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-35">Jos 8:30-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.1-28">24:1-28</a>) and, much later, during the reign of King Josiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.1-3">2 Kgs 23:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>The most important passage in the Bible for understanding covenant renewal and the nature of covenant is the book of Deuteronomy. The entire book describes a particular covenant renewal ceremony that occurred at a critical juncture in Israel’s early history. The Sinai covenant was renewed just before Moses’ death, before the transition of leadership to Joshua, and before a major military campaign to possess the Promised Land.</p>
<p>The covenant since the time of Abraham had contained a promise of land. Immediately before they entered that land (c. 1250 <span class="era">BC</span>), the covenant vows were renewed with a new generation of Israelites, most of whom had not stood at the foot of Mt Sinai some 40 years earlier. Although covenant renewal is the central theme of Deuteronomy, the writer focused primarily on Moses’ sermon rather than on a detailed account of the renewal ceremony.</p>
<p>Many aspects of the ceremony were simply a repetition of what happened at the original ratification of the covenant. The Ten Commandments were repeated (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.6-21">Dt 5:6-21</a>), and the laws of the Book of the Covenant were expounded in greater detail (<a href="?bref=Deut.12.1-26.19">Dt 12–26</a>). Two points emerging in Deuteronomy are particularly significant for an understanding of covenant: a clear statement of covenant love and a detailed statement of the blessings and curses that accompanied the making and renewing of the covenant.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheCovenantwithDavid">The Covenant with David</p>
<p class="fl">The covenant tradition underwent modification during the time of King David (c. 1000 <span class="era">BC</span>). The Sinai covenant had been established between God and Israel, with Moses acting as mediator. In David’s time an additional element was added: God entered into a covenant with David as king. That royal covenant was intimated to David through the prophet Nathan (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.8-16">2 Sm 7:8-16</a>), indicating once again the divine initiative. It was to be an everlasting covenant with David’s royal lineage (<a href="?bref=2Sam.23.5">23:5</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="TheDocumentaryFormOfTheCovenant"/>
<p>Christians generally interpret the covenant with David as a messianic covenant. For several centuries the dynasty established by David ruled a united Israel, then ruled the remaining southern kingdom of Judah. But in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> Judah was conquered by the Babylonians. At that point a descendant of David was no longer ruling an independent kingdom of God’s chosen people. The everlasting nature of the covenant with David was brought out, however, not in the pages of ancient history but in the expectation of a Messiah who would be born of David’s descendants. Matthew and Luke both pointed to Jesus’ Davidic descent (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.31">Lk 3:31</a>). The NT thus extends the covenant acts of God into the new age in the person of Jesus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheNewCovenantPredictedintheOldTestament">The New Covenant Predicted in the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Although David’s covenant with God was eternal, in a sense the covenant established with Israel on Mt Sinai was temporal. The Sinai covenant included conditional clauses, stated in the blessings and curses of Deuteronomy. Israel’s disobedience of the covenant law would at worst bring exile from the Promised Land, a central covenant theme from Abraham to Moses and beyond.</p>
<p>The Hebrew prophets often perceived the danger of an end to the covenant as a result of Israel’s sins. Some of the prophets, especially Hosea and Jeremiah, also perceived a deeper truth; namely, that the covenant was rooted in divine love and that therefore even the curse of God could not be final.</p>
<p>Hosea dramatically expressed that truth through the “living parable” of his marriage (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.1-3.5">Hos 1–3</a>). He married Gomer at God’s command, but later, as a result of her unfaithfulness, the marital covenant was dissolved by divorce. Although Gomer’s adulterous acts compelled Hosea to divorce her, he did not cease to love her. God later commanded Hosea to go back to Gomer (<a href="?bref=Hos.3.1">Hos 3:1</a>). Despite her unfaithfulness, the prophet was to take her again into the covenant relationship of marriage. That acted-out parable depicted God’s actions with Israel. Israel’s sin would inevitably culminate in a divorce from God, but Hosea perceived a new marriage. In the new covenant between God and Israel, Israel would be graciously accepted back into a relationship with God (<a href="?bref=Hos.2.14-18">2:14-18</a>).</p>
<p>The new covenant is given powerful expression in the writings of the prophet Jeremiah, who lived through the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>. In his lifetime Jeremiah saw the kingdom of Judah defeated in war. The nation lost its independence and became a vassal of the Babylonian Empire. In an external sense, that defeat in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> marked the end of the Sinai covenant. Israel could no longer call the Promised Land its own. Yet Jeremiah perceived a truth beyond the contemporary political realities. God’s work in the world, like his love for the world, was not over.</p>
<p>Thus Jeremiah spoke of a new covenant that God would bring into effect: “The days are coming, says the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah” (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31">Jer 31:31</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The new covenant would be marked by an act of God within human hearts, a radical spiritual transformation (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.34">Jer 31:34</a>). At the Last Supper Jesus declared to his disciples that “this cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). To the writer of Hebrews, the new covenant was central to a full understanding of the ministry of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.8-12">Heb 8:8-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">Covenant is a concept central to the message and the history of the OT. The covenant theme continues into the NT as a way of interpreting the Christian gospel. Meaning in human life is to be found in a covenant relationship with the living God. Yet sinful human beings cannot work their way into such a relationship; God alone can initiate it. According to the NT, God’s act in giving his son, Jesus, to die opened up the covenant relationship to all human beings. The forgiveness made available by Jesus’ “blood of the new covenant” makes it possible for any individual to enter into a covenant relationship with God. Entry into such a relationship, today as in Abraham’s time, hinges upon faith (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.6-14">Gal 3:6-14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">COVENANT, The New</p>
<p class="fl">A gracious provision of God given through Jesus Christ for the redemption of fallen humanity—replacing and fulfilling the old covenant, which was expressed primarily through the Mosaic law. The expression “new covenant” is found principally in the NT.</p>
<p>Although the concept of a new covenant is found in several places in the OT (<a href="?bref=Ezek.34.23-31">Ez 34:23-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.37.24-28">37:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.12-32">Jl 2:12-32</a>), the actual phrase occurs only once (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jer 31:31-34</a>). That passage contrasts the new covenant that the prophet Jeremiah saw God making with Israel “after those days” (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.31.32-34">32-34</a>) with the covenant God had made with his people in the days of Moses. The contrast is seen, first of all, in the internal nature of the new covenant. Whereas the old covenant was written on tablets of stone (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.18">Ex 31:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.27-32">34:27-32</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.13">Dt 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.5.22">5:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.9.11">9:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.10.3-4">10:3-4</a>) and in a book (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.7">Ex 24:7</a>; cf. the phrase “old written code,” <a href="?bref=Rom.7.6">Rom 7:6</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>), the new covenant is to be written on the human heart. One result is a clearer revelation of what God demands; another is the enablement of believers to fulfill those demands (see <a href="?bref=Rom.8.2-4">Rom 8:2-4</a>). The interior nature of the new covenant is spoken of in several other passages (<a href="?bref=Ezek.11.19-21">Ez 11:19-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.36.26-27">36:26-27</a>) and made explicit in the prophet Joel of a time when God “will pour out [his] spirit on all flesh” (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Jl 2:28-32</a>).</p>
<p>A second contrast is in the way God’s people know him under the two covenants. There is no doubt that Israel under the old covenant “knew” God; God had revealed himself, though at times the nation tended to forget this (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.10">Jgs 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.4.1,6">Hos 4:1, 6</a>). What the prophets envisioned in the new covenant is a unique personal knowledge of God by each individual member of the covenant community.</p>
<p>Finally, the two covenants differ in regard to God’s dealing with human sin. Jeremiah promised that God would forgive the iniquity of his people and blot out their sin. Israel already knew that God delighted in mercy and forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.6-7">Ex 34:6-7</a>), but Jeremiah was saying that God would never again remember their sin (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.34">Jer 31:34</a>). Under the old covenant there was a reminder of sin year after year (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.3">Heb 10:3</a>); under the new covenant no remembrance of sin remains (v <a href="?bref=Heb.10.14">14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ANewCovenant">A New Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">The expression “new covenant” is found at least six times in the NT (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">1 Cor 11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">2 Cor 3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.8,13">Heb 8:8, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.15">9:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.12.24">12:24</a>; and probably <a href="?bref=Luke.22.20">Lk 22:20</a>, according to some manuscripts). In certain Greek manuscripts the phrase is also found in <a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Matthew 26:28</a> and <a href="?bref=Mark.14.24">Mark 14:24</a>, where “new” seems to have been added by various scribes to “blood of the covenant,” in order to make these accounts conform to parallel accounts of the Lord’s Supper in 1 Corinthians or possibly in Luke.</p>
<p>Even though the term “new” is not found in the accounts in Matthew and Mark in the best Greek manuscripts, and was therefore probably not part of the original text, it is clear from all four accounts that Jesus saw the Lord’s Supper as instituting a different and therefore “new” covenant. The covenant was being sealed by his sacrificial death, that is, by his blood, just as the Mosaic covenant was sealed by the “blood of the covenant” (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.6-8">Ex 24:6-8</a>). The cup of the Lord’s Supper symbolizes the blood of Christ’s sacrifice, sealing the new covenant God has at last made with his people. The new covenant, ratified by Christ’s death, is what the church therefore commemorates each time it celebrates the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p>In his institution of the Lord’s Supper, Jesus did not elucidate what the “newness” of the covenant entailed. Elsewhere he mentioned a “baptism with the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.5">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.16">11:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">Mt 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.8">Mk 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>; and <a href="?bref=John.1.33">Jn 1:33</a>, where this promise is found on the lips of John the Baptist; cf. also <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.13">1 Cor 12:13</a>). Yet both OT prophecies refer to the same new covenant that God would establish in the future, as shown in <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.6">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>. There the apostle Paul stated that God “has qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31">Jer 31:31</a>), not “in a written code but in the Spirit” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">Jl 2:28-32</a>), for “the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="SuperiorityoftheNewCovenant">Superiority of the New Covenant</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.1-18">2 Corinthians 3</a>, Paul was showing that in contrast to the old (Mosaic) covenant (v <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.14">14</a>), which was a dispensation of death, carved in letters on stone (v <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.7">7</a>), the new covenant instituted by Jesus is one of far greater splendor (vv <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.8-9">8-9</a>), written on the human heart by the Spirit of the living God himself (v <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>The new covenant concept is treated most exhaustively and systematically in the book of Hebrews. In <a href="?bref=Heb.8.8-12">Hebrews 8:8-12</a> the quotation of <a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-34">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a> is the longest OT quotation found in the NT. In <a href="?bref=Heb.12.24">Hebrews 12:24</a> a different Greek word for “new” is used, but the meaning remains the same. The theme of the new covenant dominates the book of Hebrews, which was written to encourage faltering Christians by demonstrating the superiority of the Christian faith over their old Jewish beliefs and practices. In Hebrews the new covenant is seen as better than the old “obsolete” covenant in a number of ways.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The new covenant has a better priesthood than the old covenant, since there is no longer any need for a continual change of priests due to death (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.23">Heb 7:23</a>). One continual priest now lives forever to make intercession before God on behalf of his people (vv <a href="?bref=Heb.7.24-25">24-25</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. The new covenant priest is better than those of the old covenant, since Jesus does not have to offer sacrifices continually for his own sins and then for the sins of his people. He has instead made one complete and perfect offering (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.27">7:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.25-28">9:25-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.12">10:12</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. The new covenant has a better sacrifice than the old covenant; what the blood of bulls and goats could not do, since the atonement they brought could at best be only partial (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.2-3">10:2-3</a>), the blood of Christ has done once for all (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.11-14">9:11-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.1-10">10:1-10</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. The new covenant is built on “better promises” than the old (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.6">8:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Whereas the old covenant was imperfect (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.7">8:7</a>) and thus became obsolete (<a href="?bref=Heb.8.13">8:13</a>), the new covenant is perfect and eternal (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.20">13:20</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. Whereas the old covenant provided a believer with no direct access to God (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.6-8">9:6-8</a>), the new covenant provides a direct access to God that can purify and perfect the believer’s conscience (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.14">9:14</a> with <a href="?bref=Heb.9.9">9:9</a>).</p>
<p class="list">7. The new covenant possesses a better “surety,” or guarantee, an oath sworn by God himself (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.20-22">7:20-22</a>).</p>
<p class="list">8. The new covenant assures the presence of the Holy Spirit in the life of each believer. The new covenant community has been touched by the promised Spirit (<a href="?bref=Heb.6.4">6:4</a>), who, according to Paul, is both the seal and guarantee of their inheritance (see <a href="?bref=2Cor.1.22">2 Cor 1:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.5">5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.13-14">Eph 1:13-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">The new covenant and its accompanying new commandment are both fulfillments of what was implicit in the old. The new covenant is written on the heart of each member of the new covenant community by the Holy Spirit. The power of God’s Spirit within, enabling the believer to carry out the new commandment (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.2-4">Rom 8:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16-25">Gal 5:16-25</a>), is a distinctive feature of the new covenant.</p>

  <title>Covenant of Salt*</title>

<p class="h1">COVENANT OF SALT*</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical phrase for a two-way agreement, the inviolability of which was symbolized by salt. A Middle Eastern saying, “There is bread and salt between us,” meant that a relationship had been confirmed by sharing a meal. Salt symbolized the life and enduring nature of the alliance. In the OT salt appears in the relationship between God and Israel (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.13">Lv 2:13</a>). As a purifying agent and preservative in the cereal offering, salt symbolized the indissoluble nature of the covenant between God and Israel.</p>
<p>An everlasting “covenant of salt” (<a href="?bref=Num.18.19">Nm 18:19</a>) was made between God and Aaron, who represented the whole priesthood of Israel. Since the Levites received no inheritance in the Promised Land, God himself was to be their special portion forever. God’s covenant with King David and his sons was also called a covenant of salt (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.5">2 Chr 13:5</a>).</p>

  <title>Covering of the Head</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">COVERING OF THE HEAD</p>
<p class="fl">Issue pertaining to female decor discussed by the apostle Paul in <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.2-16">1 Corinthians 11:2-16</a>. In Paul’s day Jewish women always wore veils in public and Greek women generally went veiled—a practice that showed deference to authority and dignified the wearer.</p>
<p>Disagreement arose in the church at Corinth when women prayed publicly with uncovered heads. Since women had traditionally covered their heads out of respect for men (or “husbands”), it seemed shameful for a woman to pray or prophesy unveiled; it was viewed as if her head were shaven (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.5">5</a>), a sign of dishonor.</p>
<p>Paul responded to that confusion with a brief theological excursus about Creation (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.8">8</a>). An enigmatic reference to “angels” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.10">10</a>) precedes his statement on the interdependence of men and women (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.11-12">11-12</a>). Some interpret the word translated “veil” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.10">10</a>) as a symbol of new authority, since in the synagogues women were permitted no part in Jewish worship services. In contrast, a Christian woman could participate in Christian worship provided she wore a veil.</p>
<p>Paul spoke of “nature” as teaching men and women on the subject. Some scholars think he meant that since a woman’s long hair was her pride (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.15">15</a>), she should cover her head. Some think that the phrase referred to hairstyle. Others believe Paul was saying that a veil was not needed since a woman’s hair is given to her for a covering (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.15">15</a>). Paul encouraged freedom but also insisted on order in the churches. He upheld certain customs to avoid offense (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.9.19-23">1 Cor 9:19-23</a>). Yet he challenged other customs for the sake of the gospel’s integrity (see <a href="?bref=Gal.6.12">Gal 6:12</a>).</p>
<p>In most church traditions, covering the head is considered necessary only in societies where it is considered proper for women to be veiled. Some groups, however, believe that all women should still wear hats or something on their heads in church services. In a few groups women regularly wear small “coverings” in their hair so they will always be able to pray with their heads “covered.”</p>

  <title>Covet, Covetousness*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">COVET, COVETOUSNESS*</p>
<p class="fl">The desire to have something for oneself that belongs to another—a craving or passionate desire. Three Hebrew words are translated “covet” in the OT (see <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In one recital of the Ten Commandments (<a href="?bref=Deut.5.21">Dt 5:21</a>) the text reads, “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.” The same Hebrew word occurs in <a href="?bref=Pr.21.26">Proverbs 21:26</a>: “All day long the wicked covets.” Another word implies dishonest gain (<a href="?bref=Hab.2.9">Hb 2:9</a>). In the Exodus listing of the Ten Commandments, a third word is used for craving a neighbor’s wife (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.17">Ex 20:17</a>). The same word is used of Achan’s coveting of the spoils of Ai (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.21">Jos 7:21</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mic.2.2">Mi 2:2</a>). To covet is to desire inordinately, to place the object of desire before love and devotion to God.</p>
<p>That idea is conveyed in the NT by a Greek word literally meaning “inordinate desire to have more.” The apostle Paul listed that kind of covetousness among earthly attitudes of which Christians are to rid themselves. “Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.5">Col 3:5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.5.3">Eph 5:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.10">1 Cor 6:10</a>).</p>
<p>Covetousness is pictured as a serious sin that leads to a variety of other sins. The love of money is the root of all evils (<a href="?bref=1Tim.6.9-10">1 Tm 6:9-10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.15.27">Prv 15:27</a>). It was the sin of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.1-3">Acts 5:1-3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.15.9,19">1 Sm 15:9, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.26.14-15">Mt 26:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.15">2 Pt 2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.11">Jude 1:11</a>). Jesus warned: “Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.15">Lk 12:15</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Another Greek word translated “covet” in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> is better translated “earnestly desire” in a positive sense (<a href="?bref=1Cor.14.39">1 Cor 14:39</a>).</p>
<p>The translators of the OT who produced the Septuagint used still another Greek word for the three Hebrew words rendered “covet” in English versions. In the NT the verb form of that word is used in both a positive and negative sense. It means “to desire or long for,” whether food (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.16">Lk 15:16</a>), the divine mysteries (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.17">Mt 13:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.12">1 Pt 1:12</a>), some good thing (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.6.11">Heb 6:11</a>), or some evil thing (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.28">Mt 5:28</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.4.5">1 Thes 4:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.17">1 Jn 2:17</a>). The noun form of the same word generally reflects an attitude of disobedience to the law of God in which desire has given place to an evil impulse that results in sin (<a href="?bref=John.8.44">Jn 8:44</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.24">Rom 1:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.6.12">6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.7.7-8">7:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.13.14">13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.16,26">Gal 5:16, 26</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CREATION</p>
<p class="fl">The divine act of making something out of nothing; the divine act of bringing the world into ordered existence. Human beings unaided by divine revelation cannot arrive at the biblical doctrine of Creation by theological, philosophical, or scientific speculation. According to the Bible, knowledge of Creation must come by God’s revelation (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.11.3">Heb 11:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="UnderstandingCreation">Understanding Creation</p>
<p class="fl">To start a discussion about Creation with a comparison of the Genesis record and modern science is to begin at the wrong place. One should first ask what the Creation account would have meant to a Hebrew person in Bible times; then one should ask what use the prophets of Israel made of the doctrine of Creation. The following are some points to be noted.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Creation was a conquering of chaos. Most creation accounts from the ancient world began with a primeval chaos. The God who could conquer chaos was understood as the true and living God. <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> is a magnificent account of how the God of Israel brought the chaos of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.2">Genesis 1:2</a> into an ordered cosmos.</p>
<p class="list">2. Creation was prompted by God’s good will. It was the free act of God. It is good (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.4,10,12,18,21,25,31">Gn 1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31</a>). On the basis of that fact, Christians assert that life is a gift of God. The Christian affirmation stands against all the nihilisms and pessimisms found in religious and philosophical history.</p>
<p class="list">3. Creation is under the shadow of sin (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.18-25">Rom 8:18-25</a>). Scripture teaches that creation today is not seen in its original pristine purity but rather is seen as a world with a large measure of ambiguity.</p>
<p class="list">4. Creation is dependent upon God. The relationship of God to his creation is set out in <a href="?bref=Eph.4.6">Ephesians 4:6</a>. God is above all; that is, he is transcendent. God is through all; that is, he works in all things. God is in all; that is, he is divinely present or immanent in the entire creation (<a href="?bref=Ps.90.1-4">Ps 90:1-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.1.3">Jn 1:3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.6">1 Cor 8:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.16-17">Col 1:16-17</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. Creation is by the word of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Gn 1</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.3">Heb 11:3</a>). Students of literature have said that the creation of the world by the “word of God” is one of the most sublime of all human thoughts. Among other things it means creation by a Person. The vast expanse of the universe and the enormous number of stars and galaxies can numb a thoughtful person into a sense of meaninglessness. But when one knows that it was all created by the word of God, one knows that a Person is behind the frigid mask of the stellar spaces (<a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Pss 8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-14">19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.20">Rom 1:20</a>).</p>
<p class="list">6. Creation as depicted in the Bible stands up to critical examination. Scholars have studied parallel accounts of other peoples of biblical times, and none of them has the majesty and theological purity of the Genesis account.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CreationandTheology">Creation and Theology</p>
<p class="fl">The doctrine of Creation is built on the sum of all the biblical teachings on Creation. Examination of that material leads to a number of conclusions.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The doctrine of Creation gives us our fundamental understanding of humanity. Men and women are in the image of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-27">Gn 1:26-27</a>). That means, at least, that a human being is more than an animal, even though both were created from the dust of the earth and have much in common. Many conjectures have been made about the positive meaning of the expression “image of God.” If there is a common denominator, it is that human beings find their meaning, their destiny, and their worth in their special relationship to God.</p>
<p class="list">2. Parallel to the statement of humanity’s relationship to God is the affirmation that humanity is to be lord of God’s creation. Again, human beings are separated from the animal world, and their responsibility before God is specified (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Gn 1:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.2.15">2:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.8.1-9">Ps 8</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Both male and female are in the image of God. That means that the divine image is borne equally by both sexes. It also means that sexuality in human beings has many more dimensions than sexuality among animals. The sexual life of human beings is therefore vastly richer than that of animals and subject to deeper corruption (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.2-9">Mk 10:2-9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.7.1-5">1 Cor 7:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.25-31">Eph 5:25-31</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.13.4">Heb 13:4</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. The doctrine of prayer as “asking and receiving” is grounded in the providence of God, which in turn is grounded in Creation. There is meaning in petitionary prayer only if there is a sovereign Creator who can answer the petitions of his own creatures (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.5-13">Mt 6:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.4.2">Col 4:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.6-7">1 Pt 5:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.3">Rv 8:3</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. The history of humanity and of Israel begins with <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a>. Creation begins history; it is not merely the premise of history. The God of Creation is the God of Abraham, of Moses, of the prophets, and of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="list">6. Creation is a witness to the existence and nature of God (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.1-14">Ps 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-19">Rom 1:18-19</a>). In theology the expression used is “general revelation.” “General” means that it is a revelation witnessed by all people.</p>
<p class="list">7. Creation is a total creation. The Genesis account mentions certain bodies in the skies, certain creatures in the seas, certain plant and animal life on the earth. The number of species runs into the millions. Genesis does not attempt to list them but merely suggests such a list. God has made all that there is (cf. <a href="?bref=John.1.1-2">Jn 1:1-2</a>). Therefore, there is never a threat to the believer in the Lord from any part of the universe. There is only one Lord, not many gods and lords, to whom all are called in obedience. The personal meaning is found in <a href="?bref=Rom.8.38-39">Romans 8:38-39</a>, where the apostle Paul searches the entire universe and can find nothing in it, anywhere or at any time, that can separate a believer from the love of God in Christ.</p>
<p class="list">8. The chief theological use of the doctrine of Creation in the OT is to label idolatry for the sin that it is. Idolatry is the primeval lie and it leads to immorality, making a lie of one’s life.</p>
<p class="list">9. One of the remarkable doctrines of the NT is the “cosmic Christ”—which means he is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-2">Jn 1:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.16-17">Col 1:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>). The purpose of linking Christ with Creation is to show that he is more than a first-century Jew from Palestine.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CreationandScience">Creation and Science</p>
<p class="fl">Does science prove Creation? Some scientists have thought that the innumerable conditions necessary for life, which do as a matter of fact exist on the earth, is such a proof. That argument has been called “cosmic theology.”</p>
<p>Another so-called proof of Creation from science is the “big bang” theory of the origin of the universe. Although that view has forged ahead of its competitors, it is a theory of “first states” and not of the absolute origin of all things. The Christian doctrine of creation from nothing (Latin, <span class="ital">ex nihilo</span>) means more than that: it means that the absolute origin, sustaining, and meaning of all things is in the living Lord of Israel and of the church.</p>
<p>Another argument comes from the second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy. (Entropy refers to the leveling off of energy or temperature to a state in which no energy is available.) Heat systems cool off. The universe is not infinitely old or it would now be cool. Since there are still stars and suns, the universe must have been created a finite time ago. A related argument is that it was necessary to create a universe that would run down. In so running down, it supplies heat to the earth so that the drama of God and man could unfold.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheIssuesSurroundingEvolution">The Issues Surrounding Evolution</p>
<p class="fl">When Charles Darwin proposed biological evolution in the middle of the 19th century, many evangelical Christians took exception to it. They objected even more strenuously when books were written about human evolution. Two famous debates resulted from that controversy. In England the issue was debated in 1860 before the British Association at Oxford. That debate pitted Bishop Samuel Wilberforce (against the theory) against T. H. Huxley (for the theory). Although there was no formal decision, sentiment was with Huxley. The second debate was the famous Scopes trial in Dayton, Tennessee, in 1925. William Jennings Bryan defended the law that said that John T. Scopes should be found guilty of teaching evolution in the classroom. Clarence Darrow defended Scopes. Again, the sentiment was with the proponent of evolution, Darrow (although Bryan gave a sturdier defense of his beliefs than is generally acknowledged).</p>
<p>Both orthodox Roman Catholics and evangelical Protestants have taken various views of the controversy, of which only a few can be mentioned.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Some argue that evolution is contrary to the teachings of Scripture and is—in the name of science—actually the supreme defiance of Scripture’s authority. Thus, no quarter must ever be given in the battle against evolution.</p>
<p class="list">2. Others find a satisfactory resolution in “theistic evolution”—that is, God began the evolutionary process.</p>
<p class="list">3. Many see the parallels between the order of fossil-bearing strata in the so-called “geological column” and the six days of Creation as too close to be accidental. For them there is essential harmony between “Genesis and geology.”</p>
<p class="list">4. Many regard evolution as a theory like all other theories, which will be made or broken in the laboratory or in fieldwork. They see the doctrine of Creation as neither for nor against evolution. It is on a different level of explanation: “Science tells how; Scripture tells why.”</p>
<p class="list">5. Jesuit paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin attempted to save Christianity from evolution by “christifying” the whole evolutionary process.</p>
<p class="list">6. British author C. S. Lewis, among others, distinguished evolution from what might be called “evolutionism.” Lewis said that the validity of evolution as a narrow scientific thesis is for scientists to decide. But the notion of a total, all-encompassing evolutionary myth, as a human pseudodoctrine of Creation, is clearly not scientific.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CreationScienceandMorality">Creation, Science, and Morality</p>
<p class="fl">The growth of world population and the spread of industrialization have produced the problem of local and worldwide pollution. The ecological crisis has been said by some scholars to be the fault of Christian faith, which inspired man—as the “lord of creation”—to exploit creation. But that is hardly the meaning of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.28">Genesis 1:28</a>, which is an injunction to responsibility. A number of OT texts show clearly that the concern of Scripture is for human responsibility in God’s world; hence, Scripture parallels modern ecological concerns.</p>
<p>Science stretches theological understanding by continually revising our knowledge of the universe, but the biblical doctrine of Creation does not retreat as science advances. For the Christian, the world studied by scientists and pondered by philosophers remains God’s created world.</p>

<p class="h1">CREATION MYTHS*</p>
<p class="fl">Religious stories explaining the origin and order of the universe. Parts of some Mesopotamian creation myths bear a close resemblance to the biblical accounts of Creation and earliest times.</p>
<p>Stories explaining creation were known throughout the ancient Near East. Many were based on stories originating in Sumer, one of the earliest Mesopotamian civilizations. Although now commonly regarded as fanciful and even entertaining explanations for why things were as they were, the myths seem to have fulfilled an important social function. Their recital at religious festivals was believed to have magical power to revitalize nature and society. The creation stories assured worshipers that the original state of order created by the gods would continue to overcome the forces of chaos that threatened illness, ruin, sterility, and death.</p>

<p class="h2" id="SumerianCreationMyths">Sumerian Creation Myths</p>
<p class="fl">The Sumerians flourished in southern Mesopotamia between 4000 and 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>. Although they were non-Semitic, their cosmology influenced the Semites (various peoples inhabiting Palestine, Phoenicia, Assyria, and Arabia), who eventually adopted the Sumerian chief deities. About 5,000 tablets and fragments inscribed with an assortment of Sumerian literary works have been discovered. Although most of those tablets were inscribed in the early post-Sumerian period (c. 1750 <span class="era">BC</span>), the compositions belong to at least the latter half of the third millennium (2500–2000) <span class="era">BC</span>. As yet, no Sumerian account dealing directly with the origin of the universe has been uncovered. What is known about their notions of creation has been gleaned in part from brief passages scattered throughout their literature, especially from the introductions to poems, where Sumerian scribes were accustomed to writing several lines dealing with creation. In addition, nine myths have survived about the gods who organized the universe, created human beings, and established civilization.</p>
<p>The Sumerian religion, like that of all ancient Near Eastern peoples except the Israelites, was a naturalistic polytheism: they worshiped as gods the natural forces governing fertility (rain, wind, clouds, sun, moon, rivers, seas, and so on). Consequently, people understood the origin of the universe (cosmogony) as accompanying the origins of the gods (theogony).</p>
<p class="h3">Heaven and Earth</p>
<p class="fl">In a tablet cataloging the Sumerian gods, the sea goddess Nammu is described as “the mother, who gave birth to heaven and earth.” In another text she is described as “the mother, the ancestress, who gave birth to all the gods.” Evidently the Sumerians looked upon the primeval sea as the first cause and prime mover of all things, believing that “the heaven and earth” were somehow engendered in that sea. Moreover, in their view the major components of the universe were heaven and earth; their term for universe was a compound word meaning “heaven-earth” (exactly as in the opening verse of the book of Genesis, where “heaven and earth” designate the entire organized universe). Before Enlil, the air god, separated them, heaven-earth was conceived of as a mountain whose base was the earth and whose peak was heaven.</p>
<p>Enlil, called “the king of heaven and earth” or “the king of all the lands,” was the most important of the Sumerian gods. His creative work in organizing the earth is celebrated in “The Creation of the Pickax,” which describes his fashioning and dedicating that valuable agricultural instrument. In part it reads:</p>
<p class="poetry-1-sp">Enlil, who brings up the seed of the land from the earth,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Took care to move away heaven from earth,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Took care to move away earth from heaven.</p>
<p class="poetry-2">. . . He brought the pickax into existence, the “day” came forth.</p>
<p class="poetry-2">He introduced labor, decreed the fate.</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Upon the pickax and basket he directs the “power.”</p>
<p class="sp">Thus Enlil separated heaven from earth, brought seed to fruition, and fashioned the pickax for agriculture.</p>
<p class="h3">Civilization</p>
<p class="fl">The water god Enki was also god of the abyss and wisdom. Although Enlil drew up “blueprints” for the universe, Enki did most of the work carrying them out. His efforts went beyond fashioning the natural world to initiating the most important aspects of culture and civilization. In “Enki and the World Order,” the water god makes his way to the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, the two rivers that water the sandy Mesopotamian valley, and fills them with life-giving rains and winds. Then, preparing the earth for cultivation, he “turns the hilly ground into fields, . . . directs the plow and . . . yoke, . . . opens the holy furrows, and grows the grain in the cultivated field.” Then the god lays the foundations of houses, stables, and sheepfolds, and builds them. He fixes the “borders” and sets up boundary stones. Finally he invents weaving, called “that which is woman’s task.” Having organized the earth, Enki entrusts each place and element to a special deity.</p>
<p class="h3">Sumerian Eden</p>
<p class="fl">Another myth, “Enki and Ninhursag: A Paradise Myth,” bears a remote resemblance to the biblical story of the Garden of Eden. The myth seems to take place before the creation of animals or humans in Dilmun, a land in the east where the gods reside—“pure,” “clean,” “most bright,” and probably without sickness or death. Having filled that land with fruitful fields, Enki successively impregnates three goddesses: Ninhursag, “the mother of the land”; Nimmu, his daughter by that union; and Ninkurra, his granddaughter by Nimmu.</p>
<p>Ninhursag seems to use Enki’s semen to make eight new plants. Evidently they are “forbidden fruit,” because when Enki eats them, Ninhursag curses him and leaves the garden, adding, “Until he is dead I shall not look upon him with the eye of life.” Under the curse, the garden languishes and the gods mourn. Enlil, the king of the gods, seems unable to cope with the situation. Enki lies dying. The fox, evidently already present in Dilmun, saves the day by luring Ninhursag back to Dilmun, where she heals Enki and revives the garden.</p>
<p class="h3">The Creation of Humans</p>
<p class="fl">Regarded as the mother of all gods, Ninhursag may have personified Earth. In “The Creation of Man,” she plays an important role along with Enki.</p>
<p>Having come into existence before there was meat or bread for them to eat, the gods face a dilemma:</p>
<p class="poetry-1-sp">They knew not the eating of bread,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Knew not the dressing of garments,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Ate plants with their mouth like sheep,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Drank water from the ditch.</p>
<p class="sp">To relieve that situation, Enlil and Enki fashion a cattle god and a grain goddess. Cattle and grain suddenly abound, but the gods are unable to utilize them. Something is still needed to tend the animals and make grain into bread. The gods complain to Enki and command him to create servants to take care of their needs.</p>
<p>Coming to their aid, Enki takes “clay that is over the abyss” and with Ninhursag oversees its fashioning into human beings who are pressed into the gods’ service, especially to make them bread. At a feast afterward, Enki and Ninhursag get drunk and ineptly make several abnormal human types, including the barren woman and the eunuch. But whole or flawed, man and woman are the clay of the abyss, and are related by nature to chaos.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AkkadianCreationMyths">Akkadian Creation Myths</p>
<p class="fl">The Babylonian and Assyrian cultures, both Semitic, shared the Akkadian language, which distinguished them from the non-Semitic and linguistically different Sumerians. By far the most familiar creation myth of the ancient Near East is the Babylonian creation epic known as <span class="ital">Enuma Elish</span> (from its opening words). It deals explicitly with the creation of the universe and contains some parallels to the biblical account. A later Assyrian version of the myth appropriately substituted the national god Asshur for Babylon’s god Marduk.</p>
<p>In <span class="ital">Enuma Elish</span> the human race is made from the blood of Kingu, leader of a rebel horde against the creator god Marduk. Consequently, in the Babylonian myth, man and woman are again related to chaos. In another myth preserved in an Old Babylonian fragment, humankind is made from the blood of a slain god:</p>
<p class="poetry-1-sp">Let [man] appear!</p>
<p class="poetry-2">He who shall serve all the gods,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Let him be formed out of clay,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">be animated with blood!</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Enki opened his mouth,</p>
<p class="poetry-2">saying to the great gods: . . .</p>
<p class="poetry-2">Let them slay one god.</p>
<p class="poetry-2">With his flesh and his blood . . .</p>
<p class="poetry-2">let Ninhursag mingle clay.</p>
<p class="sp">According to another Akkadian myth, the gods created man as a perverse being, presenting him with twisted speech, lies, and untruth.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EgyptianCreationMyths">Egyptian Creation Myths</p>
<p class="fl">The customary Egyptian myth of creation (found, for example, in the dedication ritual of a royal pyramid or in the <span class="ital">Book of the Dead</span>) relates that before the creation there was a watery void, accompanied by darkness, formlessness, and invisibility. That watery chaos bore the name Nun, “the great god who came into being by himself . . . the father of the gods.” The void subsides, leaving a primordial mound of earth with the creator god Atum (“totality”) upon it. Atum brings into being the rest of the universe and assigns places and functions to its parts.</p>
<p>In a detail similar to the Mesopotamian myths, the air god Shu separates heaven-earth by lifting the sky goddess Nut from the earth god Geb and placing himself between the two.</p>
<p>The most significant Egyptian creation myth is the so-called “Memphite Theology” (c. 2700 <span class="era">BC</span>), which sought to move the Egyptian capital to Memphis by claiming it to be the site of the original creation mound. Rather than describing the creation in purely physical terms, that myth conceives of the universe as coming into existence through the mind (“heart”) and commanding speech (“tongue”) of the creator god. According to that myth, then, an intelligent will controlled the universe.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CreationMythsandGenesis">Creation Myths and Genesis</p>
<p class="fl">The Genesis account of Creation differs from pagan myths in at least two ways. First, the accounts differ in their purpose. The pagan myths served principally to preserve life and society by magical recitation. Although the biblical account has implications for life and society, it serves primarily to teach a covenant people about God and is devoid of any occult claims or power.</p>
<p>Second, the accounts differ in their quality. The Genesis Creation narrative presents a straightforward theology with a minimum of adornment. Told as a story, it rings true even in an age of scientific discovery, when people are accustomed to mechanistic explorations of natural phenomena. An intelligent, well-informed person can accept Genesis as an authoritative statement of nature’s meaning and purpose and on it base a life of devotion to the divine Creator. In contrast, the creation myths present a debased theology and an even more debased morality. The most ancient myths, which may appeal to modern practitioners of “occult sciences” for various reasons, are simply unbelievable as religious truth. The gods of the ancient myths have been buried in the rubble of long-dead civilizations or transmuted into the gods of modern polytheistic religions; the God of the Bible lives on.</p>
<p>The literary form of <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-3.24">Genesis 1–3</a> shows that it is not theology; that is, it does not make analytical statements about God. Yet it presents a view of God distinctively different from the gods of the pagan myths. God is present “in the beginning.” He is one; he creates with singleness of purpose, unchallenged. In contrast, the pagan myths portray the beginning as impersonal and chaotic. Chaos evolves into a cosmos, out of which the gods emerge by chance. The subsequent development of heaven and earth is viewed as a cosmic power struggle between rival gods. Again, the Creator in Genesis is different from and “bigger” than the heavens and earth he creates. The pagan gods are material and made up of the same cosmic stuff as the world; the world is bigger than they are.</p>
<p>Biblical and pagan anthropologies are also significantly different. In Genesis man and woman are creatures distinct from the Creator, although bearing his “image.” They are created for the purpose of ruling the earth as God’s agents and are accordingly assigned clear responsibilities. In pagan mythology human beings come from the same stuff as the gods, though humans are more closely related to chaos than to the gods who fashioned them. The pagan gods made humans as slaves to take care of the gods’ material needs, so the gods treat them with either contempt or indifference. The Near Eastern worldview was not only pessimistic but also fatalistic. Human beings, far from being responsible or significant, were assigned at birth an inexorable destiny that they could not overrule.</p>
<p>The best that most Near Eastern inhabitants could hope for was a relatively prosperous and regular life before their fated end, and for that they thought they had to manipulate their deities through recital and reenactment of the ancient myths. Genesis, on the other hand, as part of the larger OT teaching, sought to bring the human community into a living, personal, covenant relationship with God.</p>

<p class="fl">Fourth largest island in the Mediterranean, lying approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) southeast of Greece and 110 miles (177 kilometers) southwest of Turkey. It is 160 miles (257.4 kilometers) long from east to west, with a width of approximately 36 miles (58 kilometers), an area of 3,200 square miles (5,149 square kilometers). Through the island stretches a mountain range dominated in the center by the sacred Mt Ida (altitude 9,000 feet or 2,742 meters). These mountains slope down sharply to the southern coast, with the result that most of the inhabitants live on the more gradual northern slopes.</p>
<p>Civilization in ancient Crete reached its climax with the Minoan era (3000–1100 <span class="era">BC</span>). The spectacular remnants of this high civilization may be seen best at Knossos, thanks to the labors of British archaeologist Arthur Evans. About 1950–1900 <span class="era">BC</span>, beautiful pottery was produced and exported. Metallurgy was highly developed, and hieroglyphic writing was introduced. This civilization was suddenly and dramatically destroyed in a mysterious manner about 1700 <span class="era">BC</span>, perhaps by volcanic eruption or earthquake. Following this, the towns and palaces were rebuilt, and the island enjoyed its greatest prosperity. The partially restored palace of Knossos amazes today’s visitor with superb frescoes, stairways, and pillars. All this ended in destruction about 1450 <span class="era">BC</span>. Some think it was caused by the volcanic explosion at the nearby island of Santorini.</p>
<p>Crete is important in the history of the Christian church. When Paul went to Rome as a prisoner, the ship sought refuge from a storm at Fair Havens (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.8">Acts 27:8</a>). The ship tried in vain to reach the more commodious harbor at Phoenix (v <a href="?bref=Acts.27.12">12</a>) but was blown off course and sought refuge at an island off the southwest coast of Crete, called Cauda (v <a href="?bref=Acts.27.16">16</a>). Paul may have visited Crete after imprisonment in Rome, for in his Letter to Titus, he said, “I left you on the island of Crete” (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.5">Ti 1:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). On the basis of this and other evidence, many scholars conclude that Paul was released and had an extended ministry before his second imprisonment and execution (<a href="?bref=2Tim.4.6">2 Tm 4:6</a>). Paul had little good to say about the people of Crete, quoting one of their own poets as saying they were “liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons” (<a href="?bref=Titus.1.12">Ti 1:12</a>). But the gospel must have made quite a difference there, for today the name of Titus is honored in many villages, churches, and monasteries.</p>
<p>Because of its location and its relative fertility, Crete has been a prize of war and of commerce. The island was conquered by Rome in 67 <span class="era">BC</span> and became a separate province. The inhabitants prospered under the Romans and later under the Greek Christians (Byzantines). The Saracens (Muslims) occupied the island for over a century (<span class="era">AD</span> 823–960). After centuries of Christian leadership, it was conquered by the Turkish sultan, and civilization languished (1669–1898). In the 20th century Crete has been a part of Greece, except for a period of German occupancy during World War II.</p>

<p class="h1">CRIMINAL LAW AND PUNISHMENT*</p>
<p class="fl">The science or philosophy of law is called jurisprudence. Although modern jurisprudence bears little resemblance to biblical concepts of law, the Scriptures have played a definite role in its development. Today, criminal law is clearly distinguished from civil law; in Bible times the distinction was much less clear. Today, offenses against civil law (torts) are distinguished from minor crimes (misdemeanors) as well as from serious crimes (felonies). In the Bible, “crimes” included all punishable offenses, even religious offenses such as idolatry (worshiping a false god) or blasphemy (speaking or behaving with contempt toward God).</p>

<p class="h2" id="NearEasternContext">Near Eastern Context</p>
<p class="fl">In ancient societies as in modern ones, laws were considered necessary to regulate individual behavior for the good of the community, state, or nation. Today laws are thought of as made by people for their own protection. In contrast, all ancient Near Eastern law codes were considered to have come directly from some divine source. Hebrew law, though distinct, followed the general pattern of Near Eastern law codes, as is known from those that have survived—such as the Code of Hammurabi and Assyrian and Hittite laws.</p>
<p>Conclusions about the “origin” of ancient laws should be made cautiously. Although evidence indicates that Hammurabi based his legislation partially on earlier Sumerian codes, he declared that his code had been received from Shamash, god of justice. That declaration must have been intended to convey primarily that his code had the express sanction of Shamash, since at least some people would recognize it as a compilation based largely on earlier laws. Similarly, the clear biblical statements about Moses receiving the law on Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-24.18">Ex 19–24</a>) do not rule out the possibility that parts of the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments) may have existed in earlier codes. Possibly the Mosaic legislation included some social rules adapted from the period of Israel’s sojourn in Egypt.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HebrewCriminalLaw">Hebrew Criminal Law</p>
<p class="h3">Laws Governing Offenses against God</p>
<p class="fl">Since Hebrew law was designed for a group of people for whom religion was of paramount importance and whose faith was endangered by the influence of the beliefs of their pagan neighbors, it is not surprising that so much of Hebrew law dealt with crimes committed against God. The prohibition against worshiping idols is stated and repeated in the Torah, or Pentateuch (first five books of the Bible): “You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4-5">Ex 20:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Sacrifice of infants, practiced in some pagan religions, was specifically prohibited in Israel. The penalty for that crime, as for the other forms of murder, was stoning to death (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.2">Lv 20:2</a>).</p>
<p>In the book of Leviticus, death by stoning was recorded as the appropriate punishment for blaspheming the name of God (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.11-16">Lv 24:11-16</a>). False prophecy was also a criminal offense; that accusation could apply to a person making a prediction in the name of a god other than the Lord, or implying falsely that one’s prophecy resulted from a communication with God. Jeremiah, whose prophecy of Nebuchadnezzar’s victory over the southern kingdom of Judah was for a time considered to be false, was almost lynched by a mob (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.8-9">Jer 26:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>The idea of keeping the seventh day holy stemmed from the celebration of God’s work in creating the universe in six days and resting on the seventh. Keeping the Sabbath required cessation of manual work for the entire family, including farm animals (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.23">Ex 16:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.20.8-11">20:8-11</a>). People were also required to meet together on the Sabbath for worship, which at a later period in Hebrew history included the reading of Scripture, prayer, and preaching. Anyone breaking the Sabbath could be sentenced to death, as happened to a man caught gathering firewood on the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Num.15.32-36">Nm 15:32-36</a>).</p>
<p>Any type of premeditated crime was considered an offense against God, the giver of all law; hence, it was punishable by death (<a href="?bref=Num.15.30-31">Nm 15:30-31</a>). Hebrew law also insisted on donation of the firstfruits of harvest to the Lord without delay. That requirement was sometimes carried over to include a first child, whose life was dedicated to service in the temple (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.29-30">Ex 22:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.15.19">Dt 15:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Personal Injury</p>
<p class="fl">Murder, an offense against “God’s image,” was one of many crimes punishable by death in OT times. The book of Exodus stated unequivocally that “anyone who hits a person hard enough to cause death must be put to death” (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.12">Ex 21:12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). A murderer who killed by using a weapon such as a stone, a piece of wood, or iron could be killed in revenge by a relative of the deceased. If the original death happened accidentally, the community would sometimes help to conceal the killer and encourage him to hide in a nearby city of refuge, where he would be safe as long as he remained within its gates. He had to stay in that sanctuary until the death of the high priest then in office, after which he was free to return to his own city (<a href="?bref=Num.35.10-28">Nm 35:10-28</a>). The sixth commandment enjoined, “You shall not kill” (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.13">Ex 20:13</a>). The Hebrew word referred specifically to murder, not to all forms of killing. Killing an enemy in battle and the execution of a murderer were considered necessary and were not prohibited. More than one witness was required for any conviction, particularly in a murder case (<a href="?bref=Num.35.30">Nm 35:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.6">Dt 17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.19.15">19:15</a>).</p>
<p>In the Code of Hammurabi a man responsible for an accidental injury to another was required to pay for the services of the physician. If the victim died, a fine was payable according to the victim’s rank. In a sense the Hebrews went further by requiring payment for any loss of time suffered by the injured person (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.18-19">Ex 21:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>Kidnapping was punishable by death in the OT. Exodus states that “Kidnappers must be killed, whether they are caught in possession of their victims or have already sold them as slaves” (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.16">Ex 21:16</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Joseph’s being sold into slavery by his brothers illustrates this kind of kidnapping.</p>
<p class="h3">Laws concerning Property</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Exodus is quite specific about anyone responsible for damage to the property or crops of another. If a field caught fire and the fire spread, damaging crops in other fields, the person who started the fire, or perhaps the owner of the first field to catch fire, was responsible for the damage (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.6">Ex 22:6</a>). Hammurabi’s code cited a similar instance of a man who neglected to keep a dike in repair and was therefore responsible for flood damage to his neighbor’s crops.</p>
<p>Injuries to animals, especially oxen, or injuries to people or property caused by such animals formed an important area of Hebrew law. If an ox that had been previously good-tempered killed a man, the owner would be blameless, although the ox would be put to death—a severe financial penalty for the owner. If an ox with a history of goring killed a man because its owner failed to restrain it adequately, both ox and owner would be put to death. The owner’s life could be ransomed by payment of an agreed-upon sum. If the person an ox gored was a servant, the ox was stoned and the owner paid a fine (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.28-32">Ex 21:28-32</a>). The Code of Hammurabi also recommended no punishment for a first offense by an animal, but if the owner knew that the ox was dangerous and had taken no steps to prevent harm, a fine in silver was payable—a very large fine for an upper-class victim, slightly less if the victim was a slave. However bad the circumstances and however vicious the ox, the Code of Hammurabi stopped at a fine for the offense, never imposing a death penalty on either the animal or the owner.</p>
<p>Negligence causing injury to an animal was also punished in Hebrew law. If an ox or a donkey fell into a pit carelessly left uncovered, the owner of the animal was reimbursed for its loss (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.33-36">Ex 21:33-36</a>).</p>
<p>In ancient cultures women were generally considered chattel (personal property), much like animals or slaves. A daughter was considered to be her father’s property until her marriage, then the property of her husband. Therefore, any offense against a married woman was regarded as an offense against the property of the husband. According to the Code of Hammurabi, a child could be sold into slavery as a servant or bondsman, usually in payment of the father’s debt (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.21.2-7">Ex 21:2-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.5.5-8">Neh 5:5-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.50.1">Is 50:1</a>). Parental authority was so highly regarded in biblical law that a stubborn and rebellious son could be brought before the elders on the grounds of being disobedient and a glutton or a drunkard. He might then be convicted and stoned to death on the spot by the men of the city (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.18-21">Dt 21:18-21</a>). Even that, however, was a protection of the child’s rights; some Near Eastern legislation allowed a parent to order the death of his offspring without reference to the elders or to anyone else. With daughters in particular being held in such low esteem, it is perhaps remarkable that a daughter could inherit property if there were no sons (<a href="?bref=Num.27.8">Nm 27:8</a>).</p>
<p>Adultery, prohibited in the Decalogue, was another crime against a man’s property, specifically his wife. The book of Deuteronomy goes into considerable detail about cases of adultery—the punishment for both persons being death (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.22">Dt 22:22</a>). If a man seduced a young woman who was not betrothed, he was required to pay her father the bride price (50 silver shekels); he could not divorce her but had to keep her as his wife for the rest of his life (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.16">Ex 22:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.22.28-29">Dt 22:28-29</a>).</p>
<p>In a situation where a wife was accused of adultery but without evidence, a trial was conducted. The husband would bring his wife to a priest and present a small offering (a tenth of a measure of barley meal, with neither oil nor frankincense on it), indicating the low esteem in which he now held his wife. The woman then stood before the Lord holding an earthen jar of “holy water.” Dust from the floor of the tabernacle was mixed with the water, and the cereal offering was placed in her hands. Her hair was loosened by the priest to show not only her grief but also to give an impression of abandonment. She was then required to take an oath. After that, the priest pronounced a curse upon her to the effect that her womb would be fertilized easily, but that she would have many miscarriages. She had to give her consent to that pronouncement. The priest then wrote the curses in a book and symbolically washed them off into the “bitter water.” The woman was required to drink the water while the priest waved the cereal offering from her hands before the Lord and burned some of it on the altar. The priest told her that if she was guilty, the water would make her thigh rot and her abdomen swell. If that happened, she would become an outcast; but if she were proved innocent, she would be free. Whatever the result, no blame for false accusation fell upon the husband (<a href="?bref=Num.5.12-31">Nm 5:12-31</a>).</p>
<p>If a slave was struck by his master in such a manner as to cause instant death, the slave’s death had to be avenged. If the slave lingered, possibly for days, he did not need to be avenged, his loss being a sufficient punishment for the owner (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.20-21">Ex 21:20-21</a>). It is unlikely that the Hebrews had much experience with that law, which had no parallels in Hammurabi’s code. If an owner injured his slave by causing the loss of an eye or a tooth, Hebrew law required that the slave be set free (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.21.26-27">26-27</a>). The Code of Hammurabi gave an example of a man injuring another man’s slave; the owner had to be paid half the slave’s value.</p>
<p>Little emphasis was placed on burglary or larceny in the Hebrew law code. A burglar was presumed to be repentant and ready to make restitution. After return of the stolen property and payment of a small additional fine, a thief could again “approach the Lord” (<a href="?bref=Lev.6.2-7">Lv 6:2-7</a>). By contrast, the Code of Hammurabi prescribed the death penalty for burglary. In Hebrew law, theft of an animal required restitution to be made in the ratio of at least two to one; if a bull or a cow had been stolen or sold, the thief had to restore the property fivefold. The Code of Hammurabi contained a similar statute: “If a man steal ox or sheep, ass or pig, or goat—if it be from a god or a palace, he shall restore thirtyfold; if it be from a freeman, he shall render tenfold. If the thief have nothing wherewith to pay, he shall be put to death.” In Hebrew law goods stolen from a home were simply to be restored without additional penalty. If the thief no longer had the goods and was unable to pay the equivalent value, he might be sold into slavery until restitution was made (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.1-4">Ex 22:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">General Laws</p>
<p class="fl">The Hebrew code as contained in Exodus and Deuteronomy included many general prohibitions. Some concerned business dealings such as the removal of boundary markers (<a href="?bref=Deut.19.14">Dt 19:14</a>). The use of false weights and measures was condemned (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.35">Lv 19:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.25.15">Dt 25:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.11.1">Prv 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.20.23">20:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Mic.6.11">Mi 6:11</a>). Bribery was strictly forbidden (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.8">Ex 23:8</a>), yet no punishment was specified for those who broke that law. In the Code of Hammurabi, if a judge changed his decision and was unable to give a satisfactory explanation, particularly if bribery was suspected, the judge had to pay 12 times the amount of the penalty and lost his seat on the bench. In the Hebrew code, perjury was also dealt with, although again no punishment was specified. The Code of Hammurabi stated that for perjury in cases where the punishment was death, persons giving false testimony were to be sentenced to death themselves (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.23.1">Ex 23:1</a>).</p>
<p>A number of Hebrew laws reflected concern for the poor. For example, poor people were not to be subjected to usury if they were in debt, or left cold at night if their coats were taken as a pledge. Widows, orphans, and strangers were also to be treated with mercy and understanding (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.21-27">Ex 22:21-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.9">23:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.23.19">Dt 23:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.24.17">24:17</a>).</p>
<p>Some Hebrew laws concerned family behavior, such as those previously mentioned who cursed or disobeyed their parents (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.17">Ex 21:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.20.9">Lv 20:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.16">Dt 27:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.20.20">Prv 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.30.17">30:17</a>). Family responsibilities were strong; an entire family frequently suffered punishment for the crime of one of its individual members (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.20-26">Jos 7:20-26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.29">2 Sm 3:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-9">21:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.27">2 Kgs 5:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.5.7">Lam 5:7</a>). Over a period of time, as individual responsibility came to be recognized, parents were no longer put to death for the crimes of their children, or vice versa (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.31.29-30">Jer 31:29-30</a>).</p>
<p>Sorcery and witchcraft were forbidden. The book of Exodus stated explicitly, “A sorceress must not be allowed to live” (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.18">22:18</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Sexual perversions, such as intercourse with animals, were forbidden under penalty of death. Regulations prohibiting marriage with close relatives were given in detail (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.17-21">Lv 20:17-21</a>).</p>
<p>In Hebrew law no parallel existed for some interesting items in the Code of Hammurabi concerning surgery. That code mentioned veterinary surgery and even operations on the human eye. A Babylonian surgeon had to be wary, for “if a physician makes a deep incision upon a man with his bronze lancet and causes the man’s death or operates on the eye socket of a man with his bronze lancet and destroys the man’s eye, then they shall cut off his hand.” Surgery was virtually unknown among the ancient Israelites except for the ritual practice of circumcision.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Punishment">Punishment</p>
<p class="fl">Near Eastern punishments for murder and personal injury were retaliatory and often of the same nature as the offense. Other methods of punishment tended to vary with individual countries or traditions. Many kinds of punishment were inflicted on people defeated in both a full-scale war or a small insurrection.</p>
<p class="h3">Physical Punishment</p>
<p class="fl">Many forms of punishment stopped short of killing but could nevertheless be quite severe.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. In the OT beating with rods or switches was the traditional form of discipline for children, fools, and slaves (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.20">Ex 21:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.13.24">Prv 13:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.26.3">26:3</a>). Scourging (also called flogging) was more severe than beating. The whip employed could be made of several strips of leather fastened at one end or of two interwoven leather strips. A whip nicknamed “scorpion” (because of the barbs in its end) was one of the cruelest instruments of punishment mentioned in the OT (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.11,14">1 Kgs 12:11, 14</a>). The severity of punishment could be increased by inserting pieces of metal or bone into the leather.</p>
<p class="list-text">Before a scourging, the victim would be examined for physical fitness. If death resulted from the blows, no blame was attached to the person administering the punishment. The victim was stripped to the waist and tied to a pillar, his hands bound with leather thongs. The severity of a scourging depended on the crime, although the Mosaic law set an upper limit of 40 lashes (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.1-3">Dt 25:1-3</a>). To guard against a miscount, that number was later lowered by one (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.24">2 Cor 11:24</a>). Lashes might be administered both on the chest and the back. Under some law codes, scourging could be used as a private punishment; in that case, if the victim died, another life was forfeit.</p>
<p class="list-text">In offenses against the law, synagogue authorities administered scourgings (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.17">Mt 10:17</a>). A husband might be scourged by the elders of the city for defamation of his wife’s character (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.18">Dt 22:18</a>). Scourging was also used as a means of interrogating a prisoner—hence, a Roman captain’s comment that the apostle Paul should be “examined by scourging” (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.24">Acts 22:24</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The Romans usually reserved scourging for non-Roman citizens, such as slaves or aliens, as well as for those condemned to death. Normally, criminals were scourged after they had been condemned to death; it is therefore unusual to find the scourging of Jesus taking place before his condemnation. Pilate may have hoped to soften the people’s hearts by Jesus’ suffering so that they would not demand the death penalty (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.16,22">Lk 23:16, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.1">Jn 19:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Citizens of the Roman Empire could never be beaten or scourged before sentencing (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.25">Acts 22:25</a>). Hence, the magistrates were afraid when they heard that Paul, a Roman citizen, had been beaten under those circumstances (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.37-39">16:37-39</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. The gouging out of the eyes of prisoners and captives was a common practice in the Near East. The Philistines blinded Samson before imprisoning him (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.21">Jgs 16:21</a>). The Babylonians did the same to King Zedekiah in 587 <span class="era">BC</span> before taking him into captivity (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.7">2 Kgs 25:7</a>). The Ammonite king Nahash was prepared to accept peace overtures from the men of the city of Jabesh on condition that all their right eyes be gouged out. Nahash’s purpose was to disgrace them and prevent them from further active participation in warfare (<a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-4">1 Sm 11:1-4</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Several forms of mutilation served as punishments in the Near East. The Israelites considered their own bodies sacred and made in God’s image, but that did not prevent them from mutilating their enemies by cutting off their thumbs and large toes.</p>
<p class="list-text">The Code of Hammurabi and the Assyrian law code prescribed mutilation of the eye, nose, ear, breast, tongue, lip, hand, and finger as punishments for specific crimes. In Assyria, punishment was often inflicted by the victim of the crime under supervision of court officials. The Code of Hammurabi also contained safeguards so that criminals were not punished in excess of the law’s sentence.</p>
<p class="list">4. Stocks are mentioned as a form of punishment in the later OT period. The prophets Hanani (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.10">2 Chr 16:10</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.2-3">Jer 20:2-3</a>) suffered the indignity of being placed in stocks. Both ankles, and sometimes the wrists and head as well, were placed in holes in two large pieces of wood. In Roman times, stocks were converted to a form of torture, with a prisoner’s legs stretched to holes increasingly far apart. In the NT, Paul and Silas had their feet placed in stocks by a Philippian jailer (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.24">Acts 16:24</a>). The same Greek word, meaning “confinement,” can refer to fetters chaining a prisoner or to an iron collar like that worn by runaway Roman slaves.</p>
<p class="h3">Capital Punishment</p>
<p class="fl">Capital punishment was common in many Near Eastern countries. Several methods were used.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Those who offended a king were beheaded with a sword (<a href="?bref=2Sam.16.9">2 Sm 16:9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.31-32">2 Kgs 6:31-32</a>), as were idolaters and murderers (according to the Mishnah, the Jewish commentary on the law). The sword was probably used for private executions as well. Inhabitants of entire cities were sometimes “put to the sword” for their denial of the faith (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.27">Ex 32:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.15">Dt 13:15</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Certain sexual offenses were punished with death by burning (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.14">Lv 20:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.21.9">21:9</a>). Tamar, Judah’s daughter-in-law, was accused of adultery and ordered to be burned to death outside the city (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.24">Gn 38:24</a>). The Lord instructed that anyone whose feet touched the holy ground of Mt Sinai was to be shot with arrows or stoned (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.13">Ex 19:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Hanging may have been a form of execution in biblical times. But many scholars think the word translated “hanging” or “hanging on a tree” actually meant impalement (<a href="?bref=Num.25.4">Nm 25:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.22-23">Dt 21:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.29">Jos 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.6,9">2 Sm 21:6, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.9.14">Est 9:14</a>). A spiked wooden stake was set in the ground and the victim’s body was forced onto the spike, the tip of which probably protruded from the chest or mouth. Commonly practiced by the Assyrians, that form of execution was reserved for those guilty of the worst crimes and for prisoners of war or deserters. The Persian king Darius is reputed to have impaled 3,000 men when his army entered Babylon. Impalement was the penalty Darius set for changing his edict concerning the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.11-12">Ezr 6:11-12</a>). It is not certain whether Haman was hung or impaled (see <a href="?bref=Esth.7.9-10">Est 7:9-10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> and mg notes).</p>
<p class="list-text">Usually “hanging” was a means of exhibiting a corpse as a warning to local inhabitants (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.19">Gn 40:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.29">Jos 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.26">10:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.4.12">2 Sm 4:12</a>). Corpses were exhibited for only one day and were buried before nightfall. The hanging corpse was considered a defilement of the land that God had given (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.22-23">Dt 21:22-23</a>). According to the Mishnah, the hands were tied together and the body hanged from the arm of a wooden gallows.</p>
<p class="list">4. Crucifixion was a punishment employed by the Syrian king Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167–166 <span class="era">BC</span>; according to Josephus, a first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Jewish historian, Jews who refused to give up their traditional faith were so executed. During the Maccabean period (167–40 <span class="era">BC</span>), Alexander Janneus crucified 800 rebellious Pharisees in an attempt to reestablish his authority. Crucifixion was a widespread form of execution: it was used in most places in the Roman Empire, including India, North Africa, and Germany. Between 4 <span class="era">BC</span> and <span class="era">AD</span> 70, on some occasions the number of people crucified at one time reached into the thousands.</p>
<p class="list-text">Three types of crosses seem to have been used: a cross with the crossbar below the head of the upright bar (Latin cross); a T-shaped cross (St Anthony’s cross); and an X-shaped cross (St Andrew’s cross). Matthew records that an inscription, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews,” was placed over Jesus’ head (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.37">Mt 27:37</a>). That indicates that for Jesus’ crucifixion a Latin cross was used, as artists have traditionally depicted it. In crucifixions the victim was most likely affixed to the cross while it was still lying flat on the ground. Then the cross was raised into position and dropped into a hole. The hands were either nailed or bound to the cross; it is uncertain whether the feet were nailed with one or two nails. The weight of the body was supported by a piece of wood at the feet and possibly by another that was like a spike between the legs.</p>
<p class="list">5. Stoning was the most common Hebrew death penalty. The first stones were thrown by the prosecution witnesses, who were then joined by spectators. Stoning was the punishment for certain religious offenses (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.16">Lv 24:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.15.32-36">Nm 15:32-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.13.1-10">Dt 13:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.17.2-5">17:2-5</a>), adultery (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.23-24">Dt 22:23-24</a>), child sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.2">Lv 20:2</a>), divination of spirits (<a href="?bref=Lev.20.27">Lv 20:27</a>), and rebellion (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.18-21">Dt 21:18-21</a>). Before his conversion, the apostle Paul witnessed and consented to the stoning of Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.58-59">Acts 7:58-59</a>). Paul himself later survived a stoning at Lystra (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.19">14:19</a>). In Roman times, a person would occasionally be stoned as he stood on a gallows.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew law was part of the Torah (“instruction”) given by God to make his covenant people holy. At that time the Israelites were a seminomadic band of former slaves. Although there are similarities with the Code of Hammurabi and other laws of settled Near Eastern cultures, there are also many differences. Hebrew law often had a broader view, even in its less sophisticated cultural setting, as though its purpose was more to teach godly behavior than to stabilize society. The simplicity and directness of the Ten Commandments, in particular, continue to influence jurisprudence, even in modern secular society.</p>
<p>The Bible’s primary message is God’s love for his covenant people, yet it never overlooks the harsh realities of life in a fallen world. Human beings sin and they commit crimes; they suffer estrangement from God because of their sin and are punished for their crimes. Christians are constantly reminded of the realism of God’s love by the cross as the symbol of Christian faith. They see the crucifixion of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of OT prophecy that the Lord put our iniquity on him (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.5-6">Is 53:5-6</a>). The NT conviction is that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>).</p>

  <title>Crown</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CROWN</p>
<p class="fl">Headpiece symbolizing honor or high office. In addition to using the word metaphorically, the OT refers to three kinds of crowns. One type of crown was worn by the high priest and Hebrew kings. The high priest’s “holy crown” was a gold plate engraved with the words “Holy to the Lord” fastened to the front of a turban (<a href="?bref=Exod.29.6">Ex 29:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.39.30">39:30</a>). It symbolized his consecration as the people’s representative before God. The Hebrew kings wore a crown light enough to be worn into battle (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.10">2 Sm 1:10</a>)—perhaps a narrow band of silk studded with jewels. Like the high priest’s, the king’s crown also indicated a divinely appointed office (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.12">2 Kgs 11:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.39">Pss 89:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.132.18">132:18</a>). A second type of crown was a massive gold and jeweled symbol of office worn by pagan kings and idols (<a href="?bref=2Sam.12.30">2 Sm 12:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.1.11">Est 1:11</a>). The prophet Zechariah placed such a crown on Joshua the high priest to indicate the union of royal and priestly functions (<a href="?bref=Zech.6.11,14">Zec 6:11, 14</a>). A third type of crown was a wreath of flowers used at a banquet to symbolize joy and celebration (<a href="?bref=Song.3.11">Sg 3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.1">Is 28:1</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.2.8">Wisd of Sol 2:8</a>).</p>
<p>The word “crown” is used metaphorically to indicate rule or royalty (<a href="?bref=Nah.3.17">Na 3:17</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), glory or honor (<a href="?bref=Job.19.9">Jb 19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.8.5">Ps 8:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.12">Ez 16:12</a>), joy (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.42">Ez 23:42</a>), or pride (<a href="?bref=Job.31.36">Jb 31:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.3">Is 28:3</a>).</p>
<p>In the NT the most common word for “crown” means a laurel wreath worn at banquets or a prize given as a civic or military honor. The apostle Paul alluded to its use as an athletic prize when he urged Christians to be disciplined in striving for a “crown” that would not wither (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.25">1 Cor 9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Tim.2.5">2 Tm 2:5</a>). Paul regarded his converts as his “joy and crown” (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.1">Phil 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.2.19">1 Thes 2:19</a>).</p>
<p>A victor’s wreath symbolizes the eternal life inherited by Christians who have persevered (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">Jas 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.5.4">1 Pt 5:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.2.10">Rv 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.3.11">3:11</a>). In the book of Revelation the victories of the locusts (<a href="?bref=Rev.9.7">9:7</a>), the woman (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.1">12:1</a>), and Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.2">6:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.14.14">14:14</a>) are symbolized by laurel crowns. A different Greek word, meaning a royal crown, is used for the diadems on the heads of the dragon (<a href="?bref=Rev.12.3">12:3</a>), the beast from the sea (<a href="?bref=Rev.13.1">13:1</a>), and Christ (<a href="?bref=Rev.19.12">19:12</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus’ crown of thorns was a circlet formed from a prickly shrub—an ironic parody of a victor’s wreath (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.17-18">Mk 15:17-18</a>). Its combination with the robe, scepter (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.27-29">Mt 27:27-29</a>), and satirical inscription on the cross that Jesus was “the King of the Jews” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.26">Mk 15:26</a>), were all meant to mock him as a defeated messianic aspirant.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">CRUCIFIXION</p>
<p class="fl">Form of execution employed in the death of Jesus Christ. Two concepts related to crucifixion occur in Scripture: the “cross,” a pagan mode of capital punishment, and the “tree,” which was a Jewish form. Jesus’ crucifixion was the means by which he procured atonement for humanity. The term “cross” was also used figuratively by Jesus to portray the sacrifice required in discipleship, and it was used by the apostle Paul to symbolize the death of self in the process of transformation.</p>

<p class="h2" id="HistoricalBackground">Historical Background</p>
<p class="h3">The Pagan Mode</p>
<p class="fl">Literally, the word “cross” in Greek referred to a pointed stake used for various purposes, including an instrument of execution. It could be an upright stake, used to impale a victim, or a vertical stake with a crossbeam either across the top (T) or across the middle (+), used to hang or crucify a criminal, with the added disgrace of public display. Evidently crucifixion was practiced first by the Medes and Persians and later by Alexander the Great (356–323 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Carthaginians, and the Romans. Both Greeks and Romans restricted its use to slaves, considering it too barbaric for citizens. In the imperial era the Romans extended the use to foreigners, but even so it was used mainly for crimes against the state.</p>
<p>Crucifixion was universally recognized as the most horrible type of execution. In the East, in fact, it was used only as a further sign of disgrace for prisoners already executed, usually by decapitation. In the West the condemned criminal was scourged (whipped), usually at the place of execution, and forced to carry the crossbeam to the spot where a stake had already been erected. A tablet stating the crime was often placed around the offender’s neck and was fastened to the cross after the execution. The prisoner was commonly tied or sometimes nailed to the crossbeam (with the nails through the wrists, since the bones in the hand could not take the weight). The beam was then raised and fixed to the upright pole. If the executioners wished a particularly slow, agonizing death, they might drive blocks or pins into the stake for a seat or a step to support the feet. Death came about either through loss of blood circulation followed by coronary failure or through the collapse of one’s lungs, causing suffocation. That could take days, so often the victim’s legs would be broken below the knees with a club, causing massive shock and eliminating any further possibility of easing the pressure on the bound or spiked wrists. Usually a body was left on the cross to rot, but in some instances was given to relatives or friends for burial.</p>
<p class="h3">The Jewish Mode</p>
<p class="fl">A different form of crucifixion is seen in the OT. King Saul’s body was decapitated and affixed to a wall by the Philistines (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.9-10">1 Sm 31:9-10</a>). The Persian king Darius made impaling the penalty for altering his decree (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.11">Ezr 6:11</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Deut.21.22-23">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, the Eastern form was employed by the Jews with the added proviso that the body must be removed from “the tree” before nightfall, because the victim was “accursed by God” (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>) and must not remain to “defile the land.” The Roman form of crucifixion was not employed by the Jews. The only exception was a mass crucifixion of 800 rebels by the Jewish ruler Alexander Janneus in 76 <span class="era">BC</span>, reported by the Jewish historian Josephus as being universally condemned by the Jews. Some believe that Jewish courts did practice the Western method of crucifixion after the second century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChristsCrucifixion">Christ’s Crucifixion</p>
<p class="fl">The NT (quoted in this article from the <span class="sc">rsv</span>) has much to say about Christ’s crucifixion because it is the central theme of the Christian faith.</p>
<p class="h3">The Predictions</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospels record three predictions by Christ of his own crucifixion (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.31">9:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.33-34">10:33-34</a> and parallel passages). In addition, John recorded three sayings about the Son of Man being “lifted up” (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>; <a href="?bref=John.8.28">8:28</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.32-33">12:32-33</a>), which parallel the synoptic predictions. Several themes are interwoven into those passages: (1) Christ’s passion (a term used for his suffering on the cross) was part of God’s redemptive purpose (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>, “must”). (2) Both Jew and Roman were guilty of “delivering” and of “killing” Jesus. (3) His death would be followed by vindication via the resurrection. (4) His death itself, in a paradoxical way, was seen as a means of his entering into “glory” (seen in the symbolism John attached to “lifted up”). Other sayings that hint at Jesus’ fate are his comment about the murder of the prophets (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.29-30">Mt 23:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.33">Lk 13:33</a>), his parables about the death of the prophets and the “son” (the marriage feast, <a href="?bref=Matt.22.1-14">Mt 22:1-14</a>; the wicked tenants, <a href="?bref=Mark.12.1-10">Mk 12:1-10</a>), and his teachings about the coming similar suffering of his disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.24-28">Mt 10:24-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.34-35">Mk 8:34-35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.18-25">Jn 15:18-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Historical Event</p>
<p class="fl">The crucifixion of Jesus combined Roman and Jewish elements. Although the Gospel writers stressed Jewish guilt for their own polemical purposes, they were careful to distinguish between the leaders and the common people. It was the leaders who initiated Jesus’ arrest (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.43">Mk 14:43</a>) and his trial by the Sanhedrin (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.14.53-64">53-64</a>). Though Pilate seemed to vacillate and in the end surrendered weakly to the crowds by “washing his hands” of any guilt (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.24">Mt 27:24</a>), Rome was clearly implicated in the Crucifixion. Since the Sanhedrin did not have the power to inflict capital punishment, Pilate’s decision was necessary before crucifixion could occur. Further, Romans actually carried out the execution.</p>
<p>At Jesus’ crucifixion Roman custom was observed in his scourging, his mock enthronement and stripping, the bearing of his own crossbeam, his being nailed to the cross, and the breaking of the two thieves’ legs. The elevated site fits the custom of displaying certain criminals publicly. So does the height of Jesus’ cross, probably seven to nine feet (2 to 3 meters). The presence of a tablet bearing the inscription “The King of the Jews” on the cross suggests that the crossbeam was fixed somewhere below the top of the stake. Jewish elements are seen in the wine mixed with myrrh (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.23">Mk 15:23</a>), the vinegar on the hyssop reed (v <a href="?bref=Mark.15.36">36</a>), and the removal of the body before sunset and the beginning of the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=John.19.31">Jn 19:31</a>).</p>
<p>Although the fact of Jesus’ crucifixion is seldom challenged historically, the varying details in the four Gospels are sometimes regarded as later additions due to the influence of prophetic “fulfillment,” to Christian-Jewish polemics or to cultic considerations. However, one cannot conclude from the differences in the Gospel accounts that the details are not historical. Narrative selectivity on the part of the Gospel writers is in no sense evidence of fabrication.</p>
<p class="h3">The Emphasis in Each Gospel</p>
<p class="fl">The elements found in the individual passion narratives were selected by each writer to present a particular view of the crucifixion scene. It has been realized for some time that the Gospel writers were not only historians but also theologians, selecting scenes and portraying them to show the significance of the events for the Christian faith. Their selection is poignantly evident in the crucifixion narratives.</p>
<p>Mark and Matthew both show the horror of the Messiah being put to death by human beings. The first half of Mark’s scene contrasts the taunts of the crowd with the true significance of Jesus’ death. The twofold “save yourself” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.29-31">Mk 15:29-31</a>) repeats Jesus’ words about rebuilding the temple in three days—prophetically pointing to the resurrection. The second half of Mark’s description stresses the horror of the scene, progressing from a darkness motif to the cry of abandonment to further taunts (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.15.33-36">33-36</a>).</p>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew extends Mark’s imagery in certain important directions, adding that Jesus refused the stupefying drink (a drugged wine to alleviate pain) “when he tasted it” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.34">Mt 27:34</a>), as well as adding “yielded up his spirit” to the death scene (v <a href="?bref=Matt.27.50">50</a>). Matthew thus emphasizes that Jesus voluntarily faced his death fully conscious and in complete control of himself. Matthew’s irony and allusion also bring out the disparity between Jesus’ suffering and his vindication. Elements of vindication include the ripping of the temple veil (v <a href="?bref=Matt.27.51">51</a>) and the centurion’s testimony (v <a href="?bref=Matt.27.54">54</a>). In the remarkable supernatural scene of <a href="?bref=Matt.27.52-53">Matthew 27:52-53</a>, Jesus’ death is followed immediately by an earthquake that opened tombs and revived “many bodies of the saints” who had died. For Matthew those events and others inaugurated the last days, the new age of salvation, when the power of death is broken and life is made available for all.</p>
<p>The account in Luke’s Gospel is also quite remarkable. It has two major thrusts. First, Jesus is portrayed as the perfect example of the righteous martyr who forgives his enemies and by his attitude converts some of his opponents. The taunts of the rulers and soldiers are reversed when the crowd returns home “beating their breasts” (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.48">Lk 23:48</a>) and the centurion cries, “Certainly this man was innocent!” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.23.47">47</a>). Second, in Luke the entire setting has an atmosphere of reverence and worship. Omitted are the wine and myrrh, the cry of abandonment, and the Elijah taunt. Other episodes are noted instead—in particular, the prayers of Jesus. In Luke alone are related (1) Jesus’ prayer that God forgive his executioners, placing it in contrast with the soldiers’ mockery; (2) the promise in answer to the prayer of the “believing” criminal; and (3) the commitment of Jesus’ spirit to the Father. Luke’s presentation makes the Crucifixion a kind of worshipful commemoration.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John also one finds a change of theological focus. It goes further than Luke in removing shocking details such as the darkness and the taunts. Calm pervades throughout. Stress is laid on Jesus’ sovereign control of his situation, as the Crucifixion virtually becomes a coronation procession. John alone states that the inscription on the cross was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek—the charge thus becomes a worldwide proclamation of Christ’s enthronement. The inscription, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews,” continues Pilate’s dialogue on kingship beyond Jesus’ trial. John thus adds to Matthew’s emphasis: Jesus has not only become king but has been sovereign all along. The king is pictured as performing the priestly function and himself becoming the sacrifice. John alone mentions the hyssop (which had been used to sprinkle the blood of the lamb at the Passover, <a href="?bref=Exod.12.22">Ex 12:22</a>) and Jesus’ cry, “It is finished” (<a href="?bref=John.19.29-30">Jn 19:29-30</a>). Further, the piercing of Jesus’ side (vv <a href="?bref=John.19.31-37">31-37</a>), which shows the reality of his death, may also be seen symbolically, along with the “rivers of living water” (<a href="?bref=John.7.37-38">7:37-38</a>), as typifying the outpouring of life in the new age.</p>
<p>Thus, each Gospel pictures the meaning of Jesus’ death from a different vantage point. To combine their pictures gives new understanding of the significance of the cross. Rather than contradiction, one sees separate parts of a compelling whole.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTheologicalSignificanceofChristsCrucifixion">The Theological Significance of Christ’s Crucifixion</p>
<p class="fl">The cross plays a dual role in Christian theology. Some theologians emphasize the significance of the historical crucifixion of Jesus Christ and what it accomplished for the believer. Others focus on the symbolism of the cross in each believer’s life.</p>
<p>The death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth are the central events of Christian theology. The cross has meaning because of the significance of the person who was put to death on it and because of what his death accomplished. “The word of the cross” was central in the salvation proclamation of the early church. Above all, the event of the cross was God’s principal saving act in history; hence the cross, though a past event, has present significance. Christ crucified and risen is the core of the church’s message (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.1">Gal 3:1</a>).</p>
<p>The central passage is <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17-2.5">1 Corinthians 1:17–2:5</a>. There the “word of the cross” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.18">1:18</a>) is contrasted with “eloquent wisdom” (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.17">17</a>). Sounding like foolishness, it is offensive to both Greek philosophy and Jewish legalism (cf. <a href="?bref=Gal.6.12-15">Gal 6:12-15</a>), but that very “weakness” in human eyes opens the door for the “power of God” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.18">1 Cor 1:18</a>). The cross in the church’s <span class="greek">kerygma</span> (proclamation) illustrates the pattern of God’s action: he forges out of the debilitated things of life both power and wisdom (vv <a href="?bref=1Cor.1.26-30">26-30</a>). Because philosophical speculation replaces God’s message with human wisdom and thus empties the cross of its significance, Paul rejected “lofty words” and preached only the “crucified Christ.” The “Holy Spirit’s power” thus became evident in Paul’s “weakness” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.2.1-5">2:1-5</a>). The central core of the gospel is God’s demonstration of victory emerging from seeming defeat, of power arising out of infirmity.</p>
<p>The cross as the basis of atonement is the principal emphasis in the Epistles (see <a href="?bref=Eph.2.16">Eph 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.20">Col 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.2.14">2:14</a>), whereas in the book of Acts the resurrection seems more central (see <a href="?bref=Acts.2.33-36">Acts 2:33-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.3.19-26">3:19-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.37-39">13:37-39</a>). The reason for the different emphasis is found in the different purposes of those writings: the cross tends to be used in didactic (instructional) sections, the resurrection in apologetic (persuasive) or kerygmatic sections, when the basis for salvation is being presented. In actuality they were a single event in salvation history. Jesus “was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification” (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.25">Rom 4:25</a>).</p>
<p>Paul expressed the significance of the cross in the words “redemption,” “propitiation,” and “justification.” The first two concepts have the “for us” theme traceable to the suffering servant (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.10-12">Is 53:10-12</a>), whose death was for “the sin of many.” The idea of redemption in both Testaments is the payment of a price to “ransom” those held captive. That price, the NT explains, was paid on the cross, and humanity was thereby freed from sin (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.45">Mk 10:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.2.14">Ti 2:14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18">1 Pt 1:18</a>). The connection between Jesus’ death and the substitutionary preposition “instead of” is also seen in <a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Galatians 3:13</a>, which adds to the curse of <a href="?bref=Deut.21.23">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> the interpretation “for us” (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.5.10-11,18">Rom 5:10-11, 18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.24">1 Cor 11:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.7">Eph 1:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.13">2:13</a>). Similarly, Paul’s concept of justification centers on the cross. It is “Christ crucified” who declares humanity righteous and makes freedom from sin possible (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.6">Rom 6:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.19-21">Gal 2:19-21</a>). Human guilt was transferred to the cross and expiated there, opening up God’s forensic (legal) forgiveness of all who avail themselves of its power (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.18-21">1 Pt 1:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.18">3:18</a>). Finally, the result is “reconciliation”—both vertically, between humans and God (<a href="?bref=Col.1.20">Col 1:20</a>), and horizontally, between previously opposed human forces (e.g., in <a href="?bref=Eph.2.13-16">Eph 2:13-16</a>, between Jew and Gentile).</p>
<p>Beyond the theological meaning of the literal cross on which Jesus Christ was put to death in Judea nearly 2,000 years ago is the symbolic significance of the cross for his followers today.</p>
<p>Jesus made “bearing the cross” a condition of discipleship in five passages. There are two major variants: one, found in the material common to Matthew and Luke (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.38">Mt 10:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.14.27">Lk 14:27</a>), is phrased negatively (“cannot be my disciple”); the other, which is found in all three synoptic Gospels (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.24">Mt 16:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.34">Mk 8:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.23">Luke 9:23</a>), is phrased positively (“If anyone would come after me”). Two major motifs are found in the sayings. The major motif comes from the imagery of a condemned man carrying his cross to an execution site; a necessary part of discipleship is a daily (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.23">Lk 9:23</a>) willingness to sacrifice all and to suffer for the sake of Christ. The central point is not death but disgrace; the disciple must be ready to become an outcast from society.</p>
<p>Paul extended Christ’s metaphor to the death of self. He may have taken the idea from the early catechism, as seen in the baptismal creed of <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-8">Romans 6:1-8</a>, which identifies baptism as being “buried with him.” Paul interpreted the Christian’s identification with Christ’s death to mean that “our old self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin” (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.6">Rom 6:6</a>). As further developed in <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.14-17">2 Corinthians 5:14-17</a>, the believer participates in the death and resurrection of Christ, so that the old life has passed away and the new has come (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">5:17</a>). The same view is found also in Galatians, which contrasts the mystical death of self to the legalistic system of the Judaizers. The believer is “crucified with Christ,” with the result that “it is no longer I who live” (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.20">Gal 2:20</a>); “the flesh with its passions and desires” is “crucified” (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.24">5:24</a>); and “far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world” (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.14">6:14</a>). Believers must experience the cross before they can find the resurrection life.</p>

<p class="fl">Theological phrase used in two contexts: (1) in Jewish usage, a cup of wine drunk at the end of a meal and having special Passover significance; (2) in Christian usage, the Communion goblet.</p>
<p>In the Passover feast the cup of blessing is the third of four cups required in the ceremony of the Paschal meal. It derives its name from the prayer offered over the cup: “Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, who givest us the fruit of the vine.”</p>
<p>The apostle Paul used the term in reference to the wine of the Lord’s Supper (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.16">1 Cor 10:16</a>). His words are taken by many interpreters as evidence that the early church saw the Lord’s Supper as a transformation and fulfillment of the Passover celebration. To participate in drinking the cup of blessing is to commit oneself to Christ, “our paschal lamb” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.7">5:7</a>), whose death it commemorates, and to enter into “communion” or fellowship with him. The phrase “cup of the Lord” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.21">10:21</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.27">11:27</a>) or simply “the cup” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.25">11:25</a>) is also used. Paul added that true communion with Christ, signified by the cup of blessing, should exclude communion with spiritual forces opposed to Christ, signified by the “cup of demons” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.21">10:21</a>).</p>

  <title>Curse, Cursed</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CURSE, CURSED</p>
<p class="fl">Invocation of evil or injury against one’s enemies. As practiced in Bible times, cursing was the opposite of blessing and should not be confused with profanity in the modern sense.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PaganBeliefs">Pagan Beliefs</p>
<p class="fl">Curses and blessings were linked to the ancient pagan belief that spirits of “the gods” could be invoked to act on behalf of a person who repeated certain incantations or performed certain deeds (such as sacrifices). It was thought that a spoken curse possessed an occult power to work calamity on one’s enemies. In some pagan cultures, curses were written on clay jars that were then smashed, symbolically initiating or effecting the intended curse.</p>
<p>Tombs were protected against would-be desecrators by means of curses. Royal inscriptions were protected by maledictions aimed at anyone who might alter, destroy, or defy the written decree (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.11-12">Ezr 6:11-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="CursesinOldTestamentTimes">Curses in Old Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">Among the Hebrews a curse, valid only within a covenant framework overseen by God, was spoken for the sake of justice. In the OT the curse was an integral part of a covenant relationship—between God and the community, between God and an individual, or among members of the community. To break the terms of a covenant was to merit the covenant curse or curses. A curse invoked under other conditions was powerless. “Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying, a curse that is causeless does not alight” (<a href="?bref=Pr.26.2">Prv 26:2</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). A curse could be retracted by pronouncing a blessing (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.32">Ex 12:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-2">Jgs 17:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.1-3">2 Sm 21:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>The Mosaic law forbade the cursing of parents (<a href="?bref=Exod.21.17">Ex 21:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.20.20">Prv 20:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.15.4">Mt 15:4</a>), the ruler (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.28">Ex 22:28</a>), and the deaf (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.14">Lv 19:14</a>). A man who suspected his wife of unfaithfulness could require that she submit to a test administered by the priest that would result in a curse upon her if she was guilty (<a href="?bref=Num.5.11-31">Nm 5:11-31</a>). Individuals might pronounce a curse upon themselves to show the truthfulness of their assertions or promises (<a href="?bref=Num.5.19-22">Nm 5:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.31.7-10,16-22">Jb 31:7-10, 16-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.137.5-6">Ps 137:5-6</a>). In the NT the apostle Peter followed the OT practice when he used a curse to deny that he knew Jesus (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.71">Mk 14:71</a>). Certain men who wished to kill the apostle Paul proved their sincerity by such a solemn curse (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.12,14,21">Acts 23:12, 14, 21</a>). Cursing God was punishable by death (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.10-16">Lv 24:10-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.22.28">Ex 22:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.21-22">Is 8:21-22</a>).</p>
<p>Curses in Bible history include God’s curse on the serpent, Adam, and Eve (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.14-19">Gn 3:14-19</a>); on Cain (<a href="?bref=Gen.4.11-12">4:11-12</a>); on those who might curse the patriarch Abraham and his descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">12:3</a>); and on those who put their trust in human strength instead of in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.5">Jer 17:5</a>). When the people of Israel passed through Moab on their way to the Promised Land, Moab’s king, Balak, hired Balaam to curse the Israelites; he and Balaam learned, however, that they could not curse those whom God had blessed (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Nm 22–24</a>). Joshua cursed anyone who might try to rebuild Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.26">Jos 6:26</a>; fulfilled in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kgs 16:34</a>). King Saul made a curse that almost cost his son Jonathan’s life (<a href="?bref=1Sam.14.24,43-45">1 Sm 14:24, 43-45</a>). Many other curses are mentioned in the OT (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.9.25">Gn 9:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.5-7">49:5-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.22-23">Jos 9:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.9.7-21,57">Jgs 9:7-21, 57</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.16.5-13">2 Sm 16:5-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.17-24">1 Kgs 21:17-24</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.24">2 Kgs 2:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.2.2">Mal 2:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.6">4:6</a>). The pronouncement of “woe” (<span class="sc">nlt</span> “destruction”) is also the language of curse (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.8-23">Is 5:8-23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.23.13-33">Mt 23:13-33</a>, where “alas” and “woe” can be used synonymously and may be either an exclamation of sorrow or of impending doom and calamity).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Ps.109.1-31">Psalm 109</a> contains a lengthy imprecation against the psalmist’s enemies, evidently because they had spoken some words against him falsely (see also <a href="?bref=Ps.58.6-11">Pss 58:6-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.19-28">69:19-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.143.12">143:12</a>). The prophet Jeremiah was not averse to calling on God to punish his tormentors (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.20">Jer 11:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.12.3">12:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.15.15">15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.18">17:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.18.21-22">18:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.20.11-12">20:11-12</a>) or asking God not to forgive them (<a href="?bref=Jer.18.23">18:23</a>). Such imprecations against one’s enemies are difficult for Christians today to understand because they contrast sharply with the NT commands to “bless those who curse you” (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.28">Lk 6:28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.12.14">Rom 12:14</a>). Jesus’ injunction to “love your enemies” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.44">Mt 5:44</a>) may be intended to point beyond the cursing practiced in the OT to a fuller understanding of God’s command to love one’s neighbor as oneself.</p>
<p class="h3">Covenant Curses</p>
<p class="fl">Protection of a contract or treaty by invoking a curse on the violator was common in OT times. Sometimes a covenant was sealed by cutting up an animal and having the covenanting individuals walk between the severed pieces; the slain animal symbolized the curse to befall the violator. God agreed to submit to such a curse on himself if he broke the covenant he made with the patriarch Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.7-21">Gn 15:7-21</a>). Later, God accused the leaders and people of Israel of breaking their covenant with him and warned them of the consequences to follow (<a href="?bref=Jer.34.18-19">Jer 34:18-19</a>). An essential part of the covenant God made with Israel at Mt Sinai was the promise of blessings for keeping the covenant and curses for breaking it (<a href="?bref=Deut.11.26-28">Dt 11:26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.15-26">27:15-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.28.15-68">28:15-68</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.30.19">30:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Lev.26.3-39">Lv 26:3-39</a>). Israel suffered those curses in the time of the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel; the covenant breakers, including the king, were threatened with a curse (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.3">Jer 11:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.11-21">Ez 17:11-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Ban on “Devoted Things”</p>
<p class="fl">A special kind of curse was the ban or anathema. Strictly speaking, it was a vow to devote persons, animals, or objects under such a curse to God. In some cases the priests could use objects that had fallen under the ban (<a href="?bref=Num.18.14">Nm 18:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.44.29">Ez 44:29</a>), but that provision did not apply to living beings. All persons or animals under the ban were sacrificed or destroyed (<a href="?bref=Lev.27.28-29">Lv 27:28-29</a>). The ban was commonly used in Israel’s wars against its pagan neighbors. Sometimes everything was declared anathema (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.17-19">Jos 6:17-19</a>), but normally only persons and heathen images were destroyed (<a href="?bref=Deut.2.34">Dt 2:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.2,25-26">7:2, 25-26</a>—not even the melted gold of images was to be kept). To violate the ban by preserving any part of the cursed things was to come under the ban oneself. Because Achan did not respect the ban placed upon Jericho, the terms of that curse came upon all Israel until Achan confessed and was executed (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Jos 7</a>).</p>
<p>After the exile, the Jews did not practice the anathema (or ban) by putting people to death; people who violated a curse were excommunicated and put out of the congregation of Israel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.10.8">Ezr 10:8</a>). That meant that the person was no longer part of God’s people and was considered “dead.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="CursesinNewTestamentTimes">Curses in New Testament Times</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish synagogues practiced excommunication, or anathema, in the NT period (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.22">Lk 6:22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.22">Jn 9:22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.42">12:42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.16.2">16:2</a>). Later, Christians excommunicated persons by declaring them outside of the redeemed community (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.17">Mt 18:17</a>) or “delivered to Satan” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.5">1 Cor 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.20">1 Tm 1:20</a>). Both practices stemmed from the OT ban. Unlike that curse, however, the excommunication could be removed as soon as the person repented.</p>
<p>Since the anathema branded a person as “rejected” or “cursed by God,” Saul of Tarsus, before his conversion, tried to compel Christians to renounce Christ by calling him accursed (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.26.11">Acts 26:11</a>). Later, as an apostle, Paul (Saul) warned that no one speaking by the Spirit of God could call Jesus accursed (<a href="?bref=1Cor.12.3">1 Cor 12:3</a>). Paul pronounced anathema (destined for judgment and perdition) upon anyone who preached another gospel than the one he and the other apostles preached (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.8-9">Gal 1:8-9</a>). Paul said he wished he could be accursed, cut off from salvation and the people of God, if that could lead to the salvation of his fellow Israelites (<a href="?bref=Rom.9.3">Rom 9:3</a>). His desire reflected the love of Christ, who accepted the “curse of the law” upon himself in submitting to suffering and death on the cross in order to redeem human beings from that curse (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.8-14">Gal 3:8-14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.21.22-23">Dt 21:22-23</a>). The NT promises that a time will come when “there shall no longer be any curse” (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.3">Rv 22:3</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>).</p>

  <title>Cush (Place)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">CUSH (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Egyptian, Akkadian, and Hebrew term broadly referring to the countries of the Upper Nile south of Egypt. In a narrower sense Cush consisted of the territory between the second and fourth cataracts of the Nile, roughly the present northern Sudan (equivalent to ancient Nubia). The OT generally uses the term in that sense. The Greeks called it Ethiopia, which eventually gave its name to modern Ethiopia (farther to the south and east).</p>
<p>The meaning of “Cush” in the book of Genesis, however, is problematic. In the Garden of Eden narrative (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.13">Gn 2:13</a>), Cush seems to be located in Mesopotamia, the region of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (v <a href="?bref=Gen.2.14">14</a>). Perhaps the term there should be equated with Kassite (Cossaean), the usual designation of the Babylonian rulers who held sway in Mesopotamia for about half a millennium down to the 12th century <span class="era">BC</span>. The Cush of <a href="?bref=Gen.10.6-8">Genesis 10:6-8</a>, then, could be divided into two locales: Nubia (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.6-7">6-7</a>) and Mesopotamia (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.10.9-12">9-12</a>). Alternatively, the Cush of <a href="?bref=Gen.2.13">Genesis 2:13</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.10.8">10:8</a> could be Kish, the Mesopotamian city that was traditionally the seat of the first Sumerian dynasty after the Flood.</p>
<p>Less uncertainty exists over use of the term “Cushite.” With one possible exception (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1">Nm 12:1</a>), Cushite always refers to people from Nubia, the African Cush.</p>
<p>The first messenger whom Joab, King David’s commander in chief, sent to announce Absalom’s defeat to David was a Cushite (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.21-32">2 Sm 18:21-32</a>). That messenger’s foreign origin is reflected in the fact that he was unaware of a shortcut as well as in his insensitivity to the feelings of David when he gave him the message. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> transliterates the Hebrew word as a proper name (Cushi), but that rendering is unlikely. Most English versions translate the other occurrences of Cush and Cushite as Ethiopia and Ethiopians.</p>
<p>Moses had a wife who was known as a Cushite (<a href="?bref=Num.12.1">Nm 12:1</a>). In that context it is possible to understand Cushite in several ways: as a person from Nubia—which would make her a second wife, different from Zipporah; as a person from Cushan—making her possibly a Midianite, perhaps identical with Zipporah; or as a reference to her darker skin and foreign origin—possibly but not necessarily a reference to Zipporah.</p>

<p>The Cuthans seem to have been a predominant segment of the population of postexilic Samaria, since Jews in later centuries applied that name to Samaritans in general.

After about 700 <span class="era">BC</span>, they were gradually replaced by stamp seals. In Palestine the stamp seal was commonly used in biblical times.</p>
<p>The earliest cylinder seals were engraved with a distinctive scene that could signify ownership for the one to whom it belonged. A cylinder seal was often less than an inch (2.5 centimeters) in length and normally had a hole drilled through the barrel so it could be hung about the neck or waist. By 2700 <span class="era">BC</span> the seals also carried a cuneiform inscription of the name and title of their owner. During the Akkadian period (2360–2180 <span class="era">BC</span>), professions were also indicated. Early in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span> the owner usually identified himself as the servant of a particular god. By the mid-second millennium, prayers were commonly added.</p>
<p>In the fourth and third millennia <span class="era">BC</span>, cylinder seals were used primarily to indicate ownership of property, perhaps by rolling a seal across the wet clay of a jar or package. They were also used to identify and seal documents inscribed on clay tablets. At first they were used only by kings and top officials, but during the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span> large numbers of the aristocracy had them. Cylinder seals were buried with their owners; nearly 15,000 have been recovered.

<p class="h1">CYPRUS</p>
<p class="fl">Island country located in the northeastern Mediterranean Sea, 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) south of Turkey (Asia Minor), 70 miles (112.6 kilometers) west of Syria, and 245 miles (394.2 kilometers) north of Egypt. This island, about 110 miles (177 kilometers) long and 50 miles (80.5 kilometers) wide, supports the Kyrenia and Troodas Massif mountain ranges separated by the fertile Mesaoria Plain. A narrow strip of land 40 miles (64.3 kilometers) long and 5 miles (8 kilometers) wide extends from the northeastern part of the island. Cyprus is rimmed with a number of natural harbors. In antiquity these harbors provided a strategic meeting place of sea routes from Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. The Cypriot copper mines, though now largely depleted, have long been a source of revenue for its inhabitants.</p>
<p>During the Bronze Age (late fourth–second millennia <span class="era">BC</span>), Cyprus experienced an increased growth in population and economic importance among the Mediterranean communities. The island at that time was named Alashiya, as attested in the ancient documents of Ebla (24th century <span class="era">BC</span>), Mari (18th century <span class="era">BC</span>), Ugarit, and Tel el-Amarna (14th century <span class="era">BC</span>). Elishah, an OT name for this island, is perhaps identifiable with the extrabiblical Alashiya (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.7">Ez 27:7</a>). Alashiya (Cyprus) established a network of trade with Syria, Palestine, and Egypt and became known for its exports, especially copper, oil, wood, and pottery. Pieces of Alashiyan pottery have been found at over 50 sites in Egypt, 25 sites in Palestine, and 17 sites in Syria. The ancient texts of Ebla, Mari, and Amarna record the business transactions involving Alashiya’s treasured copper. Toward the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1270–1190 <span class="era">BC</span>) the Mycenian and Achaian Greeks began to migrate to Cyprus. During this period, the Greek colonies of Salamis and Paphos were founded.</p>
<p>In the ninth and eighth centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, the Phoenicians settled their people and asserted their dominance on Cyprus. King Hiram II of Tyre (741–738 <span class="era">BC</span>) included Cyprus in his royal domain, according to the inscriptions found at Mt Sinoas. Kition, near modern Larnaka, was a Phoenician settlement whose inhabitants were called Kittim. The Hebrews named the whole island Kittim (<a href="?bref=Num.24.24">Nm 24:24</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Chittim”) and eventually referred to any maritime country by this name (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.10">Jer 2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.11.30">Dn 11:30</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.1.1">1 Macc 1:1</a>). Isaiah announced that from the ports of Kittim (Cyprus), the reports of Tyre’s destruction would be confirmed to its homeward-traveling sailors (<a href="?bref=Isa.23.1,12">Is 23:1, 12</a>).</p>

<p>Assyria, rising as the superior power in the Near East during the eighth and seventh centuries <span class="era">BC</span>, made Cyprus one of its tributaries. The stele of King Sargon II (721–705 <span class="era">BC</span>) records the tributes received by seven kings of Cyprus. The prism of Esarhaddon (c. 670 <span class="era">BC</span>) registers ten Cypriot kings with their cities. During the Assyrian occupation, Cyprus was called Iadnan. After the dissolution of the Assyrian Empire, Cyprus was governed by Amasis, king of Egypt (569–527 <span class="era">BC</span>), and later by King Cambyses II of Persia (529–522 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>After Alexander the Great’s decisive defeat of the Persian army at Issus in 333 <span class="era">BC</span>, Cyprus sent 120 ships to help support his siege against Tyre. The Ptolemies of Egypt (a subdivision of the Greek Empire) gained possession of the island after Alexander’s death in 323 and retained control of Cyprus from 294–258 <span class="era">BC</span>. This period brought relative peace and prosperity to the island. Cyprus, meaning copper in Greek, was the name assigned to it.</p>
<p>Cyprus was annexed to Rome in 58 <span class="era">BC</span>, and Cicero was appointed its governor in 52. In 22 <span class="era">BC</span> Rome made Cyprus into a senatorial province; Sergius Paulus was selected as its proconsul in <span class="era">AD</span> 46. Later, Hadrian suppressed a violent Jewish revolt in 117, after which he banished all Jews from the island.</p>
<p>In the NT, Cyprus is first mentioned as the birthplace of Barnabas (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.36">Acts 4:36</a>). Later, Jewish believers sought refuge at Cyprus from the persecutions that arose in Jerusalem on account of Stephen (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-20">11:19-20</a>). On Paul’s first missionary journey he and Barnabas set sail from Seleucia, crossing to Cyprus before going on to Asia Minor (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 47). Landing at the eastern seaport of Salamis, they gradually made their way westward across the island until they reached the western harbor town of Paphos. Here they met Bar-Jesus, the false prophet, and converted the Roman proconsul Sergius Paulus. From Paphos, Paul and Barnabas sailed to Asia Minor, docking at Perga in Pamphylia (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.4-13">13:4-13</a>). Paul bypassed Cyprus on his second missionary journey; however, Barnabas with John Mark revisited the island (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.39">15:39</a>). On Paul’s final trip to Jerusalem, Cyprus was used as a navigational landmark in crossing from Patara to Tyre (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.3">21:3</a>). On the journey to Rome, Paul’s ship sailed under the lee of Cyprus to avoid rough winds (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.4">27:4</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">City and its people on the coast of North Africa that was the capital of Cyrenaica. It was founded in the seventh century <span class="era">BC</span> by Greeks who engaged primarily in agricultural pursuits. Herodotus comments in his fifth-century <span class="era">BC</span> <span class="ital">Histories</span> that “the land of Cyrene, the highest of that part of Libya which is inhabited by Nomads, has the remarkable peculiarity of three separate harvest-seasons . . . making for the fortunate people of Cyrene, a continuous autumn of eight months on end” (4.199). It was conquered by Alexander the Great in 331 <span class="era">BC</span> and later became a part of the Roman Empire. During the period of the NT, the city contained a large Jewish population that had come from Alexandria. One such person, named Simon, was visiting Jerusalem during the Passover feast the year Jesus Christ was crucified and was forced to carry his cross (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.32">Mt 27:32</a>). Fifty days later Peter preached to Jews from Cyrene on Pentecost day in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>). Stephen was attacked by Jews associated with a synagogue that included people of Cyrene (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">6:9</a>), some of whom were later converted and became preachers (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a>). They appear to have traveled as far north as Antioch, where a prominent Christian teacher was Lucius of Cyrene (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">13:1</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">CYRUS CYLINDER*</p>
<p class="fl">Baked clay barrel nine inches (22.9 centimeters) long inscribed in cuneiform, found by archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam during his excavations at Babylon (1879–82). Now in the British Museum, London, the inscription was written by Cyrus the Great (who founded the Persian Empire and ruled it 539–530 <span class="era">BC</span>) as an effort to describe and justify his policies. The largely intact text is about 1,000 words in translation and dates from about 536 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Cyrus began his text with an attack on Nabonidus (last ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, father of and co-regent with Belshazzar). He described Nabonidus as a “weakling” who had removed the images of the gods from their temples and had forsaken the proper worship of Marduk, chief of the Babylonian family of gods. To make matters worse, Nabonidus had also required his subjects to labor on a variety of public works projects.</p>
<p>Historians now believe that Nabonidus had turned from the worship of Marduk to that of Sin, the moon god with great centers of worship at Ur and Haran. Before the fall of Babylon, Nabonidus had tried to transport many of the gods of the Babylonian cities to the capital. Such tampering with the empire’s religion had won Nabonidus the undying hostility of powerful entrenched religious interests and of much of the general populace.</p>
<p>Cyrus continued the cylinder inscription with an observation that Marduk had heard the complaints of the gods and sought for a righteous ruler. His search led him to Cyrus, a man of “good deeds” and “upright heart.” The god subjected many lands to Cyrus and ordered him to march against Babylon, “going at his side like a real friend.” The result was that Cyrus took the capital without a fight, and Marduk delivered Nabonidus into Cyrus’s hands. According to Greek sources, Nabonidus’s life was spared. Moreover, the entire populace of Babylonia rejoiced over Cyrus’s kingship, delighted that they had been spared damage and disaster.</p>
<p>Next, Cyrus spoke of his lineage in order to show that he was from an established line of kingship in Anshan, a region east of the head of the Persian Gulf. Moreover, the Babylonian gods Bel and Nebo delighted in him. Perhaps Cyrus felt it necessary to make that statement because he had usurped the throne of the Median Empire (of which Anshan was a part) and had taken the Neo-Babylonian Empire by force.</p>
<p>Having spoken of his legitimate right to rule, Cyrus described his reception by the populace, his faithfulness in worshiping Marduk his benefactor, and his beneficent treatment of his subjects. His beneficence included strict control over his troops to prevent acts of terror against the newly conquered subjects, maintenance of peace in the cities of Babylonia, abolition of the hated public works detail, and development of public housing projects. Cyrus saw Marduk as pleased with his deeds and bestowing favor on Cyrus, his son Cambyses, and his troops. Moreover, princes from all over the empire came to Babylon to pay homage and bring tribute.</p>
<p>The next section of the inscription relates to the Jews and to a significant part of biblical history. Cyrus decided to reverse the deportation policy of the Babylonians and of the Assyrians before them. He permitted all the captive peoples who had been uprooted to return to their ancestral homes. He also returned the images of the gods to their former sanctuaries and helped the various groups to rebuild the temples of their gods. Thus it is clear that Ezra’s decree permitting the Jews to return to Palestine (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">Ezr 1</a>) was not a result of Cyrus’s conversion to faith in the God of Israel, but only part of a larger public policy. Presumably each of the subjected peoples had its own decree of rehabilitation.</p>
<p>In the last paragraph of his text he asked all the resettled gods to intercede with Bel and Nebo for long life for him and to commend him to Marduk. Cyrus obviously thought that grateful priests and worshipers who were praying for him would be loyal subjects. Thus important sources of disaffection would be removed.</p>

<p class="h1">CYRUS THE GREAT*</p>
<p class="fl">Persian king (559–530 <span class="era">BC</span>) who founded the Achaemenid dynasty and the Persian Empire. Cyrus (II) was the son of Cambyses I (600–599 <span class="era">BC</span>), who ruled the unified territories of Parshumash-anshan and Parsa. Cyrus’s mother was Mandane, daughter of the Median king Astyages (585?–550 <span class="era">BC</span>). The ancestor of the dynasty was Achaemenes. Cyrus succeeded his father and established himself in Pasargadae about 559 <span class="era">BC</span>. Ambitious and daring, he aligned his kingdom with neighboring peoples and tribes into a solid block of Persian power, then revolted against Astyages of Media. When it became evident that Cyrus would win in the struggle to control Media, the troops of Astyages mutinied and deserted to Cyrus. When Cyrus conquered the Median kingdom, however, he came into conflict with Babylon, since the two kingdoms claimed much of the same territory.</p>
<p>Cyrus consolidated his power before fighting with Babylon. First, he conquered Asia Minor. Wealthy King Croesus of Lydia and the Lydians submitted to him. Then he overran the northern mountainous region between the Caspian Sea and the northwest corner of India.</p>
<p>By 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, Cyrus was ready to move against Babylon. The Babylonian governor of Elam defected to Cyrus and joined his army. With a minimum of opposition, the armies of Cyrus entered the Babylonian capital in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>. Nabonidus was taken prisoner but was treated with respect and mercy. Sixteen days later Cyrus himself entered the city, to the acclaim of many of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Isaiah’s prophecy spoke of Cyrus as the Lord’s anointed (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.1">Is 45:1</a>). Israel regarded him as called and empowered by their God to free them. Under Cyrus, the Jews were allowed to rebuild Jerusalem and its temple (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.28">44:28</a>). Documents preserved in the OT state that in his first year in Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree permitting the reconstruction of the house of God at Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.22-23">2 Chr 36:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-3">Ezr 1:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.2-5">6:2-5</a>). He also returned sacred vessels taken from the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. Biblical descriptions of the decree say nothing about rebuilding the city, but that would be in harmony with the king’s policy.</p>
<p>During excavations (1879–82) at Babylon, archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam discovered a clay barrel inscription on which Cyrus told of taking the city and of his resulting policies. Isaiah and Chronicles reflect the content of the inscription, which says that captured peoples were allowed to return home and build sanctuaries to their own gods.</p>
<p>Nothing is known about the death of Cyrus. Accounts that have been preserved make it clear that he was killed in battle, but the statements are conflicting. Probably the Greek historian Herodotus is right in indicating that Cyrus died in a terrible disaster that destroyed the Persian army fighting the Massagetae. The tomb of Cyrus can still be seen at Pasargadae in Iran.</p>
