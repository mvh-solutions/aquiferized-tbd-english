  <title>“I Am” Sayings</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">“I AM” SAYINGS</p>
<p class="fl">Self-proclamations made by Jesus in the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>One of the distinctive elements of the teaching of Jesus is the way Jesus expresses important truths in terms of his own personal character and mission. These statements begin with the words “I am” and then continue to express a deep theological thought in terms of metaphorical statement. This method of teaching is preserved for us in the Gospel of John alone. While Matthew, Mark, and Luke emphasize Jesus’ mode of teaching in the form of the parable, John pictures Jesus as teaching in discourses. These discourses often find an “I am” statement as the key expression of the central thought.</p>
<p>The “I am” statements found in the Gospel of John are the bread of life or the living bread (<a href="?bref=John.6.35,48,51">6:35, 48, 51</a>), the light of the world (<a href="?bref=John.8.12">8:12</a>; see also <a href="?bref=John.9.5">9:5</a>), the gate (<a href="?bref=John.10.7,9">10:7, 9</a>), the good shepherd (<a href="?bref=John.10.11,14">10:11, 14</a>), the resurrection and the life (<a href="?bref=John.11.25">11:25</a>), the way, the truth and the life (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>), and the vine (<a href="?bref=John.15.1,5">15:1, 5</a>).</p>
<p>Each of these statements follows a basic pattern. They are written as metaphors in which one of the key elements is to be the Christ expressed as “I am.” The meaning of the metaphor is to be drawn chiefly from the explanatory statement connected with it. Thus when Jesus says, “I am the light of the world,” the explanatory statement follows, “So if you follow me, you won’t be stumbling through the darkness, for living light will flood your path” (<span class="sc">tlb</span>). This latter statement is intended to help a person interpret the metaphor. Most statements have such interpretive elements joined to them.</p>
<p>These metaphorical statements often complement Jesus’ miracles. The statement and a miracle each contribute to the understanding of the other. Thus when Jesus proclaims that he is the light of the world, he proceeds to bring sight to the blind man. The controversy that follows between the blind man and the Pharisees shows that the man has received spiritual sight as well as physical. Before Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead, he tells Martha that he is the resurrection and the life. The raising of Lazarus is intended to show Jesus’ power to give life now and to demonstrate his power to do what he proclaimed he was able to do. After Jesus had fed the 5,000, he declared that he was the living bread that had come from heaven. Each of these miracles is interpreted by the metaphorical “I am” statement. Each statement is intended to give the miracle meaning for the ministry of Jesus. They show us that Jesus’ miracles were not just acts of power or mercy but actions demonstrating the meaning of his ministry and teaching.</p>
<p>Many theologians consider the “I am” formula to reflect an identification of deity found in the OT (see <a href="?item=GodNamesof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">God, Names of</a>). When Moses was called, he asked God to identify himself in such a way that Moses might gain acceptance from the Hebrew people. God revealed himself to Moses as the great “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>.” Moses was to tell the Israelites that “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span> sent me to you” (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.13-14">Ex 3:13-14</a>). From this “<span class="divine-name">I Am</span>” the name Yahweh is derived. Many believe that Jesus used this same formula from the OT to relate his deity. The “I am” statements in John’s Gospel help the reader identify Jesus as divine, as God.</p>

<p class="h1">ICONIUM</p>
<p class="fl">City in the southwest part of central Asia Minor located about 95 miles (153 kilometers) from the Mediterranean coast. It is known today as Konya, a Turkish city, and capital of the province bearing the same name.</p>
<p>Iconium was an agricultural center famous for its wheat fields and orchards of apricots and plums. Its ideal location and climate helped establish its place as a major link in the trade routes between Syria, Ephesus, and Rome.</p>
<p>Little is known about the origin of the city. Its beginnings may be traced to a group of immigrant tribes from northern Greece—the Phrygians. Xenophon, a Greek historian (c. 428–354 <span class="era">BC</span>), mentions it as a Phrygian city visited by Cyrus. Since the Phrygian language was spoken in Iconium, it is likely that the inhabitants considered themselves of this extraction. Although the name Iconium was originally Phrygian, a myth was later created to infuse it with Greek meaning. According to this legend, a great flood destroys mankind. Life is restored when Prometheus and Athena breathe life into human images made from mud left by subsiding waters. The Greek word for “image” is <span class="greek">eikon</span><span class="ital">,</span> from which comes the name Iconium, according to the legend.</p>
<p>In the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, Iconium was governed by the Seleucid kings of Syria. As proponents of Greek culture, the Seleucids soon turned Iconium into a Hellenistic city. The Greek language was spoken and the people were ruled by two magistrates appointed annually. Despite later domination by the Gauls and Pontic kings (c. 165–63 <span class="era">BC</span>), Iconium retained its Hellenistic character until NT times. In 36 <span class="era">BC</span> Mark Antony gave the city to Antymas. Upon his death in 25 <span class="era">BC</span>, Iconium joined the neighboring cities of Lystra, Derbe, and Pisidian Antioch as a part of the province of Galatia and so became incorporated into the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul visited Iconium on his first missionary journey. Having been forced to leave Pisidian Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.51">Acts 13:51</a>), Paul came to the synagogue in Iconium. His preaching initially won the approval of both the Jews and Greeks, but unbelieving Jews soon incited a riot against him (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.1-7">14:1-7</a>). Paul fled to Lystra, but he was followed by the Iconian Jews, who stoned him and left him for dead (v <a href="?bref=Acts.14.19">19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.11">2 Tm 3:11</a>). Cared for by friends, Paul was able to join Barnabas in Derbe, where they made many disciples then later returned to Iconium to strengthen the Christians there (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.20-23">Acts 14:20-23</a>). During the second missionary journey, Timothy was recommended to Paul and Silas by the Christians at Iconium (<a href="?bref=Acts.16.1-2">16:1-2</a>).</p>

  <title>Idols, Idolatry</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">IDOLS, IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="fl">Man-made images or natural representations worshiped as deities; anything receiving worship other than the one true God. Idolatry is the spiritual worship of an idol. Many idolaters literally serve idols: in ancient Egypt statues of gods were regularly and ritually clothed and fed. Some concept of the worship of a false god, Baal, is given in the account of the contest on Mt Carmel: the priests of Baal cried aloud, they “limped” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) around the altar, they cut themselves with swords and lances (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.26-29">1 Kgs 18:26-29</a>). Baal worship was widely followed by Israel during the period of the monarchy.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Abraham’s ancestors were worshipers of idols in Mesopotamia (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.2">Jos 24:2</a>). Archaeological excavations in that area have revealed the images of numerous deities, and Mesopotamian religious literature reveals the gross polytheism out of which Abraham came. The tendency of the Israelites toward idolatry was in part the expression of the universal human longing for a god one can see and know through the physical senses.</p>
<p>Most of the idolatry of the Israelites was borrowed from their neighbors. During the more than 400 years that the descendants of Jacob spent in Egypt, they were exposed to polytheistic idolatry, which influenced their religious mind-set. At Sinai, while Moses was receiving the Ten Commandments from the Lord, the people were demanding that Aaron make gods for them (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-6">Ex 32:1-6</a>). He fashioned a golden calf, following an Egyptian form, for the whole bovine family was worshiped in Egypt—the Apis bull, the Hathor cow, and the Mnevis calf.</p>
<p>It was after his stay in Egypt (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.40">1 Kgs 11:40</a>) that Jeroboam became king of Israel and set up golden calves, one at Bethel and one at Dan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.26-33">12:26-33</a>), an action that earned him the label as being the one who made Israel sin (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.3">2 Kgs 3:3</a>).</p>
<p>Already in patriarchal times there are references to the teraphim, or household gods. Examples of these idols have been found at Ur of the Chaldees, Nuzi, and other sites, and are referred to in the cuneiform tablets. The teraphim that Rachel stole from Laban could be hidden in her camel’s saddlebag (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.34">Gn 31:34</a>). It seems, however, that in the time of David such idols were larger, for when Saul’s men came to kill David, Michal, David’s wife and the daughter of Saul, helped David to escape and then took such an image and placed it in a bed to make the men think that David was sick (<a href="?bref=1Sam.19.11-16">1 Sm 19:11-16</a>).</p>
<p>The prohibition of idolatry is explicitly stated in the second commandment (<a href="?bref=Exod.20.4-5">Ex 20:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>): “Do not make idols of any kind, whether in the shape of birds or animals or fish. You must never worship or bow down to them, for I, the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God, am a jealous God who will not share your affection with any other god!” (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.34.17">Ex 34:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.19.4">Lv 19:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.26.1">26:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.15-19">Dt 4:15-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-5">27:1-5</a>). This commandment is an extension or auxiliary of the first, for it seeks to preserve God’s uniqueness and to protect his glory. The definition of idolatry was broadened during the time of Samuel, who confronted King Saul with the charge that stubbornness is the same as idolatry (<a href="?bref=1Sam.15.23">1 Sm 15:23</a>).</p>
<p>Previous to the conquest of Canaan, the Lord kept warning Israel against marrying members of the native populace, which he had ordered Israel to annihilate. This measure was intended to prevent the weakening of moral life in Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.34.16">Ex 34:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.3-4">Dt 7:3-4</a>). This principle is again expanded in the NT (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.33">1 Cor 15:33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.6.14">2 Cor 6:14</a>). The history of Israel demonstrated the practicality of the prohibition against such marriages, for they inevitably led to apostasy. Perhaps the saddest example is Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.1-8">1 Kgs 11:1-8</a>). When Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart to other gods, so that he was not wholly true to the Lord his God (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.4">4</a>).</p>
<p>In the time of the judges there was an infamous case of idol worship (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-18.31">Jgs 17:1–18:31</a>). The mother of an Ephraimite named Micah took 200 pieces of silver and had a silversmith make them into a graven image for her son. He also had a shrine, an ephod, and teraphim. He hired a wandering Levite to be his priest, but men from the tribe of Dan came along and took the Levite, the image, and all the accoutrements and set up this idol at Dan and used it as an object of their worship (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.30-31">18:30-31</a>).</p>
<p>In Scripture the kings of Israel are evaluated on the basis of what they did with respect to the “high places” and idols. Asa removed all the idols his ancestors had made (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.12">1 Kgs 15:12</a>) and would not let Maacah be queen mother because she had an abominable image made for Asherah. He cut down and burned the image (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.13">13</a>). The Israelite king Ahab, however, was an idolater (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.26">1 Kgs 21:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">16:30-33</a>).</p>
<p>Hezekiah destroyed the high places, broke down the pillars, and cut down the Asherim (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kgs 18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.31.1">2 Chr 31:1</a>). He also put an end to a strange cult that illustrates the insidious nature of idolatry. The bronze serpent that Moses lifted up on a pole to save the Israelites from death by snakebite (<a href="?bref=Num.21.9">Nm 21:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>) had been preserved until the time of Hezekiah. It had been given the name Nehushtan, and people venerated it and burned incense to it. Hezekiah destroyed it (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kgs 18:4</a>) because what had been an instrument for good had become a thing of evil.</p>
<p>The prophet Isaiah described the making of an idol in human form (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.19-20">Is 40:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.9-17">44:9-17</a>). Images were cast in a mold using molten metal (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.19">40:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.10">44:10</a>). Statues were forged by smiths (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.12">44:12</a>), carved from wood (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.13-17">44:13-17</a>), and overlaid with precious metal (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.19">40:19</a>). Small clay images and plaques were also molded and fired in a kiln, and statues were sculptured from stone. The psalmist spoke out against idols and images (<a href="?bref=Ps.96.5">Pss 96:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.97.7">97:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.106.34-39">106:34-39</a>) and the helplessness of idols is described in <a href="?bref=Ps.115.4-8">Psalms 115:4-8</a> and <a href="?bref=Ps.135.15-18">135:15-18</a>.</p>
<p>The northern and southern kingdoms of Israel went into captivity because they forsook God and served idols. The Jews were well aware that idolatry had brought them into captivity, and during their time in Babylon, they developed an abhorrence to idols that has characterized Judaism to this very day.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The fullest discussion in the NT on idolatry <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">eidololatreia</span><span class="ital">)</span> and the idolworshiper <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">eidololatres</span><span class="ital">)</span> is found in Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians. In an earlier (no longer extant) epistle, Paul had told the Corinthians not to associate with those who called themselves believers but were still idol worshipers (<a href="?bref=1Cor.5.9-11">1 Cor 5:9-11</a>). After that letter the Corinthians must have asked Paul for clarification on this matter. Thus, in this epistle Paul provides a response to their question; the “idol worshiper” is mentioned in <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.10-11,6,10">5:10-11, 6:9, 10:7</a>, and “idolatry” is spoken of in <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.14">10:14</a>. </p>
<p>The terms, “idolatry” and “idol worshiper,” are related to two other expressions: (1) “idol” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">eidolon</span><span class="ital">),</span> found in <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.4">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.19">10:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.12.2">12:2</a>; and (2) “food sacrificed to idols” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greek">eidolothutos</span><span class="ital">),</span> found in <a href="?bref=1Cor.8.1,4,7">1 Corinthians 8:1, 4, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.19">10:19</a>. The kind of idolatry that Paul condemns is that which involved Christians offering sacrifices to idols and then partaking of the food that had been sacrificed to them. The participants are called idol worshipers because their involvement in idolatrous sacrifices was perceived as having fellowship with demons. Paul strictly prohibited the eating of sacrificial food at the popular temples in the presence of idol-demons. As such, he shared the same view about idols as most Jews in his day. For the Jews, idols and heathen deities were identical. (See <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.9">1 Thes 1:9</a>, where Paul contrasts “idols” with “the living and <span class="ital">true</span> God.”) To Paul, idols in and of themselves were nothing (<a href="?bref=1Cor.8.4">1 Cor 8:4</a>); behind the idol, however, was a demon (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.20">10:20</a>).</p>
<p>The eating of sacrificial food at the cultic meals in pagan temples was censured by Paul because it was understood that the participants thereby became united to demons (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.19-21">1 Cor 10:19-21</a>). However, Paul had no problem with those who purchased food that had been left over from these events and that was later sold in the marketplace. In his judgment, if they ate it at home, they were not participating in idolatry. They could eat this food with a good conscience—unless, of course, in doing so they would be the means of destroying a weaker believer. For the sake of such believers, one should abstain. This was a matter of conscience (<a href="?bref=1Cor.10.25-29">10:25-29</a>). But going to pagan festivities and eating meals offered to idols was not permitted in any form.</p>
<p>The Corinthians had participated in these meals regularly before they became Christians and apparently had continued to do so after their conversion. In Corinth such meals were the regular practice both at national festivals and private celebrations. The “gods” (whom Paul considered “demons”) were thought to be present at these events because the sacrifices were made to them. Thus, to participate in these events was to join oneself to demons and thereby become an idol worshiper. The ancient Israelites had been carried away into idolatry by their pagan neighbors on several occasions when they were enticed to participate in these pagan celebrations (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">Nm 25</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.32.6">Ex 32:6</a>). The festivities involved all sorts of licentiousness. In <a href="?bref=1Cor.10.1-33">1 Corinthians 10</a>, Paul referred to this apostasy of the Israelites and used it as a negative example. Because the Israelites became involved in pagan festivities, they were carried away into idolatry and fornication, which incited God’s wrath and brought destruction.</p>
<p>In other Pauline Epistles, idolatry is mentioned but not with the kind of definition and extended discussion that is found in 1 Corinthians. Nonetheless, Paul speaks out against actual idolatry and what we might call figurative idolatry (i.e., idolatry in the sense of desiring something above God).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rom.1.18-32">Romans 1:18-32</a> sexual licentiousness and other sins are ultimately traced to idolatry. The Gentiles, who should have known that God existed, as evidenced in creation and conscience, abandoned the immortal, invisible God in exchange for mortal, visible images (i.e., idols). Because of this abandonment, God gave them over to do the filthy things their hearts desired (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.24">Rom 1:24</a>). Thus, idolatry is included in Paul’s list of what he calls “the works of the flesh” (see <a href="?bref=Gal.5.19-20">Gal 5:19-20</a>). And those who are idol worshipers are included in the catalog of all those evil people who will not inherit the kingdom of God (see <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9">1 Cor 6:9</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Eph.5.5">Ephesians 5:5</a> Paul again includes idolaters among those who will not inherit the kingdom of God. However, such idolaters are not just those who go to pagan temples and worship idols; they are those who are greedy or covetous. According to superior manuscript evidence, the verse reads, “No fornicator or impure person or greedy person, which is the same as an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.” The point seems to be that the greedy, covetous person who makes his desires his god is much the same as an idolater. Thus, covetousness and idolatry are made synonymous. The parallel passage, <a href="?bref=Col.3.5">Colossians 3:5</a>, makes this explicit, which literally says covetousness is idolatry.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">IDUMAEA*, IDUMEA, IDUMEANS</p>
<p class="fl">Term derived from the Greek form of Edom (“red”). The change from Edomite to Idumean resulted from the conquests of Alexander the Great, which made Greek the common language of the area. The name was applied to the former country of the Edomites and to the portion of south Judah occupied by the descendants of Esau after the Jews had been deported to Babylon following the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The country known as Idumea in the intertestamental period had its northern boundary at Bet-sur (Beth-zur), a few miles north of Hebron, and included some of the Shephelah (low country) extending down into the former Philistine country (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.15,22,61">1 Macc 4:15, 22, 61</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.65">5:65</a>).</p>
<p>First known as Edomites, then as Nabateans, and finally as Idumeans, the ancestors of the Idumeans trace their lineage to the elder brother of Jacob, Esau, who was cheated out of both his birthright and his blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-45">Gn 27:1-45</a>). This led to conflict between the children of Israel and the descendants of Esau throughout the entire biblical period.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the Edomites rejoiced when the Babylonians conquered Israel. The Edomites then occupied the territory vacated by the Israelites following the subjugation of the kingdom by the Babylonians after 586 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>About 300 <span class="era">BC</span> Arabian tribes invaded and took the Edomite capital Petra, forcing the remaining Edomites into the area south of Judah, which then became included in what was known as Idumea. The invaders, known as Nabateans, made Sela or Petra the center of their caravan trade both from east to west and north to south. These desert tradesmen, influenced now by Greek ideas, fashioned the bowl-like “crater” at Petra into a fantastic city with a concentration of rock-hewn temples, tombs, and buildings made from the colorful red sandstone of the area. In addition to creating the world’s most unique city, the Nabateans were excellent traders and farmers. As Josephus says, they were not warlike but skilled in commerce, art, and agriculture. The Nabateans created the strategic desert stronghold of Avedat, which, with Petra, commanded the caravan routes. The Nabateans flourished from about 100 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 100, when the Romans gradually caused their demise by changing the caravan routes from south of the Dead Sea to the area around Damascus and Palmyra.</p>
<p>During the intertestamental period the returning Jews had border skirmishes with the Idumeans. Hebron was captured by Judas Maccabeus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.65">1 Macc 5:65</a>). John Hyrcanus compelled the Idumeans to become Jews and submit to circumcision. The governor of Idumea, Antipater, who had been made procurator of Judea by Julius Caesar, was an Idumean. Antipater assigned his son Herod as governor of Galilee. This paved the way for Herod to become king of Judea, under the title of Herod the Great. With the conquest of Judea by the Romans, first in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, and later in <span class="era">AD</span> 135, Idumea disappears from history. Only in recent years have archaeologists begun to uncover some of the secrets of the Idumeans and of the Nabateans, their conquerors.</p>

The letters were to churches in cities through which he passed, Philadelphia and Smyrna, and to churches that sent delegations to visit him during this final journey—namely, Ephesus, Tralles, and Magnesia. He sent a letter ahead to the church in Rome to prevent their intervention with the Roman authorities in delivering him into martyrdom. He also wrote a letter to Polycarp, the bishop of Smyrna. Similar to the NT epistles, these writings reveal a strong commitment to Christ and to the physical facts of his birth, death, and resurrection. The Epistles of Ignatius parallel the Gospels in several places and appropriate language from a number of the Pauline letters.</p>
<p>The letters of Ignatius are evidence for the rapid development of the episcopal structure in the early church of Asia Minor and Syria. In the NT, the local church was governed by a body of equal officers called elders or bishops, but in these letters there is reference to a single ruling bishop in each city except Rome. Ignatius is the first writer to use the term “catholic” (universal) to describe the church. His use of the term implied a connectional church with a unity in faith toward Christ and with delegations to express concerns between the churches.</p>
<p>He opposed the Ebionite heresy, which demanded the keeping of the Jewish regulations as the way of salvation. According to Ignatius, in order to affirm Christ the believer must reject Jewish practices. The Christian must worship on the Lord’s Day, the day of his resurrection, rather than observe the Jewish sabbaths. Yet he did view the church as the continuation of the OT people of God and the prophets as disciples who looked forward to Christ.</p>
<p>Ignatius also attacked Docetism, which held that Christ only appeared to have real birth, death, and resurrection. In reciting the facts of Christ’s life, Igantius was the first one outside the NT writers to speak of the virgin birth of Jesus. Ignatius also emphasized the fact that the apostles touched the body of their risen Lord. Ignatius said it was the real suffering of Jesus Christ on the cross and his physical resurrection that made it possible for him to face martyrdom.</p>

<p class="h1">ILLYRICUM</p>
<p class="fl">Roman province northwest of Macedonia. During the height of the Roman Empire (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 117), when it included Dalmatia, Illyricum was bounded by the Adriatic Sea on the west and by the provinces of Pannonia on the north, Upper Moesia on the east, and Macedonia on the south. Today Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Yugoslavia occupy that territory.</p>
<p>Throughout the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the people of Illyricum warred with the Macedonians, until the Macedonian ruler Philip II defeated them in 359 <span class="era">BC</span>. During the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, their acts of piracy against Greek and Roman ships led to a war with Rome that continued on and off for 60 years (229–168 <span class="era">BC</span>). After a series of revolts and sporadic Roman rule, Illyricum was officially made part of the empire in 11 <span class="era">BC</span> and renamed Dalmatia. It took another 20 years for the people to be fully integrated into Roman culture.</p>
<p>In 229 <span class="era">BC</span> the Roman historian Polybius stated that “the Illyrians were not the enemies of this people or that, but were the common enemies of all.” Later Strabo, a first-century Greek geographer, was still describing the people of Illyricum as savage and rapacious.</p>
<p>The sole NT reference to Illyricum is found in the apostle Paul’s statement that he had preached the gospel from Jerusalem to as far as Illyricum (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.19">Rom 15:19</a>). Although Acts does not document a ministry in that region, Paul may have visited Illyricum during his visit to Macedonia and Achaia just before returning to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.1-2">Acts 20:1-2</a>). Paul expressed a desire to continue his ministry in Spain, a totally Latin environment (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.28">Rom 15:28</a>); in Illyricum he would have had his first experience in a culture that was more Latin than Greek. </p>

  <title>Image of God</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">IMAGE OF GOD</p>
<p class="fl">Likeness to God, the most basic affirmation to be made concerning the nature of human beings from a Christian perspective. Humans are unique among the creatures in that they are like God and therefore able to have communion and fellowship with God.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Gen.1.26-27">Genesis 1:26-27</a> teaches that God determined to create man and woman in his own “image” and “likeness” and that they would have dominion over the animal creation. The two terms used in the creation account and found also in the NT convey closely related shades of meaning, but the difference between them is no longer thought to be theologically significant.</p>
<p>Because <a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Genesis 2:7</a> states unambiguously that <span class="ital">man</span> became a living being, the Bible does not present the view that a previously living creature developed into a human, nor does it suggest that the image of God evolved from a lower form of life. The moment the man and woman became living creatures, they were the image of God. Both male and female share this likeness to God (<a href="?bref=Gen.1.27">Gn 1:27</a>).</p>
<p>Other passages that speak of people being created in the image of God are <a href="?bref=Gen.5.1">Genesis 5:1</a>, <a href="?bref=Gen.9.6">9:6</a>, <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>, and <a href="?bref=Jas.3.9">James 3:9</a>. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:24</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Colossians 3:10</a> refer to humanity’s redemptive re-creation, but the passages are generally regarded as directly relevant for an understanding of mankind’s original likeness to God. Although explicit references to humans as expressing the image of God are comparatively infrequent in the Bible, the truth itself underlies the whole relation between God and humans and is therefore the presupposition of the entire biblical account.</p>
<p>The affirmation in <a href="?bref=Gen.1.1-31">Genesis 1</a> that man and woman were made in the image of God is not made of any of the other living creatures. The animals, the fish, and the birds do not share this privilege. It is disputed whether the angels are in the image of God, but certain theologians so view them because they find the image to reside in moral righteousness. However, there is no explicit biblical statement to this effect.</p>
<p>By virtue of his creation from the dust of the ground, mankind has an obvious kinship with the earth. It is not strange, therefore, that the body, both in its constitution and its functions, shows similarities with other earthly creatures. But humans are unique in every aspect of their existence; not some part of a human or some faculty of a human, but a human in his or her wholeness is the image of God. The biblical concept is not that the image is <span class="ital">in</span> man and woman, but that man and woman <span class="ital">are</span> the image of God.</p>
<p>However, as man’s kinship with the earth is most clearly visible in his body, so the image of God is best seen when humans are viewed from the perspective of their spirituality. Theologians have sought at this point to enumerate those aspects of spirituality that define humans and set them apart from the animal creation. The image of God is then found to reside in some attribute or combination of attributes, such as rationality, will, freedom, responsibility, or the like. Contemporary theologians prefer not to enumerate attributes, and the Bible does not set forth the image of God in this way. Nevertheless, it is the personality of humans that separates them from the animals and is a reflection of the personality of God. The animals have their existence <span class="ital">from</span> God, but humans have their being <span class="ital">in</span> God, and they are his offspring (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.28-29">Acts 17:28-29</a>).</p>
<p>Another major aspect of the image of God doctrine is developed from <a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">Ephesians 4:24</a> and <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Colossians 3:10</a>. These verses describe the re-creation of the believers in the likeness of God—in righteousness, holiness of the truth, and true knowledge. In other words, Paul declares that the redeemed are re-created into the image of God as they are transformed into the image of Christ, who bears the untainted image of God. Just as the fall into sin was not without its effect on the image of God, so also redemption from sin affects humans as the image of God. Ephesians and Colossians speak of renewal in the image of God the Creator, but other texts become even more specific in view of the mediatorial office of Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is preeminently the image of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.4">2 Cor 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.15">Col 1:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.3">Heb 1:3</a>). Frequently this is understood exclusively as a reference to the deity of Christ. To see Christ is to see the Father (<a href="?bref=John.14.9">Jn 14:9</a>). However, in the passages cited, it is the incarnate Mediator, the last Adam, who is at least all that God intended the first Adam to be. Incarnation means that Jesus is truly human, and because he is truly human, he is truly the image of God.</p>
<p>As the last Adam and the Mediator of the new covenant, Jesus brings his people into conformity with his own image, the image of the Son of God (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.29">Rom 8:29</a>). He who became like his brethren, in the likeness of sinful flesh, destroys sin in order that his brethren might reflect his own glory. They are changed into the same image from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord (<a href="?bref=2Cor.3.18">2 Cor 3:18</a>). The believer is to “put on Christ” (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.14">Rom 13:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.3.27">Gal 3:27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.4.24">Eph 4:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.10">Col 3:10</a>, “the new nature” in the image of God), an action also described as the formation of Christ in the believer (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.19">Gal 4:19</a>).</p>
<p>Conformity to the image of Jesus Christ is achieved through the process of sanctification that is ultimately completed at the resurrection. Only then is the body changed until it is fashioned like unto the glorious body of Christ (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.21">Phil 3:21</a>). Restoration in the image of Christ carries beyond creation in the image of God, for the image of the earthly is then exchanged for the image of the heavenly (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.49">1 Cor 15:49</a>).</p>

  <title>Immanuel</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">IMMANUEL</p>
<p class="fl">Hebrew masculine name that means “God with us.” It appears only twice in the OT (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Is 7:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.8">8:8</a>) and once in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">Mt 1:23</a>), where it is sometimes transliterated “Emmanuel.” In the OT the name was given to a child born in the time of Ahaz as a sign to the king that Judah would receive relief from attacks by Israel and Syria. The name symbolized the fact that God would demonstrate his presence with his people in this deliverance. The greater application is that this is a prophecy of the birth of the incarnate God, Jesus the Messiah, as shown in Matthew.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheProphecyinIsaiahsDay">The Prophecy in Isaiah’s Day</p>
<p class="fl">In focusing on the birth of Jesus as Immanuel, there has been some neglect of the historical fulfillment that occurred in the time of Ahaz. Ahaz was the son of a good king, Jotham and the grandson of another godly ruler, Uzziah, but his reign was marked by apostasy and idolatry. He made “molten images” for the Baals, offered incense in the Hinnom Valley, and even burned his sons as an offering (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.2-4">2 Chr 28:2-4</a>). Because of this, the Lord gave him into the hand of Rezin, king of Syria, and of Pekah, king of Israel. The Edomites also invaded Judah, and the Philistines attacked the Shephelah and the Negev and took several cities (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.17-18">17-18</a>).</p>
<p>Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>) for help against Israel and Syria. Tiglath-pileser accepted tribute from Ahaz, but attacked him instead of helping him (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.20-21">2 Chr 28:20-21</a>). When he went to Damascus to meet the Assyrian king, Ahaz saw an altar, upon which he made offerings to the gods of Syria (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.23">23</a>). He had a replica of this made and placed in the temple of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.10-12">2 Kgs 16:10-12</a>). The prophet Isaiah was directed to accost Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool. God’s message to the king was to “take heart,” for the attacking kings would fall (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.7-9">Is 7:7-9</a>). Isaiah directed Ahaz to ask the Lord for a sign of this, but the king demurred, having a sudden attack of piety (v <a href="?bref=Isa.7.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>Upon this refusal, the Lord gave to Ahaz a sign: a young woman would conceive and bear a son and call his name Immanuel (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Is 7:14</a>). That son would be able to distinguish good from evil by the time he was old enough to eat curds and wild honey, but even before that, the two kings would be removed and the king of Assyria would devastate their lands. The people would be taken away captive, so that the land would lie desolate and uncultivated. A man would have a cow to provide milk for curds, and wild honey would be gathered from the tangle of brush in the untended land.</p>
<p>The identity of this woman and child in Isaiah’s time is uncertain. It has been proposed that the woman was Abijah, the wife of Ahaz, and that their son, Hezekiah, was this Immanuel. This is not demonstrable, and it seems inappropriate that a man like Ahaz should be the father of Immanuel.</p>
<p>It has also been suggested that the wife of Isaiah was the mother of Immanuel. <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a> tells of the prospective birth of Immanuel; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.3">8:3</a> tells of the conception and birth of Isaiah’s son, whose name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz (“swift to plunder and quick to spoil”) is related to the prediction of the fall of Judah’s enemies, for before the child would learn to talk, the lands of Syria and Israel would be taken by the king of Assyria (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.4">Is 8:4</a>). Isaiah’s statement that he and his children were “signs and portents in Israel from the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (v <a href="?bref=Isa.8.18">18</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>) enhances the view that it was his son who was also named Immanuel.</p>
<p>The Lord then directed a message to Immanuel (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.5-10">Is 8:5-10</a>). Because the people had refused the gracious invitation of the Lord, the Assyrians would scourge and fill the land of Immanuel. The plotting and plans of the people would come to nothing, for “God is with us” <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">‘immanu’el</span><span class="ital">).</span> This is a play on words, using the name Immanuel to express the truth of the Lord’s presence.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheProphecyFulfilledinJesus">The Prophecy Fulfilled in Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">In the fullness of time God sent forth his son; more than 700 years after Ahaz, Jesus was born and here all ambiguities fade away. His mother was a virgin from Nazareth named Mary (Miriam), betrothed to a solid citizen named Joseph. <a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">Matthew 1:23</a> cites <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a> as being fulfilled in the birth of Jesus. The Scripture is very explicit in stating that Mary had no sexual contact with her husband prior to the birth of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.25">Mt 1:25</a>). The same precision is seen in the Gospel of Luke. When the announcement of this child’s conception was made to Mary, she asked, “How can this be, since I have no husband?” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.34">Lk 1:34</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The angelic messenger explained that this conception would be brought about by the coming of the Holy Spirit upon her and by the overshadowing power of the Most High (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">35</a>). For this reason the child would be not only Jesus and Immanuel but he would be called holy, the Son of God, God manifest in the flesh (<a href="?bref=John.1.18">Jn 1:18</a>); the child would be unique, being both God and man.</p>
<p>There were great distinctions between the Immanuel of Isaiah’s day and Immanuel the son of Mary. The first was a type; the other, the antitype. The first was the shadow; the other, the reality. The one symbolized deliverance from foreign oppression; the second was the Deliverer from the oppressor. The first represented God’s presence for but a few years; the second Immanuel is the son who lives forever.</p>
<p>The concept of “God with us” was often reiterated by Jesus. He told his disciples that where two or three gathered in his name he would be present (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.20">Mt 18:20</a>). Before his ascension, he assured them that he would be with them until the end of the age (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.20">28:20</a>).</p>
<p>He spoke also of the promise of the Holy Spirit, who “lives with you now and later will be in you” (<a href="?bref=John.14.17">Jn 14:17</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), who will abide with them forever (v <a href="?bref=John.14.16">16</a>). The “God with us” indwelling is spoken of in <a href="?bref=Col.1.27">Colossians 1:27</a>: “Christ lives in you.” In the consummation of all things, as shown to the apostle John, the Lord said: “Look, the home of God is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.3">Rv 21:3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">IMPALEMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Driving of a pointed stake into a human body. It was apparently practiced in ancient Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, Persia, and possibly also in Israel. There are, however, many problems in understanding the exact nature of impalement and what it means in individual OT passages.</p>
<p>It is not always clear from documents written in Greek whether impalement or crucifixion is being described, since the same Greek word could refer to either procedure. (In crucifixion the body is fastened to a stake rather than being punctured by it.) Nor is it always clear whether the impalement is done to a living body or to a corpse. Probably both types of impalement were employed—the former as a method of execution, the latter as a means of exposing the corpse to the elements, beasts, and general disgrace. Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent “hanging” in the OT refers to impalement. Perhaps the fact that it is typically used with the preposition “on” (rather than “from”) indicates that impalement of some kind is intended.</p>
<p>Some light is shed on the nature of impalement through Mesopotamian sources, where it was apparently a means of execution, in one case for a woman who had caused her husband’s death because of another man (<span class="ital">Code of Hammurabi</span> 153), in another for a woman performing an abortion on herself (<span class="ital">Middle Assyrian Laws</span> 53). The latter law makes it clear that the woman should be impaled whether or not she lived through the abortion. The claim of Assyrian kings to have hung captives of war on stakes correlates with the portrayal in Assyrian art of battle scenes where impaled bodies can be seen. The stake could be pushed up into the chest, with the body resting facedown, or between the legs, with the body upright.</p>
<p>Darius’s provision in <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.11">Ezra 6:11</a> for the punishment of violators of his decree that the temple in Jerusalem be rebuilt may refer to impalement. If the expression “hang on a tree [stake]” (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.19">Gn 40:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.21.22">Dt 21:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.29">Jos 8:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.26">10:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.23">Est 2:23</a>) refers to impalement, at least sometimes it is clear that it was a corpse being impaled (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.26">Jos 10:26</a>). This interpretation also applies to <a href="?bref=Deut.21.22">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>, in which the victim is first put to death and then “hung.” The point of similarity to the crucifixion of Christ (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>) is the disgrace involved and not the precise form of treatment. Other possible examples of impalement are found in <a href="?bref=2Sam.4.12">2 Samuel 4:12</a> and <a href="?bref=2Sam.21.6-13">21:6-13</a>.</p>

  <title>Imprecatory Psalms*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">IMPRECATORY PSALMS*</p>
<p class="fl">Psalms that contain curses (imprecations, maledictions) against enemies. These elements do not make up an entire psalm, but verses of this nature appear in approximately 20 psalms (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.5.1-12">Pss 5</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.17.1-15">17</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.28.1-9">28</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.35.1-28">35</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.40.1-17">40</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.55.1-23">55</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.59.1-17">59</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.70.1-5">70</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.71.1-24">71</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.74.1-23">74</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.79.1-13">79</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.80.1-19">80</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.94.1-23">94</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.109.1-31">109</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.129.1-8">129</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.137.1-9">137</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.139.1-24">139</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.140.1-13">140</a>). A number of other psalms express the same ideas as future or accomplished acts of the Lord. Usually these expressions are couched in the form of a prayer or a wish. They voice the desire that evil may come upon an enemy as judgment or retribution.</p>
<p>To the casual reader, such statements may appear to be at variance with much of the rest of Scripture, especially with the teaching of Jesus. The clear injunction of <a href="?bref=Lev.19.17-18">Leviticus 19:17-18</a> states, “Do not nurse hatred in your heart for any of your relatives. Confront your neighbors directly so you will not be held guilty for their crimes. Never seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone, but love your neighbor as yourself” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Jesus expanded the concept of neighbor to include even the despised Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.29-37">Lk 10:29-37</a>). In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus declared, “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you” (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.44">Mt 5:44</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. vv <a href="?bref=Matt.5.38-48">38-48</a>). This is in harmony with the teaching of the OT, which instructs one to feed a hungry enemy and give water to a thirsty one (<a href="?bref=Pr.25.21-22">Prv 25:21-22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.12.20">Rom 12:20</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Ps.109.1-31">Psalm 109</a> is often singled out as contradicting Jesus’ teachings, for it has the greatest imprecatory content, and its statements are stronger than other psalms of this character. Some have suggested that the maledictions of this psalm are unworthy of Scripture and are expressions of wicked human emotions that should not be included in the Bible. However, it needs to be seen that this psalm has been regarded as both prophetic and messianic. This was the view of Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine, and others. This was also the interpretation of Horne, who in his commentary translates the imperfect tenses of this psalm as futures, not the subjunctives of our English versions. He took his cue for this prophetic interpretation from Peter’s quotation of verse <a href="?bref=Ps.109.8">8</a> upon the occasion of choosing a successor for Judas (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.20">Acts 1:20</a>). The psalm can then fit the experiences of the life and passion of Jesus, which changes its tenor completely and in large measure removes it from being imprecatory and makes it predictive.</p>
<p>Another passage that has been abhorrent to many occurs in <a href="?bref=Ps.137.8-9">Psalm 137:8-9</a>, which speaks of the joy of those who dash Babylonian children on a rock. Horne took this as predictive of what took place when the armies of the Medes and Persians conquered the city of Babylon in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>If one predicates that the expressions in the psalms are curses or desires for retribution, they are not out of keeping with the rest of Scripture. The prayer of Jeremiah for vengeance on his persecutors (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.20">Jer 11:20</a>) received direct affirmative response from the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.11.21-23">21-23</a>). The plea of the righteous for justice and vindication will be answered speedily (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.1-8">Lk 18:1-8</a>). In Revelation those who had been slain for the Word of God and for their testimony cry out, “O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long will it be before you judge the people who belong to this world for what they have done to us?” (<a href="?bref=Rev.6.10">Rv 6:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), and they were heard. David, to whom <a href="?bref=Ps.109.1-31">Psalm 109</a> is attributed, was given victory and vengeance over his enemies, as he realized that those who were his enemies were also the enemies of God. Evidently the enemies against whom the psalmist prayed had reached the place where they should receive judgment, and the imprecations of the writer coincided with the judgment of God.</p>

  <title>Imputation*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">IMPUTATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Charging to an account, used in the Bible with legal reference to sin and salvation being recorded by God. The biblical teaching on imputation represents one of the principal doctrines of the Christian faith. Although the noun form is not found in Scripture, the verb “to impute” occurs frequently in both the OT and NT. The basic meaning of the biblical word “impute” is “to set down in a record or a ledger.” In relation to the doctrine of salvation, the word is consistently used in a legal sense. <a href="?bref=Phlm.1.18">Philemon 1:18</a>, which affirms that the apostle Paul assumed the debt of Onesimus, aptly illustrates the predominant theological usage of the word: “if he . . . owes you anything, charge that to my account.”</p>
<p>When Scripture speaks of the imputation of good or evil, it does not suggest that any change of moral character is involved. Scripture does affirm that, from God’s perspective, righteousness or sin is charged to an individual’s account. In the broadest sense, Scripture teaches that God participates in the process of imputing (<a href="?bref=Ps.32.2">Ps 32:2</a>) as do people (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.15">1 Sm 22:15</a>). Good deeds were commonly imputed for reward (<a href="?bref=Ps.106.30-31">Ps 106:30-31</a>), and evil deeds were imputed for punishment (<a href="?bref=Lev.17.3-4">Lv 17:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible sets forth the theological concept of imputation in three distinct yet related ways. First, Scripture affirms the imputation of Adam’s original sin to the entire human race. In the sovereign plan of God, the first man’s initial act of disobedience was set to the account of every member of the human family. Every person thus participates in the guilt and penalty of that original sin. Second, the sin and guilt of the human race was imputed to Christ, so that although the Savior was not a sinner, he nevertheless bore the penalty arising from sin. Finally, the Bible teaches that, as a result of his atoning work, Christ’s righteousness is set to the believer’s account. Although not yet perfectly holy or morally righteous, believers nevertheless are justified before the law of God, and they are “clothed” with the imputed righteousness of Christ.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul developed at length the theme that Christ on the cross bore the punishment for believers’ sins. Thus he wrote that God “made him to be sin who knew no sin” (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.9.28">Heb 9:28</a>). Similarly, he depicted Christ as bearing the curse of the Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>). Finally, reflecting on <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>, the apostle Peter affirmed that Christ “personally carried away our sins in his own body on the cross” (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.24">1 Pt 2:24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The idea that the guilt of the entire world was charged to the account of the sinless Savior largely explains Christ’s impassioned cry on the cross, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.46">Mt 27:46</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The imputation motif is also employed, in the sense of Christ’s righteousness being credited to believers. An incident in the life of the patriarch Abraham illustrates the imputation of righteousness on the basis of faith. After God had promised material and spiritual blessing to Abraham, <a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Genesis 15:6</a> states that he “believed the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>; and he [God] reckoned it to him as righteousness” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The Bible teaches that no person naturally possesses the standard of righteousness demanded by God (<a href="?bref=Ps.130.3">Ps 130:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.64.6">Is 64:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.3.10">Rom 3:10</a>). Yet, in his gracious plan of salvation, God himself supplies the righteousness to satisfy his holy character (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.24">Is 45:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.54.17">54:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.10.12">Hos 10:12</a>). That is, as a person accepts by faith the work of Christ in satisfying the demands of God’s law, God imputes or reckons Christ’s righteousness to the believer.</p>
<p>The imputation of divine righteousness to the believer constitutes a major theme of Paul’s Letter to the Romans (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-5.21">Rom 3:21–5:21</a>). Thus the apostle speaks of the happiness of an undeserving sinner who is declared to be righteous (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.6">4:6</a>). Moreover, the imputation of Christ’s righteousness results in justification before God’s law court (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.18">5:18</a>). The merits of Christ’s death imputed to the sinner are the basis for acquittal by the holy God. Thus the Bible teaches that the ruinous effects of the imputation of Adam’s sin are effectively reversed for those who believe in Christ. The imputation of human sin to Christ makes possible the imputation of his righteousness to believers.</p>

<p class="h1">INCARNATION*</p>
<p class="fl">Literally, “in flesh”; theologically, the doctrine that in Jesus of Nazareth God took on human flesh and became the God-man. Historically, the doctrine of incarnation was central in the christological debates of patristic times and has recently come to the fore again in academic circles. Biblically, it expresses the mystery of Jesus’ identity.</p>
<p class="h2" id="NewTestamentTestimony">New Testament Testimony</p>
<p class="h3">The Synoptic Gospels</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospel of Mark has no account of the Incarnation and stresses Jesus’ messiahship more than his deity. As a result, some believe that it represents an earlier stage in the development of the church’s theology, before the doctrine of incarnation had evolved. That is doubtful for two reasons: Incarnation passages like the Philippians hymn (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Phil 2:6-11</a>) probably antedate Mark’s Gospel, and Mark has a well-developed theology of the two natures of Christ. Although he stresses Jesus’ humanity, Mark accents it with an emphasis on divinity. Jesus was called the “beloved Son” by a heavenly voice at his baptism and transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.7">9:7</a>); demons called him divine (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.11">3:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.7">5:7</a>), as did a Roman centurion (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">15:39</a>). Jesus’ “Abba” prayers (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.36">14:36</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.39">Mt 26:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.42">Lk 22:42</a>) indicate his sense of divine identity, and at his trial he was charged with claiming the title “Son of the Blessed” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.61-62">14:61-62</a>). Thus, though the Incarnation is nowhere explicitly stated in Mark, it is implicitly affirmed.</p>
<p>Matthew and Luke express the Incarnation. The birth narratives, of course, stress the event itself, with Matthew emphasizing Jesus’ royal messiahship, and Luke, the divine witness of the Holy Spirit. Matthew’s Gospel is Christ-centered; Luke concentrates on Christ as Savior, or more precisely, on salvation-history. Although Matthew presents Jesus’ humanity, he emphasizes his lordship (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.6-10">Mt 23:6-10</a>) and divine sonship. The Incarnation thus becomes the means whereby the divine becomes human in a universal sense (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">1:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.18.20">18:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.24.14">24:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.18-20">28:18-20</a>). Luke shows the greatest interest of the three in Jesus’ earthly life. Nevertheless, his Gospel does not stress the human side of Jesus as much as Mark’s. Luke portrays Jesus primarily as the divine Savior within history (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.11">Lk 2:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-30">4:16-30</a>). He combines Jesus’ messianic office and divine nature, showing that the incarnate Son of God suffered and was exalted in order to bring people to God.</p>
<p class="h3">John’s Writings</p>
<p class="fl">The apostle John’s doctrine of incarnation is more explicit than any of the others, teaching not only Jesus’ God-man status but also his preexistent “glory” (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-18">Jn 1:1-18</a>). Central in this presentation is the oneness between Jesus and God the Father (<a href="?bref=John.10.29-30">10:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.8-11">14:8-11</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.23">1 Jn 2:23</a>). The “I am” (the expressed Christ, taken from the OT title for the one true God and probably signifying God’s personal name, Yahweh) came to reveal God to his people (<a href="?bref=John.1.4-5,14,18">Jn 1:4-5, 14, 18</a>). Yet John also has the most balanced presentation of the Incarnation. The divine Logos or Word (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-18">1:1-18</a>) is the exemplar of perfect humanity; he “became flesh” (v <a href="?bref=John.1.14">14</a>) to enlighten people (vv <a href="?bref=John.1.5,9">5, 9</a>) and generate in them “eternal life” (<a href="?bref=John.3.14-18">3:14-18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1-3">1 Jn 1:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.9">4:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Paul’s Epistles</p>
<p class="fl">The apostle Paul presented the Incarnation as Jesus’ path to suffering and redemption. In <a href="?bref=Gal.4.4-5">Galatians 4:4-5</a> the Incarnation (“born of woman”) came “in the fullness of time” or at the apex of salvation-history, to “redeem those who were under the law.” In the Philippians hymn (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-11">Phil 2:6-11</a>, quotes from <span class="sc">nasb</span>), the Incarnation is seen in terms of preexistence (“though he was in the form of God”), humiliation (“emptied . . . humbled”), and obedience (“becoming obedient to the point of death”). The goal of the Incarnation was the cross (“even death on a cross”), and its result was Christ’s exaltation. The hymn is perhaps the supreme theological statement on the Incarnation in the NT. Jesus’ human life was an “emptying,” a refusal to seize the prerogatives of his deity (“did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped”).</p>
<p>Paul described Christ as a second Adam (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.12-19">Rom 5:12-19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.45-47">1 Cor 15:45-47</a>), who brought humanity a new possibility to attain what Adam had forsaken. Through assuming the form of a man, Christ became the Redeemer who reconciles people to God (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.25">Rom 3:25</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.19">2 Cor 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.1.15">1 Tm 1:15</a>). Paul stressed even more, however, that the exalted Christ provides newness of life (<a href="?bref=Rom.6.4-6">Rom 6:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.3.17-18">2 Cor 3:17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.1-4">Col 3:1-4</a>). A hymn in the Letter to the Colossians (<a href="?bref=Col.1.15-20">1:15-20</a>) employs ideas from Jewish wisdom speculation, and possibly Greek themes, to show Christ as the “firstborn” and the “fullness of God.” The one who always existed as God, through his sacrificial death, became the exalted Lord and brought humankind to God (see also the “flesh-spirit” theme in <a href="?bref=Rom.1.3-4">Rom 1:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.3.16">1 Tm 3:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Hebrews</p>
<p class="fl">The Letter to the Hebrews strongly speaks of the Incarnation. The opening hymn (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.1-3">Heb 1:1-3</a>) accents Christ’s exalted status as “the very stamp” of God’s image and the radiance of his glory. Christ is superior to the angels (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.4-9">1:4-9</a>), yet he became a man in order to suffer for human salvation (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.9">2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.7-9">5:7-9</a>). The Incarnation is aligned with sinful humankind’s need for a Savior. The purpose of Hebrews is to show Christ’s incomparable superiority to the OT sacrifices, and at the same time to stress his work of salvation. His real temptation (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.18">2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">4:15</a>) combined with his sinlessness (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">4:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.5.9">5:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.7.26">7:26</a>) is the human remedy for human sin. The Incarnation was Christ’s path to final, once-for-all atonement and victory over sin (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.28">7:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.9.26">9:26</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoricalDevelopment">Historical Development</p>
<p class="fl">The first group to challenge the traditional doctrine of incarnation was the Gnostics, who in the late first century denied that Jesus was truly human. Their Greek belief that the physical creation was evil led them to deny the Incarnation. They believed Christ to be a quasi-spiritual being who merely appeared human. The theologian Marcion (d. c. 160), trained by Gnostic teachers, also accepted a docetic interpretation of Christ (his humanity was only apparent). Marcion taught his doctrine as an antidote to the OT or Jewish-oriented Christianity in his day. After his excommunication in <span class="era">AD</span> 144, Marcion founded his own church, and his views were widely disseminated in the next two centuries. Partly in reaction to Marcion’s christological heresy, the orthodox churches unified their doctrine.</p>
<p>The next challenge to the orthodox view came through the Arian, Apollinarian, and Nestorian controversies in the third and fourth centuries. Arianism held that the Incarnation was total, so that Christ the Logos was no longer fully God. At the same time, he was not fully human, so Christ was someone between two natures. The Council of Nicaea (<span class="era">AD</span> 325) affirmed that Jesus was indeed both God and man. A further question soon arose, however, as to the relation between his two natures. Apollinarius (310?–390?) taught that only the body of Jesus was human; his soul was absorbed completely into the divine Logos. Nestorius (c. 381–451) taught that the two natures must always remain distinct in the person of Christ; they functioned together but were separate in his being. The Council of Chalcedon (<span class="era">AD</span> 451) affirmed the unity of the two natures in Jesus. Many opponents of Chalcedon arose, called Monophysites, who believed in one divine nature in Jesus, who was only in a sense human. That movement caused serious political and religious divisions, and the Council of Constantinople (680–81) reaffirmed Chalcedon and established the orthodox incarnation theology.</p>
<p>In the eighth century, Spain and France were centers of the “adoptionist” controversy. Adoptionism taught that at birth Jesus was human, but at his baptism he underwent a “second birth” and was “adopted” as Son of God. It was condemned in a series of synods and never gained many adherents until modern times. During the scholastic age, Peter Lombard (1095?–1160) advocated what became known as “nihilism.” The Incarnation supposedly caused no fundamental change in Jesus’ deity, but his human nature was both insubstantial and unessential. That view likewise was condemned by Pope Alexander III (1159–81). Another debate at that time centered on the relationship between the fall and the Incarnation. Thomas Aquinas (1224–74) concluded that there was a cause-effect connection; the Incarnation was necessitated by sin rather than predestined apart from the fall.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Reformers follow basically the same orthodox teaching about the Incarnation. The conflict in the Reformation centered more on soteriology (the doctrine of salvation). Several aberrant antitrinitarian movements took advantage of the breakdown in ecclesiastical authority, however. Michael Servetus (1511–53) taught a pantheistic view of the Incarnation, focused on the divine Spirit becoming manifest in the human form of Jesus. Thus the Logos is not a distinct person in the Godhead, nor is it fundamentally different from a “divine spark” in every person. At the same time Laelius Socinus (1525–62) and his nephew, Faustus Socinus (1539–1604), taught a unitarian system. The Incarnation was not a transferral of the divine essence but a communication of divine authority and revelation. Christ thus did not die as an atonement but as a moral example. Both Servetus and Socinianism were condemned by Catholics and Protestants alike.</p>
<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries “kenoticism” (from Greek for “empty”) taught that in the Incarnation the Logos totally “emptied himself” (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.7">Phil 2:7</a>) of the divine attributes. That doctrine represented the final phase of a dialogue from the scholastic period about the exact communication between Jesus’ two natures. Was his human nature omnipotent? If not, how did the man Jesus exercise the divine attributes? The kenotic school believed that Jesus was fully human and that his divine nature was quiescent until after the Ascension. His miraculous powers were external, given by the Spirit. Against that view, the majority of theologians argued that Jesus was at all times both God and man, and that in <a href="?bref=Phil.2.6-8">Philippians 2:6-8</a> Jesus did not lay aside the attributes of deity (he still exhibited the “form of God”) but rather the majesty associated with deity.</p>
<p>The 19th and 20th centuries have given rise to a view that the Incarnation was a “myth,” a pictorial way of describing how God spoke through Jesus. The virgin birth was not historical, nor did any of the supernatural events of the Gospels ever take place. Rather, the stories in the Gospels were concoctions of the later church, efforts to portray Jesus’ impact on the movement. The Gospels, however, have too strong a flavor of accurate history for such a view to prevail (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-5">Lk 1:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.35">Jn 19:35</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.24">21:24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">The NT teaching on the Incarnation balances the humanity and divinity of Christ. Those two facts must harmonize in any theological system, for both are absolutely necessary parts of God’s redemptive plan. In the Incarnation, Jesus became a perfect human being. As God in human flesh, he suffered the divine penalty for sin as an innocent substitute. Being both God and man, Jesus simultaneously revealed God’s will for human life and reconciled sinful people to God through his own perfect life and death. Because of the Incarnation, therefore, those who believe in Christ have peace with God and new life from God.</p>

<p class="h1">INCENSE</p>
<p class="fl">Fragrant spices and oils or sacrifice that sends up perfumed smoke to God in order to please him.</p>
<p>People of every age have loved fragrant odors. In ancient times, sacrifices included sweet smells to make the deity happy. The aroma was a crucial factor in whether the god would accept the offering. Therefore, aromatic plants and exotic perfumes were precious for both secular and religious purposes.</p>
<p>Spices and precious oils were valued along with silver and gold. The queen of Sheba brought spices to Solomon as a gift (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.2">1 Kgs 10:2</a>). Incense was kept in the royal treasury (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.13">2 Kgs 20:13</a>). The price of spices and oils was extremely inflated because of the difficult work of extracting the juices, transportation costs to import them from faraway places, and high profits for merchants who sold the perfumes.</p>
<p>Consequently, lovers sometimes compared their beloved to “myrrh,” a “mountain of myrrh” and a “hill of frankincense” (<a href="?bref=Song.1.13">Sg 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Song.4.6">4:6</a>). The fragrance of incense set the right mood (<a href="?bref=Song.1.12">1:12</a>). Every spice known to a merchant burned beside the couch of Solomon (<a href="?bref=Song.3.6">3:6</a>). A bridegroom delighted in the perfumes of his beloved. She was his own private garden of incense (<a href="?bref=Song.4.10-14">4:10-14</a>). Even a prostitute burned incense beside her bed (<a href="?bref=Ezek.23.41">Ez 23:41</a>). No wonder wise men said that “fragrant oil” makes the heart glad and the “sweetness of friendship” comforts the soul (e.g., <a href="?bref=Pr.27.9">Prv 27:9</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TypesofIncense">Types of Incense</p>
<p class="fl">Frankincense is mentioned most often in the Bible. It was imported from India, Somaliland, and Arabia Felix. Myrrh also came from Arabia Felix. Cinnamon was another important fragrance from Ceylon and China. Galbanum, tragacanth (gum), and laudanum all were grown in the mountains of Asia Minor. Galbanum was the most popular of these three, for it was also found in Turkestan, Persia, Syria, and Crete. Henna, saffron, and balsam came from aromatic plants native to Israel. In postexilic times other plants were introduced to Palestine and cultivated there: the rose, narcissus, and jasmine. Onycha seems to have been produced from the local fauna, and musk (muskin) may have been extracted from a gland of the musk deer.</p>
<p>Incense itself came in many forms. It might be used as granules placed in a bag hung around the neck (<a href="?bref=Song.1.13">Sg 1:13</a>). In the main, however, perfumes were in a liquid form, dissolved in olive oil. A good example of this is the “holy anointing oil” (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.31">Ex 30:31</a>). Such oils were used to anoint the priests and kings of Israel. Only priests were allowed to prepare and administer them. The incense contained raw spices beaten into a fine consistency and seasoned with salt to make them holy. Stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense were mixed in equal proportions, all according to the art of the perfumer (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.34-37">Ex 30:34-37</a>). The spices and incense for the sanctuary were donated as gifts (<a href="?bref=Num.7.14-86">Nm 7:14-86</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.17.26">Jer 17:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.41.5">41:5</a>) and kept in the temple (<a href="?bref=Neh.13.5,9">Neh 13:5, 9</a>). Josephus described the incense of his day as a much more complicated compound. He listed 13 ingredients in the best incense of the Herodian era.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IncenseOffering">Incense Offering</p>
<p class="fl">Archaeology has demonstrated that incense offerings were common throughout the ancient Near East from the earliest times of organized worship. Egyptian paintings and reliefs from the New Kingdom occasionally show a man holding a censer of burning incense. Incense seems to have been used as well in the rituals of Assyria, Babylonia, and Arabia. Canaanite altars found at Megiddo and Tell Beit Mirsim have horned limestone altars (10th century <span class="era">BC</span>) that may have been designed to hold a bowl of incense. Hence, it is safe to assume that incense offerings also played some part in the worship of Israel from the beginning.</p>
<p>Incense offerings seem to have served a multitude of purposes. They may have been used to drive away evil spirits and thereby sanctify all the utensils of the place of worship (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.26-29">Ex 30:26-29</a>). Undoubtedly, the sweet smell of incense provided an antidote to the putrid odor of the animal sacrifices. Therefore, if God was to receive a sweet savor and thereby be pleased with an offering, incense was necessary to compensate for the smell of the sacrifices. However, spices were never added to the flesh of the animals or birds.</p>
<p>In some instances, incense itself became a sacrifice. As a supplement to other sacrifices, frankincense alone was burned. To alleviate a plague, Aaron performed a ritual of burning incense (<a href="?bref=Num.16.46-47">Nm 16:46-47</a>). On the Day of Atonement, the high priest carried burning incense and hot coals on a pan (censer) into the Holy of Holies (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.12-13">Lv 16:12-13</a>). The burning incense was thought to protect the life of the high priest, perhaps because the smoke kept him from seeing the full glory of God.</p>
<p>Frankincense was added to grain for offerings on the altar of burnt offering (<a href="?bref=Lev.2.1,15-16">Lv 2:1, 15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Lev.6.15">6:15</a>). It also accompanied the bread of the Presence (<a href="?bref=Lev.24.7">24:7</a>) in two dishes. The bronze serpent destroyed by Hezekiah in his reform had become a profane object to which incense was burned (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.4">2 Kgs 18:4</a>).</p>
<p>Except on the Day of Atonement, the incense was offered on a special altar (<a href="?bref=Lev.4.7">Lv 4:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.30.9">Ex 30:9</a>), where it burned morning and evening and came to be called “perpetual incense” (<a href="?bref=Exod.30.7-8">Ex 30:7-8</a>). Probably the altar of gold in Solomon’s temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.20-22">1 Kgs 6:20-22</a>) was the incense altar.</p>
<p>Offering incense was a holy ritual, and persons who offered it with disrespect for procedures were condemned (<a href="?bref=Lev.10.1-2">Lv 10:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.16.6-50">Nm 16:6-50</a>). Uzziah, the king of Judah, became a leper because he dared to offer incense (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.16-21">2 Chr 26:16-21</a>). The burning of incense at “high places” is often criticized (e.g., <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.43">1 Kgs 22:43</a>), either because the sanctuaries were idolatrous or because their priests did not take proper care as did the priesthood in Jerusalem. Prophets who criticized the offering of incense (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.13">Is 1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.66.3">66:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.6.20">Jer 6:20</a>) did so to condemn a formalism that was void of devotion to the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MeaningofIncense">Meaning of Incense</p>
<p class="fl">Since incense was such a precious commodity, incense was a fitting offering to God (<a href="?bref=Mal.1.11">Mal 1:11</a>). Incense offerings also provided a tangible sense of God’s holiness in which the people could experience atonement for sin (<a href="?bref=Num.16.46-47">Nm 16:46-47</a>). The smoke rising to the sky symbolized the prayers of the people (<a href="?bref=Ps.141.2">Ps 141:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.10">Lk 1:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.5.8">Rv 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.3-4">8:3-4</a>). At the same time, the smoke in the temple symbolized the presence of God as it had been portrayed by the cloud in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.18">Ex 19:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.9-10">33:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.25">Nm 11:25</a>). Together with the rising sun, the smoke provided a powerful symbol for the glory of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-7">Is 6:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>The significance of incense is further enhanced by NT allusions. The Christian’s testimony about Christ is paralleled with the offering of incense (<a href="?bref=2Cor.2.14-15">2 Cor 2:14-15</a>). The sweet smell of the gospel is contrasted with the smell of death that leads to doom. Likewise, money from the Philippian Christians came to Paul in the spirit of an incense sacrifice (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.18">Phil 4:18</a>), a costly expression of love and devotion. Finally, incense seems to sanctify and accompany the prayers of the saints into the presence of God (<a href="?bref=Rev.5.8">Rv 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.8.3-4">8:3-4</a>). None of the NT references call upon the Christian to offer incense, but rather to learn the devotion and dedication to holiness signified by the burning of this precious substance.</p>

<p class="h1">INCEST*</p>
<p class="fl">Sexual relations between close relatives.</p>
<p>Prohibitions against incest are prominent in <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Leviticus 18</a>. <a href="?bref=Lev.20.1-27">Leviticus 20</a> also addresses the matter and attaches the death penalty to certain kinds of incest. The assignment of severe penalty and the judgments of dishonor and perversion clearly mark incest as a grave offense.</p>
<p>Actual cases in the Bible show incest to be the fruit of a flawed character. Lot’s daughters slept with their drunken father and both became pregnant (<a href="?bref=Gen.19.30-38">Gn 19:30-38</a>). And in <a href="?bref=2Sam.13.1-22">2 Samuel 13:1-22</a>, the deceitful Amnon showed no shame in forcing himself upon his half sister Tamar. Paul’s strong rebuke in <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-5">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a> demonstrates that neither the act nor its wickedness is limited to OT times.</p>
<p>Blood relationship, or consanguinity, is one ground for declaring sexual contact unlawful. This applies, for example, to brothers and sisters, parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren, as well as some aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews.</p>
<p>The relationships denounced in <a href="?bref=Lev.18.1-30">Leviticus 18</a> are not, however, all based upon blood kinship. A number of them are matters of kinship through marriage, matters of affinity. In this connection, sexual relations with in-laws and certain aunts and uncles are declared incestuous. It should be noted that the in-law rule could be relaxed in ancient Israel when a widowed sister-in-law was left without a son (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5-10">Dt 25:5-10</a>).</p>
<p>While there are good genetic reasons to shun incest among blood relations, the fundamental problem with incest is that it strikes at the soundness of the family. And since the family is central to God’s purposes and work on earth, his judgment on this practice is fierce. Families simply cannot survive sexual intrigue among their members.</p>

  <title>India</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">INDIA</p>
<p class="fl">Eastern land of uncertain geographical boundaries in Bible times. The only specific reference to the land of India in the Bible occurs in <a href="?bref=Esth.1.1">Esther 1:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Esth.8.9">8:9</a>, where the boundaries of the empire of Ahasuerus are said to have stretched from Hoddu to Kush. The term “Hoddu” seems to have derived from an Old Persian word <span class="ital">Hindush,</span> which was itself related to a Sanskrit word <span class="ital">Sindhu,</span> meaning “stream,” that is, the Indus River. Inscriptions from Persia indicate that India was a province of the Achaemenid Empire (559–330 <span class="era">BC</span>), and thus support the biblical statements. Even the Greek historian Herodotus in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span> seems to have been poorly informed about India (<span class="ital">Persian Wars</span> 3.94-106; 4.40, 44). There are Hebrew legends and traditions that place Jews in India in the days of King Solomon. Some interpreters have suggested that the river Pishon in <a href="?bref=Gen.2.11">Genesis 2:11</a> in the land of Havilah may refer to India. Others have proposed that goods brought from Ophir, such as sandalwood (“almug wood,” <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.11">1 Kgs 10:11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.2.8">2 Chr 2:8</a>), ivory, and apes, were Indian in origin. Also, some of the items carried by merchants to Tyre, such as ivory tusks and ebony (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.15">Ez 27:15</a>), may have originated in India.</p>
<p>There are no references to India in the NT, but there are a number of general references to the land in intertestamental literature and in the later Jewish writings (e.g., the Targums on Esther, the Midrashim, and the Talmud). It was only after the days of Alexander the Great (d. 323 <span class="era">BC</span>) that the literary world of Palestine and Europe begin to record information about India. From <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.6.37">1 Maccabees 6:37</a>, it would appear that Seleucid armies used war elephants (possibly Indian), mounted by Indian drivers in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, and the reference in <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.8.8">8:8</a> indicates that the Romans compelled Antiochus III (223–187 <span class="era">BC</span>) to surrender. India is of uncertain value because of textual problems. There is no other evidence that the Seleucid domains stretched as far as India. It is known, however, that the Romans had considerable trading activity in India via Egypt and the Red Sea, and this makes the lack of references in the NT strange. As the Christian centuries passed, references do appear in both Jewish and early Christian literature, and it is certain that early in the Christian era settlements of Jews and monophysite Christians were found in India. According to legend, it was the apostle Thomas who took the gospel to India and founded the Mar Thoma Church.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">INHERITANCE</p>
<p class="fl">Legacy or bequest. Inheritance plays an unusually significant role in the Scriptures when it is used to convey theological truths. As we might expect, these theological applications reflect legal customs in force during OT and NT times.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LegalandHistoricalAspect">Legal and Historical Aspect</p>
<p class="h3">The Patriarchs</p>
<p class="fl">We learn something of early-second-millennium <span class="era">BC</span> practices from the patriarchal stories in Genesis. For example, the narrative indicates that the firstborn could normally expect to receive the birthright. Yet exceptions abound. Ishmael (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.15">Gn 16:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.17.15-21">17:15-21</a>), Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.23">25:23</a>), and Reuben (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.3-4">49:3-4</a>) did not receive the birthright. Another item of special interest is Abraham’s suggestion that, in the absence of a son, his servant Eliezer might be regarded as the heir (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.2-5">15:2-5</a>); scholars have found confirmation of this practice in Hurrian legal documents of the second millennium.</p>
<p class="h3">The Hebrew Nation</p>
<p class="fl">According to <a href="?bref=Deut.21.15-17">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>, Hebrew firstborns were legally entitled to a double portion of the inheritance. Israelite law also made provision for widows through the practice of levirate marriage (<a href="?bref=Deut.25.5">Dt 25:5</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.38.8">Gn 38:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ruth.4.5">Ru 4:5</a>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-11">Numbers 27:1-11</a>, the daughters of Zelophehad argued that they should receive the inheritance since their father had died without sons. Consequently, God decreed that if a man died without sons, the inheritance should be transferred to his daughter; if he had no daughter, to his brothers; if he had no brothers, to his nearest relatives. This particular incident also illustrates the importance of preserving tribal possessions: the daughters of Zelophehad were not allowed to marry outside the tribe of Manasseh, for this would mean transferral of the property to another tribe (<a href="?bref=Num.36.1-13">Nm 36</a>).</p>
<p>How highly the Israelites valued their family’s inherited possessions may be gathered from <a href="?bref=Lev.25.25-28">Leviticus 25:25-28</a>. If an individual sold his land for financial reasons, provision must be made for a relative to redeem it; if he had no near relative, he could still purchase it back at a later time, and even if he could not afford to do so, the land automatically reverted to him in the Year of Jubilee, when all debts were canceled (note also <a href="?bref=Lev.27.14-25">Lv 27:14-25</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Apart from the reference to levirate marriage in <a href="?bref=Matt.22.23-33">Matthew 22:23-33</a> (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.18-27">Mk 12:18-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.27-40">Lk 20:27-40</a>), the NT has little to say about principles of property transferral during Roman times.</p>
<p>In the parable of the prodigal son, the younger son in the family requested his share of the inheritance (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.12">Lk 15:12</a>). One should also note that the elder son, who with false piety looked down on his brother’s behavior, had not protested when his brother asked for the inheritance; on the contrary, the elder brother too, without complaining, received his share—presumably a double portion.</p>
<p>In another significant passage (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.1-2">Gal 4:1-2</a>) Paul, seeking to illustrate a theological point, refers to secular practices. An heir, he tells us, is subject to guardians and managers during his childhood, up to the time he actually inherits. The point Paul wants to establish is clear enough, but the illustration does not coincide with what we know of Roman law and unfortunately scholars have been unable to identify the precise social custom in view. It may be that Paul was making reference, in general rather than strict legal terms, to some practice with which he and the Galatians were familiar.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalAspect">Theological Aspect</p>
<p class="h3">Canaan as Israel’s Inheritance</p>
<p class="fl">The conviction that God gave Palestine to the Israelites for their inheritance serves as a bridge between the historical and the theological data. The historical element lies in the obvious fact that the Promised Land, a physical entity, was certainly occupied by the Hebrews and distributed among their tribes. Theologically, however, the Scriptures speak of this occupation as a divine gift; in effect, even the method of distribution was based on the concept that the land belongs to God (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.23">Lv 25:23</a>; see <a href="?bref=Exod.15.17">Ex 15:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.22.27">Jos 22:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.38.16">Ez 38:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.1.6">Jl 1:6</a>).</p>
<p>The theme goes back to <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Genesis 12:1-3</a>. God, in choosing Abraham, instructed him to move to a new country and promised to make him a great and blessed nation (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.8">Heb 11:8</a>). The significance of the land in this Abrahamic promise is made more explicit later, when we are told that God promised to give Canaan to Abraham’s descendants after four centuries of Egyptian bondage (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.12-21">Gn 15:12-21</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.7.5">Acts 7:5</a>).</p>
<p>Since Canaan was occupied by wicked inhabitants, the land was to be taken by force; to inherit the land therefore really means <span class="ital">to take possession</span> of it. Israel must trust God, whose land it is, to give them the victory (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-9">Jos 1:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.21.43-45">21:43-45</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.7.2">Jgs 7:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.44.1-3">Ps 44:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.19">Acts 13:19</a>). Once they conquered the land, it was apportioned among the tribes according to their size (following the instructions in <a href="?bref=Num.26.52-54">Nm 26:52-54</a>). God further commanded the people to divide the land by lot (vv <a href="?bref=Num.26.55-56">55-56</a>). Thus, from the initial promise to Abraham, to the actual apportionment of the land and even with reference to the future (<a href="?bref=Isa.60.21">Is 60:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.45.1-8">Ez 45:1-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.13-48.29">47:13–48:29</a>), the people were made fully aware that their inheritance lay in the hands of a sovereign Lord.</p>
<p class="h3">The Believer’s Inheritance</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT we find the concept of inheritance transferred from the purely physical to the spiritual. The tribe of Levi, which constituted the priestly clan, received no inheritance, because “the Lord is their inheritance” (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.1-2">Dt 18:1-2</a>; see <a href="?bref=Num.18.8-24">Nm 18:8-24</a>). The Levites, in other words, received no land apportionment, but in their service to God they could begin to enjoy the fuller blessings to which the land inheritance pointed.</p>
<p>That this truth could not be restricted to Levites is hinted at in <a href="?bref=Exod.19.6">Exodus 19:6</a>, where the whole nation is called “a kingdom of priests” (see <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.9">1 Pt 2:9</a>). <a href="?bref=Ps.16.1-11">Psalm 16</a> makes it clear that no one understood more clearly than David what those words entailed. Even if he were deprived of Israel’s physical inheritance, he had received by lot a more beautiful heritage, the Lord himself, in whose presence he found full joy and everlasting pleasures (<a href="?bref=Ps.16.5-6,11">Ps 16:5-6, 11</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Ps.73.25-26">Pss 73:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.142.5">142:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.58.14">Is 58:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Lam.3.24">Lam 3:24</a>).</p>
<p>In later Judaism, during and after the intertestamental period, the figure was extended considerably. For example, the rabbis began to speak of the law as the inheritance of the faithful. Further, they might give the idea a negative turn, as when the wicked are said to inherit hell (cf. <a href="?bref=Job.27.13">Jb 27:13</a>). Neither of these figures is found in the NT.</p>
<p>We also read in Jewish literature statements about inheriting the age to come, the kingdom, eternal life; these ideas occur frequently in the NT (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.29">Mt 19:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.25.34">25:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.10.25">Lk 10:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.18">18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.6.9-10">1 Cor 6:9-10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50">15:50</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.5.21">Gal 5:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.5.5">Eph 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.3.7">Ti 3:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">Jas 2:5</a>). Such an inheritance, however, belongs only to those who are sanctified by God’s word (<a href="?bref=Acts.20.32">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.18">26:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.1.12">Col 1:12</a>; note also <a href="?bref=John.17.17">Jn 17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Col.3.23-24">Col 3:23-24</a>). These future blessings do not exclude the physical (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.5">Mt 5:5</a>; note <a href="?bref=Ps.37.11,29">Ps 37:11, 29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.60.21">Is 60:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.4.13">Rom 4:13</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.3.13">2 Pt 3:13</a>), but they certainly exclude human frailty, for God’s inheritance is imperishable (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50">1 Cor 15:50</a>). In short, our heritage is nothing less than full salvation (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.14">Heb 1:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">11:7</a>), which God carefully guards for us in heaven (<a href="?bref=1Pet.1.4">1 Pt 1:4</a>).</p>
<p>Doubtless, the most significant feature in the NT is its emphasis that, as a result of the work of Christ, his people begin even <span class="ital">now</span> to receive the promised inheritance. The Gospel of John frequently stresses the present reality of eternal life, as does the Letter to the Hebrews (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.6.12-17">6:12-17</a> with <a href="?bref=Heb.9.15">9:15</a> and <a href="?bref=Heb.11.13,39-40">11:13, 39-40</a>).</p>
<p>Paul treats this whole matter thoroughly in <a href="?bref=Gal.3.7-4.7">Galatians 3:7–4:7</a>. In response to the Judaizers, who claim that the Abrahamic inheritance is restricted to those who become Jews through circumcision, Paul argues vigorously that Abraham’s true children are those who believe, whether Jew or Gentile (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.7">3:7</a>; see <a href="?bref=Acts.26.16-18">Acts 26:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.3.6">Eph 3:6</a>). They become heirs of God’s promise, for they receive the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.14">Gal 3:14</a>). The principle of inheritance is promise, not the Law (v <a href="?bref=Gal.3.18">18</a>). Those who believe are brought into union with Christ (vv <a href="?bref=Gal.3.27-29">27-29</a>); but then they are not merely Abraham’s children but God’s (v <a href="?bref=Gal.3.26">26</a>), for Christ is the Son of God and God has determined to send the Spirit of his Son to believers so that they too may call God <span class="ital">Father</span> (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.4-7">Gal 4:4-7</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Rom.8.15-16">Rom 8:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, Christ himself as the Son is the true heir (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.38">Mt 21:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.7">Mk 12:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.14">Lk 20:14</a>); he has inherited a name above every name (<a href="?bref=Phil.2.9">Phil 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.1.4">Heb 1:4</a>) and has been appointed heir of all things (<a href="?bref=Heb.1.2">Heb 1:2</a>; see <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7-8">Ps 2:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.18">Mt 28:18</a>). But by his grace, all who become his through faith are counted joint heirs with him (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.17">Rom 8:17</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">God’s Inheritance</p>
<p class="fl">With a bold shift in the metaphor, the Scriptures speak of believers as God’s inheritance. In the beautiful “Song of Moses” the author speaks of God as the Israelites’ Father (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.6">Dt 32:6</a>), who has taken special interest in their inheritance (v <a href="?bref=Deut.32.8">8</a>). Then we are told why God cares: “For the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>’s portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance” (<a href="?bref=Deut.32.9">Dt 32:9</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). This theme becomes very prominent throughout the OT (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.9.26-29">Dt 9:26-29</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.51-53">1 Kgs 8:51-53</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.28.9">Pss 28:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.33.12">33:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.74.2">74:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.19.25">Is 19:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.10.16">Jer 10:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.2.12">Zec 2:12</a>). Elsewhere, Israel is spoken of as God’s special possession (e.g., <a href="?bref=Exod.19.5">Ex 19:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.6">Dt 7:6</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Eph.1.14">Ephesians 1:14</a> “the redemption of the possession” refers to the final salvation of believers, who are God’s treasure. Further, “we have obtained an inheritance” (<a href="?bref=Eph.1.11">Eph 1:11</a>) may well be translated, “we have been made an inheritance,” that is, been “chosen as God’s portion,” a view supported by verse <a href="?bref=Eph.1.18">18</a>. No more fundamental idea than this can be found in Scripture, and its essence is expressed by the words of the One who sits on the throne: “He who conquers shall have this heritage, and I will be his God and he shall be my son” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.7">Rv 21:7</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>; see <a href="?bref=Lev.26.11-12">Lv 26:11-12</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.14">2 Sm 7:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">INN</p>
<p class="fl">Place of lodging for travelers.</p>
<p>In the OT, the word “inn” occurs three times (<span class="sc">kjv</span>): twice in reference to overnight rests of Joseph’s brothers during their journeys between Egypt and Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.27">Gn 42:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.43.21">43:21</a>), and once in a similar situation when Moses was returning to Egypt from Midian to lead the children of Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.24">Ex 4:24</a>). The <span class="sc">rsv</span> translates each of these instances as “lodging place” because in the time of the patriarchs and Moses the Near East had nothing to correspond to the inn as a public place with accommodations for hire to travelers. In a settled country a traveler could ordinarily expect hospitality from the inhabitants. Throughout the Near East, hospitality was viewed as a serious social responsibility (see <a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-3">Gn 19:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.15-21">Jgs 19:15-21</a>). In deserted areas travelers would provide for their own shelter (e.g., <a href="?bref=Gen.28.11">Gn 28:11</a>) and sustenance (e.g., <a href="?bref=Josh.9.11-13">Jos 9:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>The beginning of real inns in Palestine is obscure. It has been argued that they had a foreign origin, since the rabbinic words for “inn” are borrowed from Greek and Latin. References to Rahab (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.1">Jos 2:1</a>) as innkeeper in the Targum and in Josephus (<span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 5.1.12) may be anachronistic, and they provide no reliable witness to the existence of inns during the time of Joshua, though there are parallels in the Near East of women keeping an establishment providing both lodging and sexual activity for travelers. Certainly there is evidence for Greek inns as early as the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>, and they became common in the Hellenized Mediterranean. They were typically uncomfortable and dangerous.</p>
<p>Such an “inn” with an “innkeeper” sheltered the victim of robbers whom the Good Samaritan befriended (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.34-35">Lk 10:34-35</a>). This inn was probably much like the khan or caravansary, which has been common along the trade and pilgrimage routes of Syria since ancient times. It was built in the form of a square enclosing an open court where water and shelter were available, but the traveler typically supplied his own food and sometimes his own bedding. The Good Samaritan clearly expected the host to provide full care for the wounded man; it is difficult to tell whether this was customary or simply an accommodation to the emergency. The inn of Jesus’ story has long been identified with the Khan Hathrur, halfway between Jerusalem and Jericho, though the present structure is probably only one of many built in the same place.</p>
<p>Two other well-known passages in the NT allude, not to a real inn, but to other social customs and arrangements. First, Christians from the church at Rome met the prisoner Paul at Three Taverns, a stopping place 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Rome at the intersection of the Appian Way with the road from Antium (<a href="?bref=Acts.28.15">Acts 28:15</a>). Second, there is the “inn” from which Joseph and Mary were excluded (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.7">Lk 2:7</a>). The word is elsewhere translated “guestchamber” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) and “guest room” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.14">Mk 14:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.11">Lk 22:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The Jews of Jerusalem took pride in having enough such guest rooms to accommodate the huge influx of pilgrims keeping Passover in the city (cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.2.6-11">Acts 2:6-11</a> on the crowd at Pentecost); evidently Joseph and Mary expected such accommodation in Bethlehem for the census, but found their place already taken.</p>

  <title>Inner Man*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">INNER MAN*</p>
<p class="fl">The inner, invisible being of a human. This Pauline phrase resembles the “hidden man” (<span class="sc">kjv</span>) of <a href="?bref=1Pet.3.4">1 Peter 3:4</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.2.29">Rom 2:29</a>), where outward appearance is contrasted with inward reality. It assumes the current Jewish conception of man as a unitary being having both observable and invisible aspects, a physical body including a “psychological” heart. Paul says his members submit to sin’s rule even while his “inmost self” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>) delights in divine law (<a href="?bref=Rom.7.22">Rom 7:22</a>). In <a href="?bref=Rom.8.13">Romans 8:13</a>, he speaks of setting the mind on things of the flesh versus things of the Spirit, describing this same conflict between the inner and outer man.</p>
<p>This inner core of personality is already the locus where the Spirit’s strength is instilled and where Christ dwells in the Christian. So another contrast is between the mortal and already decaying outward man, weakened by age and by sharing the dying of Christ, and the daily renewed inner man, as the life of the risen Jesus is manifested in mortal flesh (<a href="?bref=2Cor.4.10-16">2 Cor 4:10-16</a>). Taken with <a href="?bref=Rom.8.11">Romans 8:11</a>, this may possibly echo a speculation of intertestamental Judaism that a spiritual counterpart to the present body is already being prepared by the quickening of divine life in the devout inner man.</p>

<p class="fl">Herod the Great’s massacre of all the boys under two years old in Bethlehem and its vicinity (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.16-18">Mt 2:16-18</a>). Herod slaughtered “the holy innocents” in an effort to destroy the child about whom the Magi had told him.</p>
<p>Although Matthew does not specify Herod’s motive, secular historians record ample evidence of Herod’s jealousy for his throne. He feared his own family as rivals of his power to such an extent that he put his wife and several of his sons to death. His kingdom, rife with messianic hopes and speculations, did produce some claimants. Herod himself made that association with the Magi’s quest for one born “King of the Jews” (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.2">Mt 2:2</a>). Adding to his instability, a painful form of arteriosclerosis made the king subject to fits of delirium and rage.</p>
<p>Matthew probably had several reasons for including the story in his Gospel. For one thing, its use follows Matthew’s pattern of citing OT prophecies (in this case, <a href="?bref=Jer.31.15">Jer 31:15</a>). Also, the incident accounts for the sojourn of Jesus’ family to Egypt and their subsequent settling in Nazareth (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-15,19-23">Mt 2:13-15, 19-23</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="Introduction">Introduction</p>
<p class="fl">There are occasional references to inscriptions in the Bible; for example, the Ten Commandments were inscribed on stone (<a href="?bref=Exod.31.18">Ex 31:18</a>) and given to Moses, and later written by Joshua on stone and set up at Mt Ebal near Shechem (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.32">Jos 8:32</a>). In the excavations at Shechem, G. E. Wright found a large stone prepared to receive an inscription that he dated to the time of Joshua on stratigraphic grounds. It may still be seen at the site. A message from the hand of God to the Babylonian king Belshazzar was inscribed on the walls of his palace (<a href="?bref=Dan.5.5,24">Dn 5:5, 24</a>). Paul observed an altar with the inscription “To an unknown god” in the marketplace of Athens (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.23">Acts 17:23</a>). The book of Revelation speaks of the names of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel being inscribed on the gates of the heavenly city (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.12">Rv 21:12</a>).</p>
<p>Inscriptions in the ancient world can be found in almost any language and from any period of history: Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Aramaic, Nabatean, Moabite, and so on. It was once popular to argue that Moses could not have written the Pentateuch because writing had not been invented that early. Inscriptions found at the turquoise mines of Serabit el-Khadim dating to the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span> have disproven this allegation. In addition, it might be noted that clay tablets found at Ras Shamra by Claude Schaeffer and dated to about 1400 <span class="era">BC</span> demonstrate a considerable period of literary activity, as do the tablets at Ebla from approximately 1,000 years earlier.</p>
<p>Inscriptions may be found in almost any position or place, but the most common locations are in the floors of synagogues, church buildings, and mosques; the pavements of forums; the walls of public buildings; dedicatory stones and statues; stelae and monumental plaques; tombs and sarcophagi; and Roman milestones. An exhaustive list is impossible, but a few representative samples will illustrate the various kinds of extant inscriptional material.</p>
<p class="h2" id="InscriptionsonMonuments">Inscriptions on Monuments</p>
<p class="fl">The Egyptian pharaoh Merneptah commemorated his victory over the Sea Peoples in the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span> by inscribing a black granite stele with a record of his victory. It contains the earliest known reference to Israel outside the land of Palestine: “Israel lies desolate.”</p>
<p>The Israelite king Omri (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.16-30">1 Kgs 16:16-30</a>) is referred to in a text carved in the Moabite language on a stone dating near the end of the reign of the Moabite king Mesha, about 830 <span class="era">BC</span>. It was found at Diban (OT Dibon) in 1868 and contains a record of the successful rebellion of the king against Israelite oppression.</p>
<p>Another monumental inscription was found in Persia carved into the steep slope of Mt Behistun. It is a trilingual (Old Persian, Elamite, Akkadian) record of the exploits of Darius I, providing the key to unlocking the mystery of the cuneiform script in which several of these ancient languages were written.</p>
<p>The Assyrian king Shalmaneser III left a record of his first six campaigns of conquest inscribed on a monolith found in 1861 at Kurkh on the Tigris. The stone is carved front and back in cuneiform that is written over a bas-relief of the king. This same king left a black stone obelisk, six and a half feet (2 meters) high, depicting his triumphs over several other kings, among whom is Jehu, king of Israel, depicted in the second panel from the top, prostrating himself before the Assyrian monarch. This is the earliest picture available of an Israelite and the only known representation of an Israelite king by a contemporary. The inscription above the picture reads, “The tribute of Jehu, son [descendant] of Omri . . .” It dates to the mid-ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoricalRecords">Historical Records</p>
<p class="fl">Frequently in the region of Mesopotamia, ancient kings recorded important events or proclamations in stone or clay. A notable example is the clay prism containing the final edition of Sennacherib’s Annals dated to 691 <span class="era">BC</span>. It is hexagonal, 15 inches (38.1 centimeters) high and 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) wide, and written on all sides in cuneiform script. The inscription speaks of “Hezekiah the Jew (king of Judah), who did not submit to my yoke. . . . Like a caged bird, I shut him up in Jerusalem, his royal city” (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.18.1-37">2 Kgs 18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">Is 36–39</a>).</p>
<p>Even though no annals comparable to those produced by the Assyrian kings have survived among the Babylonians, we do have some chronicles written on clay tablets covering the years from 626 <span class="era">BC</span> to the fall of Babylon to Cyrus in 539. One of these, the Babylonian Chronicle, provides an exact date of March 16, 597 <span class="era">BC</span>, for the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.10-17">2 Kgs 24:10-17</a>).</p>
<p>Babylon itself fell to Cyrus the Mede, king of Persia, in 539. The event is not only referred to in the Bible (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-3">Ezr 1:1-3</a>) but is also described on a clay barrel-shaped cylinder nine inches (22.9 centimeters) in length, written in cuneiform script, during the reign of Cyrus. It refers to his policy that allowed captive nations to rebuild their cities and temples. This provides an explanation of his encouragement and financial help to the Jews in returning to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple of Solomon that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.2-4">Ezr 1:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>Egyptian pharaohs were fond of publishing records of their exploits in hieroglyphic script on the walls of temples and tombs. These were usually incised into the stone and then painted. One of the most interesting is Shishak’s description of his invasion of the land of Israel incised on the southern wall of a court of the temple of Amon at Karnak. The inclusion of Megiddo, as well as other cities in Israel, among the more than 75 cities whose names can still be read adds historical interest to the biblical account of Shishak’s invasion and conquest of Jerusalem and “Judah’s fortified cities” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.25-26">1 Kgs 14:25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.12.2-10">2 Chr 12:2-10</a>). Archaeological finds confirm a destruction and burning of the city at this time.</p>
<p class="h2" id="OfficialAnnouncements">Official Announcements</p>
<p class="fl">When an ancient monarch or public official wanted to publish an announcement with some degree of permanency, it would be carved in stone or set in mosaic. An inscription on a marble slab dating to the reign of Claudius (<span class="era">AD</span> 41–54) was found in 1878, originating in the city of Nazareth. It contains a warning against grave robbing or any other desecration of cemeteries. The penalty for such violation was declared to be death. The inscription may reflect some of the troubles Claudius had in Rome over the person of Christ (Suetonius, <span class="ital">Claudius</span> 25) which led to the expulsion of Jews from the capital city (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.1-28">Acts 18</a>). At issue must have been the resurrection of Christ as proclaimed in Rome.</p>
<p>Announcements were placed even in temples. Josephus referred to a small wall surrounding the Jewish temple in Jerusalem that contained slabs of stone at regular intervals giving warning in Greek and Latin to Gentiles entering the temple (<span class="ital">War</span> 5.193-34; 6.125-26; <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 15.417). Two fragmentary examples have been found. One discovered by Clermont-Ganneau in 1871 reads: “No foreigner is to enter within the balustrade and embankment around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught will have himself to blame for his death which follows.” The Romans allowed the Jews to put anyone to death, even a Roman, who went beyond this barrier (<span class="ital">War</span> 6.126).</p>
<p>An important inscription commissioned by the emperor Claudius, was found at the beginning of the 20th century in Delphi, Greece. It was written in Greek and mentions Gallio as proconsul with a date that can be established as <span class="era">AD</span> 51–52 for his term of office. This Gallio is the proconsul before whom Paul was brought by the Jews of Corinth (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.12-17">Acts 18:12-17</a>). It is therefore extremely important for establishing the date of Paul’s 18-month stay in Corinth, and an important pivotal date for Pauline chronology in general. The inscription is an imperial announcement to the citizens of Delphi regarding the need for increasing the population of the city with eminent people.</p>
<p>The name Pontius Pilate has appeared in a Latin inscription carved into a stone found in the Roman theater at Caesarea Maritima on the coast of Israel. It refers to him, in partially mutilated words, as prefect and contains the name Tiberium, which designates a structure built in honor of the emperor Tiberius.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Dedications">Dedications</p>
<p class="fl">Inscriptions were commonly placed on walls or floors of buildings or attached to some other structure dedicating the completed edifice. An inscription was cut into the wall of a long tunnel built by the Jewish king Hezekiah in Jerusalem when the tunnel was finished (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.20.20">2 Kgs 20:20</a>). It is in Hebrew and is now in the Istanbul museum. One of the oldest inscriptions we have in that language, it describes the construction of the Siloam tunnel.</p>
<p>In the city of Corinth in Greece there is a dedicatory inscription cut into the pavement of a plaza on the north side of the large theater. The abbreviated Latin inscription reads: <span class="ital">Erastus pro aedilitate sua pecunia stravit</span> (“Erastus, in return for his aedileship, laid the pavement at his own expense”). The bronze has long since been removed from the letters deeply cut into the gray Acrocorinthian limestone. This is probably the same “Erastus, the city treasurer” mentioned by Paul in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.23">Romans 16:23</a>. A similar inscription from the Corinthian agora of Paul’s day reads: “Gnaeus Babbius Philinus, aedile and pontifex, had this monument erected at his own expense, and he approved it in his official capacity as duovir.”</p>
<p>A monumental dedicatory inscription in Greek was found in Jerusalem during excavations in 1913–14, which once stood on the wall of a first-century <span class="era">AD</span> synagogue on Mt Ophel. It refers to a Theodotus, the son of a ruler of the synagogue named Vettenos, who built the synagogue. Since the name Vettenos is Roman, it may be that Theodotus was a Jewish slave who had been freed and given the Roman name of his master. If so, this inscription may have hung on the “synagogue of the Freedmen” in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.9">Acts 6:9</a>).</p>
<p>The British Museum contains a portion of a broken arch that stood over an entrance into the Greek city of Thessalonica from the first century <span class="era">AD</span> until 1867, when it was torn down to provide stone for the repair of the vast city wall. The inscription begins: “In the time of the politarchs . . .” This is a rare word referring to Roman officials and is used in the book of Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.6">Acts 17:6</a>) in reference to city authorities of Thessalonica. This word is found nowhere else in Greek literature.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Correspondence">Correspondence</p>
<p class="fl">In the second millennium before Christ, it was common practice to write correspondence on small clay tablets. More than half a million have been found in Mari, Nuzi, Nineveh, Ebla, and elsewhere. Interesting examples of such correspondence may be found in a great number of clay tablets found at Tell el-Amarna in Upper Egypt. They were written in the Babylonian language using the cuneiform script during the time when Akhenaton was captivated with his reformation of Egyptian art and religion at his new capital Tell el-Amarna (Akhetaten), and Palestine and Syria were left to the mercy of marauders called Habiru in the documents. Many of these are written from cities in Canaan under attack and ask for help from the pharaoh, whose vassals they are at this time (late 14th century <span class="era">BC</span>). Some think that these Habiru were the ancient Hebrews who invaded the land under the direction of Joshua.</p>
<p>Sometimes correspondence was written in ink on broken pieces of ceramic pottery (potsherds) called ostraca. In 1935, 18 of these were found in the excavations at Lachish in southern Israel. They are written in Hebrew and provide examples of the kind of script used by the Judeans in the time of Jeremiah. The language is essentially identical with the Hebrew of the OT. The letters were sent by Hosha’yahu, an officer in charge of a nearby town, to Ya’osh, the military governor of Lachish, during the invasion of Judea by the Babylonians, which ended in the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>Eleven such potsherds were found in Masada, on the western shore of the Dead Sea, in excavations conducted by Yigael Yadin from 1963 to 1965. Masada was destroyed by the Roman army under the command of Flavius Silva in <span class="era">AD</span> 73. Nine hundred and sixty men, women, and children committed suicide rather than surrender to the Romans. Ten men were chosen to cut the throats of those who remained. They drew lots for the heartbreaking task, according to Josephus (<span class="ital">War</span> 7.395), and Professor Yadin thinks the ostraca he found were the ones used in the drawing. One of them contained the name of Ben Yair, who was probably Eleazer ben Yair, the commander of the fortress.</p>
<p class="h2" id="MosaicFloorDecorations">Mosaic Floor Decorations</p>
<p class="fl">In the Roman and Byzantine periods it was popular to decorate the floors of basilicas, baths, synagogues, churches, and other public buildings with elaborate tesselation containing inscriptions and artwork. Excavation in 1972 disclosed a building in Caesarea Maritima with mosaic inscriptions in six floors throughout the structure. Two of them are the Greek text of <a href="?bref=Rom.13.3">Romans 13:3</a> set in a circular border. Another is a blessing on the one who enters and exits the room: “May the Lord bless your entry and your exit.” Two of them invoke the aid of Christ for people associated with the function and construction of the building. These were a part of a building that was destroyed in the seventh century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>The floors of the synagogues at Tiberias-hamath, Beth Shan, Beth Alpha, Eshtemoa, Susiya, Hamath-gader, En-gedi, and others in Israel have inscriptions in Greek and Aramaic that usually refer to benefactors of the synagogue. A synagogue floor has been found in Naro, Tunisia, which contains a Latin inscription. In the Tiberias synagogue, Hebrew was used only for defining the astrological symbols that appear in the zodiac. Aramaic was used primarily for Halakah (religious rule or law), and Greek was principally used in honoring donors.</p>
<p>One of the best-known mosaic floor inscriptions in churches was in Madaba, Jordan, where the oldest known map of Israel and Jordan was set into the floor in the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>. The place-names of cities, geographical features, and passages of Scripture are given in Greek. Church floors typically contain dated or undated dedications, blessings, and Scripture quotations that appear in Aramaic, Coptic, Syriac, Latin, and Greek. Symbolism often accompanies the inscriptions, but in <span class="era">AD</span> 427 an edict was issued forbidding the use of crosses and other religious symbols on pavements so that they might not be stepped on. It is not clear how widespread this prohibition was.</p>

<p class="h1">INTERCESSION OF CHRIST*</p>
<p class="fl">Theological term for Christ’s activity of petitioning God the Father to save, help, and sustain people on earth.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word meaning “to make intercession” is from a root meaning “to strike”; hence it means “to assail or encounter with a request.” That word is used prophetically of the ministry of the “servant of the Lord”: “He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors” (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">Is 53:12</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The principal Greek verb meant in secular usage to “meet,” “approach,” or “make an appeal.” In intertestamental literature that word was employed in the sense of personally petitioning an official to gain a favor (e.g., <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.4.8">2 Macc 4:8</a>). The noun form of the word is translated in the NT both as “intercession” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.1">1 Tm 2:1</a>) and as “prayer” (<a href="?bref=1Tim.4.5">4:5</a>).</p>
<p>Theologians generally see intercession as the second phase of Christ’s “high priestly work,” after he first made satisfaction for sin through his suffering and death on the cross (<a href="?bref=1Tim.2.5-6">1 Tm 2:5-6</a>). In the OT one of the priest’s functions was to petition God on the people’s behalf. In particular, on the annual Day of Atonement the high priest carried the blood of the sin offering into the Holy of Holies, sanctified the sacred place by means of incense, and sprinkled the sacrificial blood on and about the “mercy seat” (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.11-19">Lv 16:11-19</a>). Correspondingly, after Christ offered himself on the cross as the sacrifice for sins, he ascended to the Father and entered the heavenly sanctuary where he now represents his people (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.25">Heb 7:25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChristsIntercessiononEarth">Christ’s Intercession on Earth</p>
<p class="fl">Before his life of intercession in heaven, Jesus Christ exercised such a ministry on earth, consistent with his own teaching that the disciples should always pray and not get discouraged (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.1">Lk 18:1</a>). Scripture often points to Jesus in prayer. For example, Jesus interceded at the grave of his friend Lazarus (<a href="?bref=John.11.41-42">Jn 11:41-42</a>). Jesus prayed all night on a mountain before selecting the 12 apostles (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.12-13">Lk 6:12-13</a>). After warning his disciple Peter that Satan had designs on him, Jesus said to Peter, “I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail” (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.32">Lk 22:32</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Jesus’ first words on the cross were a prayer for those who had persecuted him (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.34">23:34</a>).</p>
<p>The “high priestly prayer” recorded in <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">John 17</a> provides the most complete account in Scripture of an intercessory prayer by Jesus. The ground, or basis, of his impassioned petition was his intimate relationship with his heavenly Father (<a href="?bref=John.17.5,8">Jn 17:5, 8</a>). The objects of his prayer were (1) himself, that he might glorify the Father and complete the work he had been sent to accomplish (<a href="?bref=John.17.1-5">Jn 17:1-5</a>); (2) his disciples, who were chosen to spread the gospel after his departure (vv <a href="?bref=John.17.8-9">8-9</a>); and (3) the entire family of believers (v <a href="?bref=John.17.20">20</a>). The goals of his intercession included (1) the unity of God’s people (vv <a href="?bref=John.17.11,21">11, 21</a>), (2) their joy in spite of hardships and discouragement (v <a href="?bref=John.17.13">13</a>), (3) their preservation from evil (v <a href="?bref=John.17.15">15</a>), (4) their sanctification by the Word of God (v <a href="?bref=John.17.17">17</a>), and (5) their eternal fellowship with Christ (v <a href="?bref=John.17.24">24</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="ChristsIntercessioninHeaven">Christ’s Intercession in Heaven</p>
<p class="fl">Christ’s intercession for his people, begun on earth, is continued in heaven. The Epistle to the Hebrews depicts Christ as a priest, placing considerable emphasis on his continuing ministry of intercession. Christ’s heavenly intercession is a sequel to his earthly sacrifice accomplished “once for all” (<a href="?bref=Heb.10.10-18">Heb 10:10-18</a>). Jesus himself said, “Every one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.32">Mt 10:32</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). His continuing intercession is recognized in such NT phrases as “through Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.8">Rom 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.16.27">16:27</a>; <a href="?bref=1Pet.2.5">1 Pt 2:5</a>), “through him” (<a href="?bref=Col.3.17">Col 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.13.15">Heb 13:15</a>), and “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Eph.5.20">Eph 5:20</a>).</p>
<p>The doctrine of Christ’s heavenly intercession is explicitly affirmed in four NT texts. The apostle Paul spoke of Christ “at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes for us” (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.34">Rom 8:34</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The writer of Hebrews affirmed that Christ “is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them” (<a href="?bref=Heb.7.25">Heb 7:25</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Further, Christ has entered “into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf” (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.24">9:24</a>). The apostle John also described that ministry: “If any one does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 Jn 2:1</a>). The Greek word for “advocate” meant a legal counselor who appeared before a magistrate to plead a client’s cause. John thus pictured the ascended Lord as appearing before God on behalf of his people, presenting his own obedience and suffering as the ground for the believer’s acquittal.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheWayIntercessionWorks">The Way Intercession Works</p>
<p class="fl">Christ’s heavenly intercession has both a static aspect (his redemptive work has been completed) and a dynamic aspect (he continues to care for God’s people). Thus Christ’s intercession is seen as including (1) his presence with the Father as the ground of each believer’s justification (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.24">Heb 9:24</a>); (2) his thwarting of Satan’s accusations against each believer (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.33">Rom 8:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.12.10">Rv 12:10</a>); (3) his claim for each believer’s right of access to the divine presence (<a href="?bref=Heb.4.14-16">Heb 4:14-16</a>); and (4) his mediation of the prayers of each believer. The heavenly Father’s response is to impart the full range of spiritual blessings on believers. In the words of the Puritan John Owen (1616–83), “The intercession of Christ . . . is his continual appearance for us in the presence of God, representing the efficacy of his oblation, accompanied with tender care, love and desires for the welfare, supply, deliverance and salvation of the church.”</p>
<p>Those for whom Christ intercedes in heaven are described in Scripture both broadly and narrowly. Christ is said to pray for all people everywhere (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.12">Is 53:12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.28">Mt 26:28</a>). More specifically, and perhaps more profoundly, he prays for his own redeemed community, the church (<a href="?bref=John.14.16">Jn 14:16</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.9,20">17:9, 20</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15-16">Heb 4:15-16</a>). Nevertheless, Christ’s prayers are also centered on the specific needs of individual believers (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.31-32">Lk 22:31-32</a>; <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1">1 Jn 2:1</a>).</p>

  <title>Intermediate State*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">INTERMEDIATE STATE*</p>
<p class="fl">State of the human person after death and before the final resurrection. Such teaching is more developed in the NT than in the OT, though it is a mistake to think that reference to it is totally absent in the OT (<a href="?bref=Job.19.25">Jb 19:25</a>). According to Christ, the intermediate state is deducible from such texts as <a href="?bref=Exod.3.6">Exodus 3:6</a> (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.32">Mt 22:32</a>). Even in the NT, an account of the intermediate state is not given explicitly but may be inferred from teaching about the physical death and resurrection of all people, but especially of believers. This is taught by Christ himself (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.30-32">Mt 22:30-32</a>) and by the apostles, particularly Paul (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.1-58">1 Cor 15</a>). In addition, the biblical teaching that the human being is a unity of soul and body and not simply a soul that happens to be embodied (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>) has implications for a person’s state after death. From such data two conclusions regarding the intermediate state may be drawn. The first is that physical death is not the total cessation of the life of the individual but that the person lives on, not merely in the memories of those who survive, but as a distinct personality, and in the case of believers with awareness of the loving presence of God (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>). The second conclusion is that such an existence is not a fully human existence but is incomplete or anomalous, since being embodied is essential for an individual to be in God’s image. The individual, surviving death, awaits the resurrection of the body when, in the case of a Christian, he or she will experience complete redemption, a state of complete emancipation from sin in the presence of Christ (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.50-58">1 Cor 15:50-58</a>). The biblical data regarding the character of the intermediate state of those who are outside Christ is less clear, including as it does the difficult reference to Christ’s preaching to the “imprisoned” spirits (<a href="?bref=1Pet.3.19-20">1 Pt 3:19-20</a>).</p>
<p>Scripture is restrained in its portrayal of what life in the intermediate state is like. Paul says of himself that after his death he will be “with Christ, which is far better” (<a href="?bref=Phil.1.23">Phil 1:23</a>) but he gives no details. Nor is it wise to look for such details in such biblical incidents as that of Saul and the medium at Endor (<a href="?bref=1Sam.28.7">1 Sm 28:7</a>), which is subject to a number of different interpretations. Even Christ’s parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>), because of its obviously symbolic character and its avowed purpose of teaching about the importance of the present life for a person’s eternal destiny, must be treated with caution. Perhaps the most that can be said is that the dead in Christ are “immediately with God” and that they rest in his loving presence until the resurrection, while the unsaved are in a comfortless condition awaiting their resurrection to judgment (<a href="?bref=John.5.29">Jn 5:29</a>).</p>
<p>Discussion of the intermediate state in the history of Christian thought has focused upon three separate aspects that may help to clarify the biblical data further. First, under the influence of Greek philosophical ideas, there has been a recurring Platonic influence in Christian theology in which the Pauline contrast between the flesh and the spirit has been misinterpreted and the soul has been emphasized at the expense of the body, with the result that the prospective resurrection of the dead and its eschatological setting has either been played down or eliminated altogether because of its allegedly physical (and therefore unspiritual) aspect. The doctrine of the immortality of the disembodied soul is sometimes substituted for the idea of an intermediate state prior to resurrection, but without any warrant from Scripture. In modern theology a tendency to discount the historical has tended to displace the earlier discounting of the physical, but with much the same effect, at best a spiritualizing of postmortem existence, at worst a denial of any such existence. But it is clear from Scripture that the intermediate state is a state between two phases of embodiment, the present state of physical embodiment and that of “spiritual embodiment” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.44">1 Cor 15:44</a>), which is to occur at Christ’s second coming (v <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.23">23</a>).</p>
<p>Second, during the Reformation, a controversy arose between John Calvin and some of the Anabaptists over “soul sleep.” Calvin vehemently maintained that the intermediate state is one of conscious awareness of God’s presence—something his opponents denied. For Calvin such a denial was equivalent to holding that the soul is annihilated at death and to denying that Christ exercises rule over the dead before they are resurrected. Calvin’s view is supported by Paul’s affirmation that nothing separates the believer from the love of God—not even death (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.35-39">Rom 8:35-39</a>). The biblical teaching that upon death the believer “sleeps” (<a href="?bref=1Thes.4.14">1 Thes 4:14</a>) is interpreted to mean that the dead no longer communicate with the living on earth and no longer engage in labor, but are in repose. To “fall asleep in Jesus” is thus to enjoy the presence of Jesus in a disembodied state, the nearest analogy of which in present experience may be found in dreaming when the awareness of the dreamer does not depend upon the functioning of any of the bodily senses.</p>
<p>A third focus for Christian thought has been on whether or not a person’s eternal state is fixed at the time of death, or whether repentance and spiritual growth and purgation are possible or inevitable after death. It is the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church that death is followed by purgatory for all who are imperfect. In purgatory the soul is freed from the remnants of sin, and the period of purgation may be lessened by the gifts, prayers, and masses of those who survive the deceased. Such a view is rejected by most Protestants as being inconsistent with the biblical teaching on the complete and finished work of Christ (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.28">Heb 9:28</a>), on the impossibility of one human being meriting or otherwise gaining grace for another (<a href="?bref=Luke.17.10">Lk 17:10</a>), and on the biblical teaching that the eternal state of the soul is determined by its condition at death (<a href="?bref=Heb.9.27">Heb 9:27</a>).</p>

Joseph pretended to need an interpreter to speak to his brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.23">Gn 42:23</a>). Also, dreams needed to be interpreted (<a href="?bref=Gen.40.8">Gn 40:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.41.15-16">41:15-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-49">Dn 2</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.4.6-9,18-24">4:6-9, 18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.5.7-8,12-17">5:7-8, 12-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.7.16">7:16</a>).

  <title>Isaac</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ISAAC</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Abraham and Sarah, father of Jacob and Esau, one of the patriarchs of Israel.</p>
<p>The name Isaac has an interesting etymology. It is the Anglicized form of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">Yitshaq</span><span class="ital">,</span> in Greek <span class="greek">Isaak</span><span class="ital">.</span> If taken as an imperfect form, it means “he laughs”; as a perfect form, it means “he laughed.” Scholars have debated this problem and also the absence of an antecedent subject. If God is implied, the name could indicate divine amusement at an aged couple ridiculing the prospect of having a child (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">Gn 17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.12">18:12</a>) and then suddenly becoming parents, as God had promised.</p>
<p>Isaac’s pedigree is also interesting, for Sarah was not only the wife of Abraham but also his half sister (<a href="?bref=Gen.20.12">Gn 20:12</a>), and this fact alone may have interfered with conception in their earlier years. Because of this relationship, Isaac belonged to both sides of Terah’s family. According to prevailing custom, the son of the legal wife took precedence over the male offspring of concubines, so that Isaac had priority of inheritance over Ishmael. The gifts that Abraham subsequently gave to the sons of his concubines (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.6">25:6</a>) were without prejudice to the inheritance of Isaac.</p>
<p>Following God’s instructions (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.10-14">Gn 17:10-14</a>), Isaac was circumcised on the eighth day as a member of the covenant community. The next ceremony came when he was old enough for weaning, probably around three years old. In eastern countries where this procedure is still observed, the child’s transition from milk to solid protein and carbohydrates is normally celebrated in the context of a feast. During the celebration the mother chews a mouthful of solid food and then pushes it into the baby’s mouth with her tongue. The infant is often so shocked by this treatment that it promptly expels the food, whereupon the mother repeats the process. For an observer the procedure can be hilarious, and Ishmael may have been laughing at such a spectacle when he incurred Sarah’s wrath (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.8-10">21:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>During the years of Isaac’s adolescence, Abraham was living in Philistine territory (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.34">Gn 21:34</a>). The supreme test of the father’s faith and obedience came in this period. Having watched this son of God’s promise grow up into a healthy young man, Abraham is asked by God to offer him as a sacrifice. Isaac was familiar with sacrificial rituals and helped with the preparations, though probably not without some misgivings, for he was also familiar with the patriarchal traditions that gave the head of the family power of life or death over everyone and everything in the family. If he voiced any protest as he lay bound on the sacrificial altar, it is not recorded. When Abraham’s faith did not waver, God intervened at the crucial moment and provided another offering in the form of a ram. Because of his obedience, God promised Abraham great blessing, blessing in which Isaac also participated (<a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-24">Gn 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.25.11">25:11</a>). It was this act of faith and obedience that Paul honored centuries later by calling Abraham the forefather of the Christian church (<a href="?bref=Rom.4.1-25">Rom 4</a>).</p>
<p>After Sarah’s death (<a href="?bref=Gen.23.1-20">Gn 23</a>), Abraham set about securing a bride for Isaac, as it was the custom for parents to arrange marriages for their children. Rather than have Isaac marry a local pagan woman, Abraham sent his household steward to Nahor in Mesopotamia to seek a bride for his son from among his relatives. In an account that emphasizes faith, perseverance, and divine blessing, <a href="?bref=Gen.24.1-67">Genesis 24</a> describes how the servant met Rebekah and betrothed her to Isaac even before he had met the rest of her family. Bethuel, her father, and Laban, her brother, assented to this arrangement, and she left with the family’s blessing to take up her new responsibilities in Palestine as Isaac’s wife.</p>
<p>When Abraham died at a ripe old age, Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.8-9">Gn 25:8-9</a>). Isaac was now patriarch of the family. He pleaded with God that his wife, Rebekah, might bear children, and as a result, she bore twin sons, Esau (“the hairy one”) and Jacob (“supplanter”). Esau became a hunter, and Isaac favored him, while Jacob was more of a settler and agriculturalist and was favored by his mother. Jacob was also crafty and took advantage of Esau’s extreme hunger one day, bargaining with his older brother to exchange his birthright for some lentil stew. Possession of the birthright secured for Jacob a double portion of the inheritance (<a href="?bref=Deut.21.17">Dt 21:17</a>).</p>
<p>When famine gripped the land, God instructed Isaac not to visit Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.2">Gn 26:2</a>), but to stay in Palestine, where he would enjoy great prosperity. When the men of the area asked about Rebekah, Isaac became fearful and said she was his sister. When the deception was uncovered, Abimelech the king rebuked Isaac and forbade anyone to interfere with him. Isaac prospered so greatly that Abimelech finally asked him to relocate, so he moved to Beersheba, where there was sufficient water for his flocks, and his fortune increased.</p>
<p>Although Esau was Isaac’s favorite son, he displeased his father by marrying two Hittite women. When Isaac felt that the end of his life was approaching, he wanted to bless his firstborn in the traditional patriarchal manner (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.1-46">Gn 27</a>). Rebekah overheard his instructions to Esau, and she encouraged Jacob to deceive the blind old man by disguising himself as Esau and taking his brother’s blessing. The deception succeeded, and Isaac gave Jacob the blessing of the firstborn. When Esau appeared to receive his blessing he was too late, and he was very bitter against Jacob because of what had happened. Rebekah sent Jacob away to her brother Laban in Mesopotamia, to escape Esau’s anger and also to obtain a wife. Esau did receive a blessing from Isaac, but a lesser one. Two decades later a rich and prosperous Jacob returned with his family. He made peace with Esau before Isaac died, and the brothers buried Isaac in Hebron (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.27-29">Gn 35:27-29</a>).</p>
<p>Isaac is given less prominence in the patriarchal narratives than Abraham or Jacob, but his importance for covenantal faith was recognized in such NT passages as <a href="?bref=Acts.7.8">Acts 7:8</a>, <a href="?bref=Rom.9.7">Romans 9:7</a>, <a href="?bref=Gal.4.21-31">Galatians 4:21-31</a>, and <a href="?bref=Heb.11.9-20">Hebrews 11:9-20</a>.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">ISAIAH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophet during the reigns of the Judean kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah; author of the biblical book of Isaiah. Isaiah was the son of Amoz (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.1">Is 1:1</a>) and may have been a relative of King Amaziah. Growing up in Jerusalem, Isaiah received the best education the capital could supply. He was also deeply knowledgeable about people, and he became the political and religious counselor of the nation. He had easy access to the monarchs and seems to have been the historiographer at the Judean court for several reigns (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.22">2 Chr 26:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.32.32">32:32</a>).</p>
<p>Isaiah’s wife is referred to as a prophetess (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.3">Is 8:3</a>) and they had at least two sons, Shear-jashub (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.3">7:3</a>) and Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.3">8:3</a>). Isaiah’s customary attire was a prophet’s clothing, that is, sandals and a garment of goat’s hair or sackcloth. At one point during his ministry, the Lord commanded Isaiah to go naked and barefoot for a period of three years, (wearing only a loincloth) (<a href="?bref=Isa.20.2-6">20:2-6</a>). This must have been humiliating in a society that measured status by meticulous dress codes.</p>
<p>Isaiah worked to reform social and political wrongs. Even the highest members of society did not escape his censure. He berated soothsayers and denounced wealthy, influential people who ignored the responsibilities of their position. He exhorted the masses to be obedient rather than indifferent to God’s covenant. He rebuked kings for their willfulness and lack of concern.</p>
<p>Isaiah’s writings express a deep awareness of God’s majesty and holiness. The prophet denounced not only Canaanite idolatry but also the religious observances of his own people that were external ceremonies only and lacking sincerity (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.10-17">1:10-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.29.13">29:13</a>). He preached impending judgment on the idolatrous Judeans, declaring that only a righteous remnant would survive (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.13">6:13</a>).</p>
<p>Isaiah foretold the coming of the Messiah, the “peaceful prince,” and the ruler of God’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-11">11:1-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.9.6-7">9:6-7</a>). He also depicted this Messiah as a suffering, obedient servant (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.3-12">53:3-12</a>). Isaiah was preeminent among the prophets for the variety and grandeur of his imagery. His imagination produced forceful, brilliant figures of speech.</p>
<p>Isaiah prophesied during the last three decades of the northern kingdom of Israel but because he lived in Jerusalem, in Judah, he made little direct reference to Israel. However, when that kingdom fell, Judah lay open to conquest by Assyria. Isaiah advised King Ahaz to avoid foreign entanglements and depend on God to protect his people. Ignoring that advice, Ahaz made an alliance with Assyria.</p>
<p>It was Hezekiah, Ahaz’s pious son, who sought to remove Judah from this dangerous situation. When the Assyrians under Sennacherib approached Jerusalem, Isaiah inspired Hezekiah and the Judeans to rely on the Lord for the city’s defense, and “the angel of the Lord” destroyed Sennacherib’s army (<a href="?bref=Isa.37.36-38">37:36-38</a>), securing a short period of peace for Hezekiah and the Judeans.</p>
<p>Hebrew prophecy reached its pinnacle with Isaiah, who was greatly esteemed in both OT and NT times. One indication of that esteem is the collection of apocryphal literature associated with his name.</p>

<p class="fl">The prophet Isaiah, whose name means “the Lord saves,” lived and ministered in Jerusalem. Because of his repeated contact with the kings of Judah, some scholars believed that Isaiah was related to the royal family, but this is not certain. According to chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-25">7</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.8.1-22">8</a>, Isaiah was married and had at least two sons, Shear-jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, whose symbolic names illustrated God’s dealings with the nation as a whole. The “disciples” mentioned in <a href="?bref=Isa.8.16">8:16</a> probably assisted Isaiah in his ministry and may have helped him record the book that bears his name.</p>
<p>When Isaiah saw the Lord in the famous temple vision described in chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">6</a>, he was willing to go wherever God sent him, even though he would face strong opposition (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.9-10">6:9-10</a>). King Ahaz proved to be particularly resistant to Isaiah’s advice (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.4-17">7:4-17</a>), and the people in general ridiculed his preaching (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.10-12">5:10-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.28.9-10">28:9-10</a>). During the reign of the godly Hezekiah, however, Isaiah’s ministry was much appreciated, and the king consulted him eagerly during times of crisis (<a href="?bref=Isa.37.1-7,21-35">37:1-7, 21-35</a>).</p>
<p>Isaiah is usually regarded as the greatest of the writing prophets. Some of the chapters in his book display an unparalleled literary beauty and make use of poetic devices and a rich variety of symbols. Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a> contain many powerful passages that underscore the grandeur of the book. It is ironic, then, that many scholars attribute these chapters to a “second” or “third” Isaiah, unknown authors who wrote much later than Isaiah in connection with the Babylonian exile. Yet elsewhere in the OT, the names of all who wrote the prophetic books are preserved, and it would be most unusual for the Jews not to know who wrote such magnificent prophecy as chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Since many of the events recorded in chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.1.1-39.8">1–39</a> took place during the ministry of Isaiah, most of these chapters were probably written by about 700 <span class="era">BC</span> or shortly thereafter. The destruction of the Assyrian army in 701 <span class="era">BC</span> represents the climax of the first half of the book, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="?bref=Isa.10.16,24-34">10:16, 24-34</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.30.31-33">30:31-33</a>. In <a href="?bref=Isa.37.38">37:38</a> Isaiah refers to the death of King Sennacherib, which did not occur until 681 <span class="era">BC</span>. This means that some of the earlier chapters, along with <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a>, were probably written later, during Isaiah’s retirement years. A gap of several decades could help account for the change in subject matter that is found in the last half of the book. In these chapters Isaiah projects into the future as he addresses the Jews who would be in exile in Babylon about 550 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Isaiah’s public ministry occurred primarily from 740–700 <span class="era">BC</span>, a period marked by the rapid expansion of the nation of Assyria. Under King Tiglath-pileser III (745–727 <span class="era">BC</span>), the Assyrians moved to the west and south, and by 738 <span class="era">BC</span> the Assyrian monarch was demanding tribute from Damascus and Israel. About 734 <span class="era">BC</span> Rezin of Damascus (Syria) and Pekah of Israel organized a coalition to rebel against Assyria, and they tried to enlist the support of King Ahaz of Judah. But Ahaz refused to join, and when the kings of Damascus and Israel invaded Judah (see <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1">7:1</a>), Ahaz appealed directly to Tiglath-pileser for help (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.7-9">2 Kgs 16:7-9</a>). With little hesitation the Assyrians returned to capture Damascus and to turn the northern kingdom of Israel into an Assyrian province.</p>
<p>The puppet king Hoshea ruled over Israel from 732–723 BC but was imprisoned when he joined a revolt against Shalmaneser V, the new Assyrian king. Shalmaneser besieged the capital city of Samaria, which finally fell in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, spelling the end of the northern kingdom. Sargon succeeded Shalmaneser in 722 and had to quell a number of revolts. In 711 <span class="era">BC</span> Sargon captured the Philistine city of Ashdod in a campaign that became the occasion of Isaiah’s prophecy of chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.20.1-6">20</a>.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="IsaiahScroll"/>
<p>Even more important was the widespread rebellion that broke out with the accession of Sennacherib in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>. King Hezekiah of Judah withheld his normal tribute payment, and by 701 <span class="era">BC</span> Sennacherib had invaded Palestine to punish the rebels. The details of this campaign are given in <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-37.38">Isaiah 36–37</a> and tell how city after city was captured by the Assyrians before the invaders stood at the gates of Jerusalem and demanded total surrender. With almost no hope of survival, Hezekiah nevertheless was encouraged by Isaiah to trust God, and in one night the angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers, virtually wiping out Sennacherib’s army (<a href="?bref=Isa.37.36-37">Is 37:36-37</a>).</p>
<p>In an effort to befriend the enemies of Assyria, Hezekiah showed his treasures to envoys of the king of Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-4">39:1-4</a>). Isaiah warned that someday the Babylonian armies would conquer Jerusalem and carry off those very treasures, along with the residents of the city (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.39.5-7">5-7</a>). Not only did Isaiah predict the Babylonian captivity of 586–539 <span class="era">BC</span> (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.6.11-12">6:11-12</a>), but he also foretold that Israel would be released from Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.20">48:20</a>). The Chaldean kingdom led by Nebuchadnezzar would be God’s instrument of judgment upon Judah, but they too would suffer defeat. One of Isaiah’s most remarkable prophecies was the naming of Cyrus, king of Persia, the ruler who would conquer the Babylonians in 539 <span class="era">BC</span> and release Israel from exile (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.44.28">44:28</a>). Along with the Medes (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.13.17">13:17</a>), Cyrus won several important victories before sending his troops against Babylon. Isaiah hailed him as one anointed by the Lord to bring deliverance for Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.45.1-5">45:1-5</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="LiteraryUnity">Literary Unity</p>
<p class="fl">Largely because of the references to the later kingdoms of Babylon and Persia, the unity of Isaiah has been called into question. Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a> move abruptly into the exilic period of 550 <span class="era">BC</span>, almost 150 years after Isaiah lived. Moreover, the Servant of the Lord plays a prominent role in these chapters and the messianic king fades into the background. Brilliant poetic passages are found in chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-31">40</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">53</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.55.1-13">55</a>, and <a href="?bref=Isa.60.1-22">60</a>, demonstrating remarkable depth and power.</p>
<p>Although these factors are sometimes cited as a sign of disunity, there are actually strong indications for unity in the book. For example, the historical interlude (chs <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">36–39</a>) forms a hinge or bridge that links chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.1.1-35.10">1–35</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a>. Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-37.38">36–37</a> complete the Assyrian section, and chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.38.1-39.8">38–39</a> introduce the Babylonian material. Most of the linking chapters are written in prose, while the others (in some translations) are largely poetry. From the standpoint of verbal or stylistic unity, one can point to Isaiah’s favorite title for God, “the Holy One of Israel.” This title appears 12 times in chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.1.1-39.8">1–39</a>, and <a href="?bref=Isa.14.1-32">14</a> times in chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a>, but only seven times in the rest of the OT. A study of the famous Servant Songs of <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a> reveals several ties with earlier passages, especially in chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.1.1-6.13">1–6</a>. The servant who is smitten and wounded (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.4-5">53:4-5</a>) receives the same punishment as the beaten and injured nation of <a href="?bref=Isa.1.5-6">1:5-6</a> (also cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.52.13">52:13</a> with <a href="?bref=Isa.2.12">2:12</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1">6:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalTeaching">Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Isaiah is to the OT as the book of Romans is to the NT—a book filled with rich theological truth. Like Romans, Isaiah unveils the sinfulness of God’s rebellious people and his gracious provision of salvation. Because God is the Holy One of Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.4">1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.3">6:3</a>), he cannot ignore sin but must punish those who are guilty. Both Israel (<a href="?bref=Isa.5.30">5:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.42.25">42:25</a>) and the other nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.11,17,20">2:11, 17, 20</a>) experience a time of judgment known as the Day of the Lord. In anger God raises his hand against his people (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.5.25">5:25</a>), but ultimately his wrath is poured out upon Babylon and the nations (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.13.3-5">13:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.2">34:2</a>).</p>
<p>With the fall of Assyria and Babylon, the Day of the Lord becomes a day of joyous victory (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.27">10:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.2">61:2</a>). According to <a href="?bref=Isa.63.4">Isaiah 63:4</a>, it is the year of the Lord’s redemption. Earlier, Israel had been redeemed from slavery in Egypt; now the return from the Babylonian captivity brings equal joy (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.9">52:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">61:1</a>). The ultimate redemption is to be accomplished through the death of Christ, and <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a> describes our Lord’s suffering and death in graphic terms. His ministry as the Suffering Servant is also introduced in <a href="?bref=Isa.49.4">49:4</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.50.6-7">50:6-7</a>; meanwhile, <a href="?bref=Isa.49.6">49:6</a> states that the servant will be “a light for the Gentiles.” Looking ahead to the Second Coming, Isaiah predicts a messianic age of peace and righteousness. Nations will “beat their swords into plowshares” (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.4">2:4</a>) and the “Prince of Peace” will rule forever (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6-7">9:6-7</a>).</p>
<p>Throughout the book God is pictured as the all-powerful Creator (<a href="?bref=Isa.48.13">48:13</a>)—the sovereign One seated on a throne, high and exalted; the King, the Lord Almighty (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.1,5">6:1, 5</a>). He controls the armies of the earth (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.4">13:4</a>) and removes rulers as he wills (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.23-24">40:23-24</a>). Before him, nations “are but a drop in the bucket” (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.15">40:15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), and compared with him all idols are worthless and without power (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.29">41:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.44.6">44:6</a>). This is the God who shows his fury to his foes and his love to his servants (<a href="?bref=Isa.66.14">66:14</a>).</p>

<p class="h3">Messages of Judgment and Hope (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.1-12.6">1–12</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the opening chapter Isaiah characterizes Israel (including Judah) as “a sinful nation” that has rebelled against God. Although the people regularly bring offerings to him, their worship is hypocritical, an attempt to mask their oppression of the poor and helpless. The Lord encourages the nation to repent of their sin or face the fires of judgment. After this introduction, Isaiah turns to describe the peace of the messianic age in <a href="?bref=Isa.2.1-4">2:1-4</a>. The day will come when all nations will obey God’s word and live at peace. “The mountain of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>”—Jerusalem—will be raised up “and all the nations shall flow to it” (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-3">2:2-3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). In the meantime, however, both Israel and the nations have exalted themselves against the Lord, and he will judge them in an awesome display of power. For Israel, God’s judgment will bring great upheaval, including the loss of its leaders. Defiant and ruthless, the rulers will face either death or deportation. Chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.3.1-26">3</a> ends by denouncing the pride and vanity of the women of Zion; they, too, will suffer disgrace. After Jerusalem is cleansed of its sin, the remnant will enjoy the rule of “the branch of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>,” who will protect and shield his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.2-6">4:2-6</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Isa.5.1-7">5:1-7</a> Isaiah presents a short song about Israel as God’s vineyard. The Lord did everything possible to ensure a yield of good grapes, but the vineyard produced nothing but bad fruit and had to be destroyed. Isaiah then pronounces six woes against Israel, and announces that the Assyrian army will invade the land. Against the backdrop of Israel’s sin, Isaiah (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">6</a>) gives an account of the vision through which he was called as a prophet. Overwhelmed by the holiness of God and by his own sinfulness, Isaiah thought he was ruined, but when he was assured that his sins were forgiven, he responded positively to God’s call in spite of the stubbornness of the nation to which he was sent.</p>
<p>One of the most stubborn individuals in all the nation was King Ahaz of Judah, and chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-25">7</a> describes Isaiah’s encounter with this godless ruler. When Ahaz was threatened by Damascus and the northern kingdom, he refused to believe Isaiah’s promise that God would protect him. This was the occasion on which Isaiah gave Ahaz the sign of Immanuel (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">7:14</a>). The “virgin” refers ultimately to Mary and “Immanuel” to Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.23">Mt 1:23</a>), but in the near fulfillment the child could be Isaiah’s own son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.3">Is 8:3</a>). (<span class="ital">See</span> four interpretations of this passage in <a href="?item=VirginBirthofJesus_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Virgin Birth of Jesus</a>.) This name (meaning “swift to plunder and quick to spoil,” v <a href="?bref=Isa.8.1">1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg) would be a sign that soon Judah’s enemies would fall; “Immanuel” signified that God would be with Judah (v <a href="?bref=Isa.8.10">10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). However, if Ahaz appealed for help to the king of Assyria, Isaiah warned him, Assyria’s powerful armies would one day invade Judah also (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.7.17-25">7:17-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.8.6-8">8:6-8</a>). The destruction brought by Assyria would plunge Judah into a time of famine and distress (<a href="?bref=Isa.8.21-22">8:21-22</a>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the gloom and darkness associated with the Assyrian invasion would not last indefinitely, and <a href="?bref=Isa.9.1-5">9:1-5</a> speaks of a time of peace and joy. Verses <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-7.25">6-7</a> introduce a child who would become a righteous King and would rule forever. This “Prince of Peace” is the Messiah, the “Mighty God” whose kingdom is described in <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">2:2-4</a>.</p>
<p>For the immediate future, however, both Israel and Judah will suffer the agony of war as punishment for their sins. God is angry with his people because they are proud and arrogant, and their leaders disregard the pleas of the poor and needy. Civil war and foreign invasion will crush the hapless nation (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.8-10.4">9:8–10:4</a>). But once Israel has been judged, God will turn his hand against Assyria, the instrument he has used to judge other nations. Because of her string of victories, Assyria is filled with pride and is eager for more triumph. Yet even at the moment when Jerusalem is about to succumb, God will cut down the Assyrian army like a cedar in Lebanon and spare his people (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.26-34">10:26-34</a>).</p>
<p>After Assyria’s defeat, Isaiah describes the restoration of Israel and the powerful rule of the Messiah (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-16">11</a>). Both Jews and Gentiles will be attracted to Jerusalem to enjoy an era of peace and justice. Like David, the Messiah will have the Spirit of God resting upon him as he judges the wicked and protects the needy. To conclude these opening messages, Isaiah offers two short songs of praise that celebrate God’s past deliverance and his promise of future blessing (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.12.1-6">12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Oracles against the Nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.1-23.18">13–23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Although Babylon is not the major power of the day, Isaiah begins his announcements of judgment with two chapters about the destruction of Assyria’s neighbor to the south. Babylon will eventually conquer Jerusalem (between 605 and 586 <span class="era">BC</span>), but the Medes (<a href="?bref=Isa.13.17">13:17</a>) along with the Elamites will capture Babylon (539 <span class="era">BC</span>). In spite of the glory to be achieved by future kings of Babylon, God will bring their pomp down to the grave (<a href="?bref=Isa.14.9-10">14:9-10</a>). The chapter ends with short prophecies against Assyria and the Philistines.</p>
<p>One of Israel’s oldest enemies was the nation of Moab, situated east of the Dead Sea. Even though it was a small country, Isaiah devotes two chapters to these descendants of Lot. Chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.15.1-9">15</a> describes the extensive mourning that will overwhelm their cities. After a brief interlude urging the Moabites to submit to Israel and to her God (<a href="?bref=Isa.16.1-5">16:1-5</a>), Isaiah notes that pride will lead to Moab’s downfall. Sounds of weeping fill the land as the vines and fields wither and are trampled.</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.17.1-14">17</a> the fourth oracle is directed against Damascus and Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel), probably reflecting their alliance against Judah about 734 <span class="era">BC</span>. Both nations will face ruin, and Ephraim is condemned for abandoning the Lord, her “Savior” and “Rock” (<a href="?bref=Isa.17.10">17:10</a>).</p>
<p>In chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.18.1-7">18</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.19.1-25">19</a> Isaiah turns to the south and addresses Ethiopia and Egypt, countries that had strong links from 715–633 <span class="era">BC</span>, when an Ethiopian named Shabako became pharaoh in Egypt. But Egypt is plagued with disunity and suffers greatly at the hands of Assyrian kings. In spite of the supposed wisdom of her leaders, Egypt faces economic and political ruin (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.5-15">19:5-15</a>). Yet the time is coming when the Egyptians will be restored and will worship the God of Israel. Along with Assyria and Israel, Egypt will become a blessing (<a href="?bref=Isa.19.24">19:24</a>). Some interpreters think this is a prophecy of the salvation of Gentiles during the church age, but others relate this day to the peace of the millennial age (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.2.2-4">2:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.6-9">11:6-9</a>). For the immediate future, however, Isaiah announces that Assyria will take many Egyptians and Ethiopians into captivity (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.20.1-6">20</a>).</p>
<p>A second oracle about Babylon (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.13.1-14.23">13:1–14:23</a>) is contained in chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.21.1-17">21</a>, and Isaiah is staggered as he considers the impact of Babylon’s fall (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.3-4">21:3-4</a>). When Babylon collapses, the world will know that her gods were powerless (<a href="?bref=Isa.21.9">21:9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.14.8">Rv 14:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.18.2">18:2</a>).</p>
<p>Although it seems out of place among these oracles against the nations, chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.22.1-25">22</a> condemns the city of Jerusalem. Like the nations, Jerusalem is full of revelry (<a href="?bref=Isa.22.2">22:2</a>) but will soon experience the terrors of a siege. Since the people no longer rely on the Lord (v <a href="?bref=Isa.22.11">11</a>), he will hand them over to the enemy. Jerusalem’s unfaithfulness is exemplified by Shebna, a high official guilty of pride and materialism whose position will be taken by the godly Eliakim (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.22.15-23">15-23</a>).</p>
<p>The last oracle (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.23.1-18">23</a>) is directed against the city of Tyre, which resisted capture until Alexander the Great conquered the island fortress in 332 <span class="era">BC</span>. When Tyre fell, the economy of the entire Mediterranean world was shaken, for her ships had carried the goods of the nations far and wide.</p>
<p class="h3">Final Judgment and Blessing (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.1-27.13">24–27</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section functions as a grand finale to chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.13.1-23.18">13–23</a> in that it anticipates God’s judgment upon the nations and the inauguration of the kingdom of God. A defiled earth must bear its punishment (<a href="?bref=Isa.24.5-6">24:5-6</a>) and even the forces of Satan face judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.24.21-22">21-22</a>).</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.25.1-12">25</a> Isaiah rejoices over God’s great triumph and looks ahead to a day when death will be swallowed up and tears will be wiped from all faces (<a href="?bref=Isa.25.8">25:8</a>). Israel’s longtime enemies, symbolized by Moab, will be laid low (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.25.10-12">10-12</a>), but Jerusalem will be a stronghold for the righteous (<a href="?bref=Isa.26.1-3">26:1-3</a>). In <a href="?bref=Isa.26.7-19">26:7-19</a> the nation prays that these promises will become a reality. Verses <a href="?bref=Isa.20.1-21.27">20-21</a> indicate that the Lord will indeed respond, pouring out his wrath upon a sin-cursed earth and upon Satan himself (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.1">27:1</a>). When that takes place, Israel will be a fruitful vineyard, a blessing to the whole world (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.2-6">27:2-6</a>; contrast <a href="?bref=Isa.5.1-7">5:1-7</a>). First, however, Israel will have to endure war and exile, and then the remnant will return to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h3">A Series of Woes (<a href="?bref=Isa.28.1-33.24">28–33</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Returning to his own historical period, Isaiah pronounces a series of woes upon both the northern and southern kingdoms, as well as one upon Assyria (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.33.1-24">33</a>). Chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.28.1-29">28</a> begins with a description of the fading power of Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom. Verses <a href="?bref=Isa.7.1-10.11">7-10</a> portray the leaders of Judah in the same light; they have disregarded Isaiah’s message and are out of touch with God. Judgment is on the way, and their false preparation (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.7.15,18">15, 18</a>) will be of no avail. God will fight against Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.7.21-22">21-22</a>), and even Jerusalem will be put under siege until God in his mercy intervenes (<a href="?bref=Isa.29.1-8">29:1-8</a>). Because of their hypocritical worship, the people deserve to be punished, but in the future Israel will again acknowledge the Lord and be made physically and spiritually whole (<a href="?bref=Isa.29.17-24">29:17-24</a>).</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.30.1-33">30</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.31.1-9">31</a> denounce Judah’s proposed alliance with Egypt in the effort to thwart Assyria. God wants his people to trust him, not their unreliable neighbors to the south. The Lord promises to protect Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.18">30:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.31.5">31:5</a>) and defeat the invading Assyrian army (<a href="?bref=Isa.30.31-33">30:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.31.8-9">31:8-9</a>). None can stand before his mighty sword.</p>
<p>Continuing on this positive note, Isaiah goes on to emphasize the righteous rule of the messianic king in chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.32.1-20">32</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.33.1-24">33</a>. Zion will enjoy peace and security at last (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.2,17-18">32:2, 17-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.33.6">33:6</a>), a great change from Isaiah’s own time. In eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> Judah the women might feel secure (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.9">32:9</a>), but the Assyrian troops will devastate the crops and precipitate widespread mourning. However, the lamenting will soon end, as the prophet pronounces woe upon Assyria in <a href="?bref=Isa.33.1">33:1</a>. After Isaiah prays for the destruction of Assyria (<a href="?bref=Isa.33.2-9">33:2-9</a>), God promises to take action (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.33.10-12">10-12</a>). Gone will be the enemy soldiers and officials, for the Lord will save his people and bring them justice and security.</p>
<p class="h3">More Judgment and Blessing (<a href="?bref=Isa.34.1-35.10">34–35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section forms a climax to chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.28.1-33.24">28–33</a>. Once more, cataclysmic judgment precedes a time of blessing and restoration. In chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.34.1-17">34</a> Isaiah depicts a judgment of cosmic dimensions as he moves to a consideration of the last days. Heaven and earth endure the wrath of God that is poured out upon the nations, and verse <a href="?bref=Isa.34.4">4</a> provides the basis for John’s description of the great tribulation in <a href="?bref=Rev.6.13-14">Revelation 6:13-14</a>. Edom (like Moab; see <a href="?bref=Isa.25.10-12">Is 25:10-12</a>) represents a world judged by the sword of the Lord in his day of vengeance.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.35.1-10">35</a>, on the other hand, speaks of joy and restoration in a passage that pulsates with life. A blooming desert corresponds to the physical and spiritual age when God will come to redeem his people. Both the return of the Israelites from the Babylonian captivity and the second coming of Christ fit this glorious scene.</p>
<p class="h3">Historical Interlude (<a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">36–39</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">These chapters form the hinge that connects the two halves of the book. Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-22">36</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.37.1-38">37</a> contain the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecies about Assyria’s collapse, and chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.38.1-22">38</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-8">39</a> introduce the Babylonian captivity that forms the backdrop for chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-66.24">40–66</a>. In 701 <span class="era">BC</span> King Sennacherib of Assyria demands the unconditional surrender of Jerusalem. He sends his field commander to address the people and try to gain their submission. With persuasive words, the commander tries to convince the city that surrender is the best policy. Amazingly the people do not panic, and King Hezekiah asks Isaiah to pray for the beleaguered city. The prophet does so and announces that the proud Assyrians will not triumph. Instead, they suffer a terrible disaster as the angel of the Lord strikes down 185,000 men.</p>
<p>Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.38.1-22">38</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.39.1-8">39</a> relate another crisis in Hezekiah’s life when he becomes desperately ill. Miraculously, God heals him, and Hezekiah praises the Lord for his gracious intervention. When the king of Babylon sends envoys to congratulate Hezekiah on his recovery, Hezekiah foolishly shows these messengers his royal treasures. Isaiah solemnly announces that someday the armies of Babylon will capture Jerusalem, plunder the land, and take away these treasures.</p>
<p class="h3">The Return from Babylon (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.1-48.22">40–48</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Babylonian captivity eventually comes, but Isaiah promises that it will end. God, the incomparably powerful Creator, is far greater than any king, nation, or god, and he will bring his people back to Jerusalem. To accomplish this return from exile, God raises up Cyrus, the king of Persia (<a href="?bref=Isa.41.2,25">41:2, 25</a>). The Lord does not forget his people, and he encourages them to take heart and to rejoice.</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-25">42</a> we are introduced to a person even more significant than Cyrus the Persian. Verses <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-7">1-7</a> (the first of four Servant Songs) describe the servant of the Lord, who will bring justice to the nations and will be “a light for the Gentiles” (<a href="?bref=Isa.42.6">42:6</a>). This is the Messiah, and the redemption he will accomplish on Calvary (cf. ch <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">53</a>) is greater than the release from Babylon. In light of the good news associated with the servant, Isaiah praises the Lord for punishing the wicked and rescuing his wayward people. Chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.43.1-28">43</a> declares that nothing will stand in the way of Israel’s return, and the Lord will remember their sins no more. In fact, he will pour out his Spirit on their descendants (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.3">44:3</a>).</p>
<p>A God so great is far more powerful than any idol. In <a href="?bref=Isa.44.6-20">44:6-20</a> Isaiah makes use of satire to show the worthlessness of man-made images. God alone has the power to create and to restore, and he will bring Cyrus on the scene to effect the release of the exiles and to begin the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.46.1-13">46</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.47.1-15">47</a> contrast the God of Israel and the idols of Babylon. When God raises up Cyrus, Babylon’s idols will be unable to save their nation, and the queen of kingdoms (<a href="?bref=Isa.47.5">47:5</a>) will collapse along with her sorcerers and astrologers. The final chapter in this section (ch <a href="?bref=Isa.48.1-22">48</a>) restates God’s purpose of gaining release of the Israelites from Babylon through his chosen ally, Cyrus of Persia.</p>
<p class="h3">Salvation through the Servant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-57.21">49–57</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-53.12">49–53</a> contain the final three Servant Songs (cf. also <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1-7">42:1-7</a>), culminating in the death of the servant for the sins of the world (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>). In the second Servant Song (<a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-7">49:1-7</a>), Isaiah describes the call and ministry of the servant, noting that he will face strong opposition as he accomplishes salvation for Israel and the nations. The rest of chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.49.1-26">49</a> deals primarily with the way God will bring Israel back from exile. Soon the land will be filled with a mighty throng (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.49.19-21">19-21</a>), and the Gentiles will acknowledge Israel and her God (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.49.22-23">22-23</a>).</p>
<p>Although Israel has fully deserved the exile because of her sins (<a href="?bref=Isa.50.1-3">50:1-3</a>), the suffering endured by the servant (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.50.4-11">4-11</a>; the third Servant Song) is wholly undeserved. The beating and mocking of verse <a href="?bref=Isa.50.6">6</a> are prophetic of Christ’s experience (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.27.26,30">Mt 27:26, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.19">Mk 15:19</a>). In verses <a href="?bref=Isa.50.10-11">10-11</a> of <a href="?bref=Isa.50.1-11">Isaiah 50</a> the whole nation is challenged to trust in the Lord, as the servant did. There is, in fact, a believing remnant who obey the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.51.1-8">51:1-8</a>), and the Lord promises that he will restore them to their homeland. Israel has drunk the cup of God’s wrath (vv <a href="?bref=Isa.51.17,22">17, 22</a>), but the good news of release from exile causes even the ruins of Jerusalem to burst into songs of joy (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.7-10">52:7-10</a>).</p>
<p>Yet the best news of all is salvation from sin; the final Servant Song (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-53.12">52:13–53:12</a>) tells how Christ wins freedom for those held in bondage to sin. In this brief passage we learn how Christ suffers rejection (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.3">53:3</a>) and even disfigurement (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.14">52:14</a>). Led like a lamb to the slaughter (<a href="?bref=Isa.53.7">53:7</a>), he carries our sins in his body as he dies in ignominy. The people think he is suffering for his own sins (v <a href="?bref=Isa.53.4">4</a>), but he is “pierced” and “crushed for our iniquities” (v <a href="?bref=Isa.53.5">5</a>). The first and last paragraphs of this section (<a href="?bref=Isa.52.13-15">52:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.53.10-12">53:10-12</a>) state that through his suffering the servant is highly exalted. What seems like a terrible defeat is actually victory over death and Satan and brings salvation for many.</p>
<p>As a direct result of the servant’s death, great joy comes to all people. In chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.54.1-17">54</a> this joy is reflected in Jerusalem’s new status as the Lord’s wife. Her descendants will be numerous and eager to learn from the Lord. For the first time the plural “servants of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” appears (<a href="?bref=Isa.54.17">54:17</a>), apparently including all believers, whether Jew or Gentile (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.65.8-9,13-15">65:8-9, 13-15</a>). Joy and prosperity also characterize chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.55.1-13">55</a>, an invitation to a great spiritual banquet. All people are urged to turn to the Lord who keeps his promises to Israel. In <a href="?bref=Isa.56.1-8">56:1-8</a>, foreigners are invited to come to God’s “holy mountain” in Jerusalem, for the temple will be a house of prayer for all the nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.56.7">56:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.21.13">Mt 21:13</a>).</p>
<p>Believing Gentiles are contrasted sharply with unbelieving Jews, and in <a href="?bref=Isa.56.9-57.13">56:9–57:13</a> Isaiah returns again to the theme of judgment. Israel suffers because her leaders are wicked and because the people are guilty of idolatry. Spiritual healing is available, but unless individuals repent, they cannot be part of the remnant who will return from exile and enjoy peace in the Promised Land.</p>
<p class="h3">Ultimate Blessing and Final Judgment (<a href="?bref=Isa.58.1-66.24">58–66</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The last nine chapters of Isaiah emphasize redemption and glory, but the reality of judgment is also very much in evidence. In fact, chapters <a href="?bref=Isa.58.1-14">58</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.59.1-21">59</a> bemoan the sins of Israel. The people are hypocritical in their worship; they are selfish and fail to keep the Sabbath. Lying, oppression, and murder separate the people from God. When Isaiah openly confesses these sins (<a href="?bref=Isa.59.12-13">59:12-13</a>), the Lord suddenly takes action on behalf of his people. Like a mighty warrior, he rescues the believing remnant from Babylon and brings them back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.60.1-22">60</a> the glory and wealth of Jerusalem reach new heights. Both the city and the sanctuary are adorned with splendor, matching the prosperity of Solomon’s reign. Just as the nations treated Solomon with honor, so earth’s leaders will assist and strengthen the returning exiles. While it is true that the Persian government did help the Jews repeatedly, the conditions described here will have their ultimate fulfillment during the Millennium and in connection with the new Jerusalem (cf. <a href="?bref=Rev.21.23">Rv 21:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.5">22:5</a>). The ancient ruins will be rebuilt (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.4">Is 61:4</a>), and the Lord will fulfill the covenant made with Abraham and David (<a href="?bref=Isa.61.8">Is 61:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.55.3">Is 55:3</a>). Jerusalem will be the city of the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Isa.62.12">Is 62:12</a>), and the Lord will take delight in her (v <a href="?bref=Isa.62.4">4</a>).</p>
<p>In order to accomplish salvation for his people, God will have to judge the ungodly first. The great trampling of the winepress (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.2-3">63:2-3</a>) graphically portrays the judgment process and is linked with the Day of the Lord (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.13.3">13:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.34.2">34:2</a>). Since God has promised to intervene on behalf of his people, Isaiah prays for the realization of that promise (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.7-64.12">63:7–64:12</a>). He recalls God’s faithfulness in the past and pleads that he will again have mercy upon his suffering people.</p>
<p>The answer to Isaiah’s prayer is found in chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.65.1-25">65</a>. God does promise to give the Holy Land back to his servants, to those who worship him and obey him. But for that segment of the nation that continues in its obstinacy, God promises anguish and destruction. The ultimate joy of God’s servants is contained in a description of new heavens and a new earth (<a href="?bref=Isa.65.17-25">65:17-25</a>). Peace, long life, and prosperity will be among the blessings enjoyed in an era that seems to combine features of the Millennium and the eternal state (cf. ch <a href="?bref=Isa.60.1-22">60</a>).</p>
<p>In a fitting summary, chapter <a href="?bref=Isa.66.1-24">66</a> ties together the themes of salvation and judgment. God will comfort Jerusalem and abundantly bless her, but sinners are the objects of his wrath. Those who honor him will endure forever, but those who rebel will suffer everlasting rejection.</p>

<p class="h1">ISHMAEL</p>
<p class="list">1. Abraham’s first son, born of Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian handmaid, at the instigation of Sarah herself. God promised to make a great nation of the childless Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2">Gn 12:2</a>), assuring him that his son would be his heir (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.4">15:4</a>). But when Sarah was past 75 years old and still barren, she invoked the custom whereby a childless wife gave her maid to her husband as concubine and laid claim to the offspring of their union (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.1-2">16:1-2</a>). When Hagar conceived, the reproach attendant on barrenness prompted the maid to behave contemptuously toward her mistress, and with Abraham’s consent Sarah dealt harshly with her and she fled. An angel sent Hagar back to submit to her mistress and promised her a son to be named Ishmael meaning “God hears” (<a href="?bref=Gen.16.9-11">16:9-11</a>). The boy was born near Hebron when Abraham was 86 years old (<a href="?bref=Gen.13.18">13:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.16.16">16:16</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Abraham and Sarah received him as the son of God’s promise, as attested by their disbelief when the forthcoming birth of Isaac was announced (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.17">17:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.18.12">18:12</a>), and by Abraham’s subsequent wish that Ishmael should be accepted of God (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.18">17:18</a>). At age 13 he participated in the institution of circumcision as a witness of God’s covenant with Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.9-14,22-27">17:9-14, 22-27</a>), and the Lord promised to make Ishmael the father of 12 princes, from which would come a great nation, though the covenant was to be established with Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.20-21">17:20-21</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is no evidence that Ishmael was out of favor until Isaac’s weaning at about three years of age. When Sarah saw Ishmael “making fun” of her son Isaac, she determined that the son of a slave woman should not be heir with her son Isaac, and she demanded that Ishmael and Hagar be banished. Although vexed, Abraham received reassurance from the Lord and sent them away with some provisions. It was then clear to Abraham that Isaac, not Ishmael, was the son of God’s promise.</p>
<p class="list-text">Hagar survived in the wilderness with the guidance of an angel, and Ishmael became a hunter of wild animals. He settled in the wilderness of Paran and married an Egyptian woman (<a href="?bref=Gen.21.20-21">21:20-21</a>). Little else is recorded of him, except that he lived to assist in the burial of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.9-10">25:9-10</a>), gave his daughter Mahalath in marriage (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.9">28:9</a>), and died at the age of 137 (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.17">25:17</a>). The names of his 12 sons and their settlements are recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.25.13-16">Genesis 25:13-16</a>. In subsequent history, a caravan of Ishmaelite traders (also called Midianites, cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.8.22-24">Jgs 8:22-24</a>) bought Joseph from his brothers and sold him in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-28">Gn 37:25-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.39.1">39:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Though Isaac, rather than Ishmael, inherited the covenantal blessings, it is clear that the covenant was not the only means whereby divine favor could be bestowed. Abraham and Sarah overestimated the importance of Ishmael in God’s plan by mistaking him for the heir of covenant promises, but they also underrated God’s intentions for him by excluding him altogether from inheritance with Isaac.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the NT, Paul alludes to Ishmael while urging the Galatians not to see the law as a yoke (<a href="?bref=Gal.4.22">Gal 4:22</a>). He states that those who trust the law instead of putting their faith in God’s promises do not inherit the kingdom, just as the son of the slave woman did not receive inheritance with the son of the free woman (v <a href="?bref=Gal.4.30">30</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family of Zedekiah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.25">2 Kgs 25:25</a>). He was prompted by Baalis, king of the Ammonites, to assassinate Gedaliah, Judean governor of the puppet regime, which Nebuchadnezzar left behind at Mizpah at the time of the Babylonian exile. Gedaliah ignored advance warning of the plot and refused to allow Johanan to assassinate Ishmael first (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.14-16">Jer 40:14-16</a>). While sharing a meal with Gedaliah, Ishmael and ten companions killed him, along with the Babylonian troops accompanying him. The next day he persuaded a group of 80 pilgrims passing from the north to the temple at Jerusalem to enter Mizpah, where he killed all but 10 who ransomed their lives with stores of food. Hiding all the bodies in a cistern, Ishmael took captive the rest of the population of Mizpah, including Jeremiah and women of the royal family, and set out to join the Ammonites. But Johanan, with an armed force, overtook Ishmael at Gibeon and rescued the captives, whereupon Ishmael fled to Ammonite territory (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.1-18">Jer 41</a>).</p>
<p class="list">3. Son of Azel, a Benjamite of the family of Saul (<a href="?bref=1Chr.8.38">1 Chr 8:38</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.9.44">9:44</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">The story of Israel begins with Abraham, whom God called first at Ur, and perhaps later at Haran (<a href="?bref=Acts.7.2-4">Acts 7:2-4</a>), to leave Mesopotamia and go into a land to which God would direct the way. In calling Abraham, God made with him a covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.1-3">Gn 12:1-3</a>) that promised him a land, special divine favor (“I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse,” <span class="sc">nasb</span>), and the privilege of being a channel of blessing to the entire world (“In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed,” <span class="sc">nasb</span>). In <a href="?bref=Gen.12.4-8">Genesis 12:4-8</a> God confirmed this unconditional covenant, promising Abraham this new land forever, along with innumerable descendants. Subsequently, in <a href="?bref=Gen.15.1-21">Genesis 15:1-21</a>, God again confirmed the covenant but added the significant prediction that the guarantee of holding Canaan in perpetuity did not mean occupation of the land in every generation. God also spelled out the limits of the Promised Land (from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, some 500 to 600 miles or 804 to 965 kilometers in extent). A final confirmation of the covenant to Abraham appears in <a href="?bref=Gen.17.6-8">Genesis 17:6-8</a>. It guaranteed the land of Canaan to Abraham’s posterity and added that kings (an anticipation of the Davidic dynasty) would arise in his line. The covenant was confirmed to Abraham’s son Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.3-5">Gn 26:3-5</a>) and his grandson Jacob (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.28.1-22">28</a>).</p>
<p>This period is known as the patriarchal age in Hebrew history. The patriarchs were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They were called patriarchs because they were fathers, not only to their immediate families, but also to the extended family of Hebrews, over which they exercised a fatherly control. They served as political, legal, and spiritual heads of their migratory community, looking after their interests and leading them in worship. Periodically they built altars on which they offered sacrifices. That the patriarchal community was very large can be seen from <a href="?bref=Gen.14.14">Genesis 14:14</a>, which says that Abraham had 318 armed men in his camp. If one assumes that most of the men were married and had one or more children each, the total extended family may have numbered in excess of 1,000.</p>
<p>Additional developments in the life of Abraham and Jacob were particularly important for world history. Abraham, frustrated at not having an heir, accepted Sarah’s suggestion to obtain an heir by the slave girl Hagar. (This was also the custom of the land.) The son born was named Ishmael, progenitor of the Arabs. Thus Abraham is revered by Arabs and Muslims as well as by Jews and Christians. He is the father of the Jews through his son Isaac, child of promise. He holds a special place in Christianity as an example of Christ, through whom all Christians obtain their salvation.</p>
<p>Jacob, a scheming scoundrel in his earlier years, wound up in exile in northern Mesopotamia for 20 years in the home of his uncle Laban. There he married Leah and Rachel and fathered the sons who became the progenitors of the 12 tribes of Israel. On his return to Palestine he met God along the banks of the Jabbok River (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.1-32">Gn 32</a>), and God changed his name to Israel (“a prince of God,” <span class="sc">kjv</span> mg).</p>
<p>The patriarchal period in Canaan lasted for 215 years. One estimate places Abraham’s entry into Canaan at about 2085 <span class="era">BC</span>, when he was 75 years of age. Jacob and his sons migrated to Egypt to escape a severe famine in Canaan in about 1870 <span class="era">BC</span>. During much of the patriarchal period, Palestine experienced a decline in population and was occupied largely by nomadic or seminomadic tribes. It was relatively easy for the Hebrews to enter such a situation. After 1900 Palestine began to enjoy more settled conditions. Shortly thereafter, the Hebrews made the trek into Egypt.</p>
<p class="h2" id="SojourninEgypt">Sojourn in Egypt</p>
<p class="fl">If Jacob and his sons entered Egypt about 1870 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was the period of the Middle Kingdom. And by that time other migrants from Asia were coming in increasing numbers. The Hebrews settled in Goshen, in the eastern delta region, under the protecting care of Joseph, who held a position at the Egyptian court roughly equivalent to that of prime minister. As more and more Asiatic Hyksos came into Egypt, they began to take over the country—northern Egypt at least. During this same time the Hebrews became increasingly numerous. Some who hold to a different chronology believe the Hebrews were welcomed into Egypt during the days of Hyksos domination (after 1750 <span class="era">BC</span>). At any rate, by about 1580 <span class="era">BC</span> native Egyptian princes regained control of the country and expelled many of the Asiatics.</p>
<p>In process of time there arose a king over Egypt who “knew not Joseph” (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.8">Ex 1:8</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>). Very possibly this meant that a native Egyptian dynasty had arisen in Egypt and they were apprehensive over the fact that the growing numbers and wealth of the Hebrews might jeopardize their own supremacy. But Egyptian measures to subjugate the Hebrews and reduce their birthrate had a reverse effect (<a href="?bref=Exod.1.12">Ex 1:12</a>). Finally, the Egyptians ordered the killing of all male Hebrew infants at birth. Among those who disobeyed were the parents of Moses, who set him afloat in a waterproof basket made of reeds. Found by a daughter of Pharaoh, he was brought up in the Egyptian court, was given a first-class education, and became a high official of the realm.</p>
<p>At the age of 40, Moses identified himself with his own people. He killed an Egyptian in defense of a fellow Hebrew, and immediately fled to the land of Midian in the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula. He married and lived there for 40 years, becoming thoroughly familiar with the geography and the ways of the wilderness through which he would later lead the Hebrews. The Egyptians continued to oppress the Hebrew people severely until they cried urgently to God for deliverance. In response, God confronted Moses in the famous burning bush experience and called on him to return to Egypt and lead the people back into the land of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-4.31">Ex 3–4</a>). He was to have the help of his brother, Aaron.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheExodus">The Exodus</p>
<p class="fl">Understandably the pharaoh of Egypt was reluctant to permit the Hebrews to leave permanently. The value of this great labor force was incalculable. But finally, after suffering a series of ten plagues, lasting perhaps a year, the Egyptians were persuaded to let the Hebrews go (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-12.51">Ex 7–12</a>).</p>
<p>The plagues had a theological as well as a practical purpose. They discredited the gods of Egypt and exalted the most high God of heaven (<a href="?bref=Exod.12.12">Ex 12:12</a>). The plagues clearly discredited specific gods of Egypt (e.g., the Nile was worshiped as Hapi, plague one; the frog, worshiped as Heqt, plague two; the bull, worshiped as Ptah, plague five; the sun, worshiped as Amon-Re/Aton, plague nine). Taken together, they struck a direct blow at the Egyptian pantheon.</p>
<p>Just before the last plague, which was the night in which the death angel invaded the homes of the Egyptians, the Israelites made the Passover sacrifice according to divine instructions. This involved killing a lamb for each household (unless the household was too small; in that event, households could combine). Anyone who was careless about applying the blood to the doorpost or who rejected this divine provision came under the judgment of God. After the death of the firstborn throughout the land, the Egyptians begged the Hebrews to leave. Their company numbered 600,000 men over 20 years of age, plus women and children, for a total of over 2,500,000. In addition they took their flocks and herds and personal belongings.</p>
<p>The date they left Egypt is a matter of continuing debate. Traditionally a date of about 1446 <span class="era">BC</span> is given for the exodus (cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kgs 6:1</a>, which places the exodus 480 years before construction of the temple started in 966 <span class="era">BC</span>) and 1406 <span class="era">BC</span> for the Conquest under Joshua, and there do not seem to be any compelling arguments for rejecting that position. But a great many scholars prefer 1275 <span class="era">BC</span> for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>The early date of the exodus would place the later years of the wilderness wanderings and the subsequent conquest of Palestine during the reigns of Amenhotep III and IV (1412–1366), a time when the pharaohs allowed Egyptian control of Palestine to disintegrate. When the Egyptians did reassert their power, about 1300, they restricted their movements largely to the coastal area, and thus did not come in contact with the Hebrews who were living in the hill country of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee.</p>
<p class="h2" id="WildernessWanderings">Wilderness Wanderings</p>
<p class="fl">The wilderness wanderings were an important interlude in the history of Israel. During those years, significant and basic institutions came into existence at God’s command. At Sinai, Moses delivered to Israel the law, the pattern of the tabernacle (which later became the model for the temple) and orders for its operation, as well as detailed instructions for the priesthood and sacrificial system of worship.</p>
<p>The period of the wanderings was truly a remarkable time. The presence of God was evidenced by a pillar of cloud that hovered over the people by day and a pillar of fire by night. God provided food in the form of manna, periodically provided water by miraculous means, and made sure that clothes did not wear out. In spite of all that, the people murmured and complained continually.</p>
<p>At Sinai, God gave the law (<a href="?bref=Exod.19.2-24.18">Ex 19:2–24:18</a>), and the people promptly made a commitment to keep it (<a href="?bref=Exod.24.3">24:3</a>). Then God gave the pattern for the tabernacle and its furniture (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.25.1-27.21">25–27</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.30.1-31.18">30–31</a>, <a href="?bref=Exod.35.1-40.38">35–40</a>) and established the priesthood (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.28.1-29.46">28–29</a>). While Moses was on the mountain receiving God’s revelation, the people grew restless and clamored for gods they could see. Even Aaron was carried away with the idolatrous wave and supervised the casting of a golden calf and building of an altar before it. The fact that they turned to Egyptian cattle worship so readily indicates that paganism must have made deep inroads among them while in captivity (chs <a href="?bref=Exod.32.1-34.35">32–34</a>). Moses’ intercessory response to God’s announcement that he would destroy Israel because of her idolatry led to a divine determination to execute judgment on only the worst offenders (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.9-14">32:9-14</a>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, God revealed the legal and priestly order (<a href="?bref=Lev.1.1-27.34">Lv 1:1–27:34</a>). Among the divinely appointed institutions described or alluded to in Leviticus are several special days or feasts, including the Sabbath, Passover, Feast of Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost or Feast of Weeks, Feast of Trumpets, Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles, the Year of Sabbath, and the Year of Jubilee.</p>
<p>After camping at Sinai for about a year, the Israelites got their orders to go forward (<a href="?bref=Num.10.11-12">Nm 10:11-12</a>). Miriam (Moses’ sister) and Aaron criticized Moses’ leadership and suffered divine punishment as a consequence (ch <a href="?bref=Num.12.1-16">12</a>). When the people arrived at Kadesh-barnea, the gate to southern Palestine, they were frightened by the report of most of the spies who had been reconnoitering in Canaan and decided that they should not advance into Canaan. They called for a new leader to bring them back to Egypt. God declared that the entire generation would wander in the wilderness until the adults had died. Only Joshua and Caleb (the two spies in favor of invading immediately) would enter the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.14.26-30">14:26-30</a>). Near the end of the period of wandering, Moses also lost the privilege of entering the land by an act of disobedience.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheConquest">The Conquest</p>
<p class="fl">The latter part of the book of Numbers describes how Moses led the Israelites to victory over the peoples living east of the Jordan River. Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh requested permission to settle there and reluctantly were allowed to do so on the condition that they would join the rest of the Israelites in conquering Canaan before settling down. Prior to victories in Transjordan, a new census of adult males was taken in order to determine the military capabilities of Israel and to provide a basis for equitable division of the land they were about to enter. The number of males above 20 years of age was 601,730 (<a href="?bref=Num.26.51">Nm 26:51</a>). The book of Deuteronomy consists primarily of a series of speeches delivered by Moses in a covenant renewal ceremony on the plains of Moab just before his death and the appointment of Joshua as leader.</p>
<p>Joshua lost no time in moving forward. Spies sent across the Jordan to Jericho to reconnoiter reported a situation quite different from what the Hebrews had experienced at Kadesh-barnea a generation earlier. Now the people of Canaan were terrified because they had heard of the numerical strength and victories of the Hebrews. Apparently the day after the spies returned, Joshua moved the people to the edge of the Jordan and prepared to cross over. The waters parted for them here as the Red Sea had parted earlier.</p>
<p>The narrative of conquest that appears in the book of Joshua is not a detailed battle account. It describes a thrust into the middle of Palestine around Jericho and Ai, a southerly drive to defeat the Amorite league, and a northern campaign against Hazor and other towns. The history of Joshua is extremely telescoped, for Joshua’s major military action must have required about six years. Joshua’s friend Caleb was 79 when the Conquest began and 85 after the last great battle with Jabin, king of Hazor (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.7-10">Jos 14:7-10</a>).</p>
<p>When the war was over, major strongholds (e.g., Jerusalem) still remained in enemy hands, but the land west of the Jordan was allocated to the nine and a half Hebrew tribes. The task of reducing enemy towns was left to the individual tribes in whose land they were located. The Joshua account was not so much a narrative of Israelite battle prowess as of God’s faithfulness and intervention on behalf of his people. For example, at Jericho they did not attack but merely followed divine orders and watched the defenses collapse; at Gibeon hailstones killed more Amorites than Israelite soldiers did (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.7-11">Jos 10:7-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheJudges">The Judges</p>
<p class="fl">Joshua died some 30 years after he had led the Hebrews into Canaan, and he was followed by a series of divinely appointed leaders who ruled sometimes over the whole of Israel as a loose confederacy and sometimes over one or more tribes. They were judges, civil functionaries, and military leaders all at the same time.</p>
<p>The book of Judges pictures a series of recurring cycles: apostasy from God, punishment in the form of oppression by neighboring tribes, cries to God for relief, release from bondage under the leadership of a judge, and a period of rest from oppression.</p>
<p>Establishment of the chronology of the judges is one of the thorniest problems of Scripture. Adding up all years of oppression and rest mentioned in the book gives a total of 410. The book of Acts gives a total of 450 years from the days of Joshua to Samuel (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.19">Acts 13:19</a>). The difference in Acts may be accounted for by the addition of 40 years of Eli’s ministry (<a href="?bref=1Sam.4.18">1 Sm 4:18</a>). Allowing 410 years for the period of the judges, about 30 for the Conquest to the judges, and 40 for the wilderness wanderings, means 480 years from 1050 <span class="era">BC</span>, the date for Saul’s kingship, and would give a date of about 1530 for the exodus. This is about 100 years more than even the early date for the exodus. The most probable explanation is that there is some overlap in oppressions and judgeships. For instance, the activities of Jephthah were centered on the eastern frontier, those of Samson in the Philistine plain to the southwest, and those of Deborah and Barak in the north.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheUnitedMonarchy">The United Monarchy</p>
<p class="fl">Because of the weakness of Israel resulting from political disunity and the ineptness and corruption of both Eli’s and Samuel’s sons, the people of Israel called for a king to rule over them. This demand was in reality a rejection of the divine plan of theocracy—the rule of God. God granted the Hebrews’ wish but warned them of the disadvantages of monarchy (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.9-21">1 Sm 8:9-21</a>). The concept of kingship was not new to Israel. It had been hinted at in <a href="?bref=Gen.49.10">Genesis 49:10</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Numbers 24:17</a>, and Moses had made some very clear statements about it in <a href="?bref=Deut.17.14-20">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>.</p>
<p>The first stage of Hebrew monarchy is commonly called the united monarchy because all Israel was ruled by a single king. This period lasted for 120 years—encompassing the 40-year reigns of Saul (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.21">Acts 13:21</a>), David (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.5">2 Sm 5:5</a>), and Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.42">1 Kgs 11:42</a>).</p>
<p>The people asked for a king, and God granted them one, but not one like those of the surrounding nations. The Hebrew king was to be a man who followed God’s dictates in his public and private life, who did not intrude into the affairs of the priesthood, and who did not fall into idolatry, but exerted all his influence to keep the people faithful to God. If he failed in any of these respects, he ran the risk of being deposed by God, of having his line brought to an end, or even of having the people fall into captivity to a foreign power. All this must be kept in mind when evaluating the reigns of Saul, David, Solomon, and the kings of the divided monarchy.</p>
<p>Saul began well. He won a great victory over the Ammonites at Jabesh-gilead and showed considerable wisdom in administrative matters. But after about two years he intruded into the priest’s office to offer sacrifice, bringing the divine prediction that his kingdom would be taken from him (<a href="?bref=1Sam.13.8-14">1 Sm 13:8-14</a>). He would go on to enjoy great military victory and ability as a ruler until about the middle of his reign.</p>
<p>After Saul’s disobedience to God’s command to totally destroy the Amalekites, the Lord repudiated Saul and instructed Samuel to anoint David privately as future king of Israel. David’s rise to prominence was spurred by his victory over Goliath and the accompanying defeat of the Philistines. Saul later made David commander of the army, and the young man soon earned a reputation greater than that of the king himself. Saul, who had become increasingly mentally disturbed after his relationship with God was broken, began to make attempts on David’s life, and for the last years of Saul’s reign David lived as a fugitive. Meanwhile, the Philistines got completely out of control and finally killed Saul and most of his sons in the great battle of Mt Gilboa, which gave the Philistines control over much of Palestine west of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-7">1 Sm 31:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>Soon David became king in Judah with his capital in Hebron. A son of Saul, Ishbosheth, established himself at Mahanaim, east of the Jordan. For seven years the two tiny kingdoms existed side by side (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.2-11">2 Sm 2:2-11</a>). But after the Israelite king and his army commander were assassinated, David became ruler of a united Hebrew kingdom.</p>
<p>Not long after the beginning of his reign (1010–970 <span class="era">BC</span>) David completely defeated and subjugated the Philistines. Soon thereafter he captured Jerusalem, making it the capital of the united kingdom. During succeeding years, David built up an empire (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.10">2 Sm 8:10</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.1-19.19">1 Chr 18–19</a>), conquering Moab, Edom, Damascus, Zobah, and Ammon, so he controlled territory from the Gulf of Aqaba (a branch of the Red Sea) and the Sinai in the south almost to the Euphrates in the north. Moreover, he established good relations, if not an alliance, with Tyre. The establishment of David’s empire was possible because of a power vacuum in the Middle East. The Egyptians, Mycenaeans, Hittites, and Assyrians were either decadent or removed from the stage of history. The Phoenicians, a peaceful commercial people, were also free to expand their trade, and they were happy to sell cedar to David for his palace and the temple.</p>
<p>Without doubt, David was Israel’s greatest king. Jerusalem came to be known as the city of David. When the king wanted to build the temple as God’s house, God replied that his son should do it instead. But God would in a very real sense build David’s house; he made a covenant with David, promising him that his house (dynasty, kingdom, throne) would be established forever (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sm 7</a>). Christ, the infinite One who came from the line of David, alone was capable of fulfilling this divine promise (see <a href="?bref=Luke.1.31-33">Lk 1:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.2.29-36">Acts 2:29-36</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.32-39">13:32-39</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.15.14-17">15:14-17</a>).</p>
<p>Like other Oriental monarchs, David fell into the practice of keeping a harem. Scripture names 8 wives and 21 children and refers to other wives and concubines. Such a situation opened the door to family rivalries and questions about succession to the throne. Two sons, Absalom and Adonijah, made a try for the throne, but both efforts were squelched. Solomon, son of David’s favorite wife, Bathsheba, became the next king.</p>
<p>Solomon (970–930 <span class="era">BC</span>) was a man of peace and a builder of palaces, cities, fortifications, and the temple. He fortified cities all over his realm and outfitted cities for his chariot corps and cavalry units. With the help of the Phoenicians, he built a seaport and kept a fleet at Ezion-geber, near modern Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba. He greatly enlarged Jerusalem by enclosing the temple area to the north of David’s city and the southwestern hill now known as Zion. His best-known project was the temple, which took seven years to build. Twice the size of the tabernacle, it was built on the same basic plan; it measured 90 feet (27.4 meters) long and 30 feet (9.1 meters) wide and had magnificent appointments. But he also constructed a palace complex that took 13 years to complete. This included an armory, a throne room, the king’s private residence, and a house for the daughter of pharaoh.</p>
<p>Apparently much influenced by the spiritual testimony of David and desiring God’s blessing on his rule, Solomon made a great sacrifice to God at Gibeon near the beginning of his reign. God met him there and offered to grant whatever he might request. Solomon asked for understanding and wisdom to govern God’s people (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.3.9">1 Kgs 3:9</a>). His God-given wisdom is apparent in many administrative decisions and official policies and building plans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Solomon did not show such wisdom in maintaining a harem of 700 wives and 300 concubines or in excessive expenditures that left the state in serious financial straits. He even erected places of worship for his foreign wives, thus subsidizing their idolatries and incurring the wrath of God. In fact, foreign wives and their idolatry proved to be his downfall; before Solomon died, God informed him that for this reason he would divide the kingdom at his death and give most of it to someone other than Solomon’s son. But for David’s sake, God would keep Judah and Jerusalem in the hands of the Davidic line (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.9-13">1 Kgs 11:9-13</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheDividedKingdom">The Divided Kingdom</p>
<p class="fl">After the death of Solomon, the Near East was destined to become a very different place. Israel was no longer in a power vacuum. The Assyrian Empire rose in Mesopotamia, to be followed by the Neo-Babylonian and the Medo-Persian Empires in turn. Egypt was temporarily powerful in the south, but it would later come under control of Assyria and Medo-Persia. These empires exerted great pressure on Israel and dominated one or both of the two Hebrew kingdoms.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="TheDividedKingdom"/>
<p>When Solomon died, his son Rehoboam took the throne and was forced to deal with a rising tide of resentment over the high taxes and economic stagnation of Solomon’s last years. When Rehoboam refused to give relief, all the northern tribes broke away and formed the northern kingdom, Israel, under the leadership of Jeroboam. The southern kingdom, Judah, was left with only the territory of Judah and Benjamin. A total of 20 kings ruled in each of the separate kingdoms. While the north had several dynasties and the reigns of kings were generally short, in the south the dynasty of David continued to rule and the reigns were longer.</p>
<p class="h3">The Northern Kingdom</p>
<p class="fl">The northern kingdom lasted from the division in 930 <span class="era">BC</span> until its conquest by Assyria in 722. Jeroboam, fearing that he would lose the loyalty of the people if they continued to go to Jerusalem to worship, set up a new religion of his own. Instituting calf worship, he built shrines at Dan in the north and Bethel in the south. This idolatry drew the condemnation of God and fulfilled the prediction that Jeroboam’s line would be wiped out. All his successors are said to have followed in his idolatrous steps. Israel found itself at war during much of its history—with Judah, Syria, or Assyria. Jeroboam established his capital first at Shechem and later at Tirzah.</p>
<p>Four other kings of the north require special comment: Omri, Ahab, Jehu, and Jeroboam II. Omri (885–874 <span class="era">BC</span>) must have been an impressive ruler. Generations later, Assyrians still spoke of Israel as the land of Omri. After he had established himself on the throne, he located the permanent capital of the kingdom at Samaria and began the palace complex there. Early in his reign he was successful in conquering Moab, and later he reestablished the good relations with Tyre that existed in the days of David and Solomon. Apparently he established a full alliance and cemented it with the marriage of his son Ahab to Jezebel, a princess of Tyre.</p>
<p>Ahab (874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>) was one of the most significant of Israel’s kings. He and his wife, Jezebel, promoted the vile idolatry of Baal worship with its religious prostitution, arousing the powerful opposition of the prophet Elijah. Ahab was a formidable military man, defeating the Syrians in major campaigns and participating in a coalition that fought the Assyrians to a virtual standstill. He also built extensively at Samaria, Hazor, Megiddo, and other towns, as excavations show.</p>
<p>Jehu (841–814 <span class="era">BC</span>) was God’s agent for punishing the house of Omri and destroying Baal worship in Israel. He did eradicate Baal worship and liquidated literally scores of relatives and court officials of Ahab. But he was so ruthless that he killed off the people who knew how to run the government; subsequently, it did not work well. Jehu also was forced to become a vassal to Assyria.</p>
<p>Jeroboam II ruled during most of the first half of the eighth century (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>) and brought the kingdom to its greatest extent and prosperity. He, with his contemporary Uzziah in the south, ruled most of the land David had once controlled. This was possible because the Assyrians were in a period of decline during most of the first half of the century.</p>
<p>Prophets who were active during the history of the northern kingdom include the nonwriting prophets Elijah and Elisha and the writing prophets Jonah, Amos, and Hosea.</p>
<p class="h3">The Southern Kingdom</p>
<p class="fl">The history of the southern kingdom of Judah was quite different from that of the northern kingdom. The temple was there and so were large numbers of Levites, many of whom came south after the division of the kingdom to protest the idolatry of the north. In addition to this spiritual strength, there was greater political stability and unity, promoted by the fact that only two tribes—Judah and Benjamin—shared power, and all the kings were of the Davidic dynasty. Moreover, eight of the kings were good monarchs. There were also periodic religious revivals. God granted the southern kingdom about 100 more years of existence than the north. But Judah, too, fell into idolatry and went into captivity for her sins.</p>
<p>Rehoboam, the first king in the south, is especially remembered because he refused to listen to wise counsel about fiscal matters and perpetrated the division of the kingdom. He is also remembered for his religious policies. After a good beginning, he allowed apostasy to get out of control and brought the judgment of God in the form of an invasion in his fifth year (926 <span class="era">BC</span>) by Shishak I of Egypt, resulting in extensive plunder and payment of tribute. Thereafter, he launched an extensive program to fortify the realm. Shishak’s invasion did have the effect of producing a partial and temporary spiritual reform, but the general trend of Rehoboam’s reign was downward.</p>
<p>Conditions during the reign of his son, Abijam, were worse, but Asa (910–869 <span class="era">BC</span>) initiated a religious reform that was effective for most of his reign. When threatened by the northern kingdom during his latter years, however, Asa turned to Syria for help instead of to God, and he seems to have defied the prophets of God to his dying day.</p>
<p>Asa’s son Jehoshaphat (872–848 <span class="era">BC</span>) was apparently influenced by his father’s early religious devotion, and his reign was characterized by faithfulness, winning the favor of God. However, he seems to have made a full alliance with Ahab of Israel, which resulted in the marriage of his son Jehoram to Ahab’s daughter Athaliah. This alliance involved Jehoshaphat in almost ruinous joint ventures with Ahab, and later with two of his sons when they became kings of Israel. It also opened the door for the introduction of Baal worship into Judah when Jehoram came to the throne in the southern kingdom. For his sin Jehoram (853–841 <span class="era">BC</span>) suffered internal revolt, invasion, and death from a horrible disease.</p>
<p>After his death, his last remaining son, Ahaziah, ruled less than a year, following the wicked ways of his father. When Ahaziah died in battle, the queen mother, Athaliah, decided to seize the throne for herself and to secure her power by killing off all those in line to the throne. But she missed Ahaziah’s infant son Joash, who was kept hidden in the temple for six years.</p>
<p>When Joash was seven, Jehoiada the high priest arranged his coronation and also the execution of the murderous and idolatrous Athaliah. During his early years when Joash was influenced by good counsel, he did well. But after the middle of his reign (835–796 <span class="era">BC</span>), he began to listen to the princes who wanted to restore idolatry, and conditions deteriorated. Military reversals brought on economic decline and ultimately the king’s assassination.</p>
<p>His son Amaziah (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>) started well with victory over Edom and faithfulness to God. But he, too, fell into idolatry and was totally defeated by the northern kingdom, being held prisoner there. At that point his son Uzziah took over (c. 792 <span class="era">BC</span>) and began a long and generally successful reign. During the several decades that followed, Assyria was in decline, and Uzziah and his contemporary in the north, Jeroboam II, were able to expand Hebrew holdings so that between them they controlled most of the territory Solomon had ruled.</p>
<p>Uzziah (792–740 <span class="era">BC</span>) was able to restore the power of Judah rather quickly after his father’s defeat by Israel. Then he subjugated the Philistines in the southwest and the Ammonites across the Jordan; he strengthened his hold on the Edomites. All during his reign economic conditions improved. But at the height of his power Uzziah foolishly violated the high priest’s prerogatives and offered sacrifice in the temple. For this he was smitten with leprosy; his son Jotham was co-regent during the years 750–740 <span class="era">BC</span>, going on to rule alone for about five more years. Meanwhile, Assyrian power became resurgent.</p>
<p>By and large, Jotham merely carried on the policies of Uzziah. But the administration of his son Ahaz (735–715 <span class="era">BC</span>) was very much affected by the Assyrian threat. Israel and Syria wanted him to join in war against Assyria, but he refused, being pro-Assyrian in sympathy. When Israel and Syria invaded Judah, King Ahaz sent tribute to Assyria and became her vassal in return for protection. This rash course of action was vainly opposed by Isaiah, who was prophet at court (c. 740–700 <span class="era">BC</span>). Contemporaneously, the prophet Micah ministered to the common people of Judah. The pro-Assyrian policy of Ahaz was accompanied by a renewed sympathy for idolatry, and this brought the judgment of God in the form of invasion by Edomites and Philistines and trouble with Assyria. In fact, during this period, Assyria had annexed the northern kingdom (722 <span class="era">BC</span>) and removed many of her people into captivity.</p>
<p>The next king of Judah, Hezekiah (715–686 <span class="era">BC</span>), was greatly sobered by the fall of Israel because of her sins, and he determined to launch a reform in his realm. He was anti-Assyrian too, but he did not dare to discontinue tribute payments and strike for independence until after Sennacherib came to the throne in Nineveh in 705 <span class="era">BC</span>. At first Sennacherib was too preoccupied to attend to Judah, but finally in 701 he invaded. Despite tremendous initial success, he was stopped by a divinely sent plague (<a href="?bref=Isa.36.1-39.8">Is 36–39</a>). Isaiah stood by the king to reassure and sustain him during this emergency.</p>
<p>Hezekiah’s son Manasseh (697–642 <span class="era">BC</span>) ruled longer than any other king of Israel or Judah. Unfortunately, he turned his back on his father’s example and caused the people to fall into gross idolatry (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.9">2 Kgs 21:9</a>). Carried away captive by the Assyrians late in his reign, he repented of his evil and God restored him to his throne; thereafter, he led some reforms. But the land was too steeped in iniquity to be rescued. His son Amon (642–640 <span class="era">BC</span>) reverted to the idolatry he knew in his youth.</p>
<p>The situation was different with Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>), however. Throughout his reign he dedicated himself to reform. He sought to root out idolatry and to restore the temple and its worship. In 622 <span class="era">BC</span> the Book of the Law was found during repair of the temple, and its demands—which had been forgotten—made a great impression on king and people alike. It is certain that Jeremiah and Zephaniah ministered during Josiah’s reign, as did Nahum and Habakkuk (in all probability).</p>
<p>International conditions were now changing rapidly. Assyria was declining, and Nineveh fell to Babylon and the Medes in 612 <span class="era">BC</span>. Three years later Pharaoh Neco of Egypt marched north to aid his Assyrian ally. When Josiah tried to stop him, he was killed in battle.</p>
<p>From this point everything was downhill for Judah. None of the rest of the kings was devout, and political power and economic health rapidly declined. The people put one of Josiah’s sons, Jehoahaz, on the throne. He lasted three months. Pharaoh Neco replaced him with Jehoiakim (609–598 <span class="era">BC</span>), another son of Josiah. In 605 Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated Neco, invaded Judah, and took tribute and hostages from Jehoiakim, including Daniel and his friends (<a href="?bref=Dan.1.1">Dn 1:1</a>). Jehoiakim revolted in 600 <span class="era">BC</span>, but Nebuchadnezzar did not come to deal with him personally until 597 <span class="era">BC</span>. He died before the Babylonians arrived, and his son Jehoiachin came to the throne in 598 <span class="era">BC</span> to rule for only three months before the Babylonians carried him away into exile. Ezekiel was among the many captives taken on that occasion.</p>
<p>The Babylonians then put Zedekiah, youngest son of Josiah, on the throne in 597 <span class="era">BC</span>. When he rebelled, Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem and took the city (587 <span class="era">BC</span>), destroying it and the temple and carrying off large numbers of people. The judgment of God had finally fallen on the Jews for their idolatrous ways.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRestoration">The Restoration</p>
<p class="fl">In judgment God remembered mercy. This is evident in individual lives, when faithful ones like Daniel, Esther, or Nehemiah rose to a position of importance in political life, or as numerous other persons became prosperous in the foreign environment. It is evident on the community level as God moved to protect Hebrew enclaves scattered abroad and to restore an organized society in Palestine.</p>
<p>Among the exiles, Judaism as a way of life separated from its own political system or cultic center and began to emerge. Jews finally turned their backs on idolatry. And without a temple, priesthood, king, or land, they turned to the divine Scriptures as their rallying point and the foundation of their community. During this period they developed the synagogue as a place for fellowship, prayer, and study.</p>
<p>God’s restoration of an organized community to Palestine involved particularly the fortunes of his “anointed” Cyrus (<a href="?bref=Isa.44.28">Is 44:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.1">45:1</a>). Cyrus was a Persian prince who in 559 <span class="era">BC</span> revolted against the dominant dynasty controlling the Median Empire. After consolidating his hold on the throne, he proceeded to conquer Asia Minor and the Chaldean or Neo-Babylonian Empire. As a humane man and a wise administrator, he permitted the captive peoples to return to their homes and rebuild their communities. Cyrus’s decree to the Jews appears in <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">Ezra 1</a> and dates probably to 538 <span class="era">BC</span>. A total of almost 50,000 went back to Judah as a result of this edict (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.64-65">Ezr 2:64-65</a>).</p>
<p>Under the stresses and strains of reestablishment, the people built their houses but got no further than laying the foundation of a new temple. Finally, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah stirred the people to build the house of God (<a href="?bref=Ezra.5.1">Ezr 5:1</a>). They began in the second year of Darius I, the Great (520 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.1.1">Zec 1:1</a>), and completed the work in his sixth year (515 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.6.15">Ezr 6:15</a>).</p>
<p>During the reign of Darius’s son Xerxes (486–465 <span class="era">BC</span>), a plot was hatched to exterminate all the Jews in the Persian Empire, which at that time controlled the lands where Jews lived. Fortunately, Xerxes (Ahasuerus in the book of Esther), in his third year (483 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Esth.1.3">Est 1:3</a>), went searching for a new queen and chose Esther, who managed to preserve her people.</p>
<p>Xerxes’ son Artaxerxes I (465–424 <span class="era">BC</span>) also figured significantly in Jewish history. In his seventh year (458 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7">Ezr 7:7</a>), under the leadership of Ezra, a second contingent of Jews returned to Jerusalem. And in Artaxerxes’ 20th year (445 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=Neh.2.1">Neh 2:1</a>), Nehemiah went to Jerusalem to supervise the rebuilding of the walls of the city. Malachi probably wrote his prophecy to the Jews in Jerusalem during the latter part of Artaxerxes’ reign.</p>
<p>After the fall of Samaria and the captivity of Judah, the Hebrews remaining in the land intermarried with various pagan groups in the area. Their offspring became the Samaritans, a religious and racial admixture. These people had moved into the vacuum left by the destruction of Judah, and naturally they looked with disfavor on an intrusion of Babylonian Jews into an area they had come to call their own. They did all they could to frustrate the efforts of Nehemiah to rebuild the walls. It took all the courage, tact, energy, and persuasiveness Ezra and Nehemiah could muster to prevent the returning Jews from intermarrying with racially mixed people of the land. Such intermarriage would have meant the ultimate absorption and destruction of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>A Samaritan temple was later built on Mt Gerizim (probably during the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>), and it became the center of the Samaritan worship. The hostility between Samaritans and Jews continued on into the NT period (<a href="?bref=John.4.1-54">Jn 4</a>) and exists to the present.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheIntertestamentalPeriod">The Intertestamental Period</p>
<p class="fl">Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire with lightning speed. When the people of Jerusalem threw open their gates in 332 <span class="era">BC</span> and capitulated without a fight, Alexander treated them well. After his death in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, Palestine passed back and forth among his successors until Ptolemy I of Egypt managed to establish control in 301 <span class="era">BC</span>. Thereafter the area remained in Egyptian hands until 198 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Ptolemies were tolerant and granted the Jews considerable autonomy, allowing them to develop their unique culture undisturbed as long as they paid their taxes and remained submissive. Many Jews settled in Alexandria and gradually forgot their Hebrew in the Hellenistic environment. As a result, a translation of the OT into Greek (the Septuagint) was produced there. While the Ptolemies did not force Hellenism on the Jews of either Alexandria or Palestine, many were influenced by Hellenistic ideas.</p>
<p>When Ptolemy V came to the throne as a minor in 203 <span class="era">BC</span>, Antiochus III of Syria took advantage of the weakened Egypt and conquered Palestine (198 <span class="era">BC</span>). Apparently the Jews hoped to gain something from the change and welcomed the Syrians. But their hope was ill-founded. Antiochus III suffered disastrous defeat at the hands of Rome at Magnesia in 190 <span class="era">BC</span>. Syria not only lost much territory but also was forced to pay a huge indemnity. Thereafter, the Jews suffered under great financial burdens, along with other peoples of the empire. The next Syrian king, Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–164 <span class="era">BC</span>), decided to launch an effort to achieve greater internal strength and unity within the empire by forcing, among other things, a greater acceptance of Greek culture and the cult of the divine ruler. Naturally this idolatrous requirement weighed heavily on the monotheistic Jews and incited revolution.</p>
<p>But this does not completely explain the Maccabean revolt against Syria. In 168 <span class="era">BC</span> armed conflict broke out between Jewish factions in Jerusalem. Antiochus IV chose to interpret this as open rebellion and sent an army against the city. His forces demolished part of the city wall and many houses. After this Antiochus decided to suppress Judaism completely, and he dedicated the temple to Zeus and sacrificed swine on the altar. Circumcision, Sabbath observance, and other religious festivals were no longer permitted, and public worship of heathen gods became compulsory.</p>
<p>Some Jews capitulated to Antiochus’s orders or only resisted passively, but a few decided to resist openly. Chief among them were Mattathias and his five sons. After the early death of Mattathias, his son Judas Maccabeus led his forces to victory over the Syrians, regaining the right to restore Jewish worship. The rededication of the temple on December 25, 164 <span class="era">BC</span>, inaugurated the Festival of Hanukkah (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.4.36-59">1 Macc 4:36-59</a>). Subsequently, Jonathan and Simon (other sons of Mattathias) continued the struggle until independence was gained in 142 <span class="era">BC</span>; this was possible in large part because they saw how to take advantage of the increasing weakness of Syrian rulers and the competition for the royal office.</p>
<p>Simon ruled the Jewish state until his assassination in 134 <span class="era">BC</span>, when his son John Hyrcanus (134–104 <span class="era">BC</span>) took over. John Hyrcanus fought successfully in the east, north, and south, gaining land in Transjordan, capturing Shechem and the Samaritan temple on Mt Gerizim, and subjugating the Idumeans in the south, forcing them to adopt Judaism. His son Aristobulus ruled for only about a year (104–103 <span class="era">BC</span>), but he added a portion of Galilee to the kingdom. When he died, his widow married his brother Alexander Janneus (103–76 <span class="era">BC</span>). Janneus carried on almost incessant military action during his reign, and by the time of his death had almost recovered the kingdom of Solomon.</p>
<p>When Janneus died, Alexandra, widow of two kings, took the throne (76–67 <span class="era">BC</span>) and her eldest son, Hyrcanus II, became high priest. Her reign was peaceful and prosperous, but when she died, her sons fell to squabbling. Their appeals to Pompey, who was campaigning in the eastern Mediterranean area, were responsible for Roman interference in the region and conquest of Palestine in 63 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheRomanPeriod">The Roman Period</p>
<p class="fl">After the Romans took over Palestine, Hyrcanus II was confirmed as high priest and was also appointed as ethnarch or political ruler (63–40 <span class="era">BC</span>). But Antipater, father of Herod the Great, was the real power behind the throne, and during many of those years Hyrcanus was virtually unable to function because of the confusion of the Roman civil wars. Antipater was loyal to Rome and saw that Roman policies were carried out; he won Julius Caesar’s favor toward Jews of both Palestine and in the Dispersion.</p>
<p>With the support of Mark Antony, Herod managed to get himself appointed king of Judea by the Roman senate in 40 <span class="era">BC</span>. But a Parthian invasion of Syria and Jewish hatred for the Romans made it possible for Antigonus II, last king of the Maccabean family, to rule for three years (40–37 <span class="era">BC</span>). Finally, Herod ascended his throne in 37 and ruled until 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. As an allied king, Herod proved to be an excellent ruler from the Roman point of view and earned the title of “Great.” He brought some order to regions east of the Jordan and made possible organization of the Roman province of Arabia. He also furthered the cultural plans of Augustus for development of a Greco-Roman civilization throughout the whole empire.</p>
<p>Herod admired Greek culture and contributed to building projects in Rhodes, Antioch, Damascus, Athens, and elsewhere outside Palestine. Within Palestine he rebuilt Samaria and named it Sebaste in honor of Augustus (<span class="greek">Sebastos</span> is Greek for “Augustus”) and also constructed the great port of Caesarea. Probably about as large as Manhattan Island, it became the capital of Roman Palestine. Among his many other building projects, remodeling the temple in Jerusalem was the most famous. Begun in 20 <span class="era">BC</span>, it was not completed until just a few years before its destruction in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>The material splendor of Herod’s reign did not win the affection or support of the Jews, however. Nor did he achieve peace and harmony in his family, among whom there were periodic eruptions of treason, unfaithfulness, and murder. He worried about any threat to his rule and cracked down hard to destroy such threats, as is evident from his slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem after the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Herod controlled Idumea, Judea, Samaria, Galilee, Perea, and the area northeast of the Sea of Galilee. By his last will, his son Archelaus was to rule Idumea, Judea, and Samaria; Antipas, Galilee and Perea; and Philip, the region northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Archelaus was deposed in <span class="era">AD</span> 6, and his territory became a Roman province (<span class="era">AD</span> 6–41) to be ruled by direct appointees of Rome. The best-known of these was Pontius Pilate (<span class="era">AD</span> 26–36), who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus. Antipas was more successful and built a new capital at Tiberias, but he ran afoul of the emperor’s good pleasure in <span class="era">AD</span> 39 and was deposed. Philip was the most effective of the three and ruled until his death in <span class="era">AD</span> 34. Philip’s lands were later given to Herod Agrippa I in <span class="era">AD</span> 37; the holdings of Antipas were then added in <span class="era">AD</span> 39; and in 41 Agrippa also received Samaria, Judea, and Idumea.</p>
<p>Herod Agrippa I (<span class="era">AD</span> 37–44) was the heir of the Maccabees (through his grandmother Mariamne, first wife of Herod the Great), and for this reason had the support of patriotic Jews and of the Pharisees for his observance of divine ordinances. But when he built a new north wall for Jerusalem and dabbled in foreign affairs, he aroused the suspicions of the Romans; when he died in <span class="era">AD</span> 44, they turned the kingdom into a Roman province.</p>
<p>As is clear from the Gospels, several sects had arisen in Palestine by Roman times and were active during the first century. The Zealots opposed Roman rule and advocated armed rebellion. Herodians supported the Herodian family and Roman power. The Pharisees were fanatically devoted to the law and were supernaturalists in theological orientation. They were somewhat content to support Rome if given religious freedom, and they dominated the synagogues of the land. The Sadducees were antisupernaturalists, tended to collaborate with the ruling regime, and were dominant in the temple. Generally speaking, the literature of the intertestamental period and the popular mentality of the time tended to view the Messiah as a political deliverer who would free his people from foreign domination and set up a new independent kingdom.</p>
<p>Roman prefects ruled Palestine from <span class="era">AD</span> 44–66. They had a knack for offending the religious scruples of the Jews and alienating them in other ways. With Felix (<span class="era">AD</span> 52–60) there began a constant tension between Jews and Romans that led to the first Jewish revolt (<span class="era">AD</span> 66–70). While Paul was imprisoned in Caesarea (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.23-24.27">Acts 23:23–24:27</a>) about <span class="era">AD</span> 58–60, riots broke out there between Jews and Gentiles. Festus (<span class="era">AD</span> 60–62; <a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-27">Acts 25</a>) was an able administrator, but the situation was almost out of hand. After he died in office, there was virtual anarchy until his successor, Albinus, arrived (<span class="era">AD</span> 62–64). Totally incompetent and dishonest, Albinus was recalled in 64 and replaced by Florus (<span class="era">AD</span> 64–66). Florus was even worse, resorting to open robbery and bribery until there was no safety or justice in the land. Finally, the Jews could take no more.</p>
<p>The spark that ignited the fires of rebellion was an anti-Semitic act by the Hellenistic population of Caesarea in <span class="era">AD</span> 66. Soon riots spread to numerous cities, and Roman garrisons were massacred in several places. But the Jews were not united, and in Jerusalem armed bands of Jews fought with each other for mastery. Vespasian was chosen to command the Roman army of some 60,000 to deal with the insurrection. He had subjugated most of Palestine by the time he was elevated to the imperial chair in <span class="era">AD</span> 69 (after the death of Nero), and he left his son Titus in charge of completing the operations. In August of <span class="era">AD</span> 70 the walls of Jerusalem were breached, many of the people butchered, and the city and the temple leveled. Masada held out until <span class="era">AD</span> 73. Palestine had been flattened by Roman might. Loss of life and property had been incalculable and indescribable.</p>
<p>On two more occasions the Jews were destined to fight disastrously against the Romans. Under Trajan’s rule a rebellion of Jews broke out in Cyrenaica in <span class="era">AD</span> 115 and spread rapidly to Cyprus, Egypt, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. In the beginning it was an outgrowth of agitation between the Jews and their Hellenistic neighbors, but it developed into a challenge to Roman authority. This was particularly true after the successes of Parthia on Rome’s eastern frontier when there seemed to be some hope of success in throwing off the Roman yoke. Wherever Jews got the upper hand, they perpetrated massacres, and the non-Semitic population retaliated in kind. Trajan ruthlessly suppressed the rebels and restored order everywhere except Egypt; his successor, Hadrian, was left to accomplish that.</p>
<p>But Hadrian faced a new rebellion of his own, brought on by his law forbidding circumcision (which he considered to be inhumane) and his decision in <span class="era">AD</span> 130 to rebuild Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina and erect a temple to Jupiter on the site of the temple of Yahweh. The latter would not only profane the temple site but also would preclude any rebuilding of the Jewish temple.</p>
<p>Leader of this second Jewish revolt was Simeon, prince of Israel, called Bar-Kochba (“Son of the Star”). Both sides fought with such great ferocity for over three years (<span class="era">AD</span> 132–135) that the population of Judea was almost exterminated. Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony, and Jews were forbidden to enter on pain of death. Even as late as the fourth century they were permitted to enter only once a year, on the anniversary of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. After the Bar-Kochba revolt, Judaism retreated increasingly within the citadel of the written and oral law, thus separating itself from the Gentiles.</p>

<p class="fl">Descendant of the 12 sons of Israel (the name God gave to Jacob, <a href="?bref=Gen.32.28">Gn 32:28</a>). As the sons of Abraham, they are distinguished from the Ishmaelites (descended from Abraham by Hagar his concubine), and as sons of Isaac, from the Edomites (descendants of Esau), by having Jacob as their ancestor. They lived in Egypt from the time of Joseph until the exodus, when God led them into Canaan to fulfill his promise to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.17.8">17:8</a>).</p>
<p>God led the Israelites out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the land of Canaan that he had promised them. They were ruled by judges, kings, and conquerors from other countries. In 722 <span class="era">BC</span> the northern kingdom was conquered by Assyria and became incorporated into that empire. After this time, “Israel” refers to members of the southern tribes, Judah and Benjamin. An “Israelite” was one who, religiously as well as politically, belonged to the remnant of the covenant nation of Israel.</p>

<p class="list">1. Jacob’s ninth son, the fifth by his wife Leah (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.17-18">Gn 30:17-18</a>); his name perhaps means “reward.” Jacob, in his final message to his 12 sons says, “Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the sheepfolds” (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.14">49:14</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>); the picture suggested is a loaded donkey who refuses to move his burden, a lazy man who is unwilling to do his share of the work. Little is known about Issachar except what he did along with the other sons of Israel. He had four sons (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.13">46:13</a>), who headed clans in the tribe (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.1-5">1 Chr 7:1-5</a>). His family went with Jacob to Egypt, where they died (although Issachar’s remains were subsequently moved to Shechem with the other 12 patriarchs—<a href="?bref=Acts.7.16">Acts 7:16</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The descendants of Issachar numbered 54,400 at the first census (<a href="?bref=Num.1.29">Nm 1:29</a>), increased to 64,300 at the second (<a href="?bref=Num.26.25">26:25</a>), and to 87,000 during David’s reign (<a href="?bref=1Chr.7.5">1 Chr 7:5</a>). Issachar was the main tribe involved in the fighting led by Deborah, herself a member of the tribe (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.15">Jgs 5:15</a>). During the time of David, there were men of the tribe of Issachar who had understanding of what Israel ought to do in warfare (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.32">1 Chr 12:32</a>). These men supported David as king to replace Saul.</p>
<p class="list-text">Issachar was assigned the fourth lot of land after the ark was taken to Shiloh (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.17">Jos 19:17</a>). This included the cities of Jezreel, Shunem, and En-gannim, and it lay between the mountains of Gilboa and Tabor. Their allotment was bordered on the south and west by the tribe of Manasseh, on the north by Zebulun and Naphtali, and on the east by the river Jordan. This territory was largely a fertile plain and was often threatened by the Canaanites nearby as well as by foreign invaders.</p>

<p class="fl">Tribal inheritance of Issachar. The territory is defined in <a href="?bref=Josh.19.17-23">Joshua 19:17-23</a>; detailed boundary descriptions are not included. On the east its boundary ends at the Jordan. The area can be located by the list of towns encompassed by the inheritance of which Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, Anaharath, Kishion, Remeth, and En-gannim have identifications of varying degrees of certainty. Jezreel and En-gannim are in the southeast corner of the valley of Jezreel; Chesulloth is just west of Mt Tabor; and Shunem is at the foot of the hill of Moreh. The northern border can be deduced from the southern boundaries of Zebulun and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.10-12,33-34">Jos 19:10-12, 33-34</a>). All three areas, that of Issachar, Naphtali, and Zebulun, met at Mt Tabor. On the south side, there were some major towns not conquered in Joshua’s time (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.27">Jgs 1:27</a>) that were taken from Issachar and given to Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.11">Jos 17:11</a>); these included important centers such as Beth-shan, Ibleam, and Tanaach.</p>
<p>In the same territory, there were disturbances among the local tribes (recorded on a stele of Seti I at Beth-shan); the area is called “Mt Yarunta,” after Yarmuth (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.29">Jos 21:29</a>, Jarmuth = Remeth). Issachar was located on the rich plateau stretching east of Mt Tabor and the hill of Moreh and north of the Beth-shan Valley.</p>

<p class="fl">Roman military unit to which the centurion Cornelius belonged. The single biblical reference to a regiment (<span class="sc">nasb</span> “cohort”; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “ band”) is in <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1">Acts 10:1</a>.</p>
<p>The Roman army included auxiliary regiments, most of which seem to have comprised provincial subjects apart from Jews (who were exempted). Such units were sometimes referred to by distinctive names like “Italian” or “Augustan” (Imperial) (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1">Acts 27:1</a>). The Italian Regiment was evidently composed mainly of those who not only were Roman citizens but had been born in Rome. The regiments were made up of six centuries of 100 men, each century commanded by a centurion (in this instance, Cornelius). Ten regiments constituted a legion (6,000 men).</p>
<p>Inscriptions indicate that such an Italian regiment had indeed been stationed in Syria during <span class="era">AD</span> 69–157. This does not rule out an earlier presence in the province; military records are simply not available.</p>

  <title>Italy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">ITALY</p>
<p class="fl">Boot-shaped peninsula located between the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic seas. Uplands and two major mountain ranges—the Alps, which form a northern boundary, and the Apennines, which form the backbone of the peninsula—occupy 77 percent of the land. The plains, which are limited to the Po River valley, cover the remaining 23 percent.</p>
<p>The earliest history of the region is found in the artifacts of the Abbevillian and Neanderthal cultures discovered in many areas, including the site at Rome. With the advent of agriculture (6000 <span class="era">BC</span>), the population increased rapidly. By 3000 <span class="era">BC</span>, large groups of farmers had located in southern Italy along the Mediterranean coast and in northern Italy along the Po Valley. During the third millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, a major culture developed in the central part of the peninsula, influenced by Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations and characterized by agriculture, animal husbandry, and bronzeworking.</p>
<p>During the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, an invasion of Indo-European tribes reshaped the culture of the peninsula. Each area came to be known by the name of the tribe that inhabited it. Among the most important of these tribes were the Latins, who settled in the valley of the Tiber River—an area that came to be known as Latium. According to the historian Antiochus of Syracuse (fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>), it was also during this time (1300 <span class="era">BC</span>) that King Italos ruled the southwest part of the peninsula. This region came to take his name, which, over the next millennium, was extended northward until, in the time of Augustus (27 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 14), the entire peninsula was called “Italy.”</p>
<p>Toward the end of the eighth century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Etruscans, immigrants from Asia Minor, invaded the peninsula and organized the less-civilized Italic tribes into Etruscan-dominated city-states. The result was political chaos. Wars with Greek colonies, wars to throw off Etruscan domination, and wars between city-states dominated the next five centuries. The city-state that benefited the most from this unrest was Rome. By 220 <span class="era">BC</span>, Rome had conquered the entire peninsula and had united all Italy south of the Po Valley under one rule. After a great revolt (90–88 <span class="era">BC</span>), Italians throughout the peninsula obtained the rights of Roman citizenship, and in 49 <span class="era">BC</span> Julius Caesar extended these rights to the inhabitants of the Po Valley. Thus, by NT times, Italy had essentially come to have its present form.</p>
<p>“Italy” appears three times in the NT. Paul has the opportunity to meet Priscilla and Aquila, recently come from Italy because Claudius had expelled the Jews from Rome (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.2">Acts 18:2</a>). Italy is mentioned as Paul’s destination following his appeal to Caesar (<a href="?bref=Acts.27.1,6">27:1, 6</a>). The writer of Hebrews sends greetings to his readers from “those who come from Italy” (<a href="?bref=Heb.13.24">Heb 13:24</a>).</p>

Thereafter, the Itureans virtually drop from sight until Josephus records another defeat inflicted on them by Aristobulus in 105–104 <span class="era">BC</span>, at which time many of them were faced with a choice between circumcision and exile.</p>
<p>There are frequent mentions by classical writers of Itureans, sometimes described as Syrians or Arabians—skilled bowmen with the predatory tendencies often associated with groups unable or unwilling to settle for long in any one area. In view of this, it is not surprising that we know more about Itureans than we do about Iturea.</p>
<p>Strabo speaks of them as inhabitants of a mountainous country; Dio Cassius a little later tells us that they had a king. Any attempt to understand their history is complicated by divisions in the Roman Empire that affected them, but by the end of the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, many Itureans were to be found under the provincial rule of Syria.</p>
<p>It is easier, then, to discuss the people than the place. Some scholars, indeed, hold that Luke could not have used the noun “Iturea,” for this was a form unknown until three centuries later, and that the adjectival form better fits the case. This prompts another question: Was this Iturean territory within Philip’s tetrarchy? Could Luke have made a slip and anticipated a later regional regrouping? Josephus at one point lists the constituent parts of Philip’s tetrarchy without including Iturea.</p>
<p>Three facts are clear: (1) there is a certain flexibility and overlapping in descriptions of territorial demarcation; (2) the data we have is insufficient for exact conclusions about Iturea; and (3) the evidence is clear from other parts of Scripture that Luke is a careful and reliable writer.</p>

  <title>Ivory</title>

<p class="h1">IVORY</p>
<p class="fl">Opaque dentine substance, often mentioned along with precious metals and gems in the Bible and ancient Near Eastern writings. As such, ivory was used for combs, small boxes, jars, and other cosmetic articles; for figurines and amulets; for games; and for the adornment of articles of furniture, buildings, and perhaps even ships (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.6">Ez 27:6</a>). It is frequently mentioned in Egyptian and Assyrian annals of conquest as part of the spoils of war. Some excellent examples of work with ivory can be found in the famed collection of Tutankhamen.</p>
<p>In the Bible ivory is spoken of as the adornment of Solomon’s throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.18">1 Kgs 10:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.17">2 Chr 9:17</a>) and of beds in the time of Amos (<a href="?bref=Amos.6.4">Am 6:4</a>). Both references are probably to ivory inlay. The ivory palaces of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.39">1 Kings 22:39</a>, <a href="?bref=Ps.45.8">Psalm 45:8</a>, and <a href="?bref=Amos.3.15">Amos 3:15</a>, however, may refer to forms of decoration other than inlay. Whether <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.6">Ezekiel 27:6</a> actually implies that ships were decorated with ivory is debatable, since that passage forms part of the whole picture of Tyre as an extravagant ship. The articles of ivory that earth’s merchants can no longer sell to Babylon (<a href="?bref=Rev.18.12">Rv 18:12</a>) include smaller objects of the kind found at various archaeological sites (Megiddo, Samaria, Nimrud).</p>
<p>Originally ivory was available in northern Syria, where Assyrian monarchs hunted elephants. By Solomon’s time, however, it was imported (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.22">1 Kgs 10:22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.9.21">2 Chr 9:21</a>), probably from the east (India) or south (Africa), while the ships of Tarshish may represent the seagoing capability of the ships rather than the source of the ivory. Tyre received its ivory in trade from the “coastlands” (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.15">Ez 27:15</a>).</p>
