<p class="h1">JAAR</p>
<p class="fl">Most common word in Hebrew for “forest.” It refers to forests generally (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.18">Is 10:18</a>) and to specific forests, such as the “forest of Ephraim” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.6">2 Sm 18:6</a>) and the “forest of Hereth” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.5">1 Sm 22:5</a>), both associated with King David. It also occurs as the name of one of Solomon’s buildings, “the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.7.2">1 Kgs 7:2</a>), apparently because of its extensive use of cedar. Only one occurrence of “Jaar” seems to be a proper name. <a href="?bref=Ps.132.6">Psalm 132:6</a> alludes to the transfer of the ark from Kiriath-jearim to Jerusalem. Here it is called the field of Jaar (or “the wood,” <span class="sc">kjv</span>), perhaps a poetic abbreviation.</p>

<p class="h1">JABBOK</p>
<p class="fl">Eastern tributary of the Jordan, the modern Nahr ez-Zerqa or Blue River. Its source is a spring near Amman, capital of modern Jordan (the Decapolis town of Philadelphia in Hellenistic times). From its source the Jabbok loops northeast before swinging west and cutting a valley that, characteristic of the east Jordan tributary streams, deepens into a canyon. It emerges from this ravine near Tell Deir Alla, which may be the ancient Succoth, quiets its flow, and joins the Jordan at ed-Damiyeh, the ancient Adam, some 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of the Dead Sea. The Jabbok ranks next to the Yarmuk, its more northerly companion stream, in the extent of its watershed, a region of well-watered territory blessed with an average rainfall of some 30 inches (76 centimeters) per year. The Jabbok has a fast, strong, perennial flow; over a large portion of its 60-mile (96.5-kilometer) course, the stream averages an 80-foot (24.4-meter) drop over each mile. The loop of the river north of Amman (biblical Rabbah) was an Ammonite frontier (<a href="?bref=Num.21.24">Nm 21:24</a>). The river separated the kingdoms of Sihon and Og (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.19-22">Jgs 11:19-22</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.3.1-2,8-10">Dt 3:1-2, 8-10</a>), land in Gilead that was later divided among the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Deut.3.12,16">Dt 3:12, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.2-6">Jos 12:2-6</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JABESH, JABESH-GILEAD (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Town appearing in the closing chapters of the book of Judges (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-21.25">19–21</a>). This is a sad record of the division and degradation of the land, which tells of a base atrocity committed by the men of Gibeah against a Levite’s concubine, a sanguinary war against Benjamin in consequence, and savage reprisals against Jabesh-gilead, whose community had sent no contingent to the battle. Such is the first mention of the town. The town was repopulated by neighboring Gileadites and next appears in <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.1-15">1 Samuel 11</a>. East of the Jordan River, Jabesh was exposed to Ammonite attack, and Nahash of Ammon forced Jabesh-gilead to seek terms of surrender. The condition imposed by the barbarous Nahash was the loss of the right eye for all the inhabitants, a mutilation intended to humiliate Israel and destroy the military potential of a border fortress. The sequel was Saul’s forced march, a fine piece of military prowess, and a tremendous boost for the new king’s prestige. Saul gained in one swift blow the support of the Transjordanian tribes and the reduction of the frontier threat that a militarily powerful Ammon would undoubtedly offer. The men of Jabesh-gilead repaid their deep debt to Saul when the king, now unbalanced and rejected, died on Mt Gilboa with his son Jonathan in a last attempt to blunt the Philistine drive to the north. The bodies of Saul and Jonathan, hung headless over the walls of Beth-shan, were cut down and rescued by a commando force from Jabesh-gilead, who made a forced march of nine miles (14.5 kilometers) each way to honor their onetime benefactor (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.8-13">1 Sm 31:8-13</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.10.8-12">1 Chr 10:8-12</a>). When David became king, he repaid the men of Jabesh-gilead with gratitude.</p>
<p>The name Jabesh is preserved in that of the Wadi el-Yabis that runs into the Jordan directly south of the southern end of the Sea of Galilee. The town itself, according to Eusebius’s generally reliable topography, was about six miles (9.7 kilometers) south of Pella on the road to Gerasa. The twin tells of Tell el-Maqereh and Tell Abu Kharaz on the Wadi el-Yabis correspond with Eusebius’s location much better than the other site suggested: Tell el-Maqlub. Tell el-Meqereh and Tell Abu Kharaz are on the eastern rim of the Jordan Valley and fit the details of the historical record—Saul’s forced march from Bezek, and the route of the Jabesh-gilead raiding party to Beth-shan.</p>

<p class="h1">JABNEH</p>
<p class="fl">Biblical city on the coastal plain between Joppa (modern Jaffa) and Ashdod, first mentioned as Jabneel, on the northern border of the tribe of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.11">Jos 15:11</a>). It is mentioned together with the Philistine cities Gath and Ashdod, whose walls were breached by Uzziah, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.26.6">2 Chr 26:6</a>). In the middle Bronze Age a harbor was established at Jabneh-yam, which is probably mentioned by Thutmose III in his list of conquered cities and in the Tell el-Amarna letters (Jabni-ilu). The remains of the harbor show evidence of all periods—from early Bronze Age down to the Byzantine period. In Hellenistic times Jabneh was called Jamnia and was used as a base by foreign armies for subsequent attacks against the Judean territory of the Maccabeans. After the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, a small community of learned refugees was located in Jabneh. Their leader was Johanan ben Zakkai, a former member of the Sanhedrin, the supreme court of the Jews in Jerusalem. He founded a school there. His successor was Gamaliel II. Here the canon of the OT was defined. During the second Jewish war (Bar-Kochba Revolt, <span class="era">AD</span> 132–135), Jabneh was deserted. The spiritual center of the Jewish life was removed to Galilee. The refugees settled down first in Zippori and later in Tiberias, where the Jerusalem Talmud was codified and the Masoretic Text of the OT was produced.</p>

<p class="h1">JACOB</p>
<p class="list">1. Younger of twin sons born to Isaac and Rebekah (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.24-26">Gn 25:24-26</a>). Isaac had prayed for his barren wife, Rebekah, and she conceived the twins, who jostled each other in the womb. When she asked the Lord about this, he told her that she was carrying two nations and that the older son would serve the younger (v <a href="?bref=Gen.25.23">23</a>). Esau was hairy and red (later he was called Edom, “red,” <a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">25:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.36.1">36:1</a>), but Jacob was born holding the heel of his brother, so that he was named Jacob, “he takes by the heel” (cf. <a href="?bref=Hos.12.3">Hos 12:3</a>), with the derived meaning “to supplant, deceive, attack from the rear.”</p>
<p class="h2-list">Personal History</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">Esau and Jacob were very different from each other. Esau was an outdoorsman, the favorite of his father, while Jacob stayed around the tents and was loved by his mother.</p>
<p class="list-text">One day when Jacob was preparing red pottage, Esau came in famished and asked Jacob for some food. Jacob offered to sell Esau some stew in exchange for his birthright as firstborn, and Esau agreed, thus repudiating his birthright (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.12.16">Heb 12:16</a>). The significance of this episode of the red pottage is demonstrated by its association with Esau’s second name, Edom (“red”) (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.30">Gn 25:30</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Isaac became old and blind. One day he asked Esau to take his weapons and get some wild game, of which Isaac was very fond (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.6-7">Gn 27:6-7</a>; cf <a href="?bref=Gen.25.28">25:28</a>), so that he could eat and then confer his blessing upon Esau. Rebekah overheard this, so she called Jacob and told him to go to the flock and select two good kids. She would prepare a dish that would pass for the game while Esau was out hunting. Jacob feared that Isaac would detect the deception, for Esau was very hairy, but Rebekah had everything planned. She placed the skins of the kids on Jacob’s hands and neck to give the impression of hairiness (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.16">27:16</a>) and clothed him in Esau’s best garments, which had the smell of the outdoors on them. Although Isaac recognized the voice of Jacob, his other senses failed him, and he was deceived by the feel of the skins and the smell of the garments. He proceeded to give the blessing to Jacob (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.27.27-29">27-29</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">No sooner had Jacob left than Esau arrived with the game he had cooked. Jacob’s ruse was discovered, but the deed could not be undone (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.33">Gn 27:33</a>), for, as the Nuzi tablets show, an oral blessing had legal validity and could not be revoked. Esau was heartbroken (cf. <a href="?bref=Heb.12.17">Heb 12:17</a>). Isaac gave him a blessing inferior to the one given to Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.39-40">Gn 27:39-40</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The animosity between the brothers deepened, and Esau plotted to kill Jacob after the death of their father. Rebekah learned of this, so she instructed Jacob to flee to her brother Laban in Haran (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.42-45">Gn 27:42-45</a>). Esau’s Hittite wives, meanwhile, had been making life miserable for Rebekah; she complained to Isaac, who called Jacob and sent him to Laban to marry one of his uncle’s daughters (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.46-28.4">27:46–28:4</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jacob set out for Haran. Using a stone for a pillow, he dreamed one night of a ladder reaching up to heaven, with the angels of God ascending and descending on it. God spoke to Jacob and gave to him the promise he had given to Abraham and Isaac concerning the land and descendants. The next morning Jacob took his stone pillow and set it up as a pillar, anointing it with oil. He named the place Bethel (“house of God”) and made a vow that if the Lord would be with him and provide for him, he would give a tithe to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.10-22">Gn 28:10-22</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Jacob reached the area of Haran, he met shepherds who knew Laban. Rachel, Laban’s younger daughter, arrived with her father’s flock, and Jacob rolled the large stone from the mouth of the well and watered the sheep for her (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-10">Gn 29:1-10</a>). When Rachel learned that Jacob was from their own family, she ran to tell her father, who greeted Jacob warmly. After staying with them for a month, Jacob was hired to tend Laban’s flocks. When wages were discussed, Jacob proposed to work seven years to earn Rachel as his wife (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.29.15-20">15-20</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">At the end of seven years Jacob was set to claim his wages, but on the night of the wedding feast, Laban gave his older daughter, Leah, to Jacob; Jacob did not discover the substitution until morning. He felt cheated and protested to Laban, but Laban insisted that according to custom the older daughter must marry first and proposed that Jacob work another seven years for Rachel. Jacob agreed to this and put in his time (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.21-30">Gn 29:21-30</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text"><a href="?bref=Gen.29.1-35">Genesis 29</a> and <a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-43">30</a> relate the births of most of Jacob’s children. Leah bore Jacob four sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.31-35">Gn 29:31-35</a>). She named her first son Reuben (“see, a son”) since she felt that her husband would love her because she bore a son. Simeon is derived from the root “hear,” since Leah thought that God had given her this son because he had heard that she was hated. Levi is related to the verb “join,” for Leah thought that her husband would be joined to her because of this third son. Judah means “praise,” for she praised the Lord at the birth of her fourth son.</p>
<p class="list-text">Rachel had not conceived any children, so she gave her maid Bilhah to Jacob. She bore him Dan and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.1-8">Gn 30:1-8</a>). Rachel named the first son Dan (“he judged”) because God had judged, that is, vindicated her. Naphtali means “my struggle, my wrestling,” for Rachel said she had wrestled with and overcome her sister.</p>
<p class="list-text">Thereupon Leah gave her maid Zilpah to Jacob as a wife; she brought forth Gad and Asher (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.11">Gn 30:11</a>). Gad means “fortune”; Leah said, “Good fortune,” when he was born. Asher (“happy”) was so named because Leah said, “Now the women will call me happy.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Reuben found some mandrakes in the field, and Leah traded them to Rachel for Jacob’s services. Leah then bore sons five and six, Issachar and Zebulun, followed by a daughter, whom she named Dinah (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.14-21">Gn 30:14-21</a>). Issachar perhaps means “reward,” for Leah said that God had rewarded her for giving her maidservant to her husband. Zebulun probably means “honor”; Leah thought that now her husband would honor her.</p>
<p class="list-text">At last Rachel herself conceived and bore her first child, a son whom she named Joseph. “Joseph” means “he will add” or “may he add,” for Rachel wanted God to add another son to her.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jacob wanted to leave and go back to Canaan, but Laban wanted him to stay, for through divination he had learned that the Lord had blessed him because of Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.27">Gn 30:27</a>). They discussed the matter of wages, and Jacob proposed that every speckled and spotted sheep and goat and every black lamb become his (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.30.32-33">32-33</a>). Laban agreed to this, but he quickly removed all the animals marked in that fashion and put them under the care of his sons, some three days’ distance from the rest of the flocks (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.30.35-36">35-36</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jacob also contrived to gain an advantage; he tried to influence the genetics of the animals by putting speckled and streaked wooden rods by the water troughs when the best animals were breeding. The Lord blessed Jacob and he became rich in flocks and herds (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.37-43">Gn 30:37-43</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The sons of Laban became very bitter toward Jacob, and Laban’s attitude toward him changed also. Jacob noticed this, and now the Lord spoke to Jacob and told him to return to Canaan (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.3-16">Gn 31:3-16</a>). Jacob held a family council with his two wives and told them how God had blessed him, even though their father had cheated him and had changed his wages ten times. Jacob organized his caravan while Laban was away shearing sheep. Rachel stole her father’s household gods, for their possession would make the holder heir to Laban’s estate (see <a href="?item=NuziNuziTablets_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Nuzi Tablets</a>). The party took off, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for Gilead. Laban and his relatives pursued them, but God spoke to Laban in a dream, warning him not to say anything to Jacob.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Laban caught up with Jacob, he upbraided him for sneaking away and inquired about his household gods. Jacob did not know what Rachel had done, so he said that the one found with the gods should be put to death (<a href="?bref=Gen.31.32">Gn 31:32</a>). Rachel had hidden them in a camel saddle and was sitting on the saddle when her father searched the tent. Laban did not find the idols. After this, Jacob became angry and complained that he had served Laban for 20 years and that Laban had reduced his wages ten times.</p>
<p class="list-text">Laban suggested a covenant of peace, so the two men gathered stones to make a monument and called it “heap of witness.” Early the next morning Laban said his farewells and returned home.</p>
<p class="list-text">As Jacob and his household journeyed on, he was met by the angels of God (“God’s camp,” <a href="?bref=Gen.32.2">Gn 32:2</a>), so he named that place Mahanaim, “the two camps.” Jacob sent messengers ahead to inform Esau of his return. They came back with the news that Esau was approaching with 400 men. Jacob was afraid and sought the Lord’s protection. To win Esau’s favor, Jacob sent ahead gifts of animals, and that night he sent his family and possessions across the ford of the Jabbok River. Jacob was left alone, and “a man” wrestled with him throughout the night. Toward dawn the man touched Jacob’s thigh, and his hip was dislocated, but Jacob would not give up until the “man” blessed him. Here the Lord changed Jacob’s name to Israel (“he strives with God”), and Jacob named the place Peniel (“face of God”) because he had seen God face to face and lived (<a href="?bref=Gen.32.30">Gn 32:30</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Esau was getting near, so Jacob arranged his family and went forward, bowing low before his brother. But Esau was gracious and forgiving and the meeting was a happy one (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.4">Gn 33:4</a>). Esau was surprised at Jacob’s large family and property and made every gesture of friendship. Esau returned to Seir, and Jacob moved on to Shechem, where he bought a piece of land from Hamor, the father of Shechem. Jacob built an altar there and named it El-Elohe-Israel, “God, the God of Israel” (v <a href="?bref=Gen.33.20">20</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Acting on the Lord’s instructions, Jacob moved to Bethel and expelled the foreign gods from his household. At Luz (Bethel) the Lord again met him and reaffirmed his new name, renewing his promise of land and descendants (<a href="?bref=Gen.35.9-15">Gn 35:9-15</a>). As they journeyed south, Rachel died while giving birth to her second son (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.35.16-20">16-20</a>). She named him Ben-oni (“son of my sorrow”), but Jacob changed his name to Benjamin (“son of the right hand”). Jacob went on to Hebron and found that Isaac was still living. Isaac died at age 180 and was buried by Esau and Jacob.</p>
<p class="list-text">Although the story of Jacob continues in the book of Genesis, the central figure of chapters <a href="?bref=Gen.37.1-50.26">37–50</a> is Joseph, Jacob’s favorite son, the firstborn of Rachel. Jacob showed this favoritism so openly that the other sons became jealous of Joseph. They plotted to kill Joseph but instead sold him to a caravan of traders on their way to Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.9-28">Gn 37:9-28</a>). They took Joseph’s coat, dipped it into the blood of a goat, and took it to their father, telling him that they had found the robe. Jacob recognized the coat he had given his son and concluded that he was dead. Jacob was heartbroken and would not be comforted.</p>
<p class="list-text">When a famine hit Canaan, Jacob sent his sons to Egypt to buy grain (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.1-5">Gn 42:1-5</a>), keeping Benjamin at home. When the brothers returned to Canaan, they reported to Jacob that the governor (who was really Joseph) had kept Simeon as a hostage and demanded that they bring Benjamin with them when they came again for grain. The famine continued, and Jacob again sent his sons to Egypt for grain. Very reluctantly, he permitted Benjamin to go with them, also sending a gift for the Egyptian governor (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.11-14">43:11-14</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The next news Jacob received was that Joseph was alive in Egypt and wanted his father and all his family to join him (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.21-28">Gn 45:21-28</a>). Jacob went first to Beersheba and made offerings to the Lord. The Lord spoke to Jacob, telling him to go down to Egypt and confirming once more the promises he had previously made. Jacob and his descendants who were in Egypt numbered 70, including the two sons of Joseph.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Jacob reached Goshen, Joseph came to meet him, and there was a joyous reunion (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.28-30">Gn 46:28-30</a>). Joseph reported the arrival of his father and brothers to the pharaoh (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.1">47:1</a>) and took five of the brothers and his father to meet the ruler. Israel settled in the area of Goshen and prospered there. Jacob spent 17 years in Egypt and reached the age of 147.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Jacob sensed his death was near, he called Joseph and made him swear that he would bury him with his forebears in Canaan. Joseph took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to his father for the patriarchal blessing. He presented the boys so that Manasseh, the firstborn, would be on Jacob’s right and Ephraim on his left. Jacob, however crossed his hands and gave the younger son the greater blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.13-20">48:13-20</a>). Jacob prophesied that his people would return to Canaan, and he gave Joseph a double portion of the land. Then Jacob called for all his sons and gave to each of them a blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.1-28">49:1-28</a>). Judah received the place of preeminence, and it is he who appears in the genealogies of Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.49.8-12">8-12</a>). The blessing of Joseph shows the mark of special favor (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.49.22-26">22-26</a>). Jacob also charged his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah near Hebron, then he drew his feet up on the bed and died.</p>
<p class="list-text">Joseph summoned the physicians to embalm his father according to Egyptian practice; there were 40 days for embalming and 70 days for the period of mourning (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.1-3">Gn 50:1-3</a>). Arrangements were made to go to Canaan to bury Jacob as Joseph had promised, and a large funeral procession, including many Egyptian officials as well as the family of Jacob, went up from Egypt. The company mourned for seven days at the threshing floor of Atad; then the sons of Jacob buried him in the cave of Machpelah as he had requested. The entire group returned to Egypt, and Joseph assured his brothers that he had no intention of avenging the wrong they had done him. God had meant the whole episode for good (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.50.15-21">15-21</a>).</p>
<p class="h2-list">Jacob as the Nation Israel</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">God made the same promises concerning the land and the nation to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but it is by Jacob’s God-given name, Israel, that the nation is known.</p>
<p class="list-text">The name Jacob is used for the nation about 100 times (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.24.5,19">Nm 24:5, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.9">Dt 32:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.59.13">Ps 59:13</a>). It is often found as a parallel to Israel (e.g., <a href="?bref=Num.23.7">Nm 23:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.33.10">Dt 33:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.14.1">Is 14:1</a>). “Jacob” is also used specifically of the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.2,5">Am 7:2, 5</a>). In <a href="?bref=Isa.41.21">Isaiah 41:21</a> “the King of Jacob” refers to God himself.</p>

  <title>Jacob’s Ladder*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JACOB’S LADDER*</p>
<p class="fl">When Jacob left home after deceiving his father, Isaac, into giving him the blessing that Isaac had intended for Esau (<a href="?bref=Gen.27.6-40">Gn 27:6-40</a>), he was not only desirous of finding a wife from among the daughters of his mother’s brother, but he was also literally fleeing for his life, because Esau had determined to kill him (v <a href="?bref=Gen.27.41">41</a>). When he stopped to rest for the night in the open countryside, the Lord appeared to him in a dream and blessed him (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.10-22">28:10-22</a>). In the vision Jacob saw a ladder reaching from the earth to heaven with angels ascending and descending upon it. At the top of the ladder stood the Lord himself, who confirmed to Jacob the promise previously given to Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.2-3,7">12:2-3, 7</a>), and repeated to Isaac (<a href="?bref=Gen.26.3-5">26:3-5</a>). In the context it seems clear that the ladder with the ascending and descending angels depicts God reaching out to Jacob and making a way for Jacob to have a relationship with him. The communion that was to exist between God and Jacob is symbolized in the ladder and the movement of the angels. This communication between heaven and earth appears to be the same point that is made in <a href="?bref=John.1.50">John 1:50</a> when Jesus says to Nathanael and his other disciples, “You will all see heaven open and the angels of God going up and down upon the Son of Man” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Jacob was so overwhelmed by God’s grace in revealing himself to him in this way that he named the place at which this took place Bethel—the House of God.</p>

<p class="h1">JACOB’S WELL</p>
<p class="fl">Place mentioned only in John’s Gospel (<a href="?bref=John.4.5-29">Jn 4:5-29</a>). It was here that Jesus sat and talked with the unnamed woman of Samaria, who readily accepted Jesus’ words. This well is located in a plot of ground acquired by the patriarch Jacob, about 300 yards (274 meters) southeast from the traditional tomb of Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.19">Gn 33:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.5-6">Jn 4:5-6</a>). The site is about two miles (3.2 kilometers) southeast of modern Nablus, 600 yards (549 meters) southeast of the site of ancient Shechem (modern Balata), and 1,000 yards (914 meters) south of Sychar (modern Askar). Towering over the site on the northwest is Mt Ebal (at the foot of which lies Askar), and on the southwest Mt Gerizim, mountains of cursing and blessing, respectively (<a href="?bref=Deut.27.12-13">Dt 27:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-33">Jos 8:30-33</a>). Near here Abraham built his first altar, and Jacob his second (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.6-7">Gn 12:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.33.18-20">33:18-20</a>). Thus the site is one of the most ancient and sacred in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The well is about 100 feet (30.5 meters) in depth and one yard (.9 meter) in diameter, cut through limestone. Fed by subterranean streams from the adjacent mountain slopes, the water is pure and plentiful, the pride of the villagers. A church has existed on the site from at least <span class="era">AD</span> 380. The Greek Orthodox Church acquired the site in 1885 and built a structure on the site. Access to the well is by steps leading from either side of the church altar to the well curb below.</p>

The town is mentioned on the Moabite Stone (known as the Dibon Stele and dating to c. 845 <span class="era">BC</span>) as the place where Mesha, king of Moab, had lived while at war with Israel. According to Mesha, he took Jahaz from Israel and added it to his own territory.</p>

  <title>James (Person)</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JAMES (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. James, brother of Jesus; leading elder in the church at Jerusalem; author of the epistle bearing his name.</p>
<p class="list-text">The only two references to James in the Gospels mention him with his brothers Joseph (Greek Joses), Simon, and Judas (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>). This James may have been, after Jesus, the oldest of the brothers. The question has been raised about whether these were indeed full brothers of Jesus by Mary, for such a situation has created difficulty for those who cannot square it with their views on the perpetual virginity of Mary. But there seems to be no good reason to challenge the fact from Scripture. As with the other brothers, James apparently did not accept Jesus’ authority during his earthly life (<a href="?bref=John.7.5">Jn 7:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">There is no specific mention of James’s conversion; it may have dated from Jesus’ appearance to him and the others after Jesus’ resurrection (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.7">1 Cor 15:7</a>). He became head of the church at Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.17">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.18">21:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>). Although Jesus had always taught the relative subordination of family ties (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.48-50">Mt 12:48-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.33-35">Mk 3:33-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.21">Lk 8:21</a>), it is hard to believe that James’s authority was not somehow enhanced because of his relationship to the Master.</p>
<p class="list-text">James was regarded as an apostle (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.19">Gal 1:19</a>), although he was not one of the Twelve. Some suggest he was a replacement for the martyred son of Zebedee; others infer his apostleship by widening the scope of that term to embrace both “the Twelve” and “all the apostles” (see the two separate categories cited in <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.5,7">1 Cor 15:5, 7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Tradition stated that James was appointed the first bishop of Jerusalem by the Lord himself as well as the apostles. What is certain is that he presided over the first Council of Jerusalem, called to consider the terms for admission of Gentiles into the Christian church, and he may have formulated the decree that met with the approval of all his colleagues and was sent to the churches of Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.19-20">Acts 15:19-20</a>). James evidently regarded his own special ministry as being to the Jews, and his was a mediating role in the controversy that arose in the young church around the place of the law for those who had become Christians, from both Gentile and Jewish origins.</p>
<p class="list-text">That he continued to have strong Jewish-Christian sympathies is apparent from the request made to Paul when the latter visited Jerusalem for the last time (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.18-25">Acts 21:18-25</a>). This was also the last mention in Acts of James’s career. His name also occurs in the NT as the traditional author of the Epistle of James, where he describes himself as “a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">Jas 1:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">According to Hegesippus (c. 180), James’s faithful adherence to the Jewish law and his austere lifestyle led to the designation “the Just.” It seems clear that James suffered martyrdom. Josephus places it in the year 61, when there was a Jewish uprising after the death of Festus the procurator and before his successor had been appointed.</p>
<p class="list">2. James, son of Alphaeus; one of the 12 apostles.</p>
<p class="list-text">James, son of Alphaeus, is always listed as one of the 12 apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.3">Mt 10:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.18">Mk 3:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.15">Lk 6:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>), but nothing is known for certain about him. Levi (also known as Matthew) is also described as the son of Alphaeus (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.14">Mk 2:14</a>), but it is improbable that he and James were brothers. Many scholars have identified him with the one called “James the less” or “James the smaller.” The description “the less” seems to have been given to distinguish him from the son of Zebedee, and it may signify that he was either smaller or younger than Zebedee’s son (the Greek word can cover both interpretations).</p>
<p class="list">3. James, son of Zebedee. One of the 12 apostles; the first of them to be martyred (<span class="era">AD</span> 44).</p>
<p class="list-text">James was a Galilean fisherman whose circumstances we can suppose to have been comfortable (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.19-20">Mk 1:19-20</a>) and who was called to be one of the disciples at the same time as his brother John (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.21">Mt 4:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.19-20">Mk 1:19-20</a>). It is reasonable to assume that he was older than John, both because he is nearly always mentioned first and because John is sometimes identified as “the brother of James” (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2">Mt 10:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mk 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">5:37</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">James, John, and Simon Peter, who were part of a fishing partnership that included Andrew, Simon’s brother (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.10">Lk 5:10</a>), were a trio who attained in some sense a place of primacy among the disciples. They are found at the center of things—for example, when Jairus’s daughter was raised (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">Mk 5:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.51">Lk 8:51</a>), at the Transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1">Mt 17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">Mk 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.28">Lk 9:28</a>), on the Mount of Olives (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.3">Mk 13:3</a>), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.37">Mt 26:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.33">Mk 14:33</a>). It was James and John, moreover, who had earlier accompanied Jesus to the home of Simon and Andrew (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.29">Mk 1:29</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">James and John were given by Jesus the nickname Boanerges, or “sons of thunder” (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mk 3:17</a>), when they were rebuked by the Lord for impetuous speech and for having totally misconceived the purpose of his coming. This may have been the consequence of the suggestion made by them that they should pray for the destruction of the Samaritan village, the inhabitants of which had rejected the Lord’s messengers (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.54">Lk 9:54</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.9.38">Mk 9:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.49">Lk 9:49</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The presumptuous and ill-considered thinking of the two brothers was obvious also when, after asking with his brother for a place of honor in the kingdom, James was corecipient of the prophecy that they would drink the cup their Master was to drink (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-40">Mk 10:35-40</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.20.20-23">Mt 20:20-23</a>). The two sons of Zebedee are also assumed to have been present with the other disciples when the risen Christ appeared by the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=John.21.1">Jn 21:1</a>), though curiously James’s name is nowhere mentioned in the fourth Gospel.</p>
<p class="list-text">We know nothing about James’s career subsequently until about the year 44, when Jesus’ prophecy was fulfilled: James was killed “by the sword” by Herod Agrippa I, and thus became the first of the Twelve whose martyrdom was referred to in the NT (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-2">Acts 12:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The wife of Zebedee was Salome (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">Mt 27:56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mk 15:40</a>), who may have been a sister of the Lord’s mother (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>). If this were so, it would mean that James and John were first cousins of Jesus and that they may have considered themselves to have been in a privileged position.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">According to the salutation, this letter was written by “James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">Jas 1:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). But who was this James? Of the several mentioned in the NT, only two have ever been proposed as the author of this letter—James the son of Zebedee, and James the Lord’s brother.</p>
<p>The James who wrote this epistle was probably not James the son of Zebedee, for he was martyred too early (<span class="era">AD</span> 44) to have written it (see <a href="?bref=Acts.12.1-2">Acts 12:1-2</a>). Most scholars have identified this James as Jesus’ brother (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.19">Gal 1:19</a>), the prominent elder of the church in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.13,19">Acts 15:13, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.17-25">21:17-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.12">Gal 2:12</a>). The whole character of the epistle coincides with what we know of this James’s legalism and Jewishness.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientPapyrusManuscriptOfJames"/>
<p>As an elder of Jerusalem writing to the 12 tribes of the dispersion (which came as a result of the persecution noted in <a href="?bref=Acts.11.19">Acts 11:19</a>), James set forth the gospel in its relation to the law, which the Jews revered. As Paul’s epistles are a commentary on the doctrines flowing from the death and resurrection of Christ, so James’s epistle has a close connection with Christ’s teaching during his life on earth, especially his Sermon on the Mount. In both the Sermon on the Mount and the Epistle of James, the law is represented as fulfilled in love, and the very language is remarkably similar (cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.1.2">Jas 1:2</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.5.12">Mt 5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.4">Jas 1:4</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.5.48">Mt 5:48</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.5">Jas 1:5</a> and <a href="?bref=Jas.5.14-15">5:14-15</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.7.7-11">Mt 7:7-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.13">Jas 2:13</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.5.7">Mt 5:7</a> and <a href="?bref=Matt.6.14-15">6:14-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.10">Jas 2:10</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.5.19">Mt 5:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.4">Jas 4:4</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.6.24">Mt 6:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.11">Jas 4:11</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.7.1-2">Mt 7:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.2">Jas 5:2</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.6.19">Mt 6:19</a>). The whole spirit of this epistle breathes the same gospel-righteousness that the Sermon on the Mount inculcates as the highest realization of the law. James’s own character as “the Just” suited this coincidence (cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.1.20">Jas 1:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.10">2:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.18">3:18</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.5.20">Mt 5:20</a>). It also fitted him for presiding over a church still zealous for the law (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.18-24">Acts 21:18-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.12">Gal 2:12</a>). If any could win the Jews to the gospel, he was the most likely one because he presented a pattern of OT righteousness, combined with evangelical faith (cf. also <a href="?bref=Jas.2.8">Jas 2:8</a> with <a href="?bref=Matt.5.44,48">Mt 5:44, 48</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">Many scholars confirm an early date for James’s epistle, even as early as <span class="era">AD</span> 45–49, because the whole orientation of the epistle fits the early history of the church, an era in which many Jewish Christians had not made a complete severance from Judaism. Thus, James uses the terms “the twelve tribes” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">Jas 1:1</a>) and “the synagogue” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.2">2:2</a>, Greek); he speaks as an OT prophet (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.1-20">5:1ff</a>.) and as one fond of OT proverbs (cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.1.5">Jas 1:5</a> with <a href="?bref=Pr.2.6">Prv 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.1.19">Jas 1:19</a> with <a href="?bref=Pr.29.20">Prv 29:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.3.18">Jas 3:18</a> with <a href="?bref=Pr.11.30">Prv 11:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.4.13-16">Jas 4:13-16</a> with <a href="?bref=Pr.27.1">Prv 27:1</a>; and <a href="?bref=Jas.5.20">Jas 5:20</a> with <a href="?bref=Pr.10.12">Prv 10:12</a>). James’s message, as was noted earlier, closely follows Jesus’ sermons. His message does not deal with the Jewish/Gentile problems that arose in the 50s and 60s. Moreover, he, unlike Peter, Jude, and John (in their epistles), did not deal with false teachings. All these facts point to an early date. This date is probably before <span class="era">AD</span> 50, when the first Jerusalem Council assembled to discuss the Jewish/Gentile problem (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1-41">Acts 15:1ff</a>.). Also, the date is probably after <span class="era">AD</span> 44, the time of the persecution instigated by Herod Agrippa (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.1">12:1</a>). This persecution would have caused many Jewish Christians to leave Jerusalem and thereby be “the dispersed” (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">Jas 1:1</a>). Thus, James should be dated <span class="era">AD</span> 45–49. As such, the Epistle of James was the first NT book to be written. If these dates are not accurate, then we are, at least, sure that it was written before <span class="era">AD</span> 61 or 62, the time of James’s martyrdom, according to Josephus.</p>
<p>Although a number of suggestions have been made from time to time about the origin of the book, there can be little doubt that the letter was written in Palestine. The author makes allusions that are Near Eastern generally and Palestinian particularly (cf. “the early and late rain,” <a href="?bref=Jas.5.7">5:7</a>; the spring of brackish water, <a href="?bref=Jas.3.11">3:11</a>; the fig, olive, and vine, <a href="?bref=Jas.3.12">3:12</a>; and the “scorching heat,” <a href="?bref=Jas.1.11">1:11</a>).</p>
<p>The contents of the letter indicate clearly that James was writing to Jewish Christians. They are called “the twelve tribes,” a title of Israel (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">1:1</a>); their Christianity is assumed in <a href="?bref=Jas.2.1">2:1</a>; their place of meeting is called a synagogue (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.2">2:2</a>); and they are told about the compassion of “the Lord Almighty” (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.4">5:4</a>)—a name for God used in the OT. In the shorter, disconnected passages of the letter, it is impossible to discover anything about the readers’ circumstances. Most of these exhortations are general and relate to social and spiritual conditions one might find among any group of Christians in any age. The more extended passages that deal with social conditions (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.1-12">2:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.1-11">5:1-11</a>) do provide information about the readers’ situation. James is addressing poor Christians who are employed as farm laborers by wealthy landowners. A few rich may be included among his Jewish Christian readers (cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.4.13-17">4:13-17</a>), but James is primarily concerned with the poor. His statements denouncing the rich are reminiscent of the OT prophets, especially Amos.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeofWritingandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose of Writing and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The letter of James was written (1) to strengthen Jewish Christians undergoing trial (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.2-4,13-15">Jas 1:2-4, 13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.5.7-11">5:7-11</a>); (2) to correct a misunderstanding of the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">2:14-26</a>); and (3) to pass down to first-generation Christians a wealth of practical wisdom.</p>
<p>James’s theology is not dogmatic; it omits the great theological themes that dominate Paul’s writings and play such an important role in the rest of the books of the NT. James makes no mention of the Incarnation, and the name of Christ appears only twice (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.1">1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jas.2.1">2:1</a>). No mention is made of Christ’s sufferings, death, or resurrection.</p>
<p>James’s theology is practical and has a decided Jewish flavor. The distinctive Christian features, of course, are there. James has simply mingled the two to produce a Jewish-Christian document.</p>
<p>The outstanding theological themes of the letter are as follows:</p>
<p class="h3">Temptations and Trials</p>
<p class="fl">The typically Jewish teachings—joy in trials and the use of trials for the building and perfecting of character—are both found in the letter (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.2-4">1:2-4</a>). James also discusses the origin of temptation (vv <a href="?bref=Jas.1.13-15">13-15</a>). Here the author comes into conflict with contemporary Jewish theology. The rabbinical solution to the problem of the origin of sin was that there was an evil tendency in man that enticed man to sin. The rabbis reasoned that since God is the Creator of all things, including the evil impulse in people, they are not responsible for their sins. No, says James. “And remember, no one who wants to do wrong should ever say, ‘God is tempting me.’ God is never tempted to do wrong, and he never tempts anyone else either. Temptation comes from the lure of our own evil desires” (vv <a href="?bref=Jas.1.13-14">13-14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Law</p>
<p class="fl">The entire letter is concerned with ethical teaching; there is no mention of the central gospel truths of Christ’s death and resurrection. James presupposes the gospel and presents the ethical side of Christianity as a perfect law. He seems to be reassuring his Jewish-Christian readers that for them there is still law (the priceless possession of every Jew).</p>
<p>The law (ethical teaching of Christianity) is a perfect law (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.25">1:25</a>) because it was perfected by Jesus Christ. It is also a law of freedom—that is, a law that applies to those who have freedom, not from law, but from sin and self through the “word of truth.” Thus “law” is a Palestinian-Christian Jew’s way of describing the ethical teaching of the Christian faith, the standard of conduct for the believer in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This tendency to describe Christian ethical teaching as law is found in <a href="?bref=Jas.2.8-13">2:8-13</a>, a passage that arises out of a rebuke against the favoritism that James’s readers were showing toward the rich. This favoritism was being condoned by an appeal to the law of love to one’s neighbor. So James writes, “It is good when you truly obey our Lord’s royal command” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.8">2:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The “royal command” is for those who are of God’s kingdom; it is the rule of faith for those who have willingly subjected themselves to God’s rule. The identification of law with the ethical side of Christianity runs through the entire letter.</p>
<p class="h3">Faith and Works</p>
<p class="fl">Faith plays an important role in the theology of James. The basic element of piety (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.3">1:3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">2:5</a>) is belief in God—not merely belief in his existence but belief in his character as being good and benevolent in his dealings with mankind (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.6">1:6</a>). Faith includes belief in the power of God and in his ability to perform miraculous acts; it is closely associated with prayer (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.15-16">5:15-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jas.1.6">1:6</a>). James has a dynamic concept of faith and clearly goes beyond Judaism when he speaks of faith directed toward the Lord Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.1">2:1</a>).</p>
<p>Similarities exist between the concept of faith in James and that concept in the teachings of Jesus. For the Lord Jesus, also, faith meant gaining access to the divine power and is often associated with healing (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.21.22">Mt 21:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.5.34">Mk 5:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.24">11:24</a>).</p>
<p>The best-known passage in which faith is mentioned is <a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">James 2:14-26</a>, where it is contrasted with works. From a close study of this passage, it can be determined that James is not contradicting Paul. For both James and Paul, faith is directed toward the Lord Jesus Christ; such faith will always produce good works. The faith of which James speaks is not faith in the Hebraic sense of trust in God that results in moral action. This is not recognized as <span class="ital">true</span> faith by James (cf. “if a man says he has faith,” <a href="?bref=Jas.2.14">2:14</a>), and Paul would agree with him.</p>
<p>James’s use of the word “works” differs significantly from Paul’s. For James, “works” are works of faith, the ethical outworking of true spirituality and include especially the “work of love” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.8">2:8</a>). (Paul would probably call such works “the fruit of the Spirit.”) When Paul uses the word “works,” he usually has in mind the works of the law whereby people attempt to establish their own righteousness before God. It is against such theological heresy that Paul’s strongest polemics are addressed in the letters to the Galatians and Romans.</p>
<p class="h3">Wisdom</p>
<p class="fl">James’s concept of wisdom also reveals the Jewish background of the letter. Wisdom is primarily practical, not philosophical. It is not to be identified with reasoning power or the ability to apprehend intellectual problems; it has nothing to do with the questions <span class="ital">how</span> or <span class="ital">why.</span> It is to be sought by earnest prayer and is a gift from God (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.5">Jas 1:5</a>). Both of these ideas find their roots in the Wisdom Literature of the Jews (cf. <a href="?bref=Pr.2.6">Prv 2:6</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Wisd.7.7">Wisd of Sol 7:7</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.1.1">Ecclus 1:1</a>). The wise man demonstrates his wisdom by his good life (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.13">Jas 3:13</a>), whereas the wisdom that produces jealousy and selfishness is not God’s kind of wisdom (vv <a href="?bref=Jas.3.15-16">15-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Doctrine of the End Time</p>
<p class="fl">Three important end-time themes are touched upon in the letter.</p>
<p class="h4">The Kingdom of God</p>
<p class="fl">Mention of the kingdom of God grows out of a discussion of favoritism in the first half of chapter <a href="?bref=Jas.2.1-26">2</a>. No favoritism is to be shown to the rich, for James asks, “Hasn’t God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren’t they the ones who will inherit the kingdom God promised to those who love him?” (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">2:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This echoes our Lord’s teaching in <a href="?bref=Luke.6.20">Luke 6:20</a>: “God blesses you who are poor, for the Kingdom of God is given to you” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The kingdom is the reign of God partially realized in this life but fully realized in the life to come (cf. “promised,” <a href="?bref=Jas.2.5">Jas 2:5</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Judgment</p>
<p class="fl">This is a dominant end-time theme of the letter. In <a href="?bref=Jas.2.12">2:12</a>, the readers are admonished to speak and act, remembering that they will be judged under the law of liberty, and they are reminded that judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. In other words, judgment will be administered according to “works of love.” In <a href="?bref=Jas.3.1">3:1</a>, James addresses teachers and reminds them that privilege is another basis on which God judges.</p>
<p>The theme of judgment again appears in <a href="?bref=Jas.5.1-6">5:1-6</a>, and here the author reaches prophetic heights. God’s judgment will fall on the wealthy landowners who have lived self-indulgent, irresponsible lives. Not only have they cheated their poor tenant farmers; they have even “condemned and killed good people who had no power to defend themselves against you [the landowners]” (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.6">5:6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). All this has made them ripe for judgment (“your hearts are nice and fat, ready for the slaughter”—v <a href="?bref=Jas.5.5">5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The final passage on judgment (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.9">5:9</a>) is addressed to those who are exploited or suffering. James’s word of exhortation is that they are not to grumble against each other. Judging is God’s business, and the Judge is close at hand.</p>
<p class="h4">The Second Coming</p>
<p class="fl">The hope of Christ’s coming is presented as the great stimulus for Christian living. Every kind of suffering and trial must be endured because the coming of Christ is at hand (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.8">5:8</a>). This expectancy is powerful and immediate—like that found in the Thessalonian letters.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">In the true spirit of Wisdom Literature, James touches upon many subjects. His short, abrupt paragraphs have been likened to a string of pearls—each is an entity in itself. Some transitions exist, but they are often difficult to find and James moves quickly from one subject to another.</p>
<p>The author begins by identifying himself as the “slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,” and his readers as the “twelve tribes in the dispersion” (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg)—that is, the Jewish Christians who left Jerusalem and Israel due to persecution.</p>
<p>His first word is one of encouragement. Trials are to be counted as joy because they are God’s way of testing the believer, and they produce spiritual maturity. If the reason for a trial is not clear, God can and will give the answer. He is a lavish giver of wisdom to those who really want it (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.5-8">1:5-8</a>).</p>
<p>A poor Christian should be proud of his exalted position in Jesus Christ, and a rich Christian should be glad that he has discovered there are more important things than wealth. Riches are transitory, like quickly wilting flowers under the hot Palestine sun (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.9-11">1:9-11</a>).</p>
<p>God promises life to those who endure trials. One must not blame God for temptation, for it is contrary to his very nature either to be tempted or to tempt people. Temptation has its origin in people’s selfish desire—a desire that, when brought to full fruition, produces death (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.12-15">1:12-15</a>). God is not the origin of temptation but the source of all good. He has given people his best gift, the gift of new life, and this has come through the gospel (vv <a href="?bref=Jas.1.16-18">16-18</a>).</p>
<p>The proper attitude toward the Word of Truth is receptivity, not anger, and effective listening to that word involves spiritual preparation of heart and mind. Such a reception of the word brings salvation (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.19-21">1:19-21</a>). The word is to be acted upon, not merely listened to. To be a passive hearer is to be like a man who sees himself in a mirror, and because he takes such a fleeting glance, forgets what he sees. An active hearer, one who takes a long look in the mirror of God’s Word, will become a doer, and God will bring great blessing into his life (vv <a href="?bref=Jas.1.22-25">22-25</a>).</p>
<p>True religion is an intensely practical thing. It involves such things as controlling one’s tongue, looking after the needs of orphans and widows, and adopting a nonworldly lifestyle (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.26-27">1:26-27</a>).</p>
<p>Favoritism and faith in Jesus Christ do not go together. It is wrong to show favoritism to a rich man when he comes into the assembly and to ignore a poor man. God has chosen poor people to be heirs of his kingdom. Furthermore, to show favoritism to the rich does not make sense, since they are the very ones who drag Christians into court and blaspheme the name of Christ (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.1-7">2:1-7</a>). If, by showing deference to the rich, the royal law—to love one’s neighbor as oneself —is fulfilled, well and good. But to show favoritism is sin, and such sin will be judged by God. In order to be a lawbreaker one has only to break a single law (vv <a href="?bref=Jas.2.8-13">8-13</a>).</p>
<p>Can a faith that does not produce works save a person? What good is a faith that does not respond to human need? Such a faith is dead. Someone will object by saying that there are “faith Christians” and there are “works Christians.” But this is not so. True faith is always demonstrated by works. It is not enough to have orthodox beliefs. Even the demons are theologically orthodox! Abraham, by offering up Isaac, is an example of how true faith and works go together. Even Rahab the prostitute demonstrated her faith by protecting the spies at Jericho. So faith and works are inseparable (<a href="?bref=Jas.2.14-26">2:14-26</a>).</p>
<p>Not many people should become spiritual teachers, because of the awesome responsibility involved. All of us are subject to mistakes, especially mistakes of the tongue, because the tongue is almost impossible to control. It is like a destructive blaze set by hell itself. The tongue is also inconsistent; it is used both to praise God and to curse men. Such inconsistency ought not to be (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.1-12">3:1-12</a>).</p>
<p>True wisdom will always evidence itself in ethical living, whereas false wisdom produces jealousy and selfish ambition (<a href="?bref=Jas.3.13-18">3:13-18</a>).</p>
<p>Strife and conflict arise out of illegitimate desires. Failure to have what one wants arises either from not asking God for it or from asking for the wrong thing. To be a friend of the world is to be an enemy of God, for God is a jealous God and will brook no rivals. He also opposes the proud but offers abundant grace to the humble (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.1-10">4:1-10</a>).</p>
<p>To speak against a brother or sister, or to judge them, is to speak against God’s law and to judge it. The Christian’s proper role is to be a doer of the law, not a judge. The role of judge belongs to God alone (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.11-12">4:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>Life is uncertain. Therefore, plans for traveling or doing business should be made with the realization that all are subject to the will of God. To do otherwise is to be boastful and arrogant. When what is right is clearly known and one fails to do it, that is sin (<a href="?bref=Jas.4.13-17">4:13-17</a>).</p>
<p>Judgment is coming to the rich because they are hoarding their wealth instead of using it for good purposes. God is not unmindful of the cries of the poor whom the rich have cheated and unjustly condemned. He is preparing the selfish, unscrupulous rich for a day of awful judgment (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.1-6">5:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>In the midst of suffering and injustice, the poor are to be patient for Christ’s coming, as the farmer must be patient as he waits for God to send the rains to cause his crops to grow and ripen. The return of Christ is at hand and therefore complaining and judging one another must cease. Job is a good example of patience and endurance in suffering. One need not use oaths to guarantee the truthfulness of his statements. A single yes or no is sufficient (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.7-12">5:7-12</a>).</p>
<p>Suffering should elicit prayer, cheerfulness, and praise. When believers are sick, they should call the elders of the church to pray for them and anoint them with oil. God has promised to answer such prayers. If the sickness is due to personal sin, and if that sin is confessed, God will forgive. Elijah is a classic example of how the prayer of a righteous man has powerful results (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.13-18">5:13-18</a>).</p>
<p>If a Christian sees that another Christian has strayed from the truth and is able to bring him or her back into fellowship with Christ and his church, the consequences will be (1) that the sinner will be saved from death, and (2) that God will forgive the erring Christian (<a href="?bref=Jas.5.19-20">5:19-20</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JANNES AND JAMBRES</p>
<p class="fl">Two of Pharaoh’s magicians, who opposed Moses and tried to show that they were as effective as he at working miracles (<a href="?bref=Exod.7.1-9.35">Ex 7–9</a>). Jewish legend regarded Jannes and Jambres (somewhat improbably) as sons of Balaam, the Midianite prophet of <a href="?bref=Num.22.1-24.25">Numbers 22–24</a>. Curiously, the Exodus chapters do not identify them by name. The only biblical reference to them appears in the NT. The apostle Paul saw similarity between Jannes and Jambres and the false teachers of debased intellect who were enemies of the truth in his day (<a href="?bref=2Tim.3.6-8">2 Tm 3:6-8</a>).</p>
<p>Much speculation has arisen about the two names. They are apparently Semitic, but their precise derivation is unclear. They are referred to in the Qumran documents and in late Jewish, pagan, and early Christian literature. Variations include “Yohanneh and his brother” (Qumran), “Yohane and Mamre” (Babylonian Talmud), and “Mambres” (the translation in most Latin and some Greek manuscripts of <a href="?bref=2Tim.3.8">2 Tm 3:8</a>). The names appear also in the writings of Pliny (first century <span class="era">AD</span>) and of Apuleius and Numenius (both second century), though both names are not always cited.</p>
<p>Origen, an Alexandrian church father, twice referred to an apocryphal work entitled The Book of Jannes and Jambres, suggesting that it was the source of Paul’s words in 2 Timothy. A Latin church document called the Gelasian Decree (fifth or sixth century?) mentions Penitence of Jannes and Jambres, possibly the work mentioned by Origen.</p>

Because Japheth and his brother Shem acted with respect and modesty in covering their father’s nakedness while he was in a drunken condition (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.20-23">Gn 9:20-23</a>), they were both blessed in Noah’s prophetic pronouncement of <a href="?bref=Gen.9.26-27">Genesis 9:26-27</a>. Of Japheth, Noah said, “God enlarge Japheth, and let him dwell in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). There are two interpretations of the meaning of this prophecy. Some understand the enlargement of Japheth to be a reference to a great increase in numbers of descendants. “To dwell in the tents of Shem” is understood as Japheth’s sharing in the blessing of Shem. According to this view, there is to be a time when God will work primarily with Shem (the people of Israel), but then, at a later time, Japheth will be brought into connection with the faith of Israel and share in its promises. In this view fulfillment is found in the opening of the gospel to the Gentiles at the inception of the NT church. Others understand the “enlargement of Japheth” to refer to territorial enlargement, and the “dwelling in the tents of Shem” as the conquest of Shemite territory by Japhethites. In this view, fulfillment is found in the Greek and Roman conquests of Palestine.</p>
<p>In the “table of nations” in <a href="?bref=Gen.10.2">Genesis 10:2</a>, Japheth is listed as the father of Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. These are the ancestors of peoples who lived to the north and west of Israel and who spoke what today are classified as Indo-European languages.</p>

<p class="h1">JARMUTH</p>
<p class="list">1. Fortified city in the northern part of the Shephelah given to Judah’s tribe for an inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.35">Jos 15:35</a>). It was one of five Amorite cities that banded together to attack Gibeon after they had made peace with Joshua and Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.3-5">10:3-5</a>). Jarmuth was reinhabited after the exile by people of Judah (<a href="?bref=Neh.11.29">Neh 11:29</a>), and possibly maintained a population throughout the Dispersion. It is identified with Khirbet Yarmuk, 18 miles (29 kilometers) southwest of Jerusalem. Archaeological evidence suggests that the area of the Bronze Age city was six to eight acres (2.4 to 3.2 hectares) and had a population of about 1,500 to 2,000 people. It is mentioned in the Amarna letters as receiving aid from Lachish.</p>
<p class="list">2. One of four cities of Issachar given to the Levites for their inheritance (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.28-29">Jos 21:28-29</a>).

  <title>Jashar, Book of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JASHAR, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">This was an ancient Hebrew writing that is no longer extant. It was probably a national songbook containing songs praising the exploits of Hebrew heroes. It is mentioned in the OT account of Joshua’s command to the sun and moon to stand still during the battle with the five kings (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.13">Jos 10:13</a>) and in the account of David’s lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="?bref=2Sam.1.17-27">2 Sm 1:17-27</a>). It is also possible that Solomon’s words of dedication of the temple (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.12-13">1 Kgs 8:12-13</a>) were included. According to the Septuagint (Greek translation of the OT), the writer of that passage uses the same language as in <a href="?bref=Josh.10.12-13">Joshua 10:12-13</a> and asks rhetorically if Solomon’s statement were written in the book of “Song.” Some scholars believe that this question may have accidentally dropped out of the Hebrew text since the whole quotation appears in the Septuagint following Solomon’s prayer of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.14-53">1 Kings 8:14-53</a>. It is also likely that some Hebrew letters may have been transposed so that the Septuagint reads “Song” instead of “Jashar.” If one accepts these assumptions, then <a href="?bref=1Kgs.8.12-13">1 Kings 8:12-13</a> would have been part of the Book of Jashar.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the Septuagint rendering, “Book of Song,” is the more correct title. All of the quotations are poetry; the term “Jashar” has never been explained satisfactorily; and “Jashar” has similarities to various Hebrew root forms meaning “to sing.” Hence, some scholars believe that “Book of Song” is a more correct title.</p>
<p>The nature of the book cannot be determined with certainty except to say that it probably contained a wide variety of songs. This is evident as one considers the types of materials contained in the three passages mentioned above. One is an appeal for the prolonging of daylight in order for Israel to complete a military victory; one is an example of David’s literary skill and an expression of the national importance and close friendship of the persons involved; and one is an exclamation extolling God’s supremacy over ritual and nature.</p>
<p>The origin of the Book of Jashar is more clouded in obscurity than is its content. Some believe that it was a written collection of songs dating to the days before the monarchy. Some think that it was an oral tradition dating approximately from the time of Solomon. Others suggest that it was a vital instrument in the establishment of literary archives during the monarchy to preserve the notable events of Israelites. This has led to the suggestion that the Song of Miriam (<a href="?bref=Exod.15.21">Ex 15:21</a>) and the Song of Deborah (Jgs 5) may have been part of the collection.</p>
<p>The book has long interested many people, and this interest has led to various false imitations, false identifications, and false reproductions of it.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">JAVAN* (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Location commonly identified with Greece. The name is linguistically associated with Ionia, a region in westernmost Asia Minor that was colonized by Greeks. By extension, Javan came to be applied to Greece itself. In most occurrences in the Greek translation of the Bible, Javan appears as “Hellas,” Greece.</p>
<p>Some hints as to its location are given as early as the “table of nations,” where Javan appears as the fourth son of Japheth (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.2">Gn 10:2</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.5">1 Chr 1:5</a>); moving west from Gomer, this tends to place it in Europe. Japheth is also said to be the father of Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim or Rodanim (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.4">Gn 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.1.7">1 Chr 1:7</a>). The connections of these areas or peoples is well known.</p>
<p>Most of the references to Ionia (Greece) are in the prophetic books. In <a href="?bref=Isa.66.19">Isaiah 66:19</a> Javan is named along with Tarshish, Put, Lud, and Tubal as places to which the glory of the Lord will be declared. These are taken as a representative of the distant nations.</p>
<p>In a lengthy prophecy against Tyre, Ezekiel refers to Javan, Tubal, and Meshech as those who traded slaves and bronze vessels for the merchandise of Tyre (<a href="?bref=Ezek.27.13">Ez 27:13</a>), while in <a href="?bref=Joel.3.6">Joel 3:6</a> Tyre is condemned for having sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks. In <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.19">Ezekiel 27:19</a> the Hebrew text reads “Vedan and Javan from Uzal.” This is translated as “Greeks from Uzal” in the <span class="sc">nlt</span> (see also mg). The <span class="sc">nasb</span> states, “Vedan and Javan paid for your wares from Uzal”; the <span class="sc">kjv</span> reads “Dan also and Javan.” The <span class="sc">rsv</span> (see also mg) follows the Greek translation: “wine from Uzal.”</p>
<p>The references to Javan in Daniel clearly mean Greece. The he-goat who represents the king of Greece (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.21">Dn 8:21</a>) is Alexander the Great, whose empire was divided among his four generals upon his death. The prince of Greece in <a href="?bref=Dan.10.20">Daniel 10:20</a> is parallel to the prince of Persia in <a href="?bref=Dan.10.13,20">Daniel 10:13, 20</a>. It has been suggested that “prince” means guardian angel, but the prince of Persia’s opposition to the archangel Michael makes it evident that “prince” is a demonic spirit of high rank (cf. <a href="?bref=Eph.6.12">Eph 6:12</a>). Conflict between Persia and Greece is predicted in <a href="?bref=Dan.11.2">Daniel 11:2</a>, while the following verse tells of the success of Alexander the Great and the breakup of his empire.</p>

<p class="fl">Town east of the Jordan River in southern Gilead, taken with its surrounding villages by the Israelites under Moses (<a href="?bref=Num.21.32">Nm 21:32</a>). The tribes of Gad and Reuben asked for the lands of Jazer and Gilead. They had large flocks and herds and saw that the east side of the Jordan was fertile and best suited for livestock grazing (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1-5">32:1-5</a>).

<p class="h1">JEBUS, JEBUSITE</p>
<p class="fl">Walled city, lying on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, conquered by David; thereafter, it was known as the “city of David,” or ancient Jerusalem. Its occupants were Jebusites (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">Jos 18:16</a>). They were one of the several clans or tribes collectively known as Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Gen.10.15-16">Gn 10:15-16</a>). Their land, along with that of their neighbors, was repeatedly promised to the Israelites (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.8">Ex 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.5">13:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.23">23:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.33.2">33:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.11">34:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.13.29">Nm 13:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.1">Dt 7:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.17">20:17</a>). This promise was partially fulfilled early in the campaign under Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.10">Jos 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.12.8">12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.24.11">24:11</a>). It is said that the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.28">18:28</a>). “The Benjamites, however, failed to dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites” (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.21">Jgs 1:21</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Apparently the city was captured by the men of Judah, but its inhabitants were not destroyed and they later reoccupied the site.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="JebusTheAncientCityOfDavid"/>
<p>Jebus (or Jerusalem) lay on the borderline between two tribes, and this may account for its survival until the time of David. The borders of Judah and Benjamin are thus defined: “The boundary then passed through the valley of the son of Hinnom, along the southern slopes of the Jebusites, where the city of Jerusalem is located. Then it went west to the top of the mountain above the valley of Hinnom, and on up to the northern end of the valley of Rephaim” (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.8">Jos 15:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>); “it then goes down the valley of Hinnom, south of the shoulder of the Jebusites, and downward to En-rogel” (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">Jos 18:16</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The two accounts agree: the survey of Judah follows a westerly direction; the survey of Benjamin moves eastward; both indicate that Jebus lay on the southern slope of the “mountain” north of the valley of Hinnom, the site of East Jerusalem today.</p>
<p>The city’s survival was assured by a constant supply of water, the spring of Gihon, and by strong natural defenses. It was easily defended by steep valleys on three sides: the Kidron on the east, the Hinnom on the south and west. The Jebusites therefore considered their city impregnable. This gave them a certain arrogance and complacency. After the death of Saul, when David was seeking to consolidate the kingdom, the Jebusites scornfully challenged David to capture their stronghold (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6">2 Sm 5:6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.5">1 Chr 11:5</a>). As the last remaining Canaanite stronghold in the area, it presented a unique challenge. Joab apparently led the attack up the water shaft and succeeded where previous attempts had failed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.8">2 Sm 5:8</a>).</p>
<p>For political as well as strategic reasons, David decided to move his capital from Hebron to Jebus. Politically, it lay in neutral territory between Judah and Benjamin and thus aroused no jealousy. Strategically, it was easily defended and more centrally located. The choice proved a wise one. In spite of the fact that Jebus-Jerusalem lies on no waterway or major highway, it has become through the centuries the spiritual capital of the world. Under David and Solomon, it became Israel’s religious center, and today it is of prime importance to the three major monotheistic religions of mankind.</p>

<p class="list"> 1. Twelfth king of Israel, succeeding his father, Jehu, and ruling from 814 <span class="era">BC</span> to 798 <span class="era">BC</span>. Because he was an evil king, God punished Israel by subjecting them to the Aramean kings Hazael and his son Ben-hadad. The military force in Israel was reduced to 50 cavalrymen, 10 chariots, and 10,000 infantrymen. The oppression became so severe that Jehoahaz prayed to God, who listened to him and delivered Israel from the Arameans, but not until the reign of Joash (Jehoash) (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.2-7,25">2 Kgs 13:2-7, 25</a>). During Jehoahaz’s reign, relations between Judah and Israel seem to have been fairly good, since Jehoahaz (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.1">14:1</a>, “Joahaz”) named his son Joash after his contemporary, Joash king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.1,9">2 Kgs 13:1, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.1">14:1</a>).</p>
<p class="list"> 2. Seventeenth king of Judah, ruling three months in 609 <span class="era">BC</span>. The people chose him to succeed his father, Josiah, who was killed in the battle of Megiddo. His mother’s name was Hamutal. Jehoahaz was 23 years old at his coronation. He is also called Shallum (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.15">1 Chr 3:15</a>), and Jehoahaz may well be a throne name. He is characterized as an evil king before God. His rule ended when Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in Hamath. Later he was taken to Egypt, where he died (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.30-34">2 Kgs 23:30-34</a>).

  <title>Jehoash</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JEHOASH</p>
<p class="fl">Name of two OT kings, occurring only in the book of 2 Kings. The name means “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is strong” or “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> hath bestowed.” Joash, the shorter form of the name, frequently appears in the Kings and Chronicles narratives.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Son of Ahaziah and seventh king of Judah (835–796 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jehoash ascended the throne after the wicked Athaliah had been killed at the command of Jehoiada the priest. As an infant, he was hidden by his aunt Jehosheba in the temple and thus survived the slaughter of the king’s household by Athaliah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.1-3">2 Kgs 11:1-3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.23.10-12">2 Chr 23:10-12</a>). After remaining six years within the temple precinct, Jehoash was declared king at the age of seven and ruled for 40 years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.11.21-12.1">2 Kgs 11:21–12:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.1-3">2 Chr 24:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">His major activity during his reign was the renovation of the temple (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.4-5">2 Kgs 12:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.4-5">2 Chr 24:4-5</a>). When, by his 23d year, little progress had been made (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.6">2 Kgs 12:6</a>), he revised the taxation schedule, commanded the people of Judah to bring their contributions directly to the Jerusalem temple, and soon restored the Lord’s house to its proper condition (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.13">2 Chr 24:13</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After the death of the priest Jehoiada, Jehoash and Judah forsook the Lord and served the Asherim and the idols (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.15-18">2 Chr 24:15-18</a>). Not heeding the prophetic warning of divine judgment (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.20">20</a>), Jehoash and his people were conquered by the Arameans. Though Jehoash had once been able to avert a siege of Judah by paying tribute to Hazael (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.17-18">2 Kgs 12:17-18</a>), the same strategy did not work a second time. The Arameans plundered Judah and Jerusalem, sending the spoil to Hazael in Damascus (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.23-24">2 Chr 24:23-24</a>). Jehoash was assassinated by his servants Jozacar (Jozabad/Zabad) and Jehozabad while recuperating from wounds incurred in battle with the Arameans (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.20-21">2 Kgs 12:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.24.25-26">2 Chr 24:25-26</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Son of Jehoahaz and 13th king of Israel (798–782 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jehoash enjoyed a measure of military success that had eluded his father. No longer subject to punitive military exploits from Hazael of Aram, he was able to establish political stability in the northern kingdom. In fact, he subjugated the southern kingdom of Judah while Amaziah was king in Jerusalem (796–767 <span class="era">BC</span>). The conflict between Amaziah and Jehoash was precipitated mainly by Amaziah. Overconfident with his victories in Edom, Amaziah initiated a military conflict with Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.25.17-19">2 Chr 25:17-19</a>). The battle was fought near Beth-shemesh in the Judean Shephelah. King Jehoash routed the army of Judah, captured Amaziah, and moved on to Jerusalem. Destroying the outer wall from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, he entered the capital city and plundered the treasures of both the palace and the temple (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.21-24">21-24</a>). He was apparently used as an instrument of the Lord to subdue Judah (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.20">20</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">A contemporary of Jehoash was Elisha the prophet. In spite of the pervasive wickedness in Israel and the apostasy of the king himself (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.10-11">2 Kgs 13:10-11</a>), Jehoash still sought the counsel of this prophet of the Lord. While Elisha was on his deathbed, Jehoash sought the prophet’s blessing (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.14">14</a>). Elisha assured the king that the Arameans would be defeated by Israel at Aphek and that Israel would enjoy three decisive victories over this same enemy (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.13.15-19">15-19</a>). During his 16-year reign, Jehoash achieved political stability in the northern kingdom. Though considered an evil king, he was used as an instrument of judgment against Amaziah of Judah and enjoyed the blessing of Yahweh against Aram.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">JEHOIACHIN</p>
<p class="fl">King of Judah for a very brief time (598–597 <span class="era">BC</span>). He was the son of Jehoiakim and Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem (possibly the Elnathan mentioned by Jeremiah, cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.26.22">Jer 26:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.36.12,25">36:12, 25</a>). The name Jehoiachin means “Yahweh will uphold,” and variations include Coniah (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.24,28">Jer 22:24, 28</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.37.1">37:1</a>), Jeconiah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.16-17">1 Chr 3:16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.2.6">Est 2:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.24.1">Jer 24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.27.20">27:20</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.28.4">28:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.2">29:2</a>), and Jechoniah (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.11-12">Mt 1:11-12</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Jechonias”). Jehoiachin was 18 years old when he was installed as king upon his father’s death, and he ruled for only three months and ten days in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.8">2 Kgs 24:8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.9">2 Chr 36:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). He inherited a vassal kingdom in revolt. Besieged by the armies of the Babylonian overlord Nebuchadnezzar, Jehoiachin had little choice but to capitulate in the face of insurmountable odds. According to the Babylonian Chronicle, records based on the official annals of the Babylonian kings, Nebuchadnezzar entered Syro-Palestine in December of 598 <span class="era">BC</span> and took Jerusalem on March 16, 597. The Babylonians plundered the palace and temple treasuries. Along with Jehoiachin, his family, prominent military leaders, royal officials, and artisans were taken prisoner and led away to exile in Babylon. Before returning to Babylon, the victorious king placed Jehoiachin’s uncle Mattaniah, now named Zedekiah, on the throne in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.12-17">2 Kgs 24:12-17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.10">2 Chr 36:10</a>).</p>
<p>According to Jeremiah, the trauma caused by the Babylonian invasion of Judah, and the consequent political upheaval prompted by a succession of three kings in four months, had little impact on the people spiritually (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.1-38.28">Jer 37–38</a>). This same prophet of God forecast Jehoiachin’s exile and predicted he would have no descendants succeeding him on the throne (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.24-30">22:24-30</a>). In contrast, the false prophet Hananiah prophesied Jehoiachin would be restored to the throne of Judah within two years (<a href="?bref=Jer.28.3-4,11">28:3-4, 11</a>; cf. vv <a href="?bref=Jer.28.12-17">12-17</a>).</p>
<p>Jehoiachin’s continuing royal status as the legitimate claimant to the Judahite kingship was reflected in the fact that Ezekiel’s oracles are dated to the year of Jehoiachin’s exile, not Zedekiah’s reign (<a href="?bref=Ezek.1.2">Ez 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.8.1">8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.20.1">20:1</a>; etc.). Babylonian records confirm this recognition of Jehoiachin’s former position; he retained his title of king and received favorable treatment from the Babylonians. He is certainly the “Yaukin, king of the land of Yahuda” listed in one of the cuneiform tablets; this tablet contains inventories of rations of oil and barley for the king and his five sons and implies they were not imprisoned but living a fairly normal life in Babylonia. At some point Jehoiachin must have been imprisoned, however, because later, during the reign of Evil-merodach, he was released from prison and granted dining privileges with the Babylonian king (c. 562 <span class="era">BC</span>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.27-30">2 Kgs 25:27-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.31-34">Jer 52:31-34</a>). Whether he was imprisoned for attempting to escape or because of Judah’s rebellion against Babylon under Zedekiah is unclear.</p>
<p>Jehoiachin’s name appears in Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.11-12">Mt 1:11-12</a>), and some contend that this contradicts Jeremiah’s oracle of judgment against the king’s descendants (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.30">Jer 22:30</a>). Yet it is possible to understand Haggai’s blessing of Zerubabbel (<a href="?bref=Hagg.2.20-23">Hg 2:20-23</a>) as a reversal of Jeremiah’s curse and the reinstatement of Jehoiachin’s line on the Davidic—and ultimately messianic—throne (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.56.3-5">Is 56:3-5</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JEHOIAKIM</p>
<p class="fl">Second son of Josiah by Zebidah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.36">2 Kgs 23:36</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.15">1 Chr 3:15</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.4">2 Chr 36:4</a>) who became king of Judah in 609 <span class="era">BC</span>. He replaced his younger brother Jehoahaz as king when he was deposed and exiled by Pharaoh Neco after a three-month reign (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.31-35">2 Kgs 23:31-35</a>). Jehoiakim was installed as king at age 25, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His given name, Eliakim, means “God will establish.” Upon enthroning him, Neco changed his name to Jehoiakim, meaning “Yahweh will establish” (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.34">2 Kgs 23:34</a>), perhaps seeking to claim Yahweh’s support for his action.</p>
<p>Neco laid a heavy tribute on Judah, which Jehoiakim raised by levying a tax on the whole land (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.35">2 Kgs 23:35</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.22.13-17">Jer 22:13-17</a>, where the woe oracle against Jehoiakim implies that he appropriated some of these funds for personal use). Jehoiakim remained subservient to the Egyptians until the battle of Carchemish in 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Nebuchadnezzar and the Neo-Babylonians routed Neco. Judah then became a vassal state of Babylon for three years (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1-2">2 Kgs 24:1-2</a>). After Nebuchadnezzar’s failure to completely subdue Neco in a second fierce battle in 601 <span class="era">BC</span>, Jehoiakim seized the opportunity to throw off the Babylonian yoke when the Babylonian king returned home to reorganize his army. This ill-advised decision proved costly, as Nebuchadnezzar invaded Judah in 598 <span class="era">BC</span> to punish the rebellious vassal king (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.3-7">2 Kgs 24:3-7</a>). The expected help from Egypt never came, and the Babylonians destroyed the important Judahite cities of Debir and Lachish, seized control of the Negev, and deported several thousand of Judah’s ablest citizens. This no doubt crippled the economy and left Judah virtually leaderless. Jehoiakim died during the Babylonian siege (probably late in 598 <span class="era">BC</span>). His son Jehoiachin was placed on the throne.</p>
<p>Although the details of Jehoiakim’s death are not reported, the biblical historian does pass judgment on this reign as one that perpetuated the evils of his fathers (see <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.37">2 Kgs 23:37</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.5,8">2 Chr 36:5, 8</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.22.18-19">Jer 22:18-19</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.36.27-32">36:27-32</a>, which predicted that Jehoiakim’s dead body would be cast on the ground outside of Jerusalem without proper burial and he would have no descendants upon the throne). Presumably the reference to “fathers” is to his predecessors Manasseh, Amon, and Jehoahaz. Jeremiah specifies the evils that characterized Jehoiakim’s rule, including idolatry, social injustice, robbery of the wage earner, greed, murder, oppression, extortion, and forsaking of the covenant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.1-17">Jer 22:1-17</a>). Despite Jeremiah’s extensive activity during his reign (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.25.1-26.24">25–26</a>, <a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-32">36</a>), Jehoiakim remained disobedient, unrepentant, smug, and self-sufficient in his ill-gotten prosperity (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.18-23">22:18-23</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JEHORAM</p>
<p class="list">1. Jehoshaphat’s son and Judah’s fifth king (853–841 <span class="era">BC</span>; also called Joram). Prior to the rule of the Omride dynasty in the northern kingdom of Israel (885–841 <span class="era">BC</span>), the relationship between Judah and Israel had been strained. The political influence and economic stability of the united monarchy had long since vanished. Power and wealth had been diminished by Egyptian overlordship under Shishak (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.1-16">2 Chr 12</a>) and by civil war: the unsuccessful Shechem conference (ch <a href="?bref=2Chr.10.1-19">10</a>); Rehoboam of Judah versus Jeroboam of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.12.15">12:15</a>); Abijah of Judah versus Jeroboam of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.1-22">13:1-22</a>); and Asa of Judah versus Baasha of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>). The Omride dynasty in the mid-ninth century <span class="era">BC</span>, however, cast aside familial rivalry and sought to forge a new alliance between the two nations.</p>
<p class="list-text">The two kingdoms of Judah and Israel were increasingly threatened by the surrounding peoples—the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Syrians, Philistines, Arabs, and Assyrians. In response to this threat Ahab, the second king of the Omride dynasty, secured diplomatic relations with Phoenicia (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">1 Kgs 16:31</a>) and Judah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.4">22:4</a>). During this time, joint military expeditions by Israel and Judah were not infrequent (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-53">1 Kgs 22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.1-27">2 Kgs 3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.28">8:28</a>), though these political alliances were not without their liabilities. The intrusion of the worship of Baal and Asherah led to religious apostasy in Judah and Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31-33">1 Kgs 16:31-33</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.2">2 Kgs 3:2</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.11">2 Chr 21:11</a>). It was within this political-religious context that Jehoram reigned over Judah.</p>
<p class="list-text">Though he may have served as co-regent as early as 853 <span class="era">BC</span>, Jehoram was the sole ruler for eight years (848–841 <span class="era">BC</span>). His reign was marked by unnecessary internecine fighting and religious apostasy. His father had generously provided for his six brothers, a decision that Jehoram quickly reversed once he had secured the throne (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.2-3">2 Chr 21:2-3</a>). He executed not only his brothers but also several Israelite princes, thereby removing any political threat to himself (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.4">4</a>). In addition, he reverted to the idolatrous practices that his father had tried to eliminate by restoring forbidden worship sites, “the high places” (v 11). Jehoram had apparently fallen under the influence of his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Jezebel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.18">2 Kgs 8:18</a>). As her mother had done in Israel, Athaliah imported Baal worship into Judah. As a result, Elijah the prophet pronounced judgment on Jehoram and the people of Judah—a curse that brought a great plague upon Jehoram’s people, children, wives, and possessions, and a gross intestinal disorder upon the king himself. In spite of this pervasive wickedness in Judah, the Lord did not destroy the southern kingdom, because of his promise to David (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.19">2 Kgs 8:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.7.12-16">2 Sm 7:12-16</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Politically, Judah was vulnerable, having lost its control of Edom (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.9">2 Chr 21:9</a>) and having sustained attacks by the Philistines and the Arabs. Jehoram was left bereft of possessions, wives, and sons except for Jehoahaz (Ahaziah), his youngest (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.16-17">16-17</a>). At his death Jehoram was not honored and was deprived of burial in the tomb of the kings within the city of David (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.21.19-20">19-20</a>).</p>

<p class="list">2. Ahab and Jezebel’s son, and Israel’s tenth king (852–841 <span class="era">BC</span>; also called Joram). He succeeded his brother Ahaziah, whose premature death led to Jehoram’s ascension to the throne in Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.2,17">2 Kgs 1:2, 17</a>); he was a contemporary of the Judean kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehoram was preoccupied with the political resurgence of the two neighboring kingdoms of Moab and Syria. When Moab withheld its annual tribute to Israel, he sought assistance from both Jehoshaphat and Judah’s vassal kingdom, Edom. Jehoram and Jehoshaphat joined forces with the king of Edom but were halted in their attack on Moab when they encountered a serious lack of water. Hesitant to advance with their troops, they summoned Elisha the prophet and asked him to inquire of the Lord’s will regarding the expedition. Because of the high regard that Elisha held for Jehoshaphat, the prophet sought the Lord on their behalf, gaining both the Lord’s blessing and an abundance of water. The account of the battle records the slaughter of the Moabites as well as the horrible incident of a human sacrifice by the Moabite king. Having won the battle, Israel withdrew (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4-27">2 Kgs 3:4-27</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehoram’s conflict with Syria was less successful because the Israelite king sustained a battle wound. Retreating from Ramoth-gilead in Transjordan to his palace in Jezreel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.29">2 Kgs 8:29</a>), he found his problems compounded when one of his generals, Jehu, led an insurrection against him. Commissioned by the Lord and declared to be king of Israel, Jehu confronted Jehoram and his nephew, Ahaziah, king of Judah. The incident culminated in the death of the two reigning monarchs of Israel and Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.14-24,27">2 Kgs 9:14-24, 27</a>). While Ahaziah was buried in the tomb of the kings in Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.28">28</a>), Jehoram’s corpse was cast into Naboth’s field outside the city of Jezreel. His end was the appropriate judgment against the last king of the wicked Omride dynasty (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.25-26">25-26</a>).</p>

<p class="list-text">Jehoshaphat was 35 years of age when he began his reign; he ruled 25 years, during which time he maintained the stability of the Davidic dynasty (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.41-42">1 Kgs 22:41-42</a>). He was contemporary with King Ahab of Israel (874–853 <span class="era">BC</span>), since his first year on the throne corresponds with the fourth year of the reign of Ahab (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.41">41</a>). He was also contemporary with Ahaziah (853– 852 <span class="era">BC</span>), son of Ahab, and his brother Jehoram (852–841 <span class="era">BC</span>), who succeeded Ahaziah when he died childless (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.17">2 Kgs 1:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehoshaphat is held in high esteem by the Chronicler, along with Hezekiah and Josiah. His successful rule was due to his religious policy. He continued the religious reformation initiated by his father; therefore, the Lord firmly established the kingdom under his control. Everyone in Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great riches and honor (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.1-5">2 Chr 17:1-5</a>). The Chronicler praised Jehoshaphat’s courageous heart, evidenced in his removing the high places and the Asherim from Judah (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.6">6</a>). Jehoshaphat is also reported to have closed all the temples of prostitution (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.46">1 Kgs 22:46</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The biblical record informs us that Jehoshaphat reversed his father’s foreign policy. During his reign, Asa warred against Baasha of Israel (908–886 <span class="era">BC</span>), who exterminated the house of Jeroboam I (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>) and usurped the throne for himself, keeping it for nearly a quarter of a century. The two kingdoms engaged in warfare over the boundaries between the kingdoms. Jehoshaphat, however, discontinued this war and made peace with the king of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.2">1 Kgs 22:2</a>). To confirm this state of peace, he made an alliance with Ahab and married his son and successor, Jehoram, to Ahab’s daughter Athaliah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.18">2 Kgs 8:18</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-2">2 Chr 18:1-2</a>). In accordance with this alliance Jehoshaphat fought on the side of Ahab in his battle against Aram, which took place at Ramoth-gilead (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.1-53">1 Kgs 22</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.18.1-34">2 Chr 18</a>). He also was an ally of Jehoram, the younger son of Ahab, against Mesha the king of Moab (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.3.4-27">2 Kgs 3:4-27</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In his domestic reforms Jehoshaphat sent Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach the law in the cities of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.7-9">2 Chr 17:7-9</a>). He is also reported to have organized the use of tribute paid to Judah. The surrounding nations, observing the strength of Jehoshaphat and recognizing the presence of the Lord with him, not only refrained from attacking Judah but even brought tribute to him. He used this tribute to fortify the cities of Judah (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.10-13">10-13</a>). Jehoshaphat also reorganized the army and made arrangements for the defense of the kingdom. He had a standing army in the capital as well as garrisons in the fortified cities. It is evident that the organization centered about the tribal association of Judah and Benjamin (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.14-19">14-19</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">A prophet by the name of Jehu rebuked Jehoshaphat for his alliances with Ahab (<a href="?bref=2Chr.19.1-3">2 Chr 19:1-3</a>). Evidently, Jehoshaphat took this rebuke to heart and ruled Judah wisely. He swept most of the Asherim from the land and determined in his mind to seek God. He is reported to have gone regularly among the people from Beersheba to Mt Ephraim to convert them to the Lord. He appointed judges in each of the fortified cities of Judah and admonished them to judge as the Lord’s representatives. He also appointed Levites, priests, and family heads to handle cases pertaining to the worship of the Lord and to make decisions in disputes arising among citizens (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.19.4-11">4-11</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In addition to the fortified cities in Judah, Jehoshaphat placed military forces in the cities of Ephraim that his father, Asa, had taken (<a href="?bref=2Chr.17.1-2">2 Chr 17:1-2</a>). Though his alliances with Phoenicia and Israel were not approved by the prophets and proved dangerous in the long run, they still brought relative peace and temporary prosperity to his realm. He was held in high esteem by the neighboring Philistines and the Arabs (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.17.10-13">10-13</a>), and it is also evident that Edom submitted to him. He won victory over the Moabites, Ammonites, and Meunites at En-gedi (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.1-30">20:1-30</a>). Wishing to emulate Solomon, he constructed ships at Ezion-geber to go to Tarshish, but this did not prove a successful venture (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.20.35-37">35-37</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehoshaphat died when he was about 60 years of age and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His son Jehoram became king in his place (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.1">2 Chr 21:1</a>). His name is listed in Matthew’s genealogy of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.8">Mt 1:8</a>).</p>

<p class="fl">Name for God formed by adding the vowels of the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> to the consonants of the Hebrew divine name, <span class="hebrew">YHWH</span><span class="ital">.</span> Out of their respect for God and their fear of defiling his name, the postexilic Jews refused to pronounce the divine name when reading Scripture. Instead, they substituted <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span><span class="ital">,</span> a word meaning “my Lord.” Prior to the sixth century <span class="era">AD</span>, the Hebrew text had no vowels. These were supplied during the reading of the Scripture by one who was familiar with the language. When vowel points were added to the text (<span class="era">AD</span> 660–700), the vowels of <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> were placed below the consonants of <span class="hebrew">YHWH</span> to indicate that <span class="hebrew">’Adonai</span> should be read.</p>
<p>It is thought that about <span class="era">AD</span> 1520 Petrus Galatinus conceived the idea of combining the two names, thus creating the new form <span class="ital">YeHoWaH,</span> from which the English term Jehovah comes. Although this form was foreign to the Hebrew language, it gained wide acceptance and was included as the translation for God’s name in various verses in the <span class="sc">kjv</span> and <span class="sc">asv</span>. Biblical scholars now agree that the original pronunciation of the divine name was <span class="hebrew">Yahweh</span> or <span class="hebrew">Jahveh</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>

<p class="h1">JEHU</p>
<p class="list">1. Prophet and son of the “seer” Hanani (<a href="?bref=2Chr.16.7">2 Chr 16:7</a>), who denounced Baasha for following in the ways of Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.1-7">1 Kgs 16:1-7</a>). In addition to continuing the heretical worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan, Baasha also assassinated Nadab, the son of Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.25-32">15:25-32</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehu later rebuked Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, for helping Ahab the king of Israel in his wars against the Arameans (<a href="?bref=2Chr.19.1-2">2 Chr 19:1-2</a>). The writings of this prophet were included in one of the records of the reign of Jehoshaphat, <span class="ital">The Book of the Kings of Israel</span> (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.34">2 Chr 20:34</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Important army officer during the reigns of Ahab and Jehoram (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.25">2 Kgs 9:25</a>), who in reaction to the economic and religious abuses of the house of Omri was anointed as king of the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.16-17">1 Kgs 19:16-17</a>). In the following revolution he exterminated the royal house of Israel, the king of Judah, and a royal party from the south (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-10.36">2 Kgs 9–10</a>). He executed the worshipers of Baal in order to revive true worship in Israel. As king, he ruled in Samaria 28 years (841–814 <span class="era">BC</span>) and began a dynasty that lasted some 100 years.</p>
<p class="list-text">In the time of Jehu the prophets were engaged in a religious equivalent of war with the adherents of the Tyrian Baal. Elijah met and defeated the Canaanite priests on Mt Carmel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.17-40">1 Kgs 18:17-40</a>). Later he and then Elisha were commissioned to anoint Jehu as king. The prophets waited until the time was right (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-10">2 Kgs 9:1-10</a>), at which time Elisha sent a “son of the prophets” to Ramoth-gilead to designate Jehu as the monarch.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehu left his siege of Ramoth-gilead in northern Transjordan to meet the king of Israel in Jezreel. There he killed King Jehoram and Ahaziah, the king of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.17-28">2 Kgs 9:17-28</a>). His bloody ways continued as he extinguished the royal house of Ahab (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1-17">10:1-17</a>) and 42 ambassadors of goodwill from Judah (apparently without provocation, vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.12-14">12-14</a>). Israel’s bloodbath finally ended in Samaria. There Jehu cunningly vowed to serve Baal with a zeal greater than that of Ahab. Unsuspecting devotees of Baal gathered in great numbers to join in a festival sacrifice. Instead, the devotees themselves became the sacrifice, and the house of Baal in Samaria was destroyed and desecrated by turning its ruins into a latrine (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.18-27">18-27</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Political and economic problems also contributed to the unrest. Under the reign of Ahab and Jezebel, justice was corrupted. The poor lost their land in the drought and their property rights were ignored (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.5-6">1 Kgs 18:5-6</a>). Jehu threw the body of Jehoram into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.25-26">2 Kgs 9:25-26</a>) as justice for the crime of Ahab and Jezebel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.19">1 Kgs 21:19</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.13">13</a>). But religious passions dominated the cause. Jehu called his slaughter of the house of Omri his “zeal for the Lord.” Jehonadab, a Recabite, joined Jehu as he traveled toward Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.15-17">2 Kgs 10:15-17</a>). Recabites opposed social and economic developments that took place in the northern kingdom under Ahab. They followed a strict moral code and lived a simple life (<a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-19">Jer 35</a>). Since Recabites represented the most conservative elements of Yahwism, they became natural allies for the reform of Jehu.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehu’s revolution seriously weakened the worship of Baal. Although not all of the adherents were eliminated, Baalism no longer remained the official religion of the state (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.28">2 Kgs 10:28</a>). Rather, Baalism united with Yahwism to form the sinister syncretistic religion that was denounced by Hosea.</p>
<p class="list-text">Politically, the revolt of Jehu was disastrous. The triple alliance between Tyre, Israel, and Judah was shattered by the atrocities. Israel, now isolated, became easy prey for Assyria and Syria. Jehu attempted to buy some help from Assyria by paying tribute to Shalmaneser III. That event is pictured on the Black Obelisk in a relief from the campaign of 841 <span class="era">BC</span>. An inscription names “Jehu, son of Omri,” as the one kneeling before Shalmaneser.</p>
<p class="list-text">After the Assyrian threat dissipated in 838 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hazael, king of Aram-Damascus, conquered all of Israelite Transjordan as far as the Arnon (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.32-33">2 Kgs 10:32-33</a>). In a second campaign in 815 <span class="era">BC</span>, Hazael moved across the Jordan River, through the Jezreel plain, and down the coast, conquering the land as far as Gath in the northern Shephelah. There the son of Jehu, Jehoahaz, paid tribute to Hazael (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.12.18">12:18</a>). The revolution weakened Israel both politically and economically.</p>
<p class="list-text">Later generations spoke of the massacre of the house of Omri with horror (<a href="?bref=Hos.1.4">Hos 1:4</a>). Jehu did not destroy the golden calves of Jeroboam, and so continued the syncretistic worship at Bethel and Dan. In the final analysis the revolution, which was meant to purge Israel of oppression and false religion, succeeded in doing neither.</p>
<p class="list">3. Member of Judah’s tribe, the son of Obed and Azariah’s father (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.38">1 Chr 2:38</a>).</p>
<p class="list">4. Prince of Simeon’s tribe, and the son of Joshibiah, who, along with others, migrated from the approaches to the valley of Gedor eastward in search of good pasture (<a href="?bref=1Chr.4.35">1 Chr 4:35</a>).</p>
<p class="list">5. One of the skilled warriors who joined David at Ziklag. Interestingly, he was of Saul’s tribe, Benjamin, and from Anathoth, to which Abiathar of the priests of Eli was later banished (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.3">1 Chr 12:3</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JEPHTHAH</p>
<p class="fl">Illegitimate son of Gilead (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.1">Jgs 11:1</a>) and a leader in the period of the judges. The son of a harlot, Jephthah was dispossessed by his father’s other sons and refused a share in their father’s home. He moved to the land of Tob, a small Aramean state east of the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.3-5">Jgs 11:3-5</a>), and became leader of a band of malcontents and adventurers who went raiding with him.</p>
<p>When war broke out between the Israelites and the Ammonites, the leaders of Gilead begged Jephthah to return and lead their army. At first he refused because of their previous mistreatment of him. When they promised to make him Gilead’s ruler, he accepted and became commander in chief and ruler (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.4-10">Jgs 11:4-10</a>). The agreement was ratified before the Lord at a general assembly of the people at Mizpah (v <a href="?bref=Judg.11.11">11</a>) in Gilead, probably just south of the Jabbok River.</p>
<p>After diplomatic negotiations with the king of Ammon failed, Jephthah waged war against the Ammonites. Before the fighting started, he vowed to the Lord that if he was victorious, on his return home he would sacrifice to God whoever met him at the door of his house. Then he successfully led his army against the Ammonites, destroying them with a terrible slaughter (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.29-33">Jgs 11:29-33</a>).</p>
<p>When Jephthah returned home, he was shocked to find that the first person to meet him was his only child, his daughter, playing a tambourine and dancing for joy. When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me; for I have opened my mouth to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, and I cannot take back my vow” (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.35">Jgs 11:35</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). She submitted to her destiny but begged that it might be postponed for two months so that she and her companions could retreat to the mountains and lament that she must die a virgin (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.11.34-38">34-38</a>). A woman in ancient Israel could suffer no greater disgrace than to die unmarried and childless. When she returned, her father fulfilled his vow (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.11.38-39">38-39</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="DidJephthahOfferHisDaughterAsAHumanSacrifice"/>
<p>Jephthah also led Gilead against the Ephraimites, who were resentful that they had not been included in the fight against Ammon. They had been given a previous chance to ally with Gilead but had refused. Jephthah captured the fords of the Jordan behind the Ephraimites and prevented their escape by an ingenious strategy. Gileadite guards put fugitives to a test, demanding that they say “Shibboleth.” If they could not pronounce the “sh,” they were revealed as Ephraimites and killed. The account says that 42,000 Ephraimites died at that time (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-6">Jgs 12:1-6</a>).</p>
<p>Jephthah was judge over Gilead for six years (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.7">Jgs 12:7</a>), and when he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. In the Letter to the Hebrews, Jephthah is named with Gideon, Barak, and others as a hero of faith (<a href="?bref=Heb.11.32">Heb 11:32</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JEREMIAH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Prophet to Judah before its fall in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>; his name is also spelled “Jeremias” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.14">Mt 16:14</a>) and “Jeremy” (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.17">Mt 2:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.27.9">27:9</a>) in the <span class="sc">kjv</span>.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeremiah was born in the village of Anathoth, about three miles (4.8 kilometers) northeast of Jerusalem. His father’s name was Hilkiah, and he belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. His call came in the 13th year of King Josiah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>). He refers to himself as “a child” when called (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.6">Jer 1:6</a>), but the Hebrew word is not the same as used in <a href="?bref=Jer.30.6">Jeremiah 30:6</a> and <a href="?bref=Jer.31.8">31:8</a> and cannot be limited to preadolescence. He was probably referring to his inexperience rather than to his age. Jeremiah was born about 657 <span class="era">BC</span> during the reign of the wicked king Manasseh, while the great Ashurbanipal, who had shaken the world by sacking the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes in 663 <span class="era">BC</span>, ruled a world empire from Assyria.</p>
<p class="list-text">God informed Jeremiah that he had consecrated and appointed him before birth (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.4-5">Jer 1:4-5</a>). Jeremiah first shrank with a sense of inadequacy and fear: “O Sovereign <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, . . . I can’t speak for you! I’m too young!” (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.6">6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). God would not allow Jeremiah to excuse himself. He was assured that words would be given him to speak, and guidance given for the way (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.7">7</a>). He was promised protection (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.18">18</a>) and deliverance (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.8">8</a>) despite opposition (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.19">19</a>). God touched his mouth, signifying divine inspiration of his words, and gave the sign of a branch from an almond tree, explaining that the Lord is watching (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg). The third sign was the boiling pot (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.13">13</a>) facing from the north, picturing the source and fury of impending disaster.</p>
<p class="list-text">Thus the tone of Jeremiah’s life ministry was set: judgment, disaster, danger, defeat, and impending death for the nation.</p>
<p class="h2-list">Early Ministry</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">The messages given by Jeremiah during his first five years of ministry may have been instrumental in the great revival of 622 <span class="era">BC</span>. Those cooperating with King Josiah in the reformation and friendly with Jeremiah included Ahikam and his father, Shaphan (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.24">Jer 26:24</a>); Gedaliah, Ahikam’s son (<a href="?bref=Jer.39.14">39:14</a>), who later became governor; Acbor, son of Micaiah, also called Abdon, whose son Elnathan joined the opposition (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.22">26:22</a>) but later repented (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.25">36:25</a>); and Asaiah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.20">2 Chr 34:20</a>). The prophets Nahum and Zephaniah also influenced the reform movement, which must have climaxed under the preaching of Habakkuk and Jeremiah, the priestly ministry of Hilkiah, and the prophecies of Huldah the prophetess. During the reign of King Josiah, Jeremiah spoke without the fear of persecution that plagued his later ministry. Though the content of the book of Jeremiah sometimes appears to be fragmentary, most of chapters <a href="?bref=Jer.1.1-19.15">1–19</a> date to the time of Josiah.</p>
<p class="list-text">The finding of the lost Book of the Covenant in the temple debris may be the reason for the words in <a href="?bref=Jer.15.16">Jeremiah 15:16</a>: “Your words are what sustain me. They bring me great joy and are my heart’s delight” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). The words “So be it, <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.5">Jer 11:5</a>) in a context recalling the words of Moses in the Torah may be Jeremiah’s response after hearing King Josiah read the newly found book.</p>
<p class="list-text">Small towns and rural areas, including his hometown, heard Jeremiah’s denunciation of high places and idolatry. They sought to kill the young prophet, or at least to intimidate him (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.21">11:21</a>). Instead of being silent, Jeremiah asserted that his motivation was for their good and condemned their resistance to the truth as their greatest danger.</p>
<p class="list-text">Shortly after Jeremiah began his ministry, a number of world-changing events took place. Ashurbanipal died and the Assyrian Empire rapidly declined. Nabopolassar began a 21-year reign in Babylon, leading an expansion that culminated in his son Nebuchadnezzar’s subjugation of the known world. As the world news filtered in, Jeremiah turned more toward Jerusalem. His first temple speeches (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.7.1-10.25">7–10</a>) may have been uttered at this time.</p>
<p class="list-text">Nabopolassar felt his strength sufficient to launch an attack against Assyrian territory in 616 <span class="era">BC</span>, but he advanced cautiously because Psamtik I (Psammetichus) of Egypt appeared ready to aid Assyria. Cyaxares of Media pounced on Assyria when Babylon hesitated and took its most sacred city, Asshur, in 614 <span class="era">BC</span>. Babylon joined Media, along with Scythia, and waged an assault against Nineveh, which fell late in the summer of 612 <span class="era">BC</span>. The Assyrian Empire had shriveled to two small holdings, Haran and Carchemish.</p>
<p class="list-text">Nabopolassar took Haran in 610, and Ashuruballit, having escaped, appealed to Egypt for help at Carchemish. Neco, who had become pharaoh within the year, responded immediately. He marched through Judah without giving Josiah prior notice and asked that the Jews not bother him in view of his haste to go northward (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.21">2 Chr 35:21</a>). Ignoring the request, Josiah pursued them to Megiddo and was wounded in the ensuing battle; he died in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="h2-list">Ministry during the Reign of Jehoiakim</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">In place of Jehoahaz, Josiah’s fourth son, who reigned only three months, Pharaoh Neco enthroned Jehoiakim (Eliakim). Neco demanded heavy indemnity payments from Judah and took Jehoahaz prisoner as collateral to assure payment (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.31-33">2 Kgs 23:31-33</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Early in the reign of Jehoiakim, Jeremiah, moved by God’s Spirit, delivered his third temple speech (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.1-24">Jer 26</a>) on the occasion of one of the annual Jewish feasts. He called for the people to repent and to act on the basis of the revelation they had heard repeatedly from the Book of the Law. The barb of the sermon came in the warning: “This is what the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> says: If you will not listen to me and obey the law I have given you, and if you will not listen to my servants, the prophets—for I sent them again and again to warn you, but you would not listen to them—then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed Shiloh, the place where the Tabernacle was located. And I will make Jerusalem an object of cursing in every nation on earth” (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.4-6">26:4-6</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Shiloh had been the heart of Jewish worship from Joshua to Samuel, but after being destroyed by the Philistines, it never revived. It served as an example of complete desolation following God’s judgment in the days of Eli.</p>
<p class="list-text">Crowds gathered rapidly and reacted angrily against Jeremiah. Priests and princes hurried to the New Gate, where a court was established to bring order and to control violence. Jehoiakim would be no help to Jeremiah, for he had refused to listen to God’s messages (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.21">Jer 22:21</a>). The priests and false prophets spoke against Jeremiah, calling him a traitor. Then some of the elders spoke to the people about Uriah, who had prophesied the same message. Rather than risk disaster, Ahikam persuaded the court to spare Jeremiah.</p>
<p class="list-text">Egypt controlled Palestine and Syria after the decay of the Assyrian Empire. In 606 <span class="era">BC</span> Egypt succeeded in annihilating a garrison city of Babylonian soldiers south of Carchemish and then reoccupied Carchemish to await the return blow from Babylon. This Egyptian victory meant persecution for Jeremiah, who was often accused of false prophecy (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.20.1-18">Jer 20</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeremiah never had confidence in Egypt. Each time a Jewish leader would call for a new alliance with Egypt, Jeremiah repeated God’s message against it. Whenever a Jewish group fled to Egypt for security, Jeremiah warned of worse things in that land of false refuge (see <a href="?bref=Jer.44.26-27">Jer 44:26-27</a>). Jeremiah’s ode and prophecy in chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-28">46</a> poetically describe Egypt’s defeat at Carchemish, when Nabopolassar sent his son Nebuchadnezzar to destroy them (605 <span class="era">BC</span>). After smashing the Egyptian army at Carchemish, Nebuchadnezzar pursued the enemy through Judah. “Not a single man escaped to his own country,” reads the exaggerated Babylonian record. His father’s death, however, prevented him from invading Egypt, and he returned to Babylon to assume the throne. The following year Nebuchadnezzar, now king of Babylonia, returned to accept the homage of the rulers of Judah, Syria, and Phoenicia. On this occasion God gave Jeremiah his great 70-year prophecy (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.11-12">Jer 25:11-12</a>), which became the basis of <a href="?bref=Dan.9.2,24-27">Daniel 9:2, 24-27</a>.</p>
<p class="list-text">A year after the decisive battle at Carchemish, Baruch, Jeremiah’s scribe, finished recording all the dictated words of Jeremiah and was reading from this scroll at the temple. A report reached the king, who sent Jehudi, a servant, to fetch the scroll and read it to him. When this was done, Jehoiakim burned the scroll in spite of his counselors, who pleaded that the king not do it (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.23-25">Jer 36:23-25</a>). God’s message, soon rewritten, added a promise of fearful judgment on Jehoiakim (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.36.27-31">27-31</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Ambitious young Nebuchadnezzar determined to add Egypt to his dominion. In 601 <span class="era">BC</span> he led his forces through Judah again, but Neco had advance warning and was prepared for the onslaught. In the desert of Shur, Nebuchadnezzar suffered defeat. Encouraged by this display of Egyptian defensive strength, the pro-Egyptian parties in Judah asserted themselves, persuading Jehoiakim to lead them to freedom from Babylon by making an alliance with Egypt (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.1">2 Kgs 24:1</a>). But help from Egypt did not come (v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.7">7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In 599 <span class="era">BC</span>, Nebuchadnezzar armed those surrounding the rebel Jewish kingdom to harass the Jews, which they willingly did (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.2">2 Kgs 24:2</a>). Evidently Jehoiakim lost his life in one of these raids. Since the people despised him, his body was thrown out without honorable burial, as Jeremiah had predicted (<a href="?bref=Jer.22.19">Jer 22:19</a>).</p>
<p class="h2-list">Ministry during the Reign of Zedekiah</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem in 598 <span class="era">BC</span> lasted only a short time because the new king, Jehoiachin, crowned at age 18, knew resistance was useless. He gave himself up, with all his family and court, in March of 597 <span class="era">BC</span>, after serving as king about three months. The Babylonian Chronicle reads: “He [Nebuchadnezzar] seized the city and captured the king.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Jehoiachin was carried to Babylon along with 8,000 (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.16">2 Kgs 24:16</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.14">14</a>) officers, artisans, and executives (Ezekiel among them) and much booty. In his place Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, to rule. Zedekiah proceeded to organize his government with the less capable and inexperienced help left after the deportation.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeremiah took up his thankless ministry, calling on the Jews to believe God, obey the laws of Babylon, and reject false hopes in Egypt. Zedekiah turned a deaf ear to these appeals, listening rather to the unwise advice of his counselors (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.1-2">Jer 37:1-2</a>). During the first year of Zedekiah’s rule, Jeremiah received the vision of the two baskets of figs. The Jews carried to Babylon were like good figs, while Zedekiah and those who trusted in Egypt were like rotten figs (<a href="?bref=Jer.24.1-8">24:1-8</a>). The reason for this reproachful description was that the Jews began plotting rebellion against Babylon along with Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon from the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-3">27:1-3</a>), thus breaking their oath of loyalty to Nebuchadnezzar and repudiating God’s message through Jeremiah.</p>
<p class="list-text">In Egypt the pharaoh began to renew plans to organize dissidents within the Babylonian Empire to revolt. He hired Jewish soldiers to aid him in protecting his southern border. The Jewish soldiers settled on a Nile island called Elephantine, or Yeb (593–410 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jeremiah addressed an oracle to these Jews (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.44.1-30">44</a>). The treaty for Jews to help in Egypt evidently also assumed that Egyptians would aid Israel. When the Babylonians besieged Jerusalem in 589, Pharaoh Hophra came to the aid of Zedekiah. Nebuchadnezzar, ruling from Riblah, commanded that the siege against Jerusalem be lifted in order to make a surprise attack on Hophra (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.5">37:5</a>). The release gave Jeremiah an opportunity to journey to Anathoth to secure some family property (v <a href="?bref=Jer.37.12">12</a>). However, Irijah, captain of the guard, arrested Jeremiah in the Gate of Benjamin for defecting to the enemy, and he was beaten and flung into a dungeon. King Zedekiah brought him out after many days to obtain a prognostication. With characteristic boldness, Jeremiah told the king he would shortly become a captive. At the same time, Jeremiah requested relief from injustice for himself. He gained part of his request but continued as prisoner in the court of the guard.</p>
<p class="list-text">The Babylonian army chased Pharaoh Hophra back to Egypt and returned to crush Jerusalem without further mercy. The siege, which began in 589 <span class="era">BC</span>, was restored with rigor in January of 588, Zedekiah’s ninth year (<a href="?bref=Jer.39.1">39:1</a>). During this time, the Lord gave Jeremiah foreknowledge of a visit from a cousin who wished to sell a field near Anathoth (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.7-9">32:7-9</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.37.12">37:12</a>). Jeremiah bought the field as an object lesson to verify the message of restoration after a captivity of 70 years (<a href="?bref=Jer.29.10">29:10</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The armies of Babylon cut off all supplies from Jerusalem and were able to destroy the last two outlying Jewish fortresses of Lachish and Azekah (<a href="?bref=Jer.34.7">34:7</a>). Food became scarce. Disease spread. Undisposed-of sewage and impure cistern water caused pestilence. With increased distress came Jeremiah’s increased appeal for the city to surrender.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeremiah remained in the prison court until the Babylonians breached the city wall in July of 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. The king escaped by night and succeeded in reaching the plains of Jericho but was captured there and taken to Riblah. Zedekiah’s family and counselors were killed; he himself was blinded and taken in chains to Babylon, where he died soon after (<a href="?bref=Jer.39.6-7">39:6-7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Back in Jerusalem, Nebuzaradan, the Babylonian general, sent most of the Jews into captivity. Jeremiah, however, was granted special consideration; after being released from prison, he was placed under the care of Gedaliah, son of Ahikam.</p>
<p class="h2-list">After the Fall of Jerusalem</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">A month after the fall of Jerusalem, the city was burned and the walls broken down. Gedaliah was appointed governor of the remaining agricultural community, with headquarters at Mizpah. Jeremiah returned to Jerusalem, where, according to tradition, he took up his abode in a grotto near what is now known as Gordon’s Calvary. There he wrote the book of Lamentations.</p>
<p class="list-text">The Ammonite king Baalis, plotting rebellion against Babylon, instigated the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.13">40:13</a>). In the reaction that followed, the remaining people followed the leader Johanan ben Kareah to a camp near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt. They asked Jeremiah, at Jerusalem, to give guidance from the Lord, promising obedience. Jeremiah’s message required that they remain in Israel and not go to Egypt. Disobedience was complete and immediate. Fearing Babylon, they departed from Judah, taking Jeremiah with them, and entered Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.16-43.7">41:16–43:7</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeremiah did not stop his ministry in Egypt. His message at Tahpanhes (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.8-12">43:8-12</a>) assured a victorious conquest of the land by Nebuchadnezzar, which took place in 568–567 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jews from all parts of Egypt gathered to discuss their future as exiles. Jeremiah took the opportunity to denounce their idolatry. Jewish women as well as men argued that they had enjoyed prosperity while serving idols but had suffered since stopping. Jeremiah condemned their obdurate blindness to reality and gave God’s indictment. For a verifying sign, Jeremiah predicted that Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt would be assassinated (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.30">44:30</a>), which happened in 466 <span class="era">BC</span>. No later record of Jeremiah’s acts exists in the Bible. Tradition says Jeremiah was stoned to death by the people of the Jewish exile settlement in Tahpanhes.</p>
<p class="list-text">Though Jeremiah suffered continued rejection during his life, he has been honored by numerous apocryphal and traditional embellishments to his history. Jesus could well have had Jeremiah in mind when he said, “You build tombs for the prophets your ancestors killed and decorate the graves of the godly people your ancestors destroyed. . . . [You are] the descendants of those who murdered the prophets” (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.29-31">Mt 23:29-31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=IsraelHistoryof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Israel, History of</a>; <a href="?item=JeremiahBookof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jeremiah, Book of</a>; <a href="?item=ProphetProphetess_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Prophet, Prophetess</a>.</p>

<p class="fl">Few doubt that the prophet from Anathoth wrote the book of Jeremiah, yet questions persist concerning some parts, particularly chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">52</a>. The use of the third person cannot be used to discredit Jeremiah’s authorship, for Jeremiah used the first and third person, and even the second person, in the same context. For example, <a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-7">32:6-7</a> reads: “Jeremiah said [third person], ‘The word of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> came to me: [first person] . . . your uncle will come to you [second person]’ ” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>The problem of the passage of time provides the strongest argument against the Jeremian authorship of chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">52</a>. Jeremiah was born about 657 <span class="era">BC</span>. Evil-merodoch released Jehoiachin (<a href="?bref=Jer.52.31">52:31</a>) about 95 years later. <a href="?bref=Jer.52.33">Jeremiah 52:33</a> summarizes the continuation of events beyond this time. The problem of location also argues against Jeremian authorship, for Jeremiah took up residence in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.6-7">43:6-7</a>) while Jehoiachin dwelt in Babylon. Note also that Jeremiah concludes his writing with chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.51.1-64">51</a>, making chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">52</a> a true editorial appendix. Since chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">52</a> parallels <a href="?bref=2Kgs.24.18-25.30">2 Kings 24:18–25:30</a>, it may be that other portions of Jeremiah that parallel sections of 2 Kings may have been written by someone other than Jeremiah.</p>
<p>The following table shows such portions and includes harmonic passages in 2 Chronicles. The first column shows historical (chronological) sequence. The last column provides a brief condensation of content.</p>
<p>Baruch served as the secretary for Jeremiah. The relationship between the two men apparently lasted many years; the prophet gave a word of encouragement as he blessed his helper (<a href="?bref=Jer.45.5">45:5</a>). According to the custom of the people, it would have been legitimate for the scribe to write some of the prophet’s messages in his own words. This would not deny inspiration.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Authenticity">Authenticity</p>
<p class="fl">That Jeremiah lived and actually wrote the major part of the book bearing his name is authenticated by numerous references in both biblical and nonbiblical sources (e.g., <a href="?bref=Dan.9.1-27">Dn 9</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Ecclus.49">Ecclus 49</a>; Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 10; Talmud: <span class="ital">Baba Bathra</span>). The veracity of the historical sections of Jeremiah have abundant confirmation in contemporary biblical books and in the secular histories preserved in Babylon, Egypt, and Persia.</p>
<p>Higher critics sought to discredit the portions of Jeremiah that were omitted by the Septuagint, or to credit passages to a later writer because of style differences (e.g., chs <a href="?bref=Jer.30.1-33.26">30–33</a>) or spelling differences (as found in chs <a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-29.32">27–29</a>) or linguistic problems (as in <a href="?bref=Jer.10.11">10:11</a>, written in Aramaic, but this may be a gloss). Another reason for discrediting Jeremiah’s authorship is that critics dated some prophecies later than indicated in the context. This results from their requiring that predictive writing follow the record of its fulfillment. None of these reasons is sufficient cause for doubting authenticity. The Hebrew text deserves priority over the Septuagint. Aramaic contact with the Jews became commonplace during this period (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.1-7.28">Ezr 4–7</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.2.1-7.28">Dn 2–7</a>) and therefore explains the presence of Aramaic. Different styles may be expected from the same writer due to differing circumstances and differing purposes. Baruch may have been inspired to write parts of this book and/or edited what Jeremiah wrote. Prediction preceding fulfillment presents no problem for believers.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheBookofJeremiahandtheSeptuagint">The Book of Jeremiah and the Septuagint</p>
<p class="fl">The special problems of the Septuagint translation of Jeremiah demand attention. The Septuagint translators evidently made an inaccurate translation. About 2,300 Hebrew words are omitted from the Septuagint. After chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.23.1-40">23</a>, the mistranslation, omissions, and mixed chronological order indicate confusion. However, the Dead Sea Scrolls display texts with both the Hebrew and the Septuagint order, indicating the antiquity of both editions. Both have suffered corruption at the hands of scribes and the ravages of the ages. The Septuagint evidently veers much further from the original, yet it has invaluable clues to help suggest answers to some textual problems. The most evident major shift in the Septuagint consists of the removal of chapters <a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-51.64">46–51</a> of the Hebrew order, and the placement of them in the spot from which <a href="?bref=Jer.25.13b-14">25:13b-14</a> was removed. These chapters are renumbered <a href="?bref=Jer.26.1-31.40">26–31</a> but are mixed and changed considerably from the order of the Hebrew Masoretic Text.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>

<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The chronological sequence of the messages of Jeremiah constitutes a major problem that cannot be wholly solved. Nonetheless, the book was written during Jeremiah’s ministry (c. 627–586 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="OriginandDestination">Origin and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">After beginning his ministry in Anathoth, Jeremiah moved to Jerusalem, where he remained until he was forced to join the disobedient refugees who arrived in Egypt about 584 <span class="era">BC</span>. Until the deportation of Jehoiachin (597 <span class="era">BC</span>), Jeremiah addressed his messages to the king and the people residing in Judah. Later messages addressed the same group, plus the captives in Babylon (e.g., ch <a href="?bref=Jer.29.1-32">29</a>). After the departure to Egypt, he addressed Jews in that land.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">Part of God’s commission to Jeremiah stated the purpose of Jeremiah’s ministry: “Today I appoint you to stand up against nations and kingdoms. You are to uproot some and tear them down, to destroy and overthrow them. You are to build others up and plant them” (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.10">1:10</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The first four parts of the commission required that Jeremiah, appointed as a “chief governor” over nations, should wreck the existing religious and social structures by his preaching against moral and spiritual sin. Doubtless, the physical destruction caused by the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians was the accoutrement for the truth uttered by the prophet. Jeremiah is consistent in his blasts at moral and religious wickedness, his call to submit to the punishment that God gives through Babylon, and his assurance that such submission will lead to blessing. When Zedekiah asks advice (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.14">38:14</a>), we know what Jeremiah will say. When the captains of the refugees ask if they should go to Egypt, we already know the answer (<a href="?bref=Jer.42.3">42:3</a>). We may also anticipate the obdurate rejection of God’s message on the part of the inquiring people, who apparently want to know God’s will but have no desire to obey it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, part of Jeremiah’s purpose focuses on the most distant future when the new covenant will supplant the old (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-37">31:31-37</a>), and a transformed people bent on obedience rather than sin will receive God’s promised kingdom.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Teaching">Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">National sin brings national punishment. No truth blazes so clearly as this. Gentiles as well as Jews stand under the same judgment, for God is not the God of Israel only.</p>
<p>Individuals are not overlooked in divine judgments on nations. God sets before each the way of life and the way of death (<a href="?bref=Jer.21.8">21:8</a>) and appeals to each to choose life (<a href="?bref=Jer.27.13">27:13</a>).</p>
<p>Jeremiah illustrates human depravity by questioning if people can change their skin color or leopards their spots (<a href="?bref=Jer.13.23">13:23</a>). The depths of depravity reach beyond man’s ability to measure (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.9-10">17:9-10</a>). People even love falsehood (<a href="?bref=Jer.5.30-31">5:30-31</a>). Yet God promises to transform willing subjects who call on him (<a href="?bref=Jer.33.3">33:3</a>) by giving them a “new heart” (<a href="?bref=Jer.24.7">24:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.32.38-41">32:38-41</a>) as the climatic provision of the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.33-35">31:33-35</a>). The Messiah, who accomplishes the saving work, is called the Lord our Righteousness, the King, the righteous Branch, the Branch of David (<a href="?bref=Jer.23.5-6">23:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.15-16">33:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>A future nation will be made up of individuals who accept this salvation. Passing through the night of tribulation as of travail (<a href="?bref=Jer.30.6-7">30:6-7</a>), the Jews will understand the true identity of their Messiah, will believe and receive him with repentant sorrow, will be cleansed (<a href="?bref=Jer.33.8">33:8</a>), and will be regathered from all countries (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.37">32:37</a>) by the omnipotent God (v <a href="?bref=Jer.32.27">27</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="OutlineandContent">Outline and Content</p>
<p class="fl">Though many see no logical order, a careful reading of Jeremiah will reveal a grouping on the basis of content, as suggested by the following outline:</p>
<p class="list">  I. Introduction (1)</p>
<p class="list"> II. Oracles against the Jews (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.1-25.38">2–25</a>)</p>

<p class="list"> VI. Oracles against the Nations (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-51.64">46–51</a>)</p>
<p class="list">VII. Conclusion (<a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">52</a>)</p>
<p class="sp">The prophet opens his ministry with a series of utterances against the sins of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.1-3.5">2:1–3:5</a>), followed by similar messages (through ch <a href="?bref=Jer.4.1-31">4</a>), concluding with words of judgment (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.5.1-6.28">5–6</a>). The message in the temple gate (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.7.1-10.21">7–10</a>) leads into the proclamation against covenant breakers (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.11.1-13.27">11–13</a>). The lamentation over the drought (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.14.1-22">14</a>) and subsequent miseries (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.15.1-21">15</a>) compares with many similar expressions of grief. Jeremiah did not differ from other prophets in his use of object lessons. The rotted linen waistband (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.13.1-27">13</a>), the broken jug (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.19.1-15">19</a>), figs (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.24.1-10">24</a>), and ox yoke (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.27.1-28.17">27–28</a>) may be supplemented by human object lessons (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-19">35</a>), and even the prophet himself, whose celibacy (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.1-4">16:1-4</a>), resistance to sympathetic consolation (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.5-7">16:5-7</a>), and withdrawal from feasts (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.8-9">16:8-9</a>) all served to illustrate and confirm his message.</p>
<p>Places where Jeremiah proclaimed his messages helped bear home his point. He stood in the public gate, where kings came and went, to proclaim that judgment (fire) would come through the gate (<a href="?bref=Jer.17.19,27">17:19, 27</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.39.3">39:3</a>). Then he went to the potter’s house (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.18.1-23">18</a>), and then to Hinnom or Topath, which would be called the Valley of Slaughter (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.19.1-15">19</a>).</p>
<p>The persecution suffered by Jeremiah first hinted at (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.8">1:8</a>), then predicted (v <a href="?bref=Jer.1.19">19</a>), expresses its venom privately from his home village (<a href="?bref=Jer.11.19-23">11:19-23</a>). The prophet’s kindred join the opposition (<a href="?bref=Jer.12.6">12:6</a>). Public opposition brings beatings and the stocks (<a href="?bref=Jer.20.2-3">20:2-3</a>). Jeremiah prefers to keep silent rather than to speak and suffer (v <a href="?bref=Jer.20.9">9</a>), but he cannot withhold the word that is as fire in his bones. The result: all his familiars reproached, derided, terrorized, and denounced him, then sought his death (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.20.7-18">7-18</a>). Jeremiah escaped death at the hands of priests, prophets, and people only because he had a few faithful friends (<a href="?bref=Jer.26.8-24">26:8-24</a>). When his prophecies began to materialize, hatred mounted. He was beaten and put into a dungeon for many days (<a href="?bref=Jer.37.14-17">37:14-17</a>) on a false charge. Temporary relief at the guardhouse (v <a href="?bref=Jer.37.21">21</a>) lasted only a few days. Officials clamored again for his death (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.4">38:4</a>) and put him into a cistern, where he sank in the mire (v <a href="?bref=Jer.38.6">6</a>). His rescue (v <a href="?bref=Jer.38.10">10</a>) preserved his life, but his imprisonment at the guardhouse continued (v <a href="?bref=Jer.38.28">28</a>). His writings were cut up and burned (<a href="?bref=Jer.36.23">36:23</a>); his words were denied and rejected (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.1-7">43:1-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.44.16">44:16</a>).</p>
<p>The “Book of Hope“ (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.30.1-33.26">30–33</a>) does contain some words of judgment (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.28-35">32:28-35</a>), and other sections of the prophecy have a few bright spots (<a href="?bref=Jer.3.11-18">3:11-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.16.14-16">16:14-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.2-8">23:2-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.10-14">29:10-14</a>), but in a volume otherwise dark, these four chapters bring pleasant relief. The climax of hope, as indicated also in the longest NT quotation from Jeremiah (see <a href="?bref=Heb.8.8-12">Heb 8:8-12</a>), predicts a new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.31.31-40">31:31-40</a>). Other prophecies also describe the end of the Mosaic law and sacrament (e.g., <a href="?bref=Jer.3.16">3:16</a>), and the new covenant (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.40">32:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.19-26">33:19-26</a>).</p>
<p>Little is known of Jeremiah’s activity or messages from c. 594–589 <span class="era">BC</span>. Zedekiah’s counselors made clandestine plans for throwing off Babylon’s yoke by alliances with neighbor nations. A traitor may have reported the conspiracy to Babylon (perhaps Edom). After Babylon attacked, Zedekiah sought a hopeful report from Jeremiah but did not get it.</p>
<p>The Recabite faithfulness to the Nazarite vow (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-19">35</a>) dates to the days of Jehoiakim but as an object lesson fits the siege context. Recabites received a human command that they obeyed; Jews received a divine command that they rejected. Recabites will be blessed (<a href="?bref=Jer.35.18-19">35:18-19</a>); Judah, judged (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.35.15-17">15-17</a>). The reading of the scroll to Jehoiakim and his scornful rejection of it (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.36.1-32">36</a>) illustrates the prophetic assertion (<a href="?bref=Jer.35.15">35:15</a>) that destruction follows the rejection of God’s message given through the prophets.</p>
<p>The siege comes into focus in chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.37.1-21">37</a> with another inquiry from Zedekiah (the nonchronological chs <a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-36.32">35–36</a> serve as an illustrative parenthesis). <a href="?bref=Jer.37.11">Jeremiah 37:11</a> moves forward to the time of the lifting of the siege of 589 <span class="era">BC</span> when Nebuchadnezzar drove Pharaoh Hophra’s army back to Egypt. During the reprieve, Jeremiah sought to attend a meeting of relatives to settle family matters at or near Anathoth. Perhaps the trip involved initiating the purchase that would be made two years later (<a href="?bref=Jer.32.6-15">32:6-15</a>). However, as he was leaving the city, he was arrested for desertion to the Babylonians and jailed in a dungeon cell until Zedekiah granted him privileged prisoner status.</p>
<p>The king’s officers had ample cause for the accusation of sedition: Jeremiah had encouraged desertion (<a href="?bref=Jer.21.9">21:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.38.2">38:2</a>). Traitors deserved death, and this was their verdict against Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.4-5">38:4-5</a>). The violence of the time encouraged the officers to select a cruel method of execution: let Jeremiah starve and bury himself in the mire at the bottom of an abandoned cistern. A sympathetic Ethiopian, Ebed-melech, made the rescue. Immediately, the unadulterated prophecies of judgment came forth again from Jeremiah’s lips, including a message to the king that reflected Jeremiah’s own recent experience: “[Your friends] have betrayed and misled you. When your feet sank in the mud, they left you to your fate” (<a href="?bref=Jer.38.22">38:22</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Jer.39.1-43.7">Jeremiah 39:1–43:7</a> records history from the fall of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> to the flight into Egypt, including the liberation of Jeremiah (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.39.1-18">39</a>), appointment and assassination of Gedaliah (chs <a href="?bref=Jer.40.1-41.18">40–41</a>), a warning from God against going to Egypt (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.42.1-22">42</a>), and the obdurate disobedience of the people (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.1-7">43:1-7</a>).</p>
<p>The latest writings of Jeremiah are found in chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.44.1-30">44</a>. The audience consisted of idolatrous Jews (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.4-6">44:4-6</a>) gathered from various parts of Egypt as far as Aswan (Pathros). Jeremiah repeated the appeal of former prophets to reject false gods in favor of Jehovah, but to no avail (<a href="?bref=Jer.44.15-16">44:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>The message to Baruch (ch <a href="?bref=Jer.45.1-5">45</a>), written about 605 <span class="era">BC</span>, is placed here to round out the main part of the book, which begins with the commission to “break down” and “pluck up” (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.10">1:10</a>) and concludes with the same Hebrew words (<a href="?bref=Jer.45.4">45:4</a>). If Baruch had ambition to obtain status in the Judean court like his brother Seraiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.51.59">51:59</a>), he was advised that it would be useless because disaster would come, as the preceding chapters indicate.</p>
<p>The oracles against the nations (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-51.64">46–51</a>), introduced by a title superscription (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.1">46:1</a>), constitute a distinct stylistic division similar to <a href="?bref=Isa.13.1-23.18">Isaiah 13–23</a>, <a href="?bref=Ezek.25.1-32.32">Ezekiel 25–32</a>, and <a href="?bref=Amos.1.3-2.16">Amos 1:3–2:16</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the prophecies against foreign nations in Jeremiah carry dates that show that they were written at different points during his ministry but were collected together for the book.</p>
<p>The prophecy against Egypt opens with a colorful description of Egypt’s expulsion from Carchemish (605 <span class="era">BC</span>) after a short occupancy (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.1-12">Jer 46:1-12</a>). The second message (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.46.13-26">13-26</a>) may picture the attack on Egypt in 601 <span class="era">BC</span> when Neco stopped Nebuchadnezzar at the border; the attack in 589 <span class="era">BC</span> when Hophra lost in his attempt to aid Zedekiah; or (most probably) the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar in 568 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Babylon took advantage of the weakness of Egypt to occupy it. At that time Nebuchadnezzar set up his judgment throne as predicted (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.10">43:10</a>) and meted out death sentences to all rebels, including those Jews who might have been implicated in anti-Babylonian conspiracies. The conclusion of the Egypt oracle repeats part of the Book of Hope (<a href="?bref=Jer.46.27-28">46:27-28</a>, cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.30.10-11">30:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>Messages against Edom, Arabia, Phoenician cities, and Ammon generally condemn pride, cruelty, and idolatry. The oracle against Elam is unique. No other prophet speaks judgment against this people, whose dwelling east of Babylon meant rare contact with Judah. Jeremiah predicted that Elam would be doomed, then restored. Ezekiel counts Elamites among the inhabitants of Sheol (<a href="?bref=Ezek.32.24">Ez 32:24</a>).</p>
<p>The final judgment indicates the unbiased attitude of the prophet. His messages placed him in an advantageous position with the Babylonians, who treated him with respect and kindness, in contrast to their cruelty to other Jews. But when God spoke against Babylon, Jeremiah uttered God’s words without respect to his own comfort, just as he had spoken against Egypt when silence would have been logical for self-preservation.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.51.1-64">51</a> concludes “the words of Jeremiah.”</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.52.1-34">52</a> repeats historical facts previously stated prophetically by Jeremiah, and partially recorded also as history in chapter <a href="?bref=Jer.39.1-18">39</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.1-30">2 Kgs 25</a> and <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.1-23">2 Chr 36</a>). The editor of Jeremiah evidently desired to climax the book with a historical confirmation of Jeremiah’s prophecy, but he included facts beyond those contained elsewhere.</p>

  <title>Jericho</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JERICHO</p>
<p class="fl">Ancient city on the west side of the Jordan River. The name Jericho may be connected to the ancient name of the Canaanite moon god. The Hebrew words for moon, month, new moon, and Jericho are very similar. Others associate it with the word for spirit or smell, assuming that the pleasant fragrances of the fruits and spices that grew in this oasis occasioned the name of the place. The OT occasionally calls it “the city of palm trees” (e.g., <a href="?bref=Deut.34.3">Dt 34:3</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.28.15">2 Chr 28:15</a>).</p>
<p>Jericho was located on the west side of the Jordan River about five miles (8 kilometers) from the southernmost fords and about ten miles (16 kilometers) northwest of the Dead Sea. Being in the broad part of the plain of the Jordan, it lies nearly 1,000 feet (305 meters) below sea level and about 3,500 feet (1,067 meters) below Jerusalem, which was a mere 17 miles (27 kilometers) away. This simple topographical fact explains the incidental words in Jesus’ parable of the good Samaritan, “down from Jerusalem to Jericho” (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.30">Lk 10:30</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="h3">Prebiblical Record</p>
<p class="fl">Jericho was a large and thriving city for centuries, even millennia, before the Bible first mentions it in connection with the exodus from Egypt. In fact, Jericho is one of the oldest cities in the world, with remains dating to and before the Neolithic Age 10,000 years ago.</p>
<p>For three reasons primitive people would have chosen this site, first as a settlement and eventually as a key city: (1) It has a copious spring, now called Elisha’s Fountain (cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.18-22">2 Kgs 2:18-22</a>). (2) It has a warm climate in the winter, although “hot” describes it in the summer. (3) It is strategically located at a Jordan ford and at the base of several routes leading westward to the foothills.</p>
<p>The comings and goings of various populations can be reconstructed only sketchily from noninscriptional archaeological data. The civilizations grew more complex over the years, going from a simple food-gathering economy at first to the relatively complex urban society, complete with king, soldiers, and guest houses, that Joshua encountered. The first certain identification of its inhabitants occurs in <a href="?bref=Num.13.29">Numbers 13:29</a>: “The Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfJericho"/>
<p class="h3">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The Jericho of the OT is best known as the first city taken by the invading Israelites through the miracle of the falling walls. Having spent some time on the east bank of the Jordan in the plains of Moab (<a href="?bref=Num.22.1">Nm 22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.26.3,63">26:3, 63</a>), the Israelites targeted it as the first military objective in the Conquest. Joshua sent spies to reconnoiter the land and the city. Rahab the harlot took them in and later engineered their escape. For her cooperation, she and her family were spared when Israel destroyed the city (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.1-24">Jos 2</a>, <a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-27">6</a>). The fall of the city itself occurred after the Israelites had marched around it in silence, except for the continual blowing of trumpets, once a day for six days and then seven times on the seventh day. Then, as the priests blew the trumpets, the people shouted and the walls collapsed.</p>
<p>Joshua laid a curse on anyone who might rebuild Jericho (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.26">Jos 6:26</a>). The curse was fulfilled about 500 years later when Hiel rebuilt the city at the cost of two of his sons (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kgs 16:34</a>).</p>
<p>Jericho was in the territory of Benjamin but right on the border with the territory of Ephraim to the north (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.1,7">Jos 16:1, 7</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.12,21">18:12, 21</a>) and appears in scattered incidents throughout the rest of the OT. In <a href="?bref=2Sam.10.5">2 Samuel 10:5</a> (see also <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.5">1 Chr 19:5</a>) David had his humiliated ambassadors wait there until their beards grew back. It served as a kind of headquarters for Elisha and apparently was where a “company of the prophets” lived (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.5">2 Kgs 2:5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.10.5">1 Sm 10:5</a>). During the time of Ahaz, a return of prisoners took place there (<a href="?bref=2Chr.28.15">2 Chr 28:15</a>). When Jerusalem fell in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, the reigning king, Zedekiah, fled to near Jericho but was caught by the Babylonians, who later put out his eyes at Riblah in Syria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.5">2 Kgs 25:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.39.5">Jer 39:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.52.8">52:8</a>). The last OT references to Jericho are in the census lists of Ezra (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.34">Ezr 2:34</a>) and Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.7.36">Neh 7:36</a>). Men from Jericho also helped rebuild the Jerusalem wall (<a href="?bref=Neh.3.2">3:2</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">First, it must be understood that the Jericho of NT times was built by Herod more than a mile to the south of the OT site, at the mouth of the Wadi Qilt. It is possible to sort out the healing of the blind men episodes in the synoptic Gospels by understanding that Jesus was passing from the site of ancient Jericho (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.29">Mt 20:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.10.46">Mk 10:46</a>) and approaching Herodian Jericho (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.35">Lk 18:35</a>). The modern city of Jericho includes both these sites. As Jesus passed through Jericho (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.1">19:1</a>) he met and ate with Zacchaeus, the wealthy chief tax collector of the new Roman Jericho. The city also figures in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.30-37">10:30-37</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Postbiblical Record</p>
<p class="fl">While ancient Jericho was of small consequence after its destruction under Joshua, the Jericho of Herod was a city of beauty and importance. But even this city fell into decay with the decline of Roman influence in the Middle East. Most of what we know of the city until modern times comes from the writings of pilgrims to the Holy Land. They usually report seeing certain things of biblical significance, such as the tree that Zacchaeus climbed, but they also report that Jericho was a squalid, wretched Muslim village. And such it has been until relatively recent times, when it grew in size and importance as a major West Bank city.</p>

  <title>Jeroboam</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JEROBOAM</p>
<p class="fl">Name of two kings who reigned in the northern kingdom of Israel: Jeroboam I (930–909 <span class="era">BC</span>), the originator and first monarch of the 10 tribes of Israel, and Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>), the 14th king of the northern kingdom.</p>
<p class="list-space">1. Jeroboam I was the son of Nebat from Ephraim’s tribe. He also served King Solomon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.26">1 Kgs 11:26</a>) and his efforts had been rewarded by his placement as the supervisor of an Ephraimite work force. Jeroboam, therefore, helped rebuild an important section of the defenses of Jerusalem (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.27-28">27-28</a>). This efficient and energetic young man did not remain in the employ of Solomon for long, however. Jeroboam’s background, his tribe’s pride, and the oppression of Solomon had produced a young rebel. Ahijah, the prophet of Shiloh, met Jeroboam outside Jerusalem one day and did a startling thing—he tore a new garment he was wearing into 12 pieces and gave 10 of them to Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.29-30">1 Kgs 11:29-30</a>). Ahijah had symbolically shown Jeroboam that God would give him 10 tribes and would leave the Davidic line intact (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.31-39">31-39</a>). Solomon’s idolatry had brought this judgment upon the Davidic line (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.33">33</a>). Although precise details of a revolt are not given (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.7">7</a>), Jeroboam fled to Egypt in order to save his life (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.40">40</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After Solomon’s death, Jeroboam returned to Palestine and approached Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, with a request that his program of oppression cease (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-4">1 Kgs 12:1-4</a>). Rehoboam asked for three days to consult with his advisers before answering (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.5-11">5-11</a>). The counsel of the older advisers was toward clemency, but younger hotheads prevailed with their counsel of increased taxation and forced labor (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.12-14">12-14</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The Israelites responded by rejecting Rehoboam. Jeroboam was quickly elected king of the northern tribes (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.20">1 Kgs 12:20</a>), and an uneasy cease-fire temporarily stabilized relationships between the two kingdoms at their division (930 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Being ambitious and skillful, Jeroboam built two capital cities, one at Shechem (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.12.6-8">Gn 12:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-35">Jos 8:30-35</a>), in the territory west of the Jordan, and one at Penuel (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.32.30">Gn 32:30</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.8.17">Jgs 8:17</a>), east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.25">1 Kgs 12:25</a>). He reinstituted the cult of the golden calves, substituting an ancient religion for the worship of Jehovah. He changed the centers of worship, the object of worship, the priesthood, and the time of worship. The new centers became Bethel and Dan (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.29">29</a>); Bethel was a place of patriarchal worship (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.10-22">Gn 28:10-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.31.13">31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.1-7">35:1-7</a>), and Dan was the site of a renegade Levitical worship established for the tribe of Dan in the days of the judges (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">Jgs 18</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The object of worship became the idol calf (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.28">1 Kgs 12:28</a>). The worship was based upon Aaron’s participation in the first instance of this idolatry in Israel. Aaron had presented the golden calf at Sinai as a visible representation of the invisible Yahweh who had brought Israel out of Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.32.4-5">Ex 32:4-5</a>). This compromise religion would yet have an appeal to Yahweh worshipers. Aaron’s prior establishment of this worship added to the appeal for those who were reluctant to separate from Levitical methodology. The Levites in Dan would also add to the authentication of the calf worship.</p>
<p class="list-text">Doubtless, the Egyptian sojourn of Jeroboam contributed to this turn of events. The Egyptians’ worship of Amon-Re, the sun god, included his representation as a bull. The bull in Egyptian worship was intended to visibly represent an invisible deity. This concept could have easily been transferred by the Israelites to their worship of the invisible Yahweh.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeroboam’s idolatry would result in the ultimate destruction of his line (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.33-34">1 Kgs 13:33-34</a>). An immediate result was the death of his son Abijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.1-18">14:1-18</a>). Jeroboam’s plan to deceive the prophet Ahijah failed and became the means of pronouncing judgment upon the house of Jeroboam and the northern kingdom (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.7-16">7-16</a>). One manifestation of the gradual decline of Israel was the defeat Jeroboam suffered at the hand of Abijah of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Chr.13.1-20">2 Chr 13:1-20</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeroboam I died after reigning 22 years over Israel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.19-20">1 Kgs 14:19-20</a>). His remaining son, Nadab, ruled for only two years before he was assassinated by Baasha of the tribe of Issachar (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.14.20">1 Kgs 14:20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.25-31">15:25-31</a>). The whole household of Jeroboam was then killed by Baasha, fulfilling the prophecy of Ahijah concerning the end of the dynasty of Jeroboam. Yet even Baasha walked in the footsteps of Jeroboam’s apostasy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.15.34">1 Kgs 15:34</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Jeroboam II, the son of Joash (or Jehoash, 798–782 <span class="era">BC</span>), reigned over Israel longer than any other northern king even though he followed the evil example of his ancestral namesake, Jeroboam I (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23-24">2 Kgs 14:23-24</a>). His reign of 41 years included an 11-year co-regency with his father. Evidently, Joash had taken steps to ensure the stability of his kingdom before meeting Amaziah of Judah in battle (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.8-14">2 Kgs 14:8-14</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.25.5-24">2 Chr 25:5-24</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jeroboam II ruled in the city of Samaria (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.23">2 Kgs 14:23</a>). The archaeological evidence at Samaria indicates a reconstruction program in the royal palace during the prosperous reigns of Joash and Jeroboam II. In 1910 excavators found over 60 inscribed potsherds that were invoices or labels for oil and wine sent to the royal stores for use in the king’s service. The limited number of place-names (27) on the potsherds indicates that the shipments of these commodities were not a nationwide levy of taxes but were probably all from properties belonging to the royal house. These illustrate the extensive holdings and opulence of the royal house in Israel during the reign of Jeroboam II.</p>
<p class="list-text">Large numbers of carved decorative plaques and panels of ivory were also found in the ruins of Samaria, a reminder of the wealth of the northern kingdom in its latter days. The influence of the pagan societies of Syria, Assyria, and Egypt can be seen by the various figures of deities on the ivories.</p>
<p class="list-text">The prophet Jonah, son of Amittai, had prophesied the acquisition of power by Jeroboam II (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">2 Kgs 14:25</a>). Although Jeroboam’s reign was late in the history of the northern kingdom, God still desired to exhibit his long-suffering and faithful covenant-keeping love, offering Israel repentance (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.26-28">26-28</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The northern kingdom reached its greatest extension since the time of Solomon as the result of God’s care for Israel during Jeroboam’s reign. The boundaries stretched from Hamath on the Orontes River in the north to the Gulf of Aqaba, with its cities of Elath and Ezion-geber, in the south. Prosperity did not suffice to deliver Israel from internal and external problems, however. The extensive corruption in government and the degenerate spiritual state of the people propelled Israel into the tumultuous days that would end in the utter destruction of the northern kingdom. Jeroboam’s own life must have been in danger from conspirators. Amaziah, a priest at Bethel, even accused the prophet Amos of conspiring to assassinate Jeroboam (<a href="?bref=Amos.7.8-17">Am 7:8-17</a>). Amos had actually prophesied the captivity of Israel and the fall of Jeroboam’s dynasty. The word of God had become a threat to Jeroboam because of the hardness of the hearts of all in Israel, including the king.</p>
<p class="list-text">Economic depression, moral deterioration, political weakness, and governmental corruption served to hasten the fall of Israel. The rich landowners, including Jeroboam II, had oppressed the less wealthy citizens and had forced small landowners to migrate from their farms to the cities.</p>
<p class="list-text">Within six months of the death of Jeroboam II, the prophecy concerning the end of the dynasty of Jehu (Jeroboam was the fourth king of that line) was fulfilled (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.29">2 Kgs 14:29</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.8-12">15:8-12</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.12-31">10:12-31</a>). As the son of Jeroboam I, Nadab, was assassinated, so the son of Jeroboam II, Zechariah, was assassinated. Thirty-one years after the death of Jeroboam II, the prophecies concerning the captivity of Israel were fulfilled (722 <span class="era">BC</span>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.17.5-41">2 Kgs 17:5-41</a>).</p>

<p class="h2" id="MeaningoftheName">Meaning of the Name</p>
<p class="h3">Egyptian Meaning</p>
<p class="fl">The earliest mention of the name occurs in the Egyptian Execration Texts of the 19th and 18th centuries <span class="era">BC</span> in the form probably transliterated <span class="ital">Urusalimum.</span></p>
<p class="h3">Semitic Meaning</p>
<p class="fl">In the 14th century <span class="era">BC</span> the name appears in the Abdi-Hepa correspondence from Tell el-Amarna, written <span class="ital">Urusalim.</span> Later it is found in the inscription of the Assyrian monarch Sennacherib, written <span class="ital">Ursalimmu.</span> The two transparently Semitic elements, <span class="ital">uru</span> (city) and <span class="ital">salim</span> (a divine name), have produced the hyphenated composite meaning “the city of [the god] Salim.” Hyphenating geographic names to incorporate divine elements was a common practice in the ancient Near Eastern world, and the deity Salim, or Shalem (Akkadian, Shulmanu; cf. Solomon), was a member of the Amorite pantheon (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.3">Ez 16:3</a>). Since the oldest textual evidence—Egyptian, West Semitic, and Akkadian—supports only <span class="ital">urusalim,</span> and since the OT itself attests that Jerusalem was not originally a Hebrew city, it is probable that the Semitic etymological origin of this name produced the meaning “the city of [the god] Salim.”</p>
<p class="h3">Hebrew/Aramaic Meaning</p>
<p class="fl">In the Hebrew OT, Jerusalem is written <span class="hebrew">yerushalayim</span><span class="ital">,</span> and in the Aramaic portions the name is rendered <span class="ital">yerushalem.</span> Containing the elements <span class="hebrew">yarah</span> (“to found,” cf. <a href="?bref=Job.38.6">Jb 38:6</a>) and <span class="hebrew">shalem</span> (a divine name), it yields the meaning “the foundation of [the god] Shalem,” the <span class="ital">sh</span> of the Hebrew/Aramaic to be taken as the phonemic equivalent of the Akkadian <span class="ital">s.</span></p>
<p class="h3">Greek Meaning</p>
<p class="fl">In the NT, Jerusalem translates the two Greek words <span class="greek">Ierousalem</span> and <span class="greek">Hierosoluma</span><span class="ital">.</span> The former is simply the Greek transliteration of the OT Aramaic form; the latter reflects the word <span class="greek">hieros</span> (holy), representing a Hellenized paronomasia, corresponding neither with the Semitic root of the name nor with the city’s historical reality.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfJerusalem"/>
<p class="h2" id="GeographicalSituation">Geographical Situation</p>
<p class="fl">Jerusalem is situated 31º 46’ 45” north latitude and 35º 13’ 25” east longitude. The city rises to just over 2,500 feet (762 meters) above sea level and rests some 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) west of the northern end of the Dead Sea and approximately 33 miles (53 kilometers) east of the Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>A Mediterranean climate pervades Jerusalem. From October to May, the city experiences its rainy season, with an annual accumulation of about 25 inches (63.5 centimeters). Throughout January and February the rains are often driven by winds, and the mercury drops to near freezing (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezra.10.9">Ezr 10:9</a>); the coldest weather coincides with the days of heaviest rainfall. Snow falls two years out of three. There is no rain between May and September, and a high percentage of solar radiation produces oppressive heat.</p>
<p>Like Rome, Jerusalem is a city set on hills. A cluster of five hills comprise the denuded quadrilateral landmass roughly one mile (1.6 kilometers) long and one-half mile (.8 kilometer) wide, bordered on all sides, except the north, by deep ravines. Stationed astride the crest of Palestine’s central plateau and located at the crossroad of the watershed route connecting Hebron, Bethlehem, Shechem (Nablus), and points north with the longitudinal route from the Jordan Valley and the several arteries to the Mediterranean, Jerusalem is commercially central to the country. The lateral highway through the Judean mountains and eastward could not pass south of Jerusalem, being blocked by the Dead Sea and its sheer cliffs. Because it lacked significant water supply, the city’s strategic commercial location was probably the deciding criterion for its original occupation.</p>
<p>Water, a lifeline of civilization, has always been in meager supply at Jerusalem. The only natural source of permanent water was the spring at Gihon, today sometimes called the Virgin’s Fountain, located in the Kidron Valley immediately east of the ancient fortress conquered by David. Tunnels were burrowed to provide access to the Gihon when Jerusalem was besieged. Later, the Siloam Tunnel was cut through nearly 1,800 feet (548.6 meters) of limestone, allowing the waters of the Gihon to pass through the hill of Zion to the pool of Siloam.</p>
<p>Farther south, where the Kidron and Hinnom Valleys converge, there was another spring, called En-rogel in the Bible (modern Bir Eyyub). Owing to the lowering of the water table, this source of water ceased to percolate and was subsequently converted into a well.</p>
<p>These two sources were clearly insufficient to sustain a sizable population, and both were too deep in the Kidron to be employed for irrigation. Hence, a vast network of cisterns, reservoirs, and water conduits for supplemental supply has been devised since ancient times.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="h3">The Pre-Israelite Period</p>
<p class="fl">Paleolithic and Mesolithic flint implements of an Acheulian type found in the plain of the Rephaim constitute the earliest evidence of the existence of human beings in the area of Jerusalem. Near the beginning of the fourth millennium <span class="era">BC</span>, the southeastern hill was first occupied by a sedentary group, a fact evinced from the artifactual remains recovered from three graves and the pottery type discovered on bedrock. By 1800 <span class="era">BC</span>, the crest of the southeastern hill was walled in rudimentary form.</p>
<p>From the Bible one learns that Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, king of Salem (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.17-20">Gn 14:17-20</a>). Again (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.22.1-24">22</a>) the great patriarch visited an area later incorporated into Jerusalem, Mt Moriah, the site where Isaac was nearly sacrificed. <a href="?bref=2Chr.3.1">Second Chronicles 3:1</a> identifies Mt Moriah as the temple hill. In the 15th century <span class="era">BC</span> or thereabouts the Hurrians (possibly the biblical Horites) penetrated into Palestine. About the same time at Jerusalem, extensive building activities were initiated and improved fortification methods were introduced. Accordingly, most writers attribute these projects at Jerusalem to the Hurrian infiltration.</p>
<p class="h3">Conquest and Settlement Period</p>
<p class="fl">Upon learning of Gibeon’s placation of Joshua’s army (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">Jos 9</a>), Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, formed a coalition with the kings of Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon and attacked Gibeon. In response, Joshua marshaled his forces and defeated the coalition, killing all five monarchs at Makkedah (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.16-27">Jos 10:16-27</a>). It appears that the tribe of Judah temporarily took control of Jerusalem and burned it in the wake of this victory (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.8">Jgs 1:8</a>). However, the Jebusites reoccupied the site (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.63">Jos 15:63</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.4-5">1 Chr 11:4-5</a>). Apparently, the Jebusites more or less maintained control of Jerusalem until the time of David.</p>
<p>The city appears again as a boundary separating the tribal inheritances of Judah and Benjamin, becoming the southern border of the latter’s domain. The identification of the “shoulder of the Jebusite” (<span class="sc">rsv</span> <a href="?bref=Josh.15.8">Jos 15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16">18:16</a>) with Jerusalem is usually explained as a reference to the southwestern hill, probably held also by the Jebusites at this time.</p>
<p class="h3">David’s Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">Following the Philistine victory atop Mt Gilboa, where Saul and Jonathan were killed in battle (<a href="?bref=1Sam.31.1-13">1 Sm 31</a>), David reigned over the tribe of Judah from Hebron, while a surviving son of Saul, Ishbosheth, ruled over the northern tribes from Mahanaim. During the two-year struggle that ensued, the house of David grew stronger while the forces of Ishbosheth shrunk considerably (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.1">2 Sm 3:1</a>). This struggle culminated in the death and decapitation of Ishbosheth and the dispersion of his forces. David became the undisputed monarch of all the tribes of Israel.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="ExplorationsAndExcavations"/>
<p>But the new monarch recognized that a consolidated national capital acceptable to both the north and the south would have to be created. Jerusalem had remained neutral in the conflict, being the site of a Jebusite enclave. It also represented a location that was militarily desirable, and by being commercially central to the fledgling nation, it was ideally suited.</p>
<p>In the course of David’s 33-year reign at Jerusalem he made the city into the center of an empire that stretched from Egypt to the Euphrates River. He engaged in considerable building and expansion of the city. He fortified the Canaanite walls and prepared an extension of the city, possibly along the east slope of Zion.</p>
<p>David also constructed a royal residence, receiving the technology and many materials from Hiram, king of Tyre (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.11">2 Sm 5:11</a>). <a href="?bref=Neh.12.37">Nehemiah 12:37</a> suggests that this palace also may have been near the east side of the southeastern hill. It was from a window of this house that Michal saw David dancing in an undignified manner—according to her perception (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.16-23">2 Sm 6:16-23</a>). From the roof of this palace David gazed upon Bathsheba as she bathed (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.2-5">11:2-5</a>), and from this residence he plotted the murder of her husband, Uriah (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.14-25">14-25</a>).</p>
<p>By bringing the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-15">2 Sm 6:1-15</a>)—implying that Yahweh would reside there—David displayed his most profound leadership. For in this perceptive act he merged for the first time in Israel’s history its political and religious capitals. Jerusalem took on the unique character of a holy city <span class="ital">and</span> a royal city. As a result, the city would be known as the “city of David” (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.7">5:7</a>) as well as the “city of God” (<a href="?bref=Ps.46.4">Ps 46:4</a>). Adult male Jews would make their pilgrimages to Jerusalem to take part in the feasts and offerings. It only remained for David to make this arrangement permanent, to enshrine Yahweh at Jerusalem forever by building him a temple. David aspired to do so (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.1-29">2 Sm 7</a>), but God responded that such an undertaking was to be reserved for a son of the king.</p>
<p class="h3">The First Temple Period</p>
<p class="fl">A growing national realization of the extent and impact of the Davidic empire was employed by Solomon to full advantage. Himself an innovative and dynamic administrator, Solomon turned Jerusalem into a cosmopolitan center. The revenues of caravans from Egypt to Babylonia as well as the Phoenician trade with Elath, the Red Sea, and Ophir passed through his royal capital. Solomon’s own naval fleet traveled as far as Tarshish, most likely located on an island along the western coast of Spain. These expeditions returned every three years with such exotic commodities as apes, peacocks, silver, iron, tin, ivory, and gold. The capital swelled with residents and visitors, and the monarch’s fame became proverbial (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.1-29">1 Kgs 10</a>).</p>
<p>Solomon was the great OT builder of Jerusalem. His most significant building enterprise was undoubtedly the first temple. Erected on the summit of the temple hill, this edifice required seven years to construct, from April/May 966 (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.1">1 Kgs 6:1</a>) to October/November 959 (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.6.38">38</a>). Hiram again provided both the technology and the cedar beams.</p>
<p>One may find in <a href="?bref=1Kgs.10.27">1 Kings 10:27</a> a succinct encapsulation of the economic wealth lavished upon Jerusalem by Solomon: silver became as abundant as stone, and cedar was as common as sycamore. It is estimated that the annual revenues that coursed into Jerusalem were as high as $17 million. Ironically, it was the fiscal factor that became the burden of Solomon’s monarchy. Overextending himself financially, his economic and political programs soon required the levying of heavy taxes (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.7-19">1 Kgs 4:7-19</a>) and the drafting of Israelites into forced labor (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.5.13-18">1 Kgs 5:13-18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.20-23">9:20-23</a>). These were the primary factors that prompted the schism in Israel’s political structure after the death of Solomon and resulted in a divided monarchy by 930 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>When the Babylonian army laid final siege to Jerusalem (588 <span class="era">BC</span>), capturing it after many months, the city was completely decimated. The temple and Solomon’s palace were destroyed with fire; the city walls were demolished. The temple treasures were completely plundered, and the citizens were deported in large numbers.</p>
<p class="h3">The Second Temple Period</p>
<p class="fl">Jerusalem’s doom and 70-year captivity had been spelled out by Jeremiah (<a href="?bref=Jer.25.11">Jer 25:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.29.10">29:10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Chr.36.21">2 Chr 36:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Dan.9.2">Dn 9:2</a>). In 538 <span class="era">BC</span>, after the fall of Babylon, Cyrus, king of Persia, issued his famous proclamation (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.22-23">2 Chr 36:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-4">Ezr 1:1-4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.44.28">Is 44:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.45.1">45:1</a>). Thereupon, a humble group of Jews returned to Jerusalem with Sheshbazzar, a prince of Judah (<a href="?bref=Ezra.1.8-11">Ezr 1:8-11</a>) and Zerubbabel (<a href="?bref=Ezra.2.2">2:2</a>). In 515 <span class="era">BC</span>, the doors of the second temple were opened officially, and the Passover feast was again observed from Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Ezra.6.15-18">6:15-18</a>).</p>
<p>Ezra came to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes (<a href="?bref=Ezra.7.7">Ezr 7:7</a>). Assuming this is a reference to Artaxerxes I, the date of Ezra’s return would have been 458 <span class="era">BC</span>. Again, it was only a meager remnant who felt the compelling urge to make that difficult journey (cf. Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 11.1.3).</p>
<p>Moved by reports of troubled conditions (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.3-4">Neh 1:3-4</a>), Nehemiah, in the 20th year of Artaxerxes (445 <span class="era">BC</span>), was able to leave his post as cup-bearer to the king and to go to Jerusalem. If the concern of the earlier returnees focused upon the temple, Nehemiah’s was upon the city walls. His is the most comprehensive description of Jerusalem’s postexilic city walls and topography (<a href="?bref=Neh.2.11-16">Neh 2:11-16</a>). Spurred on by his energetic enthusiasm, the people completed the task of rebuilding the walls in 52 days (<a href="?bref=Neh.6.15">6:15</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheWailingWallInJerusalem"/>
<p class="h3">The Roman Period</p>
<p class="fl">In 40 <span class="era">BC</span>, with the aid of the Parthians, Antigonus attacked and seized Jerusalem, forcing Herod to escape by night. He journeyed to Rome, where the Senate appointed him as “king of the Jews” (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1">Mt 2:1</a>). Armed with this new authority, Herod marshaled two Roman legions, and in 37 <span class="era">BC</span>, he succeeded in forever expelling the Parthians. So began the long and infamous rule of Herod, who reigned at Jerusalem for 33 years (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>).</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that Jerusalem enjoyed prosperous and peaceful years during his reign. Herod transformed the external aspect of Jerusalem. He transferred the seat of government to the southwestern hill. Here he erected a lavish palace, an arena for athletic contests, a theater, and a vast aqueduct network.</p>
<p>Other building projects concerned the temple hill. Herod transformed the old Maccabean fortress into a much larger structure and named it Antonia, in honor of Mark Antony. In the temple area proper he enlarged the esplanade on both the north and south sides, giving it a rectangular shape. Herod’s reconstruction of the temple was undertaken in 20 <span class="era">BC</span>, and it was not completed until around <span class="era">AD</span> 64, just six years prior to its destruction by Titus (cf. <a href="?bref=John.2.20">Jn 2:20</a>).</p>

  <title>Jerusalem, New</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JERUSALEM, New</p>
<p class="fl">Phrase appearing only twice in the Bible, once near the beginning and once near the end of the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.3.12">Rv 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">21:2</a>). In the first of the great visions of that book, the risen Christ speaks to his people in the midst of their conflict in this world. Among his promises to those who conquer is that they will one day be citizens of the new Jerusalem. The last of the book’s visions shows the fulfillment of this promise. There we see not only the victorious people of God but also the city that is to be their home in a new world.</p>
<p>This does not, of course, answer the question “What is the new Jerusalem?” A description of what it is like would be relatively simple. An explanation of what it <span class="ital">is</span> would be more complicated.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DescriptionoftheCity">Description of the City</p>
<p class="fl">An angel takes John to a mountaintop to show him the new Jerusalem. In the account that follows (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.10-22.5">Rv 21:10–22:5</a>), the first thing John notes is the light, like a great jewel-like lamp, that lights the city (“the glory of God,” <a href="?bref=Rev.21.11">21:11</a>). Then he describes its walls and gates (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.12-14">21:12-14</a>). The 12 gates bear the names of the tribes of Israel, and the wall between each gate and the next forms a single “foundation,” or block, bearing the name of one of the 12 apostles of Christ. Next, the measurements of the city are given (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.21.15-17">15-17</a>). It is 1,400 miles (2,220 kilometers) each way—not only in breadth and in length but also in height—and its wall is 216 feet (65.8 meters) thick (or high?). By working out these equivalents in miles and feet, however, we miss what John would probably have thought much more important. According to the biblical units of measurement, the city is 12,000 stadia broad and its wall is 144 cubits thick. These numbers are symbolic; as multiples of 12, they signify perfection, as do other occurrences of 12 in Revelation (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rev.7.4-8">7:4-8</a>).</p>
<p>After this, John describes the materials of which the new Jerusalem is built (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.18-21">21:18-21</a>). The wall is of jasper; its foundation layers are encrusted with other precious stones; its gates are pearls; and the streets and buildings within are made of “transparent gold.” As for the city itself, John notes a series of things that it does <span class="ital">not</span> have (vv <a href="?bref=Rev.21.22-27">22-27</a>)—no temple, no sun or moon, no night, no closing of its gates, and no evil. Finally, there are the three wonderful things that it <span class="ital">does</span> have (<a href="?bref=Rev.22.1-5">22:1-5</a>)—the river of the water of life, the tree of life, and the throne and presence of God himself.</p>
<p>Such is the new Jerusalem as John describes it. But he wants us not so much to picture what the city looks like as to understand what it means.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BackgroundoftheCity">Background of the City</p>
<p class="fl">OT history presents the city of David, old Jerusalem, as the place where God’s rule over his people and his presence among them was centered. In that Jerusalem stood both the temple, where the priests served, and the throne of the kings who governed as God’s deputies. It was the metropolis, or “mother city,” of Israel, the people of God. But the whole Bible is about God’s redeeming a people for himself, out of all nations, in all ages—a greater Israel of which OT Israel is only the vanguard. So it is natural that the last revelation the Bible gives should be a vision of that greater people—home at last in the true mother city, a new and greater Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The OT prophets witnessed the decline of old Jerusalem. They watched with grief and anger as it disappointed the hope that it would live up to its high destiny. As it became infected with sin and folly, and as its kings and priests increasingly betrayed their calling, two of these prophets in particular began to look forward to a Jerusalem that one day would be what it was meant to be. Ezekiel (chs <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">40–48</a>) foresaw the city and its temple reconstructed in detail; Isaiah (chs <a href="?bref=Isa.52.1-15">52</a>, <a href="?bref=Isa.60.1-66.24">60–66</a>) described this latter-day Jerusalem in even more glowing terms. The vision of both prophets tie in closely with the vision John records in <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-22.21">Revelation 21–22</a>.</p>
<p>In the period between the OT and NT, Jewish writers became yet more disillusioned with the way things were going, and they encouraged their readers not so much with hopes of the renewal of the earthly Jerusalem as with imaginative descriptions of the heavenly one. This, they reckoned, existed already; at the end of the age it would come down from God out of heaven, the metropolis of his people, populous and beautiful, the place of his temple and throne. In fact, what was imagined by these apocalyptic writers is in many respects very like what would in due course actually be seen by John.</p>
<p>Jesus develops all these lines of thought in quite a remarkable way. It is not simply that he foretells the final destruction of Jerusalem and its temple (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.41-44">Lk 19:41-44</a>). If that were all, it would leave a great question unanswered. For old Jerusalem existed for a purpose, as we have seen; and if it is to be destroyed, how can that purpose then be fulfilled? Where will God’s people then find his throne and his temple?</p>
<p>Jesus’ answer is that, since the Incarnation, God’s rule and God’s presence are to be found <span class="ital">in him</span> (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.18">Mt 28:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.14.9">Jn 14:9</a>). He himself is the “new Jerusalem”—an entirely new kind of Jerusalem. This is borne out by the word for “new” that John uses in Revelation. There are two distinct Greek words translated in English Bibles as “new.” Sometime after the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, the emperor Hadrian built a “new” Jerusalem; that was the kind of “new” that simply meant the latest in a series of cities on the same site. But John’s vision is of a Jerusalem that is “new” in the sense of being fresh, clean, and different. The NT speaks in the same way of the new covenant and the new commandment (<a href="?bref=John.13.34">Jn 13:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.8.8">Heb 8:8</a>), the new creation and the new man (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.17">2 Cor 5:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.2.15">Eph 2:15</a>). John’s vision brings out the same truth by telling of seven things that will exist “no more” in the new heaven and earth: no more sea, death, sorrow, crying, pain, curse, or night (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.1,4">Rv 21:1, 4</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.3-5">22:3-5</a>). In these respects all will be new and different.</p>
<p>There are five passages elsewhere in the NT that help to fill in the background to <a href="?bref=Rev.21.1-27">Revelation 21</a>. In <a href="?bref=Gal.4.26">Galatians 4:26</a> Paul speaks of “Jerusalem above,” the mother city of all who receive salvation by faith, as opposed to the old Jerusalem, where those belong who seek to please God by trying to obey the law (v <a href="?bref=Gal.4.25">25</a>). In <a href="?bref=Eph.5.25-32">Ephesians 5:25-32</a> he speaks of the bride of Christ, by which he means the church; in John’s vision the “bride” is the “city” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.9-10">Rv 21:9-10</a>). In <a href="?bref=Phil.3.20">Philippians 3:20</a> we are told that the heavenly city is not simply the future home of believers but also the place of their present “citizenship.” <a href="?bref=Heb.12.22">Hebrews 12:22</a> makes the same point: those who believe have arrived already at the “heavenly Jerusalem.” In other words, <span class="ital">this</span> Jerusalem is the home of all God’s believing people, Jew and Gentile, from OT and NT times, and it seems not only to be future but also to exist already, in some sense, in the present. What, then, are we to make of John’s vision?</p>
<p class="h2" id="MeaningoftheCity">Meaning of the City</p>
<p class="fl">Some of those who expect a future Millennium (1,000-year earthly reign of Christ, between his second coming and final defeat of Satan) believe that the new Jerusalem belongs to the Millennium, because of certain indications that they think suit that period better than the eternal state that will follow it (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.24-26">Rv 21:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.2">22:2</a>). They visualize it as a literal, material city. It will presumably, then, be in the shape of a cube, or perhaps a pyramid, and some even picture it hovering like an immense spaceship above the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Most millennarians, however, and also many who do not believe in a millennium in the sense just mentioned, think that John is describing the city as it will be in eternity. They, too, may take it literally, or they think that giving the literal details in these chapters—the city’s measurements, materials, and so on—is the only way in which John could describe something that is in fact indescribable (though nonetheless real).</p>
<p>In line with the message of the entire book of Revelation, many take the new Jerusalem to be the ideal city of God, which belongs not only to the future but also to the present. It exists here and now because it is a spiritual truth, not a material one. It is always “coming down . . . out of heaven” precisely because it comes to men “from God” (<a href="?bref=Rev.21.2">21:2</a>). The fact remains, of course, that everything John records in the last two chapters of Revelation belongs to a world that will only appear after the first heaven and the first earth have passed away—a world that is (to us, at any rate) still future.</p>
<p>Taking into account all these Scriptures, we may come closest to understanding the new Jerusalem if we see it as the community of Christ and his people, which will appear in its perfection only when this age has come to an end. Yet, in another sense, Christians belong to it already, and it gives them both an ideal to strive for in this world and a hope to anticipate in the next.</p>

  <title>Jerusalem Council*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JERUSALEM COUNCIL*</p>
<p class="fl">Meeting described in <a href="?bref=Acts.15.6-29">Acts 15:6-29</a>, held about <span class="era">AD</span> 50. Acts records that the conference was held to deal with the question of the requirement for gentile salvation raised by Jews first in Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.26-15.1">14:26–15:1</a>) and later in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.3-5">15:3-5</a>). The matter was subjected to lengthy consideration by the apostles and the elders (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.6">6</a>), with Peter (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.7-11">7-11</a>), Paul and Barnabas (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.12,22-26">12, 22-26</a>), and James the brother of Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.13-21">13-21</a>), who seems to have been the moderator.</p>
<p>The major points agreed upon by the council were the following: (1) God makes no distinction between believers, Jewish or Gentile (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.9">15:9</a>); (2) salvation is by grace through faith (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.9-11">9-11</a>); (3) God confirmed his acceptance of Gentiles through signs and wonders (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.8,12">8, 12</a>); (4) inclusion of the Gentiles among his people was part of the divine intention revealed in the OT (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.15-18">15-18</a>; quoting <a href="?bref=Amos.9.11-12">Am 9:11-12</a>). The assembly also issued a list (sometimes called “the decree”) instructing gentile Christians to abstain from (1) idolatry, (2) fornication, (3) eating animals that had been strangled, and (4) consuming blood. (The last two items pertained to dietary matters that greatly separated Jews from Gentiles.) The decision was circulated by letter to churches in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.23">Acts 15:23</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Acts.16.4">16:4</a>).</p>
<p>The account, when viewed within its place in the book of Acts as a whole, forms the culmination of the struggle by the early church to understand itself. The Judaism from which Christianity arose was a legalistic religion wherein people sought to earn God’s favor by observing ceremonies and keeping laws. It also held to an exclusive nationalistic outlook that regarded Israel alone as “the people of God” and that required non-Jews desiring to be identified with God to submit to circumcision and the Mosaic law as well as offer prescribed sacrifices. The earliest Christians in Jerusalem seem to have held at least some of these views even after recognizing Jesus as the Messiah.</p>
<p>Acts portrays a series of events through which the fallacy of the Jewish legalistic and exclusivistic attitudes were exposed. Stephen questioned the narrow religious view that restricted God’s presence, activity, and concern to Jerusalem (ch <a href="?bref=Acts.7.1-60">7</a>). Philip led Samaritans and an Ethiopian official, representatives of groups with only loose traditional connections to Judaism, to faith in Jesus (ch <a href="?bref=Acts.8.1-40">8</a>). At the direct command of God, Peter proclaimed Jesus as Messiah and Lord to Cornelius, a good God-fearing but uncircumcised Gentile (ch <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10</a>). Through this incident Peter came to recognize that God does not discriminate between peoples (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.34-35">10:34-35</a>). The undeniable coming of the Holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household (v <a href="?bref=Acts.10.44">44</a>) provided surprising proof of God’s acceptance of the Gentiles, which could not be doubted even by members of the scrupulously Jewish, pro-circumcision group who witnessed the event (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.10.45-48">45-48</a>) or to whom it was later reported (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.1-18">11:1-18</a>). The conversion of Cornelius became a precedent later cited by Peter at the council (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.7-11">15:7-11</a>).</p>
<p>God’s acceptance of Cornelius might have been regarded as an exceptional case by strict Jewish Christians. This was made impossible by the conversion of Greeks at Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.20">11:20</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), the establishment of a racially and culturally mixed church in that city (as implied by the diverse backgrounds of the leaders mentioned in <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1">Acts 13:1</a>), and the large number of Gentiles converted during Paul’s missionary journey into south-central Asia Minor (chs <a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-14.28">13–14</a>).</p>
<p>Acts records that at this juncture Jewish Christians from Jerusalem came to Antioch and precipitated the crisis that made necessary the convening of the council. Their insistence that gentile believers be circumcised and submit to the Mosaic law was tantamount to requiring them to become Jews nationally, socially, and religiously in order to become Christians. The early church was thus faced with the necessity of clarifying its relation to Judaism (was it a part of or separate from it?) and the nature of the salvation it proclaimed (nationalistic and legalistic or by grace through faith?).</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Council established the truth that salvation is a free gift to be received by faith; it rejected human effort as a means of or contributor to salvation. By implication it also dissociated Christianity from any attempt to restrict it to a particular racial, national, cultural, or social group. The council affirmed Christians to be free from the obligation to earn salvation through ceremonies or law-keeping. At the same time it recognized the practical necessity of responsible and appropriate conduct, which takes into account the moral nature of God and the sensitivities and concerns of other Christians.</p>

In the Septuagint, the word is not translated as a proper name but as an adjective, “beloved.” In <a href="?bref=Isa.44.2">Isaiah 44:2</a> Jacob is described as “Israel, my chosen one” (with mg note saying “Jeshurun,” see <span class="sc">nlt</span>), thus linking the name with the idea of election. In <a href="?bref=Deut.33.5">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> Israel is reminded that “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> became king in Jeshurun” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>), and in verse <a href="?bref=Deut.33.26">26</a> it is told that there is none like God. If we follow the Septuagint, there is a link with the term “beloved” used of Christ (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">Mt 3:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Eph.1.6">Eph 1:6</a>) and of the church (<a href="?bref=Col.3.12">Col 3:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.4">1 Thes 1:4</a>; <a href="?bref=2Thes.2.13">2 Thes 2:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Jude.1.1">Jude 1:1</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JESSE (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Son of Obed and grandson of Ruth and Boaz (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.17,22">Ru 4:17, 22</a>). Jesse was a shepherd from Bethlehem. He had eight sons, of whom David was the youngest. He had at least two daughters, Zeruiah and Abigail, who became mothers of famous warriors.</p>
<p>When Samuel went to Jesse’s home to search for and anoint a king, Jesse did not at first feel it worthwhile to call David for examination (<a href="?bref=1Sam.16.11">1 Sm 16:11</a>). Later he sent David to play the lyre for Saul (vv <a href="?bref=1Sam.16.19-21">19-21</a>). After David became a fugitive from Saul, Jesse and others of the family came to David in the cave of Adullam. David then brought his father and mother to Mizpah in Moab (<a href="?bref=1Sam.22.3">22:3</a>). Nothing further is heard of Jesse.</p>
<p>After Saul broke with David, he commonly spoke of David derisively as a “son of Jesse” to underscore his humble origins (<a href="?bref=1Sam.20.31">1 Sm 20:31</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.22.7">22:7</a>). This same emphasis on Jesse’s modest station in life is found in such messianic references as <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Isaiah 11:1</a> and <a href="?bref=Isa.10.1-34">10</a>, which speak of the “shoot from the stump of Jesse” and “the root of Jesse” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>

<p class="h1">JESSE*, Root of</p>
<p class="fl">Figure of speech used by Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.10">Is 11:10</a>) to express the hope of a messianic king from the line of David. The “root” of a family is its progenitor. Jesse, David’s father, is listed as an ancestor of the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1,10">Is 11:1, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.1.5-6">Mt 1:5-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.32">Lk 3:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.13.22-23">Acts 13:22-23</a>). Isaiah pictures God’s judgment upon Assyria as the cutting down of a forest (<a href="?bref=Isa.10.33-34">Is 10:33-34</a>); Judah likewise will be felled and the proud tree of David’s sovereignty hewn down, but a remnant will remain, described by Isaiah as a shoot from a stump (<a href="?bref=Isa.6.13">6:13</a>). The messianic shoot will come forth from the stump of Jesse as a branch from his roots. The Spirit of the Lord will rest upon this one who stands as an ensign to the people, so that the nations will seek him in the glory of his dwelling place (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-10">Is 11:1-10</a>; see <a href="?bref=Isa.53.2">Is 53:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.23.5">Jer 23:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.33.15">33:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.17.22-23">Ez 17:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.3.8">Zec 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.6.12">6:12</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul, quoting Isaiah’s prophecy, identified Jesus as “the root of Jesse” in whom the Gentiles hope (<a href="?bref=Rom.15.12">Rom 15:12</a>). Christ is not only “a shoot from the stump of Jesse” (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.1">Is 11:1</a>) but is himself the “root of Jesse” (<a href="?bref=Isa.11.10">Is 11:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.15.12">Rom 15:12</a>; see <a href="?bref=Rev.5.5">Rv 5:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.16">22:16</a>, “root of David”). This means that Jesus not only came from Jesse’s line but that Jesse (and David) came from Jesus. In other words, the image points to Jesus’ divinity. While Jesus was the son of David, Jesus was also David’s “Lord.” This is the point Jesus made in his debate with the religious leaders of his day who recognized only that the Messiah was a human descendant of David. <a href="?bref=Matt.22.42-45">Matthew 22:42-45</a> reads: “ ‘What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?’ They replied, ‘He is the son of David.’ Jesus responded, ‘Then why does David, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, call him Lord? For David said, “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> said to my Lord, sit in honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.” Since David called him Lord, how can he be his son at the same time?’ ”</p>

<p class="h1">JESUS CHRIST</p>
<p class="fl">Messiah, Savior, and founder of the Christian church.</p>
<p>In providing a biography of Jesus Christ it must be borne in mind that each of the Gospels has its own distinctive purpose. Matthew, for instance, presents Jesus as the messianic King, whereas the emphasis in Mark is more on Jesus as the servant of all. Luke tends to present Jesus in a softer light, showing particularly his amazing compassion to the less fortunate, whereas John plunges the reader into a deeper and more spiritual understanding of Jesus. These different aims caused the four Evangelists to select and arrange the events of Jesus’ life differently, resulting in a fourfold portrait of the same man. It was undoubtedly for this reason that the Christian church preserved four Gospels instead of only one.</p>
<p>The following sections present the main events in what may be regarded as the chief stages of the life of Jesus. These stages show a definite progression from Christ’s incarnation to his cross. The amount of space devoted to each stage in each of the Gospels is dictated by theological rather than biographical interest. The whole presentation of Christ’s life centers on the cross and the subsequent triumphant resurrection and is more an account of God’s message to humanity than a plain historic account of the life of Jesus.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheIncarnation">The Incarnation</p>
<p class="fl">The major event of this initial stage was the Incarnation. Only Matthew and Luke give accounts of Jesus’ birth. John goes back and reflects on what preceded the birth.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that John began his Gospel with a reference to the Word (<a href="?bref=John.1.1">Jn 1:1</a>), but it is in this way that he delivers to the reader an exalted view of Jesus. John saw Jesus as existing even before the creation of the world (v <a href="?bref=John.1.2">2</a>). In fact, he saw him as having a part in the act of creation (v <a href="?bref=John.1.3">3</a>). Therefore, when Jesus was born, it was both an act of humiliation and an act of illumination. The light shone, but the world preferred to remain in darkness (vv <a href="?bref=John.1.4-5">4-5</a>, <a href="?bref=John.1.10">10</a>). Therefore, anyone coming to John’s records of the life of Jesus would know at once, before even being introduced to the man named Jesus, that here was the record of no ordinary man. The account of his life and teachings that followed could not be properly understood except against this background of his preexistence.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBirthofJesus">The Birth of Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">John simply wrote that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Matthew and Luke fill in some of the details of how this happened. There is little in common between the two accounts. Each approaches the subject from a different point of view, but the supernatural is evident in both. The coming of Jesus is announced beforehand, through dreams to Joseph in Matthew’s account (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.20-21">Mt 1:20-21</a>) and through an angel to Mary in Luke’s account (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-33">Lk 1:26-33</a>). Matthew leaves his readers in no doubt that the one to be born had a mission to accomplish—to save people from their sins (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>). Luke sets his story of Jesus’ coming in an atmosphere of great rejoicing. This is seen in the inclusion of some exquisite songs, which have formed part of the church’s worship ever since (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.46-55,68-79">Lk 1:46-55, 68-79</a>). The homage of the wise men in <a href="?bref=Matt.2.1-12">Matthew 2:1-12</a> is significant because it sets the scene for a universalistic emphasis that links the beginning of the Gospel to its ending (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.28.19-20">Mt 28:19-20</a>). A similar emphasis is introduced in the angel’s announcement to the shepherds in <a href="?bref=Luke.2.14">Luke 2:14</a> and in Simeon’s song (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.32">Lk 2:32</a>), where he predicts that Jesus would be a light for Gentiles as well as a glory for Israel. The flight into Egypt for safety (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13-15">Mt 2:13-15</a>) shows the contribution of a gentile nation in providing protection for a Jewish child.</p>
<p>One feature of the birth stories in Matthew and Luke is that they are both linked to genealogies. It is difficult to harmonize these genealogies since they appear to be drawn from different sources, but the purpose in both cases is to show that Jesus was descended from Abraham and David. The latter fact gave rise to Jesus’ title Son of David.</p>
<p>Luke was the only Gospel writer who attempted to link the coming of Jesus with events in secular history. Although problems arise over the dating of the census of Quirinius (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-2">Lk 2:1-2</a>), the firm setting of the contemporary scene is highly significant because the Christian faith is a historic faith centered on a historic person.</p>
<p class="h2" id="LifeinNazareth">Life in Nazareth</p>
<p class="fl">The years of Jesus Christ’s human development are given only a few lines in the Gospels. Details are given of only one incident belonging to the period of childhood, the discussion of the 12-year-old Jesus with the Jewish teachers in the temple (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.41-50">Lk 2:41-50</a>). This event is a pointer to one of the most characteristic features of Jesus’ later ministry: his display of irrefutable wisdom in dialogue with his Jewish contemporaries. It also reveals that at an early age Jesus was acutely aware of a divine mission. Nevertheless, Luke notes that in Jesus’ formative years he was obedient to his parents (v <a href="?bref=Luke.2.51">51</a>). It is assumed that during 30 years at Nazareth Jesus learned the carpenter’s trade from Joseph and became the village carpenter after Joseph’s death. However, there is no account of this period in the Gospels. This has led to many fantastic imaginings about Jesus’ childhood. Many of these fables are recorded in apocryphal gospels, but Luke’s account is unembellished. Its remarkable reserve is a strong indication of its historical reliability.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PreparatoryEvents">Preparatory Events</p>
<p class="fl">All four Gospels refer to a brief preparatory period that immediately preceded the commencement of Christ’s public ministry. This period focused on three important events.</p>
<p class="h3">The Preaching of John the Baptist</p>
<p class="fl">John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness and caused an immediate stir in Judea, particularly as a result of his call to repentance and to baptism (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.1-6">Mt 3:1-6</a>). John was like one of the OT prophets, but he disclaimed any importance in his own office except as the herald of a greater person to come. His stern appearance and uncompromising moral challenge effectively prepared the way for the public appearance of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.4-6">Lk 3:4-6</a>). It is important to note that John the Baptist’s announcement of the imminent coming of the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>) was the same theme with which Jesus began his own ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17">4:17</a>). This shows that John the Baptist’s work was an integral part of the preparation for the public ministry of Jesus. The same may be said of the rite of baptism, although John recognized that Jesus would add a new dimension in that he would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.11">3:11</a>). As the forerunner of Jesus Christ, John proclaimed that the one to follow would not only be greater than he but would also come with high standards of judgment (v <a href="?bref=Matt.3.12">12</a>). The stage was therefore set in stern terms for the initial public act of Jesus—his willingness to be baptized (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.13-15">Mt 3:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.21">Lk 3:21</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Baptism of Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">John’s baptism was a baptism of repentance. Since Jesus submitted to this, are we to suppose that Jesus himself needed to repent? If this were the case, it would involve the assumption that Jesus had sinned. This is contrary to other evidence in the NT. But if Jesus did not need to repent, what was the point of his requesting baptism at the hands of John? Jesus had come on a mission to others, and it is possible that he deliberately submitted to John’s baptism in order to show that he was prepared to take the place of others. This explanation is in line with Paul’s later understanding of the work of Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>). Matthew is the one Evangelist who records John’s hesitation to baptize Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.14-15">Mt 3:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>The most important part of the baptism of Jesus was the heavenly voice, which declared pleasure in the beloved Son (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.17">Mt 3:17</a>). This announcement by God was the real starting point of the public ministry of Jesus. It revealed that the ministry was no accident or sudden inspiration on the part of Jesus. He went into his work with the full approval of the Father. A further important feature is the part played by the Holy Spirit in this scene. The dovelike description is full of symbolic meaning (v <a href="?bref=Matt.3.16">16</a>). It was not just an inner experience that Jesus had. The activity of the Spirit in the ministry of Jesus, although not much emphasized in the Gospels, is nevertheless sufficiently evident to be indispensable to a true understanding of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">The Temptation of Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus’ baptism showed the nature of his mission. The temptation showed the nature of the environment in which he was to minister (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.1">Mt 4:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.4.1-2">Lk 4:1-2</a>). Confrontation with adverse spiritual forces characterized Jesus’ whole ministry. Only Matthew and Luke record details of the temptations to which Jesus was subjected by the devil. All these temptations present shortcuts that, if pursued, would have deflected Jesus from his vocation. The record leaves us in no doubt that Jesus gained the victory. Both Gospels show that he accomplished this by appealing to Scripture. Jesus is also seen in this event as a genuine human who, like all other humans, was subject to temptation. The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews notes that this fact qualified Jesus to act as High Priest and to intercede on behalf of his people (<a href="?bref=Heb.2.18">Heb 2:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.4.15">4:15</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheEarlyMinistryofJesusinJudeaandSamaria">The Early Ministry of Jesus in Judea and Samaria</p>
<p class="fl">Only John’s Gospel tells of the work of Jesus in Judea following his baptism. It first describes his calling of two disciples, John and Andrew (<a href="?bref=John.1.35-39">Jn 1:35-39</a>). This event is set against the background of John the Baptist’s announcement of Jesus as the Lamb of God who was to take away the sin of the world (v <a href="?bref=John.1.29">29</a>). These first two disciples were soon joined by three others: Peter, Philip, and Nathanael (vv <a href="?bref=John.1.41-51">41-51</a>). These five formed part of the nucleus of Jesus’ followers who came to be known as the Twelve. One feature of John’s account is the early recognition by the disciples of Jesus as Messiah (<a href="?bref=John.1.41">Jn 1:41</a>) and Son of God (v <a href="?bref=John.1.49">49</a>).</p>
<p>Soon after Jesus began his ministry in Jerusalem, John relates an incident at Cana in Galilee in which water was turned into wine (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-10">Jn 2:1-10</a>). This event is important in John’s account because it is the first of the signs that he records (v <a href="?bref=John.2.11">11</a>). He saw Jesus’ miracles as “signs” of the truth of the gospel rather than as mere wonders.</p>
<p>John sets two incidents at Jerusalem in this initial period. The first is the cleansing of the temple (<a href="?bref=John.2.13-16">Jn 2:13-16</a>). Matthew, Mark, and Luke all place this event just before Jesus’ trial, but John places it at this early stage. The moral intention of Jesus’ work is seen in his driving out the money changers who were profiting from worshipers more than was appropriate. This was apparently acceptable to Judaism but was unacceptable to Jesus. The other Evangelists imply that this authoritative act was the event that sparked the final hostility of his opponents. John tells the story for a theological reason; to him, the cleansing of the temple was a parable telling of what Jesus had come to do.</p>
<p>The other incident in Jerusalem is the meeting between Jesus and Nicodemus (<a href="?bref=John.3.1-36">Jn 3</a>). Nicodemus was closely associated with Judaism, yet he was also searching for truth. He was unable to understand, however, the spiritual truth about being born again through the Spirit.</p>
<p>John’s story then moves from Judea to Samaria and the story of the Samaritan woman at the well (<a href="?bref=John.4.1-42">Jn 4:1-42</a>). Jesus used her physical thirst to point to her deeper spiritual thirst. She realized that Jesus had something to offer her that she had not previously known. As a result of this woman’s experience and testimony, many of the Samaritan people came to believe in Jesus as the Savior of the world (v <a href="?bref=John.4.42">42</a>). In this case John intends that his readers would appreciate the fuller significance of the words of Jesus by viewing them in the light of the resurrection.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePeriodoftheGalileanMinistry">The Period of the Galilean Ministry</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="ImportantPlacesinJesusMinistryinGalilee"/>
<p class="fl">Almost all the information on this period is found in the synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke.) It may be conveniently divided into three sections. The first briefly outlines the events leading up to the choosing of the Twelve; the second deals with Jesus’ withdrawal from northern Galilee; and the third deals with his departure for Jerusalem. While the synoptic Gospels concentrate exclusively on the events in Galilee, John’s account indicates that there were some visits by Jesus to Jerusalem during this period. Also, John records another incident at Cana, where the son of a Capernaum official was healed. This is noted as the second of Jesus’ signs (<a href="?bref=John.4.54">Jn 4:54</a>). It is chiefly important because of the extraordinary faith of the father, who was prepared to take Jesus at his word.</p>
<p class="h3">The Calling of the Disciples</p>
<p class="fl">In the synoptic Gospels there is an account of the initial call to four of the disciples to leave their fishing boats and to become fishers of men (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.18-22">Mt 4:18-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.16-20">Mk 1:16-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.1-11">Lk 5:1-11</a>). They had already met Jesus and must have had some idea what was involved in following him. Jesus did not at this time appoint them to be apostles, but this call was an indispensable step toward the establishment of the Twelve as a group. Setting apart a particular number of disciples formed an important part of the ministry of Jesus. The miraculous catch of fish, which preceded the call of the disciples in Luke’s account, served to highlight the superiority of the spiritual task of catching people rather than fish.</p>
<p>Another significant call came to Levi, otherwise known as Matthew (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.9">Mt 9:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.13-14">Mk 2:13-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.5.27-28">Lk 5:27-28</a>). As a tax collector, he was of a different type from most of the other disciples. He would certainly have been despised by his Jewish contemporaries because of his profession. But his inclusion in the special circle of Jesus’ disciples shows the broad basis on which these men were chosen. One of the others, Simon the Zealot, may have belonged to a group of revolutionaries who were religious as well as political. Even a man like Judas Iscariot was numbered among the Twelve, and he would later betray Jesus to his enemies for a small sum of money. Jesus accepted them as they were and molded them into men who later came to learn how to be totally dependent on God and the power of his Spirit.</p>
<p class="h3">Sermon on the Mount</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospel of Matthew presents a substantial sample of Jesus’ teachings commonly called the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">Mt 5:1–7:29</a>). Some of the same material occurs in Luke in a different context and different arrangement. It is possible that Jesus often repeated his teachings on different occasions and with different combinations. Matthew’s record of the Sermon on the Mount presents an impressive body of teaching, mainly of an ethical character. In it Jesus upholds the Mosaic law and at the same time goes beyond it. The beginning of this sermon has been called the Beatitudes (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.3-12">5:3-12</a>). It commends moral and spiritual values. The teachings recorded in this section were radical, but not in a political sense. The Sermon on the Mount may be taken as a fair sample of the kind of discourses that must have abounded in the ministry of Jesus.</p>
<p class="h3">Jesus as Healer</p>
<p class="fl">Throughout the Gospels there are records of miracles involving Jesus healing people. There are more of these miracles than any other type. In a section in Matthew devoted to a sequence of healings (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-9.34">Mt 8:1–9:34</a>), a leper, a centurion’s servant, Peter’s mother-in-law, a demoniac, a paralytic, a woman with a hemorrhage, blind men, and a man who was mute—all were healed. In addition, Jairus’s daughter was raised from the dead. This concentration of healings focuses on Jesus as a miracle worker, but throughout the Gospels there is no suggestion that Jesus healed by magical means. In some cases an individual’s faith was acknowledged (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.10">8:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.9.22">9:22</a>). In at least one incident, the healing was accompanied by an announcement of the forgiveness of the sins of the one healed (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.2">Mt 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.2.5">Mk 2:5</a>). This shows that Jesus considered spiritual needs to be of greater consequence than the physical problems.</p>
<p>In view of the widespread belief in the powerful influence of evil spirits over human lives, it is of great significance that Jesus is seen exercising his power of exorcism over demons. Jesus’ ministry was set in an atmosphere of spiritual conflict, so the confrontations between the forces of darkness and the Light of the World were to be expected. Those who explain away these cases of demon-possession in psychiatric terms miss this key feature of Jesus’ ministry. Each time he exorcised a demon, he was demonstrating victory, which reached its most dramatic expression in his victory over death at his resurrection.</p>
<p>In addition to the healing miracles in this early section, one nature miracle is recorded, that of the stilling of the storm (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.23-27">Mt 8:23-27</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.4.35-41">Mk 4:35-41</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.22-25">Lk 8:22-25</a>). This miracle focused both on the lack of faith in the disciples and the mysterious power of the presence of Jesus.</p>
<p class="h3">The Reaction to Jesus by His Contemporaries</p>
<p class="fl">In the early stages of his ministry, Jesus was very popular with the ordinary people. There are several notices to this effect (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.23-25">Mt 4:23-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.7-8">Mk 3:7-8</a>). This popularity showed no appreciation of the spiritual purpose of Jesus’ mission (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.17">Lk 13:17</a>). Nevertheless, it stands in stark contrast to the nit-picking opposition of the religious leaders, who even plotted to kill Jesus in the early period of his ministry (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.6">Mk 3:6</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus and the religious leaders often clashed over the observance of the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-14">Mt 12:1-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.10-17">Lk 13:10-17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.9-18">Jn 5:9-18</a>). Jesus adopted a more liberal view than the rigid and often illogical interpretation of some of his religious contemporaries—as in the instances when he was criticized for healing on the Sabbath even though the Jewish law allowed the rescuing of trapped animals on the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.11">Mt 12:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.15">Lk 13:15</a>). To the Pharisaic mind, Jesus was a lawbreaker. The Pharisees feared that it would undermine their authority if his teaching were permitted to permeate popular opinion.</p>
<p class="h3">Preparing the Twelve</p>
<p class="fl">The synoptic Gospels supply lists of the names of the 12 apostles (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.2-4">Mt 10:2-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.16-19">Mk 3:16-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.14-16">Lk 6:14-16</a>). Both Matthew and Mark name them in the context of their exercising authority over evil spirits, thereby showing that these men were being called to enter the same spiritual conflict as Jesus.</p>
<p>The synoptic Gospels also give details of the instructions Jesus gave to these disciples before sending them to minister in Israel (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.5-42">Mt 10:5-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.7-13">Mk 6:7-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.1-6">Lk 9:1-6</a>). Matthew included material in his discourse that appears in a different context in Mark and Luke, but the discourse still shows the concern of Jesus to prepare his disciples for their future work. They were to proclaim the kingdom as he had done, but they were not to suppose that all would respond to it. They were warned about coming hostility and even persecution. It is important to note that Jesus warned his disciples against encumbering themselves with material possessions. Although the instructions given related immediately to a ministry tour, he was laying the foundation for the future work of the church.</p>
<p class="h3">The Relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist</p>
<p class="fl">For a while there were parallel preaching and parallel baptisms by John the Baptist with his followers and Jesus with his disciples (<a href="?bref=John.4.1-2">Jn 4:1-2</a>). After John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod because of his uncompromising condemnation of Herod’s marriage to Herodias, his brother’s wife (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-4">Mt 14:3-4</a>), John began to have doubts about Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.1-19">Mt 11:1-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.7.18-35">Lk 7:18-35</a>). He may have been expecting Jesus, if he really was the Messiah, to come to his rescue. When John sent his disciples to Jesus to express his doubts, Jesus took the opportunity to tell the crowds of the greatness of John the Baptist. He said there was none born of women who was greater than John.</p>
<p class="h3">Various Controversies</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus did not hesitate to confront his contemporaries on issues that involved moral or religious questions. The controversy recorded in John’s Gospel concerning the keeping of the Sabbath that arose when a lame man was healed on that day (<a href="?bref=John.5.1-18">Jn 5:1-18</a>) shows once again that ritual observance of the Sabbath was regarded as of greater importance than a compassionate concern for the physical welfare of the lame man. This was typical of the Jewish approach and led at once to a persecuting attitude toward Jesus, particularly because he claimed to be doing the work of God.</p>
<p>A similar conflict arose after Jesus’ disciples had plucked grain in the fields on the Sabbath day (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.1-8">Mt 12:1-8</a>). The Pharisees assumed that this act constituted work and saw it as a sufficient reason to plot how to destroy Jesus. After this event, he healed a paralytic on the same Sabbath day (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.12.9-14">9-14</a>). The Jewish leaders clearly regarded him as a direct threat to their position among the people.</p>
<p>The rising opposition did not deter Jesus from further healings (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.15-32">Mt 12:15-32</a>), which Matthew depicts as the fulfillment of Scripture. But when Jesus healed a blind and mute demoniac, the Pharisees charged him with casting out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of the demons. Jesus told them that to blaspheme the Holy Spirit was an unforgivable sin. This incident not only brings out the perversity of the religious leaders but also shows that the ministry of Jesus was under the direct control of the Spirit. Other notable miracles were the healing of the centurion’s servant, as recorded by Luke (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.1-10">Lk 7:1-10</a>), and the raising from the dead of the widow’s son at Nain (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.7.11-17">11-17</a>). The former of these is notable because of the remarkable faith of a Gentile.</p>
<p>Another example of the Pharisees’ criticism was when Jesus attended a meal in Simon the Pharisee’s house (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">Lk 7:36-50</a>). His host had not provided for the usual courtesies toward guests and yet was critical of Jesus for allowing an immoral woman to wash his feet with tears, dry them with her hair, and anoint them with ointment. There is no doubt that most of Simon’s colleagues would have shared his reaction, but Jesus did not stop the woman because he knew that the motive impelling her to do it was love. He told Simon a parable to press home his point.</p>
<p>John records two visits by Jesus to Jerusalem. These are difficult to date, but they probably occurred during the early period of the ministry. He attended the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="?bref=John.7.2">Jn 7:2</a>) and the Feast of Dedication (<a href="?bref=John.10.22">10:22</a>). At these times Jesus taught in the temple area and entered into dialogue with the religious leaders. The chief priests became alarmed at his presence and sent officers to arrest him (<a href="?bref=John.7.32">7:32</a>). They were unable to do so; instead, they themselves were captivated by his teachings. More discussions with the Jewish leaders followed. They charged Jesus with being demon-possessed (<a href="?bref=John.8.48">8:48</a>). Both in this case and in the event of the healing of the blind man (ch <a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">9</a>), the hostility of the Jewish leaders to Jesus surfaces. When Jesus spoke of himself as the Shepherd, his teaching again raised the anger of his Jewish hearers, who took up stones to kill him (<a href="?bref=John.10.31">10:31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Teaching in Parables</p>
<p class="fl">Matthew’s Gospel gives a sample of a continuous discourse by Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.1-7.29">Mt 5:1–7:29</a>), but Jesus more often spoke in parables. Matthew collected into a group some of the parables that concern the theme of the kingdom (ch <a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-58">13</a>). Luke tends to preserve parables of a different kind that are not specially linked to the kingdom. Mark has the least number of parables among the synoptic Gospels, but his writing shows little interest in Jesus as a teacher. John does not relate any parables, although he does preserve two allegories—the Sheepfold and the Vine—which could be regarded as extended parables. The parable was a form of teaching particularly characteristic of Jesus. In addition, Jesus interspersed even his discourses with metaphors akin to the parabolic form. The parable was valuable because it could stimulate thought and challenge the hearer. This is because the form of the parable is easy to retain in the mind. Jesus did not speak in parables in order to obscure his meaning. This would be contrary to all that he aimed to do through his work and teaching.</p>
<p class="h3">Significant Events in Galilee</p>
<p class="fl">In Nazareth there was a striking instance of the unwillingness to respond to the ministry of Jesus. The people of his hometown proved so hostile that he could perform very few miracles there (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.53-58">Mt 13:53-58</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.1-6">Mk 6:1-6</a>). This incident is important because it shows that faith was especially necessary for people to receive his healing miracles.</p>
<p>The one miracle performed by Jesus that all four Evangelists describe is the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.13-21">Mt 14:13-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.30-44">Mk 6:30-44</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.10-17">Lk 9:10-17</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.1-15">Jn 6:1-15</a>). This occasion shows the great popularity of Jesus at this stage of his ministry. It also reveals that he was not unmindful of the physical needs of people. After this miracle, some wanted to make Jesus king. This casts considerable light on their real motives. They were more concerned with material and political expediency than with spiritual truth. This is why Jesus immediately withdrew from them. When the people found him the next day, he proceeded to instruct them about the spiritual bread that comes from heaven (<a href="?bref=John.6.25-40">Jn 6:25-40</a>).</p>
<p>At this point in John’s Gospel, Jesus is often seen in dialogue with his opponents. This style of teaching is different from the synoptic parables but familiar in Jewish-style debate. Many of the people found the spiritual themes in the teaching of Jesus too difficult to accept and consequently ceased to be his disciples (<a href="?bref=John.6.51-52,60,66">Jn 6:51-52, 60, 66</a>). This incident demonstrates the unique challenge presented by Jesus and his teaching. Another miracle closely linked with this is when Jesus walked on the water, demonstrating his power in the natural world. Many have sought to rationalize the event by supposing that Jesus was really walking on the shore, and that the disciples did not realize this in the haze. But this miracle is no more extraordinary than the massive multiplication of loaves and fishes, nor is it inconceivable if the miracle worker was all that he claimed to be.</p>
<p class="h3">Leaving Northern Galilee</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus spent a brief time in the region of Tyre and Sidon, where he performed further healings and made it clear that his main mission was to the house of Israel (<a href="?bref=Matt.15.21-28">Mt 15:21-28</a>). He then moved on to Caesarea Philippi; this was the turning point of his ministry (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-20">Mt 16:13-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.27-38">Mk 8:27-38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.18-27">Lk 9:18-27</a>). It was there that Jesus asked his disciples: “Who do people say the Son of Man is?” This caused Peter to confess: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” This impressive confession led Jesus to promise that he would build his church on “this rock.” There has been much discussion about the meaning of this saying. It is open to some doubt whether Jesus intended to build his church on Peter, on his confession, or on Peter making the confession. Historically, Peter was the instrument God used for the entrance into the church of both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.1-47">Acts 2</a>, <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10</a>). There is no doubt about Jesus’ intention to found a church, since the word occurs again in <a href="?bref=Matt.18.17">Matthew 18:17</a>. Despite the glorious revelation of Jesus on this occasion, he took it as an opportunity to begin to inform his disciples of his death and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.21-23">Mt 16:21-23</a>).</p>
<p>This revelation of Jesus was considerably reinforced by the event known as the Transfiguration, when Jesus was transformed in the presence of three of his disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-8">Mt 17:1-8</a>). It was natural for them to want to keep this glorious vision of Jesus for themselves, but the vision vanished as rapidly as it came. Its purpose was evidently to show the three leading disciples something of the nature of Jesus, which was obscured by his normal human form. A further feature of the vision was the appearance with Jesus of Moses and Elijah, representatives of the Law and the Prophets.</p>
<p>After the Transfiguration, Jesus made two predictions concerning his approaching death. These announcements were a total perplexity to the disciples. In <a href="?bref=Matt.16.1-28">Matthew 16</a>, when Jesus mentioned his death, Peter attempted to rebuke Jesus and was rebuked by Jesus in kind. When Jesus mentioned his death again in chapter <a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-27">17</a>, Matthew noted that the disciples were greatly distressed (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.23">Mt 17:23</a>), while Mark and Luke mentioned the disciples’ lack of understanding (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.32">Mk 9:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.45">Lk 9:45</a>). Jesus was approaching the cross with no support from those closest to him. It is not surprising that when the hour arrived they all forsook him.</p>
<p>After the Transfiguration revealed that Jesus was greater than Moses and Elijah and in fact was the beloved Son of God, he was asked to pay the temple tax (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.24-27">Mt 17:24-27</a>). This incident illustrates the attitude of Jesus toward the authorities and practical responsibilities. He paid the tax, although he did not acknowledge any obligation to do so. The method of payment was extraordinary, for it involved the miracle of the coin in the fish. But the greater importance of the incident is the light it throws on Jesus’ independence from the Jewish law.</p>
<p>Luke devotes more than half his Gospel to the period that begins with Jesus leaving Galilee and ends with his death and resurrection in Jerusalem. In this section of his Gospel, Luke introduces a great deal of material that does not occur elsewhere. We can do no more than summarize some of the more striking items that throw light on the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>In addition to the mission of the Twelve, Luke records the mission of the Seventy (or Seventy-two—see <a href="?bref=Luke.10.17-20">Lk 10:17-20</a>). Special parables are recorded by Luke in this section—the Good Samaritan (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.10.29-37">29-37</a>), the lost sheep (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.3-7">15:3-7</a>), the lost coin (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.15.8-10">8-10</a>), and the prodigal son (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.15.11-32">11-32</a>). As Jesus moved toward Jerusalem, he was concerned with developing the spiritual life of his disciples. He was mindful of the fact that he would not be with them long and wished to prepare them for the future. He taught them about prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.1-13">11:1-13</a>), the Father’s care for them (<a href="?bref=Luke.12.13-34">12:13-34</a>), and preparation for the coming of the Son of Man (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.12.35-56">35-56</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="OntheWaytoJerusalem">On the Way to Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">On the approach to Jerusalem, Jesus visited both Jericho and Bethany. At Jericho he healed Bartimaeus (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.35-43">Lk 18:35-43</a>) and had a fruitful encounter with Zacchaeus, who reformed his ways as a tax collector (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.1-10">19:1-10</a>). Bethany was the home of Mary, Martha, and their brother, Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead (<a href="?bref=John.11.1-57">Jn 11</a>). Jesus spent his remaining days in Jerusalem but returned each night to stay at Simon the Leper’s house in Bethany in the presence of those who loved him (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.6">Mt 26:6</a>). It was there that a woman anointed his body with costly ointment. This was a controversial and prophetic act preparing Jesus for his burial and enhancing the gospel with loving consecration (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.26.6-13">6-13</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="JesusTravelstowardJerusalem"/>
<p class="h2" id="TheFinalDaysinJerusalem">The Final Days in Jerusalem</p>
<p class="fl">All four Gospels relate the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.1-11">Mt 21:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.1-10">Mk 11:1-10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.29-38">Lk 19:29-38</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.12-15">Jn 12:12-15</a>). At this time multitudes greeted Jesus with praises acclaiming him as their king. This welcome stands in stark contrast with the crowd’s later cry for his crucifixion. In fact, it was the second crowd that was doing God’s bidding, since Jesus had not come to Jerusalem to reign but to die.</p>
<p>The synoptic Gospels place the cleansing of the temple as the first main event following Jesus’ entry into the city (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.12-13">Mt 21:12-13</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.15-17">Mk 11:15-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.45-46">Lk 19:45-46</a>). The clouds of opposition had been thickening, but the audacity of Jesus in clearing out the money changers from the temple area was too much for the authorities (<a href="?bref=Mark.11.18">Mk 11:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.47">Lk 19:47</a>). The die was cast and the Crucifixion loomed closer.</p>
<p>It was during this period that further controversies developed between Jesus and the Pharisees and Sadducees (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.23-22.45">Mt 21:23–22:45</a>). In several cases trick questions were posed in order to trap Jesus, but with consummate skill he turned their questions against them. His opposers eventually reached the point where they dared not ask him any more questions (<a href="?bref=Matt.22.46">22:46</a>).</p>
<p>Nearing his final hour, Jesus took the opportunity to instruct his disciples about future events, especially the end of the world. He reiterated the certainty of his return and mentioned various signs that would precede that coming (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">Mt 24–25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.1-38">Lk 21</a>). The purpose of this teaching was to provide a challenge to the disciples to be watchful (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.13">Mt 25:13</a>) and diligent (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.25.14-30">14-30</a>). This section prepares the way for the events of the arrest, the trial, the scourging, and the cross carrying and crucifixion that followed soon after. But first we must note the importance of the Last Supper.</p>
<p>When Jesus sat at the table with his disciples on the night before he died, he wished to give them a simple means by which the significance of his death could be grasped (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.26-30">Mt 26:26-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.22-25">Mk 14:22-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.19-20">Lk 22:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.23-26">1 Cor 11:23-26</a>). The use of the bread and wine for this purpose was a happy choice because they were basic elements in everyday life. Through this symbolic significance Jesus gave an interpretation of his approaching death—his body broken and his blood poured out for others. It was necessary for Jesus to provide this reminder that his sacrificial death would seal a completely new covenant. It was to be an authentic memorial to prevent the church from losing sight of the centrality of the cross.</p>
<p>John’s Gospel does not relate the institution of the Last Supper. Nevertheless, it does record a significant act in which Jesus washed the feet of the disciples as an example of humility (<a href="?bref=John.13.1-20">Jn 13:1-20</a>). He impressed on the disciples the principle of service to others. John follows this display of humility with a series of teachings Jesus gave on the eve of the Passion (chs <a href="?bref=John.14.1-16.33">14–16</a>). The most important feature of this teaching was the promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit to the disciples after Jesus had gone. Even with his mind occupied by thoughts of approaching death, Jesus showed himself more concerned about his disciples than about himself. This is evident in the prayer of Jesus in <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">John 17</a>. All the Evangelists refer in advance to the betrayal by Judas (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.21-25">Mt 26:21-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.18-21">Mk 14:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.21-23">Lk 22:21-23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.21-30">Jn 13:21-30</a>), which prepares readers for the final stages of the way of Jesus to the cross.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBetrayalandArrest">The Betrayal and Arrest</p>
<p class="fl">There is a sense in which the whole gospel story has been working up to a climax of rejection. The various outbursts of popular support were soon over and the determined opposition emerged as seemingly in control. In John’s Gospel the sense of approaching climax is expressed in terms of “his hour” (<a href="?bref=John.13.1">Jn 13:1</a>). When this at length comes, the betrayal and arrest are seen as part of a larger plan. From the upper room where the Last Supper was eaten, Jesus went straight to the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.36-46">Mt 26:36-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.32-42">Mk 14:32-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.40-46">Lk 22:40-46</a>), where he prayed to his Father with deep intensity and agony. In this we see part of what it cost Jesus to identify himself with man’s need. He prayed for the cup of suffering to pass from him but at the same time submitted to the Father’s will. The three disciples he took with him all fell asleep, while one of his other disciples, having betrayed his master, appeared at the gates at the head of the group who had come to arrest him. At the moment of confrontation with Judas, Jesus exhibits an amazing dignity when he addressed the betrayer as his “friend” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.50">Mt 26:50</a>). He offered no resistance when he was arrested and chided the crowd of people for their swords and clubs (v <a href="?bref=Mt.26.55">55</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTrial">The Trial</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus was first taken to the house of Annas, one of the high priests, for a preliminary examination (<a href="?bref=John.18.13">Jn 18:13</a>). During his trial, he was scorned by his enemies, and one of his disciples, Peter, denied him three times (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.69-75">Mt 26:69-75</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.66-72">Mk 14:66-72</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.54-62">Lk 22:54-62</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.15-27">Jn 18:15-27</a>), as Jesus predicted he would (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.34">Mt 26:34</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.30">Mk 14:30</a>; <a href="?bref=John.13.38">Jn 13:38</a>). The official trial before the Sanhedrin was presided over by Caiaphas, who was nonplussed when Jesus at first refused to speak. At length Jesus predicted that the Son of Man would come on the clouds of heaven; this was enough to make the high priest charge him with blasphemy (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.62-64">Mk 14:62-64</a>). Although he was spat upon and his face was struck, Jesus remained calm and dignified. He showed how much greater he was than those who were treating him with contempt.</p>
<p>The further examinations before Pilate (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.1-2">Mt 27:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.1">Mk 15:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.1">Lk 23:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.28">Jn 18:28</a>) and Herod (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.7-12">Lk 23:7-12</a>) were no better examples of impartial justice. Again Jesus did not answer when asked about the charges before either Pilate (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.14">Mt 27:14</a>) or Herod (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.9">Lk 23:9</a>). He remained majestically silent, except to make a comment to Pilate about the true nature of his kingship (<a href="?bref=John.18.33-38">Jn 18:33-38</a>). The pathetic governor declared Jesus innocent, offered the crowds the release of either Jesus or Barabbas, and then publicly disclaimed responsibility by washing his hands. Pilate then cruelly scourged Jesus and handed him over to be crucified. This judge has ever since been judged by the prisoner.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheCrucifixion">The Crucifixion</p>
<p class="fl">The reader of this scene cannot help but see man’s inhumanity to man—even the man of all men, Jesus Christ. The soldiers’ ribald mockery of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.27-30">Mt 27:27-30</a>), mixing a royal robe with a hurtful crown of thorns (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.17">Mk 15:17</a>), compelling a passerby to carry the cross (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.26">Lk 23:26</a>), the cruel procedure of nailing Jesus to the cross, the callous casting of lots for his garment (<a href="?bref=John.19.23-24">Jn 19:23-24</a>), and the scornful challenge to him to use his power to escape (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.40-44">Mt 27:40-44</a>)—all expose the cruelty of Jesus opponents. But against this is Jesus’ concern about the repentant criminal who was crucified with him (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.39-43">Lk 23:39-43</a>), his concern for his mother (<a href="?bref=John.19.25-27">Jn 19:25-27</a>), his prayer for forgiveness for those responsible for the Crucifixion (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.34">Lk 23:34</a>), and his final triumphant cry (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.37">Mk 15:37</a>)—all of which show a nobility of mind that contrasted strongly with the meanness of those about him. A few observers showed a better appreciation, like the centurion who was convinced of Jesus’ innocence (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.39">Mk 15:39</a>) and the women who followed him and stood at a distance (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.55-56">Mt 27:55-56</a>). There was one dark moment, as far as Jesus was concerned—his forsaken cry, which quickly passed (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.34">Mk 15:34</a>). There was an accompanying darkness and an earthquake, as if nature itself were acknowledging the significance of the event. Even the temple veil was torn in two, as if it had no longer any right to bar the way into the Holy of Holies (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.51">Mt 27:51</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheBurialResurrectionandAscension">The Burial, Resurrection, and Ascension</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus’ body was placed in a tomb that belonged to Joseph of Arimathea, who was assisted by Nicodemus in laying the body to rest (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.57-60">Mt 27:57-60</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.39">Jn 19:39</a>). But the tomb played only an incidental part in the resurrection. The Evangelists concentrate on the appearances of Jesus not only on the day of resurrection but also subsequently. The disciples were convinced that Jesus was alive. Some, like Thomas, had doubts to overcome (<a href="?bref=John.20.24-29">Jn 20:24-29</a>). Others, like John, were more ready to believe when they saw the empty tomb (vv <a href="?bref=John.20.2-10">2-10</a>). It is not without significance that the first to see the risen Lord was a woman, Mary Magdalene (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.61">Mt 27:61</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.28.1,5-9">28:1, 5-9</a>), whose presence at the cross put to shame those disciples who had run away (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.56">Mt 26:56</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>).</p>
<p>We may note that in his glorified, risen state Jesus was in a human form, although he was not at once recognized (<a href="?bref=John.20.15-16">Jn 20:15-16</a>). There was a definite continuity with the Jesus the disciples had known. The appearances were occasions of both joy and instruction (cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.24.44">Lk 24:44</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.1.3">Acts 1:3</a>). The resurrection, in fact, had transformed the Crucifixion from a tragedy into a triumph. Forty days after his resurrection, Jesus ascended into heaven to join his Father in glory (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.51">Lk 24:51</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.17">Jn 20:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.9-11">Acts 1:9-11</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JESUS CHRIST, Teachings of</p>
<p class="fl">Because of the wide variety of forms in which the teachings of Jesus have been preserved, it is difficult to bring out the essence of that teaching in a systematic way. Jesus did not present us with a theological system. His words were essentially practical in intent. Yet from all the variety of sayings it is possible to extract a clear idea of what Jesus thought about a number of important issues. What was his teaching about God? What did he think about himself? What did he mean when he spoke about the kingdom? What light does his teaching throw on the meaning of his death? What did he say about the Holy Spirit? How did he describe human beings and their needs? Did he anticipate the Christian church? Did he teach anything about the end of the world? What were the main features of his moral teaching? The following sections will seek to answer these important questions.</p>

<p class="fl">Anyone who comes to the teachings of Jesus after reading the OT will at once recognize that much of his teaching about God is the same. Since Jesus, as all orthodox Jews of his day, accepted the testimony of the OT as inspired, it is not surprising that his approach to God was similar. This is especially true of his assumption that God was Creator. He taught a special providential care over the created order and affirmed that God watched over such small creatures as the sparrow (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.29">Mt 10:29</a>). There is no support in the teachings of Jesus for the view that God is uninterested in the world he made.</p>
<p>One of the most characteristic titles Jesus used for God was Father. This was not new, for the idea occurs in the OT, where God is seen as Father of his people Israel. This kind of fatherhood was national rather than personal. In the intertestamental period the Jews came to regard God as so holy that he was removed from direct contact with human affairs. There had to be mediators between God and people. This exalted notion of God was not conducive to the idea of God as Father, and it is against this background that the uniqueness of the personal fatherhood of God in the teaching of Jesus must be seen. There is some evidence in Judaism that prayer to God as “Our Father” was known, but what distinguishes Jesus’ teachings from that of his contemporaries is that the fatherhood of God was central to what he taught.</p>
<p>The father-son relationship is particularly vivid in John’s Gospel, where Jesus as Son is seen to be in close communion with God as Father. This comes out strongly in Jesus’ prayer in <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">John 17</a> and in the frequent assertions that the Father had sent the Son and that the Son was doing the will of the Father. It is this strong relationship between God and Jesus in terms of fatherhood and sonship that led Jesus to teach men to approach God in the same way. The Lord’s Prayer at once recognizes this in its opening words. It is particularly important to note that “Our Father” precedes “hallowed be thy name,” for the more intimate idea prepares the way for the more remote. Jesus never taught men to approach God with terror.</p>
<p>Although there is a connection between the way in which Jesus addressed God as Father and the way in which he taught his disciples to approach God, there is also a distinction. Jesus spoke of “my Father and your Father” when he appeared to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection (<a href="?bref=John.20.17">Jn 20:17</a>), but he did not say “our Father.” His sonship was unique, for he claimed that he and the Father were one (<a href="?bref=John.10.30">Jn 10:30</a>).</p>
<p>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus assured his followers that their heavenly Father knows about their needs (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.32">Mt 6:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.12.30">Lk 12:30</a>), on the strength of which they are exhorted not to be anxious. This gives some insight into the way in which Jesus’ teachings about God has a bearing on practical issues.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsaboutHimself">Teachings about Himself</p>
<p class="fl">What Jesus said about himself is of great importance, for this undoubtedly formed the basis of what the early church came to teach about him.</p>
<p>Jesus used certain titles of himself or accepted them as descriptions of himself when they were used by others. The most widely used is Son of Man. This title was used by Jesus to refer to himself but was not used by anyone else. It was used, moreover, in several different kinds of sayings. Sometimes the sayings related directly to the public ministry of Jesus, like the saying that the Son of Man was Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.28">Mk 2:28</a>), or that the Son of Man had authority to forgive sins (v <a href="?bref=Mark.2.10">10</a>). Sometimes the sayings had a direct bearing on the Passion, as when Jesus said that the Son of Man must suffer many things (<a href="?bref=Mark.8.31">Mk 8:31</a>; note that <a href="?bref=Matt.16.21">Mt 16:21</a> has “he” instead of “Son of Man”). At other times the reference is to a future appearance, as when Jesus declared to the high priest that he would see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mk 14:62</a>). What did Jesus mean by the title, and why did he use it?</p>
<p>The title “Son of Man” had been used before. The phrase occurs in <a href="?bref=Ps.8.4">Psalm 8:4</a>, where it refers to man or humans. Again, the expression is used many times in Ezekiel as a mode of address to the prophet, but here also it means man. A rather different use occurs in <a href="?bref=Dan.7.13">Daniel 7:13</a>, where one like a son of man comes with the clouds before the Ancient of Days. There is a strong similarity between this passage and the words of Jesus in <a href="?bref=Mark.14.62">Mark 14:62</a>. But an important difference is that whereas Son of Man becomes a title in Mark, it is not so in Daniel. There is some evidence for the title in Jewish apocalyptic literature (e.g., in the Similitudes of Enoch), where it represents a preexistent being who will come to judge and overthrow the enemies of God. It seems evident from this that Jesus’ use of Son of Man as a title is unique.</p>
<p>The Son of Man sayings are distributed throughout the four Gospels, and there are no appreciable differences in their uses. What is at first astonishing is that though the title is so widespread in the Gospels on the lips of Jesus, it never became a name by which Jesus was known by the early Christians. In fact, only in <a href="?bref=Acts.7.56">Acts 7:56</a> does the title appear, in this case used by Stephen. It is clear, therefore, that it had a special meaning for Jesus that it did not have for others. There is no doubt that he was referring to himself and not to someone else, as a careful study of all the Son of Man sayings shows. Those who think that Jesus was referring to someone else arrive at this conclusion only after first dispensing with some of the sayings. The most probable reason why he used the title Son of Man was because he wanted to avoid a term like Messiah, which carried with it too many political overtones. But what did Son of Man mean to Jesus? It is rich with the idea of humanness, possibly allusions to Daniel’s “son of man,” and perhaps a touch of the Suffering Servant idea from <a href="?bref=Isa.53.1-12">Isaiah 53</a>. It is most likely that Jesus saw it in terms of his mission in a way that his hearers could not fully appreciate. It is also probable that the early church preferred Messiah because this title carried the meaning of a royal deliverer; also, after the death of Jesus, there would be no further fear of political misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The term Messiah, or Christ, does not belong strictly to the teachings of Jesus, since he himself never used it. The most striking instance where he accepted the ascription of Messiah was in Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi. All the synoptic Gospels record the confession “You are the Christ,” while Matthew adds the significant comment by Jesus that flesh and blood had not revealed it but “my Father who is in heaven” (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.17">Mt 16:17</a>). He certainly accepted the confession and regarded it as revelation. One other case in the Synoptics where he does not specifically refute messiahship is his answer to the high priest’s question “Are you the Messiah?” (<a href="?bref=Mark.14.61">Mk 14:61</a>). In John’s Gospel, Andrew tells Peter that he had found the Messiah (<a href="?bref=John.1.41">Jn 1:41</a>); the woman at Samaria talks to Jesus, and he reveals that he is the Messiah (<a href="?bref=John.4.25-26">4:25-26</a>). There was a widespread expectation among the Jews that a deliverer would come to overthrow their political enemies, the Romans. There were various ideas about his origin (a military leader or a heavenly warrior) and his methods (the Zealots believed that deliverance could come only through armed revolution). The reticence of Jesus concerning messiahship is therefore readily understandable.</p>
<p>Another title of utmost importance is Son of God, although it occurs mainly in John’s Gospel. That both Mark and John regarded Jesus in this light is clear from explicit statements in their Gospels (cf. <a href="?bref=Mark.1.1">Mk 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.30-31">Jn 20:30-31</a>). There are certainly passages where Messiah is linked with Son of God and where Jesus rejects neither title (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.16.16">Mt 16:16</a>). But in the teachings of Jesus one passage makes abundantly clear the special relationship that Jesus had with God as Son—namely, <a href="?bref=Matt.11.27">Matthew 11:27</a> (also <a href="?bref=Luke.10.22">Lk 10:22</a>, a parallel passage), where Jesus implies that he is the Son of the Father.</p>
<p>Many similar passages in John’s Gospel are, however, more explicit. The Son is unquestionably preexistent, because he knows he came from the Father and returns to the Father. It is not possible from the many references to sonship in John’s Gospel to come to any other conclusion than that Jesus regarded himself as divine. It is particularly important to note that it is also in this Gospel that Jesus is portrayed most clearly in his human nature with its attendant weaknesses. Nowhere in the teachings of Jesus did he explain how God could become man, but he assumed this as a fact. He taught with the authority of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsabouttheKingdomofGod">Teachings about the Kingdom of God</p>
<p class="fl">No one can read the synoptic Gospels without being impressed with the frequency with which the expression “kingdom of God” (or of heaven) occurs. It was clearly an important theme in the whole teaching of Jesus. It is less evident in John’s Gospel but is nevertheless still present. Many of the parables of Jesus are specifically called parables of the kingdom. Jesus’ concept of the kingdom provided a foundational idea to the Christian gospel.</p>
<p>The main idea is the rule of God over people rather than a realm that belongs to God. In other words, the emphasis is on the active reigning of the King. This is important because it means that the kingdom is inextricably affected by relationships between the members and the King. It also means the kingdom will not be expressed in institutional terms.</p>
<p>There is one problem with the kingdom teachings that must be faced: its timing. Some sayings imply that it is already present, while others suggest that it will not come until the future. Some scholars disavow the idea that present and future can be held together; therefore, they reject one and concentrate on the other. Those who maintain a present understanding of the kingdom developed the idea of a social gospel, since Christianity was defined as the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth. According to this view, there is no place for a future arrival of the kingdom. On the other hand, some have denied altogether the present aspect and concentrate on the future. In this case, it is difficult to see in what sense the kingdom teachings are relevant.</p>
<p>Yet others have insisted that since both present and future aspects are found in the Gospel records, no explanation is satisfying that denies one at the expense of the other. One possible solution is to regard the present aspects as applying to this age but as not reaching their fulfillment until the future establishment of the kingdom. A similar solution, expressed differently, is to maintain that the reality is a future kingdom but that it has spilled over into the present. Jesus intentionally included both present and future aspects.</p>
<p>That the kingdom was a theme of common interest is clear from <a href="?bref=Luke.17.20-21">Luke 17:20-21</a>, where the Pharisees asked Jesus when it was coming. His answer, that it was among them, shows unmistakably a present idea. This is equally true of the statement that in the exorcism of evil spirits the kingdom had arrived (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.28">Mt 12:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.20">Lk 11:20</a>). Moreover, Jesus mentioned that the kingdom has been forcefully advancing (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.12">Mt 11:12</a>), by which he did not mean by revolutionary methods, although he clearly implied that something dynamic was already happening. This idea of dynamic power is one of the most characteristic features of the kingdom. Jesus spoke of binding the strong, armed man (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.21-22">Lk 11:21-22</a>), which shows that in his ministry he expected to give a powerful demonstration against the forces of darkness.</p>
<p>It is evident that the kingdom Jesus proclaimed was a kingdom in which God was supreme. It was inseparably linked with his redemptive mission, in which God was bringing spiritual deliverance to his people. Moreover, the kingdom teachings of Jesus cannot be regarded in isolation. It is part of the total message; no part of that message can be divorced from any other part without distorting the whole.</p>
<p>The clearest teachings on the future aspect of the kingdom are to be found in some of the parables (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.1-58">Mt 13</a>) and in the discourse on the Mt of Olives (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.1-25.46">Mt 24–25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.1-37">Mk 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.21.1-38">Lk 21</a>). In the latter, Jesus spoke of the future using imagery drawn from Jewish literature, like the references to clouds, to glory, and to angels in relation to the coming of the Son of Man (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.26-27">Mk 13:26-27</a>). In Matthew’s account there is reference to a trumpet call, another familiar feature (<a href="?bref=Matt.24.31">Mt 24:31</a>).</p>
<p>Various features from the kingdom parables give the clearest idea of the nature of the kingdom. Membership in the kingdom is not considered to be universal, for in the parable of the sower not all the soils are productive. The same separation is seen in the parable of the tares and the parable of the dragnet. The tares are destroyed and only the wheat is harvested, while the bad fish are discarded. The members of the kingdom are those who hear and understand the word of the kingdom (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.23">Mt 13:23</a>). It is clear, therefore, that a response is necessary if the benefits of the kingdom are to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>There is an emphasis on growth in the parable of the mustard seed, where rapid development occurs from small beginnings. The parables of the treasure and the pearl are intended to underline the value of the kingdom. The universal character of the kingdom comes out sharply in the parable of the vineyard, where the kingdom is said to be taken away from the Jews and given to another “nation,” presumably an allusion to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Matt.21.43">Mt 21:43</a>). This is in line with the great commission Jesus gave to his disciples to preach to all nations (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19">28:19</a>). A universal kingdom would certainly be entirely different from the messianic kingdom idea of Judaism, in which Israel was to be the central unit. It is not easy to appreciate how revolutionary the idea was of a worldwide kingdom with Gentiles and Jews on the same footing.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsaboutHisOwnDeath">Teachings about His Own Death</p>
<p class="fl">The announcement of the kingdom must be linked with Jesus’ approach to his own death. Did Jesus see his death as an integral part of his mission? Some have maintained that he ended his life in disillusionment, but a brief survey of his teaching about his own destiny is sufficient to dispel such a theory. To the further question, “What meaning did Jesus attach to his forthcoming death?” he gave a series of passing indications that, when taken together, supply us with a basis on which to reconstruct some idea of the place of his death within the entire range of his mission.</p>
<p>It is important to note that many times Jesus showed his awareness that details of his life were a fulfillment of Scripture (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.26.24,56">Mt 26:24, 56</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.12">Mk 9:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.18.31">Lk 18:31</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.24.25-27,44-45">24:25-27, 44-45</a>). In all the instances cited, the suffering of Jesus is referred to as the subject of OT prophecy. This must mean that he had reflected on OT predictions and recognized that they could be fulfilled only through his own sufferings. In this case the Passion must be regarded as an indispensable part of Jesus’ consciousness of his own mission.</p>
<p>This emphasis on fulfillment of Scripture is also seen in John’s Gospel. His statement that the Son of Man must be lifted up even as Moses lifted up the serpent (<a href="?bref=John.3.14">Jn 3:14</a>) illustrates this point. Most of the passages where fulfillment of Scripture is mentioned are the comments of the Evangelist, John. But there can be no doubt that the fulfillment motive played a vital part both in Jesus’ own understanding of his mission and in the early Christians’ understanding of his death. In this connection, some hold that John puts more stress on the Incarnation as a means of salvation in that he sees it as an illumination of the mind. But this is only part of the truth, for there is more on the meaning of the death of Jesus in John’s Gospel than in the others.</p>
<p>The Gospels emphasize the divine necessity of the death of Jesus. In addition to the fulfillment motive, the idea of necessity is strong in the first prediction by Jesus of his approaching death. In John’s Gospel Jesus speaks of his “hour” several times in the earlier stages of his ministry as “not yet,” but in the later stages as having arrived. There is a sense of definite movement toward a climax, the hour undoubtedly being the hour of the Passion (cf. <a href="?bref=John.17.1">Jn 17:1</a>). There is not room for any disillusionment here. Jesus knew that only through the hour of death could the Father be glorified. The climax was according to an orderly plan.</p>
<p>Jesus evidently regarded his death as in some ways a sacrifice. The clearest indication of this is in the words of institution at the Last Supper. The cup is connected with the blood of the new covenant, which is said to be for the “remission of sins” (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.26-28">Mt 26:26-28</a>). No explanation is given of the way in which the coming death, signified by the broken bread and poured-out wine, would bring about forgiveness of sins. But the immediate realization by the early church that Christ died for our sins (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>) shows that the importance of what Jesus said had been clearly grasped. The new covenant idea is parallel to the old covenant, which according to <a href="?bref=Exod.24.1-18">Exodus 24</a> was sealed with sacrificial blood; there can be little doubt that Jesus had this in mind when he spoke the words about the new covenant. It was also akin to the ideas expressed in <a href="?bref=Jer.31.1-40">Jeremiah 31</a>, referring to a covenant written on the heart rather than graven in stone.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the death of Christ seen especially in John’s Gospel is the sense of completion that went with it. In Jesus’ prayer in <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">John 17</a>, as he faces the cross, he declares that he has finished the work that the Father had given him to do (<a href="?bref=John.17.4">Jn 17:4</a>). This is reinforced by the cry from the cross, “It is finished,” which only John records (<a href="?bref=John.19.30">19:30</a>). This sense of accomplishment gives an air of triumph to what might otherwise have been considered a disaster.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsabouttheHolySpirit">Teachings about the Holy Spirit</p>
<p class="fl">At several of the major events in the life of Jesus, the Evangelists note the activity of the Spirit (e.g., the Virgin Birth, the Baptism, the Temptation). It is to be expected, therefore, that Jesus would have instructed his disciples about the Spirit. However, there is surprisingly little in the synoptic Gospels on this theme. Most of the teachings come from John’s Gospel.</p>
<p>When Jesus began his preaching ministry in Nazareth, according to Luke, he read the statement in <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1-2">Isaiah 61:1-2</a> about the Spirit of God and applied it to himself. He saw his ministry as being inaugurated by the Spirit. This becomes clear in the way in which he responded to the charge that he cast out demons by means of Beelzebub, prince of the demons. He identified the reality of the coming of the kingdom by the fact that he was casting out evil spirits by the Spirit of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.28">Mt 12:28</a>). He was, moreover, sensitive to the seriousness of blaspheming the Spirit, which he implies his accusers were in danger of doing. Whatever he did in his ministry he saw as an activity of the Spirit, and this was especially so in the contest with evil spirits.</p>
<p>While warning his disciples that they would meet with opposition, Jesus assured them of the Spirit’s support when they were forced to appear before kings or governors (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.19-20">Mt 10:19-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.13.11">Mk 13:11</a>). Indeed, he told them that the Spirit would speak through them, thus emphasizing that he expected a continuation of the Spirit’s activity in the future. Luke records one instance in which Jesus comments on what fathers will do for their children and asks whether God will not give the Holy Spirit to those who ask (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.13">Lk 11:13</a>). The assumption is that God regards the Holy Spirit as the best gift to give his children. On yet another occasion, Jesus recognized that David was inspired by the Holy Spirit when he wrote <a href="?bref=Ps.110.1-7">Psalm 110</a> (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.36">Mk 12:36</a>), reflecting Jesus’ belief in the Spirit’s agency in the production of Scripture.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John provides a more detailed development of what Jesus taught about the Spirit. Teachings about the Spirit are usually linked to Jesus’ teachings about giving eternal life to those who believe in him and receive him. At the same time he spoke of the new birth and eternal life to Nicodemus, Jesus also spoke of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.3.3-8,15-16">Jn 3:3-8, 15-16</a>). When he spoke of water of life to the Samaritan woman, he also spoke of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.4.14,23-24">4:14, 23-24</a>). The same holds true for the discourses on the bread of life (<a href="?bref=John.6.48-63">6:48-63</a>) and river of life (<a href="?bref=John.7.37-39">7:37-39</a>). Throughout the Gospel, Jesus declares to various people that he can give them eternal life if they would believe in him. He promises them the water of life, the bread of life, and the light of life, but no one could really partake of these until after the Lord was resurrected. As a foretaste, as a sample, they could receive a certain measure of life via the Lord’s words, because his words were themselves spirit and life (<a href="?bref=John.6.63">6:63</a>), but it was not until the Spirit would become available that the believers could actually become the recipients of the divine, eternal life.</p>
<p>After the Lord’s discourse in <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">John 6</a> (a discourse that was very troubling and offensive to most of his disciples), Jesus said, “It is the Spirit who gives eternal life” (<a href="?bref=John.6.63">6:63</a>). When the Spirit became available, they could have life. Again, Jesus offered the water of life—even life flowing like rivers of living water—to the Jews assembled at the Feast of Tabernacles. He told them to come and drink of him. But no one could, then and there, come and drink of him. So John added a note: “This He spoke of the Spirit, . . . for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified” (<a href="?bref=John.7.39">7:39</a>, <span class="sc">nasb</span>). Once Jesus would be glorified through resurrection, the Spirit of the glorified Jesus would be available for men to drink. In <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">John 6</a>, Jesus offered himself as the bread of life to be eaten by men; and in <a href="?bref=John.7.1-53">John 7</a>, he offered himself as the water of life to refresh men. But no one could eat of him or drink of him until the Spirit of the glorified Jesus was made available, as was intimated in <a href="?bref=John.6.63">John 6:63</a> and then stated plainly in <a href="?bref=John.7.39">John 7:39</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=John.14.16-18">John 14:16-18</a>, Jesus went one step further in identifying himself with the Spirit. He told the disciples that he would give them another Comforter. Then he told them that they should know who this Comforter was because he was, then and there, abiding with them and would, in the near future, be in them. Who else but Jesus was abiding with them at that time? Then after telling the disciples that the Comforter would come to them, he said, “I am coming to you.” First he said that the Comforter would come to them and abide in them, and then in the same breath he said that he would come to them and abide in them (see <a href="?bref=John.14.20">14:20</a>). In short, the coming of the Comforter to the disciples was one and the same as the coming of Jesus to the disciples. The Comforter who was dwelling with the disciples that night was the Spirit in Christ; the Comforter who would be in the disciples (after the resurrection) would be Christ in the Spirit.</p>
<p>On the evening of the resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples and then breathed into them the Holy Spirit. This inbreathing, reminiscent of God’s breathing into Adam the breath of life (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.7">Gn 2:7</a>), became the fulfillment of all that had been promised and anticipated earlier in John’s Gospel. Through this impartation, the disciples were regenerated and indwelt by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This historical event marked the genesis of the new creation. Jesus could now be realized as the bread of life, the water of life, and the light of life. The believers now possessed his divine, eternal, risen life. From that time forward, Christ as Spirit indwelt his believers. Thus, in his first epistle John could say, “We know he lives in us because the Holy Spirit lives in us” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.24">1 Jn 3:24</a>).</p>
<p>The indwelling Spirit helped the disciples remember Jesus’ words and actions (<a href="?bref=John.14.26">Jn 14:26</a>) so that they could teach and write about them with acumen. This means that Jesus did not intend that the preservation of his teachings should be left to chance. All too often theories attempting to explain the way in which the traditions about Jesus and his teachings were transmitted in the period before there were any written Gospels are suggested without any reference to the Holy Spirit. It is not acceptable to concentrate on so-called laws of oral tradition and pay no attention to the unique factor in this case—the Holy Spirit. It is part of the Spirit’s mission to preserve and transmit the teaching of Jesus. What Jesus says in this passage about the Spirit has far-reaching significance for the formation of the Gospels.</p>
<p>Another important function is the activity of the Spirit in the world. Jesus made it clear that the Spirit would convict of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (<a href="?bref=John.16.8">Jn 16:8</a>). Without the activity of the Spirit, there would be no possibility of the disciples making any impact on the world. Nevertheless, Jesus warned that the world could not receive the Spirit because it did not know him (<a href="?bref=John.14.17">14:17</a>). The mystery of the Spirit is that he dwells in every believer. This indwelling aspect is of great importance and was particularly developed in the writings of Paul.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsaboutHumanity">Teachings about Humanity</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus taught about God’s providential care over all human beings. A person’s hairs are all numbered (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.30">Mt 10:30</a>), which is a vivid way of saying that God is concerned about the details of human life. But God is far more concerned with the eternal soul. Jesus made it clear that it would be unprofitable for anyone to gain the world and to lose his or her soul (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.26">Mt 16:26</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.8.36">Mk 8:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.25">Lk 9:25</a>). The focus falls on what a person is and not what he or she has. Jesus even said that a maimed body was preferable to a forfeited life (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.43-47">Mk 9:43-47</a>). One’s total fulfillment depends more on one’s spiritual condition than on one’s environment or physical well-being. He was not, of course, unconcerned about people’s physical state, as his many healings show, but his major concern was with people’s relationship with God.</p>
<p>Jesus never viewed humans as isolated individuals. Within God’s community people were expected to have responsibility toward one another. The Sermon on the Mount illustrated this social emphasis in the teaching of Jesus. Those who are merciful to others will obtain mercy (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.7">Mt 5:7</a>). There is special commendation for peacemakers (v <a href="?bref=Matt.5.9">9</a>). The disciples of Jesus are expected to bring light to others (v <a href="?bref=Matt.5.16">16</a>). They are expected to give more than expected (v <a href="?bref=Matt.5.40">40</a>). Jesus is clearly saying that people have responsibility beyond themselves.</p>
<p>The relation of people to God is one of dependence. Jesus taught men and women to pray to God for daily bread (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.11">Mt 6:11</a>) as a reminder that they cannot be wholly self-sufficient. He allowed no place in his teaching for humans to boast in their own achievements.</p>
<p>Jesus had some specific things to say about home life. He accepted the sanctity of the marriage contract (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.31-32">Mt 5:31-32</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.19.3-9">19:3-9</a>) and therefore showed a high regard for the honor and rights of the wife. It was more in his actions and attitudes rather than his specific teachings that Jesus showed his regard for the status of women. When he spoke of men, he often used the term in the sense of people, including both men and women. There is no suggestion that in matters of faith women were in the least inferior to men. Moreover, Luke points out how many women supported Jesus and his disciples in their travels.</p>
<p>Jesus had a high view of the human potential but also acknowledged their present condition. The stress on repentance (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.17">Mt 4:17</a>) shows a sinfulness of which people need to repent. This sense of need is implicit in the instances where Jesus pronounces forgiveness (e.g., to the paralytic, <a href="?bref=Matt.9.1-8">Mt 9:1-8</a>; and to the woman who anointed him, <a href="?bref=Luke.7.47-48">Lk 7:47-48</a>). In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus instructs his disciples to pray for forgiveness (<a href="?bref=Matt.6.12">Mt 6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.11.4">Lk 11:4</a>). He takes for granted that they need it and desire to obtain it.</p>
<p>Jesus gives no support to any self-righteousness in men or women. This is the burden of his criticism of the religious leaders in various sayings, but particularly in <a href="?bref=Matt.23.1-39">Matthew 23</a>. He was critical of Jewish teachers because they placed so much importance on works of merit as contributing to salvation. His whole approach depended on humans casting themselves on the mercy of God. This is vividly illustrated in the parable about the Pharisee and the tax collector at prayer (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.10-14">Lk 18:10-14</a>). It was the latter who threw himself on the mercy of God and who was commended by Jesus.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Jesus regarded sin as universal. He never suggested that there was anyone who was exempt from it. The major concept of sin in his teachings was alienation from God. This comes out clearly in John’s Gospel, with its strong antithesis between light and darkness, life and death (cf. <a href="?bref=John.5.24">Jn 5:24</a>). Indeed, the “world” in John’s Gospel represents the system that takes no account of God. But sin is also seen as enslavement to Satan. The life and teachings of Jesus are seen against the background of spiritual conflict. Jesus can even say to his opponents, “You are of your father the devil” (<a href="?bref=John.8.44">Jn 8:44</a>). He assumes throughout that there are hostile forces bringing man into subjection.</p>
<p>In the parable of the prodigal son, sin against God is linked with sin before the father. In other words, it is regarded in terms of rebellion and revolt (<a href="?bref=Luke.15.21">Lk 15:21</a>). This is a different assessment of the son’s offense than the one arrived at by the elder brother, who could see it only in terms of property. The view that humans are essentially in a state of rebellion against God is a basic tenet of Paul’s theological position, and it is important to note that it finds its root in the teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>There is no question that Jesus had much to say about condemnation. Those who did not believe and were therefore outside the provision of salvation that Jesus had made are declared to be already condemned (<a href="?bref=John.3.18">Jn 3:18</a>). At various times Jesus mentioned judgment to come, which shows that a person’s destiny is related to his or her present spiritual condition. Against this background of humanity’s spiritual need, the whole mission of Jesus must be seen. A person, if left to himself or herself, would be totally unable to achieve salvation, but Jesus came to offer eternal life to those who believe in him (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">Jn 3:16</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsabouttheChurch">Teachings about the Church</p>
<p class="fl">Some have supposed that Jesus did not predict that there would be a church. But on two occasions he used the word “church,” which means a people called out by God. On one of the occasions—at Caesarea Philippi—Jesus told Peter that he would build his church upon the rock (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.16-19">Mt 16:16-19</a>). It seems most probable that “rock” was intended to link the foundation of the church to Peter’s particular confession about Jesus. It is certain that the later church was a community that affirmed that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God. It is important to note that it is Christ himself who is the builder of the church. He assured his disciples that it would be impregnable (the gates of hades would not overcome it). Moreover, one of the functions of the church was to proclaim forgiveness of sins, and this is implied in what Jesus said to Peter. That the words were not intended to refer exclusively to him is clear from <a href="?bref=Matt.18.18">Matthew 18:18</a>, where similar words were addressed to all the disciples. The church, according to <a href="?bref=Matt.18.17">Matthew 18:17</a>, was to be a community that could settle disputes between believers.</p>
<p>In addition to these specific references to the church, Jesus assumed that his followers would meet together in his name (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.19-20">Mt 18:19-20</a>). In his final words in Matthew’s account, he commissioned them to teach what he had taught them and to baptize new disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.28.19-20">Mt 28:19-20</a>). He promised his presence would be with them. The command to baptize was reinforced by Jesus’ own example in submitting to John’s baptism. One other special rite that Jesus expected his disciples to observe was the Lord’s Supper. His instructions about this presuppose a later community that could observe it. Since the form of words used in the institution point to the meaning of the death of Christ, it is clear that Jesus intended the future community to be frequently reminded of the center of the faith. The Christian church was to be a group of people who knew that through Christ they had entered into a new relationship with God.</p>
<p>Although there are no references to the church in John’s Gospel, there are certainly hints that support the community idea. Jesus introduced himself as the Shepherd and spoke of his followers as forming a flock (<a href="?bref=John.10.16">Jn 10:16</a>). The sheep imagery occurs again in this Gospel when Peter is instructed three times by the risen Lord to feed the sheep (<a href="?bref=John.21.15-17">Jn 21:15-17</a>). Another figure of speech that Jesus used to bring out the group idea is that of the many branches that draw their life from the vine, and therefore belong to each other because of their common life in the vine.</p>
<p>Jesus recognized that the future community would need the aid of the Spirit. His teachings on this subject laid the foundation for the evident dependence of the early church on the Spirit, as seen in the book of Acts. Finally, it should be noted that there is a close connection between the church and the kingdom, although they are not identical. The kingdom is more comprehensive than the church, which is included within it.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsabouttheFuture">Teachings about the Future</p>
<p class="fl">Jesus thought of the kingdom in terms of both present realization and future hope. The future aspect is related to the end of the age. Although he did not spell it out in specific terms, Jesus did not leave his disciples without any knowledge of how the present age would end. He gave firm assurance that he would return at some time in the future.</p>
<p>He told the disciples that the Son of Man would come with his angels in his Father’s glory (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Mt 16:27</a>). In the discourse in which he answers the disciples’ question about the end of the world, he speaks again of the Son of Man coming in clouds with power and glory (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.26">Mk 13:26</a>), probably drawn from the familiar language of <a href="?bref=Dan.7.1-28">Daniel 7</a>. Jesus described various signs that would precede his own coming. He spoke of wars, conflicts, earthquakes, famines, and disturbances in the heavens. The gospel was to be preached to all nations. At the same time many false Christs would arise.</p>
<p>Jesus gave such details about his return to encourage his disciples in the face of persecution. The future hope had a definitely practical purpose. The disciples were urged to watch. The coming would happen as unexpectedly as a thief in the night. Jesus said that even he himself did not know when the coming would take place (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.32">Mk 13:32</a>).</p>
<p>Another important theme affecting the future is emphasized in Jesus’ teachings about resurrection. The Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the body. They attempted to trap Jesus with a question about a woman who had been married seven times. They wanted to know whose husband she would be at the resurrection (<a href="?bref=Mark.12.18-27">Mk 12:18-27</a>). Jesus pointed out that there would be no marriage when the dead rise. The Sadducees’ idea about resurrection was clearly wrong. Jesus’ teaching was that the resurrected would be like the angels. There is no doubt about the resurrection of the dead, although no information is given about the resurrection body. Jesus told a story about a rich man and a poor man who both died (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.19-31">Lk 16:19-31</a>). In the afterlife the rich man cries out in torment, while the poor man enjoys a state of blessedness. What is most clear from this is the certainty of the afterlife and the fact of a distinction between the two men, although we are not told on what grounds the distinction is made. Elsewhere in his teachings, Jesus suggested that the most vital requirement is faith in himself. The conversation between Jesus and the dying thief on the cross suggests that paradise for the latter consisted in an awareness of the presence of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.42-43">Lk 23:42-43</a>).</p>
<p>The theme of rewards and punishment occurs in many passages. In <a href="?bref=Matt.16.27">Matthew 16:27</a> Jesus says that the Son of Man will reward everyone according to what he or she has done. Those who are worthless are promised punishment in darkness (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.30">Mt 25:30</a>). Moreover, Jesus spoke of a day of judgment on which men and women must give an account, even of all their careless words (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.36-37">12:36-37</a>). In the parable of the sheep and the goats, he spoke of a separation that the Son of Man will make when he comes. Those commended are those who have shown concern for the believers (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">25:31-46</a>).</p>
<p>Among Jesus’ most solemn statements are those that speak of hell. There is no way of getting around his teachings about eternal punishment for the unrighteous (as in <a href="?bref=Matt.25.41,46">Mt 25:41, 46</a>), which is opposite to the eternal life promised to the righteous. He taught that his disciples would have a place prepared for them in heaven (<a href="?bref=John.14.2">Jn 14:2</a>), and spoke of a Book of Life in which the names of his disciples were written (<a href="?bref=Luke.10.20">Lk 10:20</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TeachingsaboutMoralIssues">Teachings about Moral Issues</p>
<p class="fl">Much of the teaching of Jesus is concerned with moral issues—so much so that some scholars have concluded that this was the main burden of his teaching. But the moral teachings cannot be considered apart from the many facets of his teachings outlined above. It has been said that there are close parallels between the teachings of Jesus and the moral teachings of Judaism. What is distinctive about Jesus’ teachings about morality is that the motive and power behind moral conduct is not conceived in terms of laws that must be obeyed. Right conduct is seen to be the result of a right relationship with God.</p>
<p>Jesus was himself the pattern for moral behavior. He made clear that his aim was to fulfill the will of God. There is no sense of legalism in his approach to ethical decisions. When—in the Sermon on the Mount—he compared his own teaching with that of Moses, he showed the importance of penetrating to the inner meaning (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.5.21-22,27-28,31-32">Mt 5:21-22, 27-28, 31-32</a>). On the face of it, Jesus made more rigorous demands than the Mosaic law, because he was concerned with probing the motives as well as the actions. Many have dismissed the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount as entirely impractical, but Jesus never intended that his teaching would be easy; he set as a target nothing less than the perfection of God himself (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.48">Mt 5:48</a>). Nevertheless, he called his yoke easy and his burden light (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29-30">11:29-30</a>), which suggests that he was not setting out an impossible ethical pattern. It must be remembered that he was not producing a manifesto for society. His concern was that each individual should have powerful motives for right decisions on matters of conduct. His reaction against a rigid application of Sabbath observance at the expense of the welfare of a needy person illustrates this point. Concern for others was rated higher than ritual correctness.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">No account of the life and teachings of Jesus would be complete without some indication of the place that Jesus Christ gained in the developing church. Such a quest naturally takes us outside the scope of the Gospels into the testimony of the book of Acts and Paul’s letters. There we can see whether the predictions of Jesus were fulfilled and whether in fact the early Christians took his teaching seriously. Although there can be no question that Jesus Christ became central to the faith of the early Christians, he was regarded from many points of view. He was seen as Messiah in the sense of a spiritual deliverer, as Lord in the sense of being sovereign over his people, as Servant in the sense of his obedience to suffering, as Son in his relation to his Father. In many ways the full understanding of what and who he was could not have occurred until after the resurrection. Therefore, we find that many facets of his teachings about himself were more fully developed in the reflections of his people. This is true in a special sense of the writings of the apostle Paul.</p>
<p>Many have found a problem in linking the Gospels with their detailed presentation of the acts and teachings of Jesus with the Christ who is so central in Paul’s beliefs. The problem arises because the apostle does not refer to any specific incident in the life of Jesus and does not reflect in his epistles any acquaintance with the large amount of teaching material in the Gospels. Does this suggest that Paul had no interest in the historical Jesus? Or could it be maintained that he knew nothing about him? Those who have driven a wedge between Paul and Jesus have not given sufficient weight to those incidental indications that Paul knew a great deal more about the historical Jesus than he states in his letters. He writes, for instance, about the meekness and gentleness of Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.10.1">2 Cor 10:1</a>), suggesting that he knew that Jesus had said of himself that he was meek and lowly of heart (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.29">Mt 11:29</a>). Moreover, Paul speaks of the poverty of Christ (<a href="?bref=2Cor.8.9">2 Cor 8:9</a>) and must have known that the Son of Man had nowhere to lay his head. He certainly knows the details of how Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.23-26">1 Cor 11:23-26</a>), and he knows of his death by crucifixion. It seems reasonable to conclude that Paul assumes that his readers will be acquainted with the Gospel material.</p>
<p>It is perhaps useful in this connection to inquire whether the life and teachings of Jesus played a significant part in the early Christian proclamation. One passage that is valuable in this respect is <a href="?bref=Acts.10.36-38">Acts 10:36-38</a>. In Peter’s address to Cornelius, he spoke of God’s having anointed Jesus of Nazareth, and of Jesus’ having gone about doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil. It is clear that some account of the acts of Jesus was included in the early preaching, and there is no reason to suppose that this was not a regular procedure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the example of Jesus was a powerful motive for promoting right behavior. Peter appeals to it in encouraging Christians who were suffering for their faith (<a href="?bref=1Pet.2.21">1 Pt 2:21</a>). Paul also knows the value of imitation (<a href="?bref=1Cor.11.1">1 Cor 11:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.1.6">1 Thes 1:6</a>). Since Jesus was recognized as being a man who did not sin (cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>), his behavior patterns would have proved invaluable for those who needed a new standard for moral action. While this idea of example is unquestionably present in the Epistles, it would be quite wrong to suppose that it formed a major part of Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>There are a few references to the teachings of Jesus in the non-Gospel portion of the NT. In the Letter of James, which is almost wholly practical, there are more allusions to the teachings of Jesus than anywhere else in the NT. This is especially true in echoes of the Sermon on the Mount, and it shows the strong contribution that the moral teaching of Jesus had on the ethical values of the early Christians. Most of the expositions of doctrine in the Epistles find their basis in some aspect of the teachings of Jesus. These teachings have an ongoing significance for the development of the church.</p>
<p>To what extent is knowledge of the life and teachings of Jesus relevant to the 21st century? Existential theologians have driven such a wedge between the Christ of faith and the Jesus of history that the latter has ceased to have any importance for them. Christians today, no less than their first-century predecessors, need to know that the object of their faith is the same one who lived and taught in Galilee and Judea.</p>

  <title>Jethro</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JETHRO</p>
<p class="fl">Father-in-law of Moses. Zipporah, Jethro’s daughter, became Moses’ wife while he was a fugitive in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.21">Ex 2:21</a>). When Moses departed for Egypt, he took Zipporah and his sons with him (<a href="?bref=Exod.4.20">4:20</a>), but he must have sent them back. Jethro brought them to Moses after the Israelites arrived in Sinai (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.1-7">18:1-7</a>). Through this familial relationship with Moses, Jethro became involved with Israel.</p>
<p>Jethro’s relationship with Israel has been variously interpreted. Jethro was a priest of Midian (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16">Ex 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.3.1">3:1</a>). It is not definitely known what the religion of the Midianites was, but some scholars have suggested that the Kenites, who were a tribe included in the nation of Midianites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>), had a tribal god named Yahweh whom Jethro served as priest. Scholars who have suggested that Jethro’s tribal god, Yahweh, was introduced to Israel by Moses have not been able to establish their case. Biblical evidence does not support this interpretation. That Jethro was a god-fearing and god-serving man is quite clear. The biblical record could be understood to teach that Jethro knew of Israel’s God because he was a descendant of Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.25.2">Gn 25:2</a>). Having heard of Yahweh’s deliverance of his people from Egypt, Jethro acknowledged him as God, greatest of all gods. He also brought a burnt offering and sacrifices, thereby worshiping Yahweh and identifying with Israel (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.11">Ex 18:11</a>). This action has been interpreted as Jethro’s acceptance of a covenant with Israel, but the interpretation rests upon a faulty reading of what Jethro actually did and the meaning of sacrifice and a fellowship meal. Upon receiving Jethro’s good counsel concerning procedures for judging disputes among the people, Moses appointed able men as heads and judges over the people (vv <a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-27">13-27</a>). Jethro departed to his own land and seems to have had no further interaction with Israel, but his son (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29-33">Nm 10:29-33</a>) and other descendants later became a part of Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">4:11</a>).</p>
<p> Jethro is referred to by other names, both in the Scriptures and later. The Talmud records that his name was Jether originally, but after his conversion it became Jethro; there is no definite evidence to support this. He is called Reuel, the father of seven daughters whom Moses met at a well (<a href="?bref=Exod.2.16-18">Ex 2:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>). He is also referred to by the name Hobab (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Jgs 4:11</a>); and he is said to be the son of Reuel (<a href="?bref=Num.10.29">Nm 10:29</a>). The Scriptures do not explain the use of the different names. Suggestions include the following: (1) each Midianite tribe he served as a priest knew him by a different name; (2) Reuel was a tribal name, not personal; (3) Hobab, the son’s name, was used to refer to the father; (4) a gloss appears in the text at <a href="?bref=Exod.2.18">Exodus 2:18</a> and <a href="?bref=Judg.4.11">Judges 4:11</a>. It can be quite clearly established, however, that Jethro had a son named Hobab.</p>

<p class="h1">JEW</p>
<p class="fl">Judean, belonging to Judah. The short form of the English word was developed from the French. The underlying Hebrew word is used first in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.16.6">2 Kings 16:6</a> as a national term, meaning citizens of Judah. It came into general use in the period of Jeremiah just before the exile (late sixth century <span class="era">BC</span>; see <a href="?bref=Jer.32.12">Jer 32:12</a>). It reflects a growing sense of national identity among foreign nations in an international world. In <a href="?bref=Jer.34.9">Jeremiah 34:9</a>, a statement concerning the national principle that an individual citizen had the right to freedom from slavery uses the term “Jew.” In <a href="?bref=Jer.52.28">Jeremiah 52:28</a> it is poignantly used in giving the number of deported citizens.</p>
<p>Once the people were in exile, the term’s national meaning was expanded with a religious one. The Jews were different from surrounding peoples in that they preserved a living religious tradition of one true God. A Jewish-Gentile polarization developed. Thus in <a href="?bref=Dan.3.8-12">Daniel 3:8-12</a> certain Jews are accused of deviating from otherwise acceptable Babylonian religious practices. The book of Esther is concerned with the problem of Jewish identity and survival in a hostile alien environment. <a href="?bref=Esth.8.17">Esther 8:17</a> speaks of Gentiles declaring themselves Jews in the religious sense of becoming proselytes.</p>
<p>After the exile, the strongly religious meaning of “Jew” is expressed in the prophecy of <a href="?bref=Zech.8.23">Zechariah 8:23</a> that the Jew would be courted by Gentiles because God was with him. In <a href="?bref=Ezra.4.12">Ezra 4:12</a> the term “Jews” is the national designation of the returned exiles, as it is in the book of Nehemiah (e.g., <a href="?bref=Neh.1.2">Neh 1:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Neh.4.2">4:2</a>). In <a href="?bref=Neh.13.24">Nehemiah 13:24</a> there is a consciousness of the social exclusiveness of the Jews: on religious grounds, marriage to foreigners is deplored.</p>
<p>In the NT “Jew” continues to have the same national and/or religious meaning. Culturally, Jews have religious and other customs that NT documents addressed to Gentiles find it necessary to explain (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.3">Mk 7:3</a>; <a href="?bref=John.5.1">Jn 5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.40">19:40</a>). Jews are contrasted with Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.19">Acts 11:19</a>), Samaritans (<a href="?bref=John.4.9,22">Jn 4:9, 22</a>), and proselytes (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.10">Acts 2:10</a>). Jewish Christians can be called “Jews” (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.13">Gal 2:13</a>), but there is an increasing stress on the religious distinctions between Jew and Christian. In <a href="?bref=Rom.2.17-29">Romans 2:17-29</a> Paul gives an interesting theological analysis of the term “Jew.” He is at pains to emphasize that the true meaning of the word lies not in outward religious profession but in an inward attitude to God. Paul was doubtless thinking of the inadequacy of his own life as a Jew before he was converted to the Christian faith (cf. <a href="?bref=Phil.3.3-6">Phil 3:3-6</a>). His mention of “praise” in <a href="?bref=Rom.2.29">Romans 2:29</a> is the climax of the passage. It is a forceful play on words: in Hebrew, Judah means praise (<a href="?bref=Gen.29.35">Gn 29:35</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.49.8">49:8</a>).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul is here moving in the direction of regarding Christianity as the true heir of the faith of the OT. <a href="?bref=Rev.2.9">Revelation 2:9</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.3.9">3:9</a> express similar sentiments: to be truly a Jew is much more than a matter of birth and synagogue observance. Underlying these passages in both Revelation and Romans is obviously the issue of the messianic claims of Jesus (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.9.3-5">Rom 9:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.10.1-4">10:1-4</a>). The NT bears sad testimony to the opposition of Jews to the Christian message. The gospel proved a cause of offense to the Jews (<a href="?bref=1Cor.1.23">1 Cor 1:23</a>). Paul himself, despite his claim of impeccable Jewish credentials (<a href="?bref=Acts.26.4-7">Acts 26:4-7</a>), found himself the object of bitter Jewish attacks (<a href="?bref=Acts.21.11">21:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.12,27">23:12, 27</a>). <a href="?bref=Rev.2.9">Revelation 2:9</a> and <a href="?bref=Rev.3.9">3:9</a> describe the Jews’ opposition as satanic: they were carrying out the work of God’s adversary, Satan.</p>
<p>These negative overtones are especially attached to the use of the word “Jew” in John’s Gospel. It is found some 70 times, versus about five or six instances in each of the synoptic Gospels. Some passages, such as those already cited, have no associations of hostility. But in most cases the fourth Gospel uses “Jews” in the sense of the religious authorities, especially those in Jerusalem, who were hostile to Jesus (see, e.g., <a href="?bref=John.5.18">Jn 5:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.9.18">9:18</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.8">11:8</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.36">18:36</a>). It is noteworthy that in <a href="?bref=John.9.22">9:22</a> the parents of the blind man, clearly Jews themselves, are said, literally, to fear the investigating Jews. In <a href="?bref=John.18.14">18:14</a> “Jews” stands for the chief priests and Pharisees of <a href="?bref=John.18.3">18:3</a>. It must be emphasized that the author, who was obviously a Jew himself, was not expressing an anti-Semitic viewpoint as such. He condemned not race or people but those who opposed Jesus. He gladly acknowledged that some Jews put their faith in Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.8.31">8:31</a>; <a href="?bref=John.11.45">11:45</a>: <a href="?bref=John.12.11">12:11</a>). Nathanael is featured as a type of the Christian Jew, a true Israelite “in whom is no guile” (<a href="?bref=John.1.47">1:47</a>; cf. v <a href="?bref=John.1.31">31</a>; see <a href="?bref=Gen.27.35">Gn 27:35</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.32.28">32:28</a>).</p>

  <title>Jewelry, Jewels</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JEWELRY, JEWELS</p>
<p class="fl">Decorated adornments. In the Bible, jewelry was used by both men and women (<a href="?bref=Exod.11.2">Ex 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.3.18-21">Is 3:18-21</a>). Items of jewelry were given as presents (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.22,53">Gn 24:22, 53</a>) and were regularly seized as spoil in war (<a href="?bref=2Chr.20.25">2 Chr 20:25</a>). Before coinage came into use, jewels were associated with gold and silver as a measure of wealth (<a href="?bref=2Chr.21.3">21:3</a>) or as a standard of value (<a href="?bref=Job.28.16">Jb 28:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Pr.3.15">Prv 3:15</a>).</p>
<p>In the OT a wide variety of jewelry is mentioned—arm bracelets (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.22,30,47">Gn 24:22, 30, 47</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.11">Ez 16:11</a>), ankle ornaments (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.18-20">Is 3:18-20</a>), necklaces (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">Gn 41:42</a>), crowns (<a href="?bref=Zech.9.16">Zec 9:16</a>), earrings (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.22">Gn 24:22</a>), nose rings (<a href="?bref=Isa.3.21">Is 3:21</a>), and finger rings (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">Gn 41:42</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.3.10">Est 3:10</a>). In each case a gold or silver mounting was used to hold the precious stones. It would seem that the modern art of faceting was not used but the precious stone was rounded, polished, and sometimes engraved. Many of the precious stones valued in antiquity would hardly be classed as precious today, though they might be classified as semiprecious.</p>
<p>Semiprecious stones were frequently incorporated into necklaces and other pieces of jewelry. Royal headdresses from the graves at Ur near the Persian Gulf give an indication of the skill of jewelers around 2700 <span class="era">BC</span>. Hairbands and pins were necessary parts of hair adornment and have been recovered from numerous Near Eastern archaeological sites. Rings, often with delicately carved stones, were extremely popular, and nose rings were also in use by the middle Bronze Age (see <a href="?bref=Gen.24.47">Gn 24:47</a>). Fine gold chains were frequently worn. A signet ring and a heavy gold chain were decorative symbols of office (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.42">41:42</a>). Bracelets and amulets were worn around the wrist, the upper arm, and the neck. Decorative pins, similar in design and intent to the modern safety pin, were often used to hold clothing together.</p>
<p>An excellent description of women’s clothing and jewelry is found in <a href="?bref=Isa.3.18-23">Isaiah 3:18-23</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>), where the prophet warns: “The Lord will strip away their artful beauty—their ornaments, headbands, and crescent necklaces; their earrings, bracelets, and veils of shimmering gauze. Gone will be their scarves, ankle chains, sashes, perfumes, and charms; their rings, jewels, party clothes, gowns, capes, and purses; their mirrors, linen garments, head ornaments, and shawls.”</p>

  <title>Jezebel</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JEZEBEL</p>
<p class="fl">Daughter of Ethbaal, king of Sidon (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">1 Kgs 16:31</a>). She became the wife of Ahab, king of the northern kingdom of Israel. The marriage was probably a continuation of the friendly relations between Israel and Phoenicia begun by Omri; it confirmed a political alliance between the two nations. Jezebel exerted a strong influence over the life of Israel, as she insisted on establishing the worship of Baal and demanded the absolute rights of the monarchy. So strong was her pagan influence that Scripture attributes the apostasy of Ahab directly to Jezebel (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.30-33">30-33</a>).</p>
<p>Jezebel’s efforts to establish Baal worship in Israel began with Ahab’s acceptance of Baal following the marriage (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.31">1 Kgs 16:31</a>). Ahab followed Jezebel’s practices by building a house of worship and altar for Baal in Samaria, and by setting up a pole for worship of the Asherah. A campaign was then conducted to exterminate the prophets of God (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.4">18:4</a>), while Jezebel organized and supported large groups of Baal prophets, housing and feeding large numbers of them in the royal palace (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.19">19</a>). To meet this challenge, God sent Elijah to prophesy a drought that lasted three years (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1">17:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.1">18:1</a>).</p>
<p>Elijah’s confrontation with Jezebel and Ahab culminated on Mt Carmel, where Elijah demanded that the prophets of Baal meet him (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.18.19-40">1 Kgs 18:19-40</a>). As they and the people of Israel gathered, Elijah issued the challenge to Israel to follow the true God. To demonstrate who was the true God, Baal’s prophets and Elijah each took a bull for sacrifice. The prophets of Baal then prepared the sacrifice and called on their god to send fire to consume it. But no answer came. Elijah prepared his sacrifice and had it drenched in water. After his prayer, God sent fire that consumed the sacrifice, the wood, the stones of the altar, the dust, and the water in the trench. Following this, the Israelites fell down in tribute to God. Then Elijah directed the people to take the prophets of Baal to the brook Kishon, and he slaughtered all of them. When Jezebel heard of this, she flew into a rage and threatened Elijah with the same fate. In fear, Elijah fled for his life to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Jezebel’s unscrupulous nature is revealed in the account of Ahab’s desire for Naboth’s vineyard (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-16">1 Kgs 21:1-16</a>). Although Ahab desired the vineyard, he recognized Naboth’s right to retain the family property. Jezebel recognized no such right in view of a monarch’s wishes. She arranged to have Naboth falsely accused of blaspheming God and consequently executed, leaving the vineyard for Ahab to seize. For this heinous crime, Elijah pronounced a violent death for Ahab and Jezebel (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.20-24">21:20-24</a>), a prophecy which was ultimately fulfilled (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.29-40">1 Kgs 22:29-40</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.1-37">2 Kgs 9:1-37</a>).</p>
<p>The corrupt influence of Jezebel spread to the southern kingdom of Judah through her daughter Athaliah, who married Jehoram, king of Judah. Thus the idolatry of Phoenicia infected both kingdoms of the Hebrews through this evil Sidonian princess.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=Rev.2.20">Revelation 2:20</a> the name of Jezebel is used (probably symbolically) to refer to a prophetess who seduced the Christians of Thyatira to fornication and to eating things sacrificed to idols.</p>

<p class="h1">JEZREEL (P<span class="lc">lace</span>)</p>
<p class="list">1. Town originally founded by the tribe of Issachar to the south of Shunem, a site that was abandoned in the el-Amarna period by earlier settlers (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.18">Jos 19:18</a>). The city became associated with a number of important events in the history of Israel.</p>
<p class="list-text">It probably gained some of its importance from the decline of the ancient town of Beth-shan during the Iron Age. Jezreel became the center of an important district in Saul’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.9">2 Sm 2:9</a>), and a nearby spring served as the rallying point for Saul’s army before they met the Philistines in the battle of Mt Gilboa (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1">1 Sm 29:1</a>). After Saul’s death, the town was, for a short time, part of Ishbosheth’s kingdom (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-11">2 Sm 2:8-11</a>). In Solomon’s day it was assigned to the tenth district of Issachar and was excluded from the main Jezreel Valley. It was administered by Jehoshaphat, son of Paruah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.17">1 Kgs 4:17</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In the days of Omri (885–874 <span class="era">BC</span>) it was chosen as the site of the king’s winter capital, and the four kings of his dynasty down to Joram (852–841 <span class="era">BC</span>) all resided there. It was to this place that Joram retired to recover from wounds received in battle (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.8.29">2 Kgs 8:29</a>). Jezreel was a walled city with a gate and a tower from which the countryside could be surveyed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.17">9:17</a>), and it was administered by a council of elders and nobles (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1">10:1</a>). The royal palace was adjacent to the vineyard owned by Naboth, the Jezreelite, which was seized illegally by King Ahab (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1-29">1 Kgs 21</a>). For this dastardly deed the dynasty of Ahab received severe retribution. Jezebel, Ahab’s Phoenician wife, was thrown to the dogs through an upper window at the time of Jehu’s usurpation of the throne. King Joram, wounded in battle, was slain by Jehu along with his courtiers and his body cast into the field of Naboth (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.9.24-26">2 Kgs 9:24-26</a>). The remnant of Ahab’s household were killed at the same time (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.10.1-11">10:1-11</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After the downfall of Omri’s dynasty, the town declined in importance, although it is mentioned as a village by a number of writers in the Christian era. Eusebius (<span class="era">AD</span> 260–340), for example, refers to it as a village between Scythopolis (Beth-shan) and Legio (<span class="ital">Onomasticon</span> 108:13ff.). The Crusaders called it “le Petit Gerim” to distinguish it from “le Grand Gerim.”</p>
<p class="list-text">Today Jezreel is identified with Zer’in, the site of an Israeli kibbutz about 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) north of Jerusalem. Archaeological remains found in the area point to an occupation in the Iron Age and the Roman period.</p>
<p class="list">2. Town in the mountains of Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.56">Jos 15:56</a>). It was the hometown of Ahinoam, one of David’s wives (<a href="?bref=1Sam.25.43">1 Sm 25:43</a>), but nothing is known about the site today.</p>

  <title>Jezreel Valley</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JEZREEL VALLEY</p>
<p class="fl">Largest and richest valley in the land of Israel. It was named after Jezreel, and it was apparently the only town on the plain where the Israelites had gained a foothold in the early stages of their conquest (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.27-30">Jgs 1:27-30</a>). The form of the name in later Greek sources is Esdraelon (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.8">Jdt 1:8</a>); some scholars have wrongly applied the latter term to the great western plain and the former to the narrow valley leading eastward to Beth-shan. Comparison of <a href="?bref=Josh.17.16">Joshua 17:16</a> with <a href="?bref=Judg.1.27-28">Judges 1:27-28</a> and <a href="?bref=Josh.17.11">Joshua 17:11</a> shows that the Beth-shan area was considered as a separate entity from the valley of Jezreel, which included the cities of Taanach and Megiddo among others (cf. also <a href="?bref=Hos.1.5">Hos 1:5</a>).</p>
<p>The Midianites camped there, between the hill of Moreh and Mt Tabor (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.33">Jgs 6:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.7.1">7:1</a>); Barak defeated the army of Sisera and Jabin there, near Endor (<a href="?bref=Ps.83.9-10">Ps 83:9-10</a>), and later the Philistines gathered there to oppose Saul (<a href="?bref=1Sam.29.1,11">1 Sm 29:1, 11</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.4.4">2 Sm 4:4</a>). Under the monarchy, the valley was an administrative district (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.9">2 Sm 2:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.12">1 Kgs 4:12</a>). Another name, perhaps applicable only to the southern half of the valley, is the plain of Megiddo (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.22">2 Chr 35:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.12.11">Zec 12:11</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfJezreel"/>
<p>The valley figures in the wars of Thutmose III and Amenhotep II, and the towns there, especially Megiddo, were under Egyptian control in the late Bronze Age. The southwestern side was famous as a military assembly ground, probably called Harosheth-haggoyim (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.2,13-16">Jgs 4:2, 13-16</a>).</p>

  <title>Joab</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JOAB</p>
<p class="list">1. Son of Zeruiah, the half sister of David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.16">1 Chr 2:16</a>), who, along with his brothers Abishai and Asahel, was well known for his military valor in Judah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.18">2 Sm 2:18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.26.6">1 Sm 26:6</a>). According to 2 Samuel, Joab rose to prominence and distinguished himself at the battle of Gibeon when Saul’s troops under Abner were vanquished (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.8-32">2 Sm 2:8-32</a>). Because Abner had slain Joab’s brother Asahel (v <a href="?bref=2Sam.2.23">23</a>), Joab later killed Abner in revenge (<a href="?bref=2Sam.3.26-30">3:26-30</a>), despite Abner’s new loyalty to David (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.12-19">12-19</a>). Possibly Joab sensed that Abner would be his rival. Nevertheless, David praised the slain commander as a prince and a great man (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.31-39">31-39</a>) and set a curse on the house of Joab for his insubordination (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.3.26-29,39">26-29, 39</a>). This incident illumines Joab’s sometimes unscrupulous and ruthless behavior.</p>
<p class="list-text">Joab spearheaded David’s siege of the Jebusite city of Jerusalem, and when David consolidated his reign there, Joab became the commander of the king’s army (<a href="?bref=2Sam.8.16">2 Sm 8:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1">11:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Chr.11.6-8">1 Chr 11:6-8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.18.15">18:15</a>). He suppressed a rebellion among the Syrians and Ammonites (<a href="?bref=2Sam.10.7-14">2 Sm 10:7-14</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.19.8-15">1 Chr 19:8-15</a>). At Rabbah he not only conquered the city (<a href="?bref=2Sam.11.1-12.31">2 Sm 11–12</a>) but arranged for the death of Uriah the Hittite so that David could take Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba.</p>
<p class="list-text">Joab’s loyalties to David and shrewd control of the army are seen during Absalom’s rebellion (<a href="?bref=2Sam.15.1-37">2 Sm 15</a>). Joab suppressed the conspiracy (ch <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.1-33">18</a>), but ignoring a direct order from David not to kill his son (<a href="?bref=2Sam.18.5">18:5</a>), brutally killed him anyway (vv <a href="?bref=2Sam.18.10-17">10-17</a>). When David mourned, Joab rebuked the king, urging that a crisis with the army was imminent (<a href="?bref=2Sam.19.5-7">19:5-7</a>). This insubordination led David to replace Joab with Amasa as commander (v <a href="?bref=2Sam.19.13">13</a>), but later, at Gibeon, Joab also killed him dishonorably (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.8-10">20:8-10</a>). Joab’s influence in the army must have been great, since he regained his former role as military commander (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.23,24">2 Sm 20:23, 24:2</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.19">1 Kgs 1:19</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">At the end of David’s reign, Joab supported the conspiracy of Adonijah and Abiathar against the throne (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.7">1 Kgs 1:7</a>). David’s distrust of him led the king to warn Solomon specifically about Joab’s repeated treacheries (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.5-9">2:5-9</a>). Solomon had to resolve the problem of an untrustworthy army. Therefore, upon his father’s death, Solomon pursued the conspirators Adonijah (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.23">23</a>), Abiathar (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.26">26</a>), and Joab (v <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.28">28</a>). Solomon’s officer Benaiah found Joab at the altar seeking refuge and killed him there (vv <a href="?bref=1Kgs.2.28-35">28-35</a>), thus cleansing Solomon’s reign from the wrongdoing of Joab.</p>

<p class="list-text">The etymology of the name is difficult. Some have seen it as a derivative of a Hebrew word meaning “to be hostile” and have suggested that it reflects Job’s adamancy in refusing to bow to God’s will. The name occurs in several West Semitic texts as a proper name, however, and it seems best to understand it simply as a common name. The meaning of the name in West Semitic is either “no father” or “where is my father?”</p>
<p class="list-text">The lack of certainty surrounding the authorship and geographical provenance of the book makes it difficult to place Job in history. The occurrence of Job’s name in <a href="?bref=Ezek.14.14,20">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a> seems to support the possibility that he was a personage of great antiquity.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The question of the authorship of the book of Job is a difficult one. The difficulty is compounded not only by the lack of ascription of authorship to any individual but also by the structure of the book which, according to some scholars, is a composite consisting of several literary works.</p>
<p>Some scholars who think the book is a composite work base their views on alleged incongruities existing among the various sections. The prologue (chs <a href="?bref=Job.1.1-2.13">1–2</a>) and the epilogue (<a href="?bref=Job.42.7-17">42:7-17</a>), for example, are seen as separate from the body of the book because they seem to present Job as a man of perfect moral character. The dialogues, however, picture a somewhat more human Job whose utterances about God are at times brash and shocking.</p>
<p>It is true that Job is depicted as a man of perfect moral character in the prologue. But it should be noted that while he refuses his wife’s suggestion to curse God, an account recorded in the prologue (<a href="?bref=Job.2.9-10">2:9-10</a>), he does not curse God in the dialogues either. The very point of the book seems to be that even one of the highest moral character must struggle with the ways of God in this world. Only after the series of misfortunes recorded in chapters <a href="?bref=Job.1.1-22">1</a> and <a href="?bref=Job.2.1-13">2</a>, and the period of inner struggle that no doubt transpired during the seven days and seven nights before he began to speak (<a href="?bref=Job.2.11-13">2:11-13</a>), did Job find those deep inner questions that the book deals with. Job’s high moral character is quite evident in the dialogues, for throughout, even though he cannot comprehend God, he speaks the truth before him.</p>
<p>Other portions alleged to be additions to the book are the speeches of Elihu (<a href="?bref=Job.32.1-37.24">32–37</a>), the discourse of God (<a href="?bref=Job.38.1-41.34">38–41</a>), and the discourse on wisdom in chapter <a href="?bref=Job.28.1-28">28</a>. Some scholars think the author of the final version borrowed these existing works to provide a literary structure for his own work.</p>
<p>The main structure of the book, consisting of prologue, dialogues, and an epilogue, need not necessarily be regarded as the result of a complex process of editing. The Code of Hammurabi, for example, has a similar structure, as does an ancient Egyptian work called <span class="ital">A Dispute over Suicide.</span></p>
<p>With regard to the problem of authorship, it seems best to acknowledge that the author is anonymous. His theology is certainly Yahwistic; thus, he was probably a Hebrew. His literary skills were remarkable, for he has produced one of the finest works known through the ages.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Since the authorship of the book is in question, so is the date of the book. Most modern scholars place the book in the postexilic period, around the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. However, some place it toward the end of the exile. Others put it in the Solomonic era, while still others place it in the period of the patriarchs.</p>
<p>The internal evidence points to a very early setting for the book. There are no Levitical institutions cited. Job sacrifices for his family as in the period before the priesthood (<a href="?bref=Job.1.5">1:5</a>). The wealth of Job, given in terms of livestock, seems to reflect the patriarchal milieu (v <a href="?bref=Job.1.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>The language of the book may also point to an early date. Certain linguistic elements indicate more archaic forms of Hebrew, as preserved in the epic material from Ugarit. It may be that Job himself lived in the second millennium <span class="era">BC</span>. If the book—or part of it—was written then, it may represent the first written material to find its way into the biblical canon. The book may have come into its final form in the Solomonic era, when so much of the Hebrew Wisdom Literature was produced.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Job belongs to the body of OT materials known as the Wisdom Literature. This literature deals with the basic issues of human life. The Israelites were not the only ancient people to produce Wisdom Literature. This type of material came out of pagan cultures as well, and often represents efforts to explain the course of human events within the structure of pagan religion.</p>
<p>Several ancient works similar to the OT book of Job are known from ancient cultures. A Sumerian book exists that does not compare with the biblical book, either in literary scope or depth of feeling. It depicts the plight of a young man whose sorrow was turned to joy as a result of extended pleading to his personal deity. According to Sumerian thought, the gods were responsible for evil as well as good. Only placation of some kind could prevent the evil they might do. There is no attempt to philosophize or expound the problem of the presence of evil in the world.</p>
<p>A Babylonian book, commonly titled <span class="ital">I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom,</span> is philosophically similar to the Sumerian <span class="ital">Job.</span> In the work the writer describes his suffering in vivid terminology. No one can help him. He wonders whether the ritual obligations of his pagan religion really are pleasing to a god. An emissary of the god Marduk appears to him in a dream and relieves his suffering. The work ends with a section of praise to Marduk in which occurs the affirmation that the offerings he gave the gods served to gladden the hearts of the gods.</p>
<p>Another work, “A Dialogue about Human Misery,” is also similar to the biblical book of Job. It struggles with the fact that worship of the deities seems to make no difference in the quality of one’s life. A figure in this work reminds the sufferer that the ways of the gods are difficult to understand, and man is naturally perverse. The sufferer appeals to the gods, but the dialogue ends at that point with no resolution to the problem.</p>
<p>These literary works are not comparable to the OT book of Job theologically or philosophically. They offer only a fatalistic outlook on life and understand life to be governed by the capricious will of the gods. However, these documents, which date variously between the second and first millennia <span class="era">BC</span>, may provide us with the literary ground from which the book of Job sprang. That is, the book of Job may present the inspired answer to the deep questions that were being considered at this time in history. Thus, this type of literature may argue for an early date for the book of Job.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The question of the central purpose of the book of Job has been a serious one in biblical scholarship for ages. It is difficult to assert that the purpose of the book is to present the solution to the problem of evil, for at the very point where an answer is expected, God asks questions instead of giving answers.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that the central purpose is to answer the question “Why do the righteous suffer?” It is true that the book has much to do with this question, but it too presents various problems. When one comes to the end of the book, he or she has only the words of the comforters and the statements of Elihu relating to that question—not a great deal at all. Then one may wonder why we were given the long dialogues with their record of Job’s internal struggles. When God speaks from the whirlwind, we find no concern to explain why the righteous suffer. Job is simply led to accept his place in the universe.</p>
<p>It seems best to adopt another approach to the book. In attempting to find the central theme of any literary work, one should look to the prologue and the epilogue. In the prologue one can see what the author intends to do, and in the epilogue the reader will find the author’s understanding of what the author actually has done.</p>
<p>In the prologue of Job, the author deftly establishes an atmosphere of suspense. We are told of Job’s perfect moral character. Then Satan taunts, “Take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!” (<a href="?bref=Job.1.11">1:11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). We wonder whether Job will curse God and thus deny his faith, but then we hear his great affirmation of trust: “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> gave me everything I had, and the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> has taken it away. Praise the name of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>!” (v <a href="?bref=Job.1.21">21</a>).</p>
<p>The writer then sets up another suspenseful situation when Satan proposes to afflict Job. To this trial is added the discouraging words of Job’s wife: “Curse God and die.” Again we wonder whether this trial will destroy Job’s faith. The suspense is broken when we read that “in all this, Job said nothing wrong” (<a href="?bref=Job.2.10">2:10</a>).</p>
<p>The writer then introduces Job’s friends into the narrative. We are told that they remained silent for seven days. We wonder what is going on in Job’s mind. Is he still the man of staunch faith, or is his trust being eroded as the disease eats at his flesh? When Job speaks and curses the day of his birth, the suspense becomes intense. The writer has raised a question in our minds: Will Job’s faith remain secure?</p>
<p>At times we think it will. Job makes several great affirmations of faith. He states that God will vindicate him. One of the greatest affirmations of the book occurs in <a href="?bref=Job.19.25-27">19:25-27</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>): “But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and that he will stand upon the earth at last. And after my body has decayed, yet in my body I will see God! I will see him for myself. Yes, I will see him with my own eyes. I am overwhelmed at the thought!” At other times Job expresses deep doubts about God’s orderly control of the universe. The suspense continues. Throughout the dialogues we trace the pattern of Job’s struggle. It is an emotional struggle in which Job speaks from the depths of despair and the heights of triumphant faith.</p>
<p>In the epilogue the suspense is resolved. Job’s trials have not destroyed or even eroded his faith. He emerges triumphant, with a humble faith. He can finally say to God, “I know that you can do anything, and no one can stop you. You ask, ‘Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance?’ It is I. And I was talking about things I did not understand, things far too wonderful for me” (<a href="?bref=Job.42.2-3">42:2-3</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the writer is clear. At the outset he has raised the question “Will Job’s faith endure in spite of trial?” The dialogues have heightened the suspense, and the epilogue resolves it. Job has remained faithful to God in the midst of his suffering. We learn that Job’s faith is genuine.</p>
<p>The book of Job, therefore, is a treatise on faith and the role that suffering plays in faith. The book of Job teaches that the truly righteous person will remain faithful to God in spite of the seeming delay of God’s justice. He may not be able to comprehend all that God does in history, but his faith in God’s good plan and wise providence will remain secure. This aspect of faith is one facet of the total spectrum of faith in the Bible. It does not allow for works but is totally dependent on God.</p>
<p>The same relationship between faith and suffering may be found in the NT as well. In <a href="?bref=Jas.1.12">James 1:12</a> trials and faithfulness are woven together in the word “Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>; see also <a href="?bref=1Pet.1.3-7">1 Pt 1:3-7</a>). According to these passages, trials provide the test of faith and thus reveal whether one’s faith is true or false. Faith that is not true will not stand the test of suffering (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.20-21">Mt 13:20-21</a>). The book of Job connects faith and trials; it portrays the nature of a genuine faith, a faith unbroken by suffering.</p>
<p>There are other principles in this rich book. It teaches that sin brings punishment. There is truth in the words of the comforters that is corroborated by Scripture. Yet this is but a small part of the role of suffering in life. The book also teaches that suffering has a didactic function, for it is chastening from the Almighty. In the section in which God speaks from the whirlwind, we learn that suffering is part of the structure of things and that we must submit to the wisdom of the Creator. In this section God reveals himself personally. Job could say, “I had heard about you before, but now I have seen you with my own eyes” (<a href="?bref=Job.42.5">42:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). When we experience trials, we need a God who is near much more than a philosophical treatise on the problem of evil. Another emphasis is the role of suffering in producing true righteousness. While Job was depicted as a righteous man at the beginning of the book, his righteousness lacked what suffering could give it. At the end of the book, Job is a more humble man, one who sees his role in the universe and who has submitted to the wisdom of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The Prologue (<a href="?bref=Job.1.1-2.13">1:1–2:13</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">This section of the book describes the events that led to the suffering of Job. He is pictured at the outset as a man of wealth with a family for whom he cared deeply.</p>
<p>In a dramatic scene set in heaven, Satan appears and is asked by the Lord, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and will have nothing to do with evil” (<a href="?bref=Job.1.8">1:8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Satan’s reply is “But take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!” (v <a href="?bref=Job.1.11">11</a>). There follows the first of Job’s great calamities, the loss of his family and his possessions.</p>
<p>Another encounter between the Lord and Satan leads to the physical suffering of Job. It is this loathsome disease that provides the context for the dialogues that follow. In all of this the writer is careful to tell us that Job did not sin. He has resisted his wife’s plea to curse God. He has resisted the temptation to forsake God because of the loss of his children. But suddenly the placid picture ends with dialogues as we listen to Job’s complaints. We wonder, has Job given up his faith in God?</p>
<p>Three of Job’s friends have come to comfort him. They sit silent in his presence for seven days, reluctant to speak. After the period of silence they begin their dialogues with Job.</p>
<p class="h3">The Dialogues (<a href="?bref=Job.3.1-31.40">3:1–31:40</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">The First Cycle (<a href="?bref=Job.3.1-14.22">3:1–14:22</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Job’s complaint, recorded in chapter <a href="?bref=Job.3.1-26">3</a>, questions the wisdom of God in allowing him to be born. He wonders why life was given to one whose lot in life is to suffer.</p>
<p>Eliphaz is the first of Job’s friends to speak. A polite man on the surface, he is heartless underneath. His answer is that Job must have sinned—why else would he be suffering so (<a href="?bref=Job.4.7-11">4:7-11</a>)? Eliphaz clearly believes that Job’s questioning represents a negative attitude toward God. He appeals to Job to trust in the Lord (<a href="?bref=Job.4.8">4:8</a>) and give up his vexation toward God, since his anger will lead only to ruin (<a href="?bref=Job.5.2">5:2</a>). He sees a positive element in suffering, for he affirms that it is chastening from the Almighty (v <a href="?bref=Job.5.17">17</a>).</p>
<p>Job responds by pointing out that his vexation is warranted in view of the terrible suffering he is enduring (<a href="?bref=Job.6.1-7">6:1-7</a>). He also complains that Eliphaz is in the wrong in not showing him kindness, likening him to a wadi in the desert that offers no water in the hot, dry season (vv <a href="?bref=Job.6.14-23">14-23</a>).</p>
<p>The next comforter, Bildad, is even more heartless than Eliphaz. He, too, repeats the accusation that Job has sinned. His pitiless attitude is evident in his reference to Job’s children, blaming their deaths on probable sin in their lives (<a href="?bref=Job.8.4">8:4</a>).</p>
<p>Bildad, like Eliphaz, appeals to Job to turn to God (<a href="?bref=Job.8.5">8:5</a>), assuring him that God will surely respond (v <a href="?bref=Job.8.6">6</a>). He pictures Job’s misfortunes as the result of turning from God (vv <a href="?bref=Job.8.11-19">11-19</a>) but assures him that God will not reject a blameless man (v <a href="?bref=Job.8.20">20</a>).</p>
<p>Job’s response to Bildad begins with a poignant question: “How can a person be declared innocent in the eyes of God?” (<a href="?bref=Job.9.2">9:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This question is followed by an eloquent statement in which Job pictures the magnitude of God’s power as seen in the universe (vv <a href="?bref=Job.9.3-12">3-12</a>). Job stands before the mighty God completely helpless to withstand his power. He protests that he cannot contend with such a God, nor protest his innocence before him, for he is too powerful to oppose.</p>
<p>Job also complains that he cannot gain a fair hearing from God because God believes him guilty. The fact that God has punished him with his affliction proves that he does not regard him as innocent (<a href="?bref=Job.9.14-24">9:14-24</a>). Job continues his response and again questions God’s wisdom in bringing him into existence (<a href="?bref=Job.10.18-22">10:18-22</a>).</p>
<p>The next to speak is Zophar. He also accuses Job of sin (<a href="?bref=Job.11.4-6">11:4-6</a>). In an insulting statement he says that God “knows those who are false, and he takes note of all their sins. An empty-headed person won’t become wise any more than a wild donkey can bear human offspring” (vv <a href="?bref=Job.11.11-12">11-12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>Job’s anger is kindled by Zophar’s insulting accusations (<a href="?bref=Job.12.2-3">12:2-3</a>), and he calls on God to withdraw his hand from him and demands that God speak (<a href="?bref=Job.13.20-28">13:20-28</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Second Cycle (<a href="?bref=Job.15.1-21.34">15:1–21:34</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The second cycle of discourses continues in the same pattern as the first. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar continue their accusations, attributing Job’s misfortune to sin in his life. But as the narrative continues, the speakers begin to become more involved in their own assertions, and they no longer answer each other’s arguments as directly as they did in the first series of dialogues.</p>
<p class="h4">The Third Cycle (<a href="?bref=Job.22.1-31.40">22:1–31:40</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In the third series of dialogues only Eliphaz and Bildad speak. The accusations of sin in Job become even more pointed and cruel. Eliphaz says, “It [your suffering] is because of your wickedness! Your guilt has no limit!” (<a href="?bref=Job.22.5">22:5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This third dialogue is unusual in that Job speaks more than he does in the others. While Bildad’s argument extends for only six verses, Job’s reply goes on for six chapters (chs <a href="?bref=Job.26.1-31.40">26–31</a>).</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="?bref=Job.31.1-40">31</a> is an important one. In it Job protests his innocence. It is a chapter in which Job’s sincerity cannot be doubted. He affirms that he has been morally pure (vv <a href="?bref=Job.31.1-4">1-4</a>), he has not been deceitful (vv <a href="?bref=Job.31.5-8">5-8</a>), he has not been guilty of adultery (vv <a href="?bref=Job.31.9-12">9-12</a>), he has concern for others (vv <a href="?bref=Job.31.13-23">13-23</a>), he has not trusted in wealth (vv <a href="?bref=Job.31.24-28">24-28</a>). He concludes with a general affirmation of his innocence (vv <a href="?bref=Job.31.29-40">29-40</a>).</p>
<p>A pattern begins to develop. Job gradually moves away from his friends in the discussion. They become more insistent on sin as the cause of his misfortunes, and Job more firmly asserts his innocence. The writer of the book deftly weaves the account so that the reader can find little that is unorthodox in the statements of the friends. Yet while we may agree with their words, we cannot approve their attitudes. It is true that sin brings punishment, but the friends emphasize only that. The next friend, Elihu, will point out another function of suffering.</p>
<p>We hear the ring of truth in Job’s protestations of innocence. But if we believe Job and also believe the comforters, we have the same dilemma as Job. We do not know where the truth lies. We do not know why Job is suffering.</p>
<p class="h3">The Speech of Elihu (<a href="?bref=Job.32.1-37.24">32:1–37:24</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Elihu is a young man who listens to Job and to his fellow comforters with growing impatience (<a href="?bref=Job.32.3">32:3</a>). He is overly sensitive about his youth (vv <a href="?bref=Job.32.6-22">6-22</a>), but when he speaks, he reveals an understanding of suffering that is more mature than that of his companions.</p>
<p>Elihu emphasizes the fact that God speaks in many ways and that suffering is chastening (<a href="?bref=Job.33.19">33:19</a>), which reveals the goodness of God (vv <a href="?bref=Job.33.29-33">29-33</a>). While this thought was found in Eliphaz’s first speech (<a href="?bref=Job.5.17">5:17</a>), it is given greater prominence by Elihu, who emphasizes a dimension of suffering that reveals the love of God. But still one feels that the whole answer has not been given. Another dimension follows in the words of God.</p>
<p class="h3">The Voice from the Whirlwind and Job’s Response (<a href="?bref=Job.38.1-42.6">38:1–42:6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">God speaks in this section. He poses one question after another to Job, all having to do with some aspect of the Creation. God asks, “Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?” Then, in a note of sarcasm, he adds, “Tell me, if you know so much” (<a href="?bref=Job.38.4">38:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>God refers to the seas and asks Job who made the ocean basins (<a href="?bref=Job.38.8-11">38:8-11</a>). He pictures the rising dawn and asks Job, “Have you ever commanded the morning to appear and caused the dawn to rise in the east?” (v <a href="?bref=Job.38.12">12</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Further questions relate to light (vv <a href="?bref=Job.38.19-21">19-21</a>), snow (vv <a href="?bref=Job.38.22-24">22-24</a>), rain (vv <a href="?bref=Job.38.25-30">25-30</a>), the constellations (vv <a href="?bref=Job.38.31-33">31-33</a>), storms (vv <a href="?bref=Job.38.34-38">34-38</a>), and animals (<a href="?bref=Job.38.39-39.30">38:39–39:30</a>). Job is made to realize the vastness of God’s power as revealed in the Creation. Job must have felt rather small and insignificant as he contemplated God’s might.</p>
<p>But the questions are meant to accomplish more than to make Job feel small. They are meant to make him feel ashamed of his presumption as well. The sarcasm in this section is particularly biting, and one can imagine Job sinking deeper into the ash heap with each question. In the section dealing with light (<a href="?bref=Job.38.19-21">38:19-21</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>), the questions “Where does the light come from, and where does the darkness go? Can you take it to its home? Do you know how to get there?” are followed by “But of course you know all this! For you were born before it was all created, and you are so very experienced!” And in the section dealing with the constellations God asks Job, “Can you hold back the movements of the stars? Are you able to restrain the Pleiades or Orion?” (v <a href="?bref=Job.38.31">31</a>).</p>
<p>Job has been somewhat brash in his statements to God in the dialogues. He has demanded that God speak to him (<a href="?bref=Job.13.22">13:22</a>), and has accused God of injustice (<a href="?bref=Job.19.6-7">19:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.24.1">24:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Job.27.2">27:2</a>). Now, as he is reminded of the power of the Almighty, Job begins to recognize his proper place in the universe.</p>
<p>The crucial questions in this long series are those in <a href="?bref=Job.40.15-41.34">40:15–41:34</a>. Here, in an unusual sequence, God draws Job’s attention to behemoth (<a href="?bref=Job.40.15">40:15</a>) and leviathan (<a href="?bref=Job.41.1">41:1</a>). While some scholars see these as mythical figures, it is most probable that these, like the others cited throughout this section, are literary depictions of ordinary animals known for their great size and strength. It is suggested by many scholars that behemoth is the hippopotamus and leviathan the crocodile. The contexts in which these animals are described seem to support this. These references to two powerful animals end the section in which the voice of God speaks from the whirlwind. It is a section filled with suspense. At the end of it, the reader finds that Job has learned his lesson (<a href="?bref=Job.42.1-3">42:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>There is an important reason for these questions that came to Job with such insistent force. Job has been led to see that he does not control the universe—God does. Job is forced to face the power of God and learn that he is only part of this vast structure that reflects God’s almighty power. By demanding that God speak to him, Job was attempting to control God. By implying that God was unjust, he was making a judgment on God, thus making himself equal, if not superior, to God. God demands that Job face the power displayed in the universe and repeat his petulant words. Job wanted a God he could control; God demands submission. Job wanted a world run his way; God created a world to be run his way. Job had manufactured an illusory God, one who should obey his own whims. By recognizing God’s sovereign control in this world, he is led to see that suffering has a purpose. Job may not recognize that purpose, but it is part of the creation of the Almighty. It is no wonder that Job begins to enter into a settled peace and acknowledge God’s sovereignty (<a href="?bref=Job.42.5-6">42:5-6</a>).</p>
<p>This section of questions is followed by a poignant response from Job. He confesses God’s might (<a href="?bref=Job.42.2">42:2</a>). He admits that he did not fully understand things too wonderful for him (v <a href="?bref=Job.42.3">3</a>), and he repents in dust and ashes (v <a href="?bref=Job.42.6">6</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Epilogue (<a href="?bref=Job.42.7-17">42:7-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The final part of the book begins with a denunciation of Job’s comforters. They are condemned because they did not speak that which was right (<a href="?bref=Job.42.7">42:7</a>). This seemed most unusual, since their words have seemed quite orthodox. Yet, in the final analysis, they did not say what was right because their answer to the problem of suffering was only a partial answer, and because it was partial, it was dangerous. It caricatured God as an austere being who used suffering only to punish sin. It did not allow room for the loving hand of God in suffering, as did Elihu’s answer to the problem.</p>
<p>While Job said some things about God that were harsh, he was not berated. In fact, the text says that Job spoke of God that which was right (<a href="?bref=Job.42.8">42:8</a>). This evidently refers to Job’s concluding words in <a href="?bref=Job.42.1-6">42:1-6</a>, where, purified by suffering, he humbly yielded himself to God’s sovereign will.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">In the first verse the contents of the book of Joel are described as the “message” of the Lord that “came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.” We are told nothing more in Scripture about Joel or Pethuel. The name Joel was common; there are 13 different Joels in the OT. From what is said in the book, it would seem that Joel was not a priest but was closely associated with the priests of the temple, and in all probability a man of Jerusalem. More than that we cannot say.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Many different views of the date of Joel have been taken by those who have studied this book carefully; thus it is difficult to be dogmatic. The book may be dated to a time after the return to Jerusalem of the Jewish exiles who had been in Babylon—more precisely, to a time after Nehemiah’s work of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem (c. 400 <span class="era">BC</span>). Reasons given in support of this are as follows:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. <a href="?bref=Joel.3.2">Joel 3:2</a> says that the people of Judah and Jerusalem had been scattered among the nations and their land divided up, but they have been brought back, and their city once again has its walls (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.9">2:9</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. When a call is issued to prayer and fasting, the priests and elders are to take the lead (<a href="?bref=Joel.1.13">1:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.16-17">2:16-17</a>). There is no mention of a king at any point in the book. There were kings until the time of the exile, but not for 400 years after it.</p>
<p class="list">3. The preexilic prophets—Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, and Jeremiah—were often critical of the people for offering sacrifices while they departed from the ways of the Lord in their daily lives. Postexilic prophets like Haggai and Malachi offer encouragement and deep concern for the offering of sacrifices. In the preexilic prophets there was constant rebuke of the people for their worship of idols; this was not a problem with the people after the exile. In both these concerns Joel seems to fit better the postexilic than the preexilic scene.</p>
<p class="list">4. There is no reference to the northern kingdom of Israel in this book. Much is said of Judah and Jerusalem; when “Israel” is spoken of, the reference seems to be to the same people (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.27">2:27</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.16">3:16</a>). We would expect to find a different way of speaking before the fall of the northern kingdom to the Assyrians in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p class="list">5. The other kingdoms referred to are Edom, Tyre and Sidon, the Philistines, and the Greeks. There is no mention of Syria, Assyria, and Babylonia, the inveterate enemies from whom the people suffered so much in preexilic days. Those mentioned were certainly significant to the people in postexilic times, and only then are the Greeks of importance on the Palestinian scene.</p>
<p class="sp">Some scholars think there is no great strength in these arguments and that everything in the book can be made to fit a much earlier date. It has sometimes been argued that the book is deliberately placed in the Hebrew Scriptures alongside the two eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophets Hosea and Amos. But the order of the books in the prophetic canon does not determine their date. The postexilic Obadiah stands between the eighth-century <span class="era">BC</span> prophets Amos and Micah, and in fact in the Greek OT Joel was placed in a different position from its place in the Hebrew Bible. Most likely Joel and Amos stand together, as <a href="?bref=Amos.1.2">Amos 1:2</a> has the same words found at the close of the book of Joel (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.16">Jl 3:16</a>). Some of those who favor a preexilic date for the book place it in the ninth century, in the early period of the reign of Joash when the king was too young to actually function as ruler of the land. Others place it sometime shortly before the death of Josiah in 609 <span class="era">BC</span> because of the reference to the enemy coming from the north (as in Jeremiah) and because of the appeal to the people (like Jeremiah’s appeal) to return to the Lord with all their hearts (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.12">2:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.1.1-12">1:1-12</a></p>
<p class="fl">A plague of locusts more devastating than any that past generations had experienced had come on the land (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.1.2-4">2-4</a>). Drinkers were summoned to see the grapevines devastated and the fig trees stripped (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.1.5-7">5-7</a>). People were called to mourn at the sight of fields laid waste—especially the priests, as they would no longer be able to bring cereal and drink offerings to the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.1.8-10">8-10</a>). Farmers must grieve over the ruin of their harvest, in anguish at the loss of the fruits of the land (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.1.11-12">11-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.1.13-20">1:13-20</a></p>
<p class="fl">Because of what had happened, the people were called to prayer and fasting; the priests were to come before the Lord in sackcloth, grieving that no offerings could be brought (v <a href="?bref=Joel.1.13">13</a>). Elders and people alike must come to the temple to pray (v <a href="?bref=Joel.1.14">14</a>). Such a time of crisis, with the crops lost and the sheep and cattle having no pasture, was to be seen as foreshadowing the great coming Day of the Lord, for which everyone should be prepared (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.1.15-18">15-18</a>). The prophet himself could only cry out to God when he saw the devastation of the land (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.1.19-20">19-20</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="LocustPlagues"/>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.2.1-11">2:1-11</a></p>
<p class="fl">In this section the prophet speaks of a time when God’s judgment threatens the whole land. It is a time for the alarm to be sounded, when a great and powerful “people” come up on the land, a more threatening foe than any known before. Further, it is a warning of the coming “Day of the Lord,” “a day of darkness and gloom” (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.1-2">1-2</a>). The land is devastated as by fire; what was like the Garden of Eden becomes a wilderness (v <a href="?bref=Joel.2.3">3</a>). This invasion is like that of cavalry and the sound of the insurgents like “the rumbling of chariots.” Everyone is in anguish at their advance. They march like warriors, burst through the weapons, scale the walls of the city, and come into the houses like thieves (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.4-9">4-9</a>).</p>
<p>Some have taken this description to be a picture of armies of nations who are the foes of Israel, used by the Lord in judgment on his own people. But in that they are described as horses in battle, their noise like “the rumbling of chariots,” their advance “like a mighty army moving into battle,” it seems that the locust plague is still in mind. Yet the dark cloud of the locusts in the sky and their terrible effect on the land foreshadows the great day when the Lord will speak and act in judgment on all peoples. Then heaven and earth will tremble; sun, moon, and stars will be darkened (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.10-11">10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.2.12-17">2:12-17</a></p>
<p class="fl">The prophet repeatedly calls the people to the Lord in humility and penitence so that his mercy and grace may be found. Then it will be possible “to offer grain and wine to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> your God as before” (v <a href="?bref=Joel.2.14">14</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). A fast is to be appointed, a solemn assembly of young and old called. Even the newlyweds are to come. The priests must lead the people in prayer to God to spare his people (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.14-17">14-17</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.2.18-27">2:18-27</a></p>
<p class="fl">According to this passage, it seems that the people did turn to God as the prophet required; in response, the Lord had compassion on them and assured them of renewing their grain, wine, and oil, and removing their reproach (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.18-19">18-19</a>). The “armies from the north” would retreat, and God would restore the pastures of the land, its fruit trees, and its vines (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.20-22">20-22</a>). The people would rejoice, and with the blessing of the early and late rains the land would again be abundantly productive. The losses from the locust plague would be made good (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.23-25">23-25</a>). People would eat food in plenty and praise God. They would know that the one great living God was among them, and they would not be put to shame anymore (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.26-27">26-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-32">2:28-32</a></p>
<p class="fl">The prophet also saw that the blessing experienced in this renewal after the plague of locusts foreshadowed greater blessings to come, just as the judgment experienced brought the warning of the great and terrible Day of the Lord to come. God would do greater things for his people in the future; in particular, he would pour out his Spirit on men and women, young and old, slave and free (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">28-29</a>). There would be awe-inspiring signs in heaven and on earth (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.2.30-31">30-31</a>). All who called on the name of the Lord would know his salvation (v <a href="?bref=Joel.2.32">32</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.3.1-15">3:1-15</a></p>
<p class="fl">The meaning of the Day of the Lord for Israel as a nation and its significance for all nations must be realized. God’s people would find restoration by turning to him; those who had scattered them, taken their land, and sold them as slaves would come under his judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.3.1-3">1-3</a>). Tyre and Sidon and the Philistines especially would have to give account for what they had done, taking the Lord’s silver and gold, removing his people from their land, and selling them as slaves to the Greeks. The sons and daughters of these slave traders would in turn be sold as slaves (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.3.4-8">4-8</a>). So the nations must be prepared for war—to melt their plowshares into swords and to beat pruning hooks into spears—but not for a battle between human armies. Those who have fought against the living God must reckon with him as a mighty warrior (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.3.9-11">9-11</a>). This mighty warrior is coming to execute judgment. The scene changes from a battleground to a court of justice; great crowds will stand before the Lord “in the valley of decision” on the Day of the Lord, which is a day of dread darkness for those who have made themselves enemies of the Almighty (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.3.12-15">12-15</a>).</p>
<p class="h3"><a href="?bref=Joel.3.16-21">3:16-21</a></p>
<p class="fl">After men have spoken and done their worst, God will speak and act. He will show himself to be his people’s “refuge and strength” (v <a href="?bref=Joel.3.16">16</a>). Their city will then be kept from invasion by strangers (v <a href="?bref=Joel.3.17">17</a>). Their land will be wonderfully productive (v <a href="?bref=Joel.3.18">18</a>). Because of what Egypt and Edom have done in violence to Judah, they will be desolate (v <a href="?bref=Joel.3.19">19</a>). Israel will be avenged and restored, and to all it will be clear that the Lord’s home is in Jerusalem with his people (vv <a href="?bref=Joel.3.20-21">20-21</a>).</p>
<p>This account of the contents of the book is based on the view that Joel experienced a plague of locusts in his day and that he saw this as a warning of a greater judgment of God to come. At the same time, he also spoke of a greater restoration and blessing when the people turned back to God with prayer and fasting. Others see the enemies throughout the book as human foes, at least in chapter <a href="?bref=Joel.2.1-32">2</a>. Some think of the whole book as prophetic of battles to come, and in particular of a final battle of the Lord against those who have made themselves his enemies. Some think of two prophets, or two parts of the book written at different times. But the view of the book taken above seems exposed to the fewest difficulties and makes good sense and meaning of the whole.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Message">Message</p>
<p class="fl">What can be said finally of the abiding significance of the message of Joel? His, like that of most of the OT prophets, was a message of mercy and judgment. Such a catastrophe as a plague of locusts was a warning of God’s judgment of all men and nations, within history and ultimately at the great Day of the Lord at the consummation of history, when all will be gathered before him. The message of Joel, with its challenge to repentance arising from the events of his time, can be set alongside the words of Jesus himself when he was asked about those who had suffered in the catastrophic events of his time. When asked whether they were worse sinners than others, he answered in the negative, but with the warning, “Unless you repent, you will all of you come to the same end” (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.5">Lk 13:5</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>). The word of God through Joel called people to turn back to him to find his mercy; then to the assurance of mercy was added the hope of the greater things that God in his goodness would do. He would pour out his Spirit freely on all. These words of promise (<a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>) were made more significant than any others in the book of Joel by their quotation in the NT in Peter’s sermon on the day of Pentecost (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.16-21">Acts 2:16-21</a>). They stand true for the Christian church ever since that beginning of their fulfilment, and with them stands Joel’s great assurance that God makes his home in the midst of his people and that those who turn to him will never be ashamed.</p>

<p class="fl">Name meaning “Yahweh has been gracious.” It occurs also in the alternate form of Jehohanan. The name John is derived from these names. Several men of this name appear in the OT.</p>
<p class="list-space"> 1. Son of Kareah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.25.23">2 Kgs 25:23</a>). Johanan was a Jewish leader, a contemporary of Jeremiah, and supportive of Gedaliah, the governor of Judah after the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Jer.40.8,13">Jer 40:8, 13</a>). He forewarned Gedaliah of Ishmael’s plan to assassinate him (vv <a href="?bref=Jer.40.13-16">13-16</a>). When the warning was ignored and Johanan was refused permission to execute the would-be assassin, Gedaliah was murdered. Johanan took vengeance against Ishmael and rescued those who had been captured (<a href="?bref=Jer.41.14-18">41:14-18</a>), but he was unable to pursue Ishmael. In fear of a Babylonian reprisal, he made plans to seek asylum in Egypt. Jeremiah, whom he consulted, gave God’s word against this move (<a href="?bref=Jer.42.1-22">42:1-22</a>), but Johanan was unwilling to take counsel (<a href="?bref=Jer.43.2-3">43:2-3</a>).

<p class="list"> 2. Eldest son of Josiah, king of Judah (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.15">1 Chr 3:15</a>). Possibly he died young, for he did not succeed his father on the throne, even though he was the firstborn.</p>
<p class="list"> 3. Son of Elioenai (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.24">1 Chr 3:24</a>), a descendant of Jehoiachin, one of the last kings of Judah.</p>

<p class="list"> 6. Gadite who joined David in the wilderness (<a href="?bref=1Chr.12.8-12">1 Chr 12:8-12</a>). He was also specially trained for war, in that he could handle both shield and spear, could endure hardship, and was quick on his feet.</p>

<p class="h1">JOHN, The Apostle</p>
<p class="fl">The apostle known as “the disciple whom Jesus loved”; author of the fourth Gospel, three epistles, and probably Revelation.</p>
<p>The apostle John has a high reputation among Christian people, and his influence has been felt throughout the centuries. Despite this, he is a surprisingly shadowy figure. When he appears in the pages of the NT, it is almost always in company with Peter or James, and if there is speaking to be done, it is usually his companion Peter who does it; thus, there is not a great deal on which to base a biography.</p>
<p>John’s father’s name was Zebedee, and John had a brother called James (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.21">Mt 4:21</a>). Among the women at the cross, Matthew names Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and “the mother of Zebedee’s children” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.56">27:56</a>). Mark names the two Marys and adds Salome (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.40">Mk 15:40</a>). This indicates that Salome may be the name of John’s mother. If Matthew and Mark are naming the same women as does John, then Salome was Jesus’ “mother’s sister” (<a href="?bref=John.19.25">Jn 19:25</a>). This would make John a cousin of Jesus. We cannot be certain of this, for there were many women there (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.55">Mt 27:55</a>) and there is no way of being sure that Matthew, Mark, and John all name the same three. Many accept the identification, but we can scarcely say more.</p>
<p>John was among those whom Jesus called by the Sea of Galilee (<a href="?bref=Matt.4.21-22">Mt 4:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.1.19-20">Mk 1:19-20</a>). This makes him one of the first disciples. It is also possible that he was the unnamed companion of Andrew when that apostle first followed Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.1.35-37">Jn 1:35-37</a>). John was important in the little group around Jesus since he was one of three who were especially close to the Master. These disciples were selected to be with Jesus on many great occasions. John, along with his brother James and Peter, was present at the Transfiguration (<a href="?bref=Matt.17.1-2">Mt 17:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.9.2">Mk 9:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.28-29">Lk 9:28-29</a>). Jesus also took just these three into the house of Jairus when he brought that man’s daughter back to life (<a href="?bref=Mark.5.37">Mk 5:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.8.51">Lk 8:51</a>). Before Jesus’ arrest, it was this trio that he took to pray with him in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.37">Mt 26:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.33">Mk 14:33</a>). Though the three were admonished for sleeping instead of watching in prayer, we must not overlook the fact that in that time of great difficulty, when Jesus faced the prospect of death on a cross, it was to these three that he looked for support.</p>
<p>There are other occasions when John is mentioned in the Gospels. Luke tells us of John’s surprise when the miraculous catch of fish took place (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.9-10">Lk 5:9-10</a>). This is especially noteworthy since John was a fisherman. Toward the close of Jesus’ ministry, we find John coming to Jesus with Peter, James, and Andrew to ask when the end would come and what would be the sign when all things come to their climax (<a href="?bref=Mark.13.3-4">Mk 13:3-4</a>). And on the last evening, Jesus sent Peter and John to prepare the Passover meal (<a href="?bref=Luke.22.8">Lk 22:8</a>).</p>
<p>Passages like these show that John was highly esteemed among the apostles and that he stood especially close to Jesus. But there are indications that at first John was far from appreciating what Jesus stood for. When Mark gives his list of the Twelve, he tells us that Jesus gave to James and John the name “Boanerges,” which means “sons of thunder” (<a href="?bref=Mark.3.17">Mk 3:17</a>). Some in the early church understood this name as a compliment, thinking it meant that James’s and John’s witness to Jesus would be as strong as thunder. But most see it as pointing to their tempestuousness of character. We see this, for example, when John encounters a man who was casting out demons in Jesus’ name. John instructs him not to, “for he isn’t one of our group” (<a href="?bref=Mark.9.38">Mk 9:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.9.49">Lk 9:49</a>).</p>
<p>Mark also tells us of an occasion when the sons of Zebedee asked Jesus for the two chief places in his kingdom, one to be on his right and the other on his left (<a href="?bref=Mark.10.35-40">Mk 10:35-40</a>). Matthew adds the point that the words were spoken by the men’s mother, but he leaves us no doubt that James and John were in on it (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.20-22">Mt 20:20-22</a>). Jesus proceeded to ask them whether they could drink the cup he would drink and be baptized with the baptism he would receive. (Clearly, these are metaphors for the suffering Jesus would in due course undergo.) James and John affirmed that they could, and Jesus assured them that they would indeed do this. However, he gave them no assurance about their places in the Father’s kingdom. (But it is plain that James and John would suffer for Christ.) At that time they also failed to understand the loving spirit that moved their Master and was required of them as well.</p>
<p>Another incident that shows the same tempestuous spirit is one involving Samaritan villagers who refused to receive the little band as they traveled. When James and John heard of it, they asked Jesus whether he wanted them to call down fire from heaven to consume the villagers (<a href="?bref=Luke.9.54">Lk 9:54</a>). They were clearly at variance with Jesus, and indeed he rebuked them. But we should not miss the zeal they displayed for their Lord, nor their conviction that if they did call down fire it would come. They were sure that God would not fail to answer the prayer of those who asked for vengeance on the opponents of Jesus. There is zeal here and faith, though also a spirit of lovelessness.</p>
<p>The synoptic Gospels thus show us John as a zealous and loyal follower of Jesus. He is not depicted as gentle and considerate. At this time, he knew little of the love that should characterize a follower of Jesus, but he did have faith and a passionate conviction that God would prosper Jesus and those who served him.</p>
<p>John is not mentioned by name in the fourth Gospel, but there are passages that speak about “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (<a href="?bref=John.13.23">Jn 13:23</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.26">19:26</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.2">20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.7,20">21:7, 20</a>). We are not told who this was, but the evidence seems to indicate that it was the apostle John. For example, there is an account of a fishing trip in chapter <a href="?bref=John.21.1-25">21</a>, with a listing of those who went fishing. It includes Peter, who must be ruled out as “the disciple whom Jesus loved” because he is often mentioned along with the beloved disciple. Thomas and Nathanael were there, but there seems to be no reason for seeing either as a likely candidate. Two unnamed men and the sons of Zebedee make up the remainder of the party. James is excluded as being the author because of his early death—around <span class="era">AD</span> 44 (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.2">Acts 12:2</a>). This leaves us with John or one of the unnamed men. John is favored by the fact that the beloved disciple is linked with Peter on a number of occasions (<a href="?bref=John.13.23-24">Jn 13:23-24</a>; <a href="?bref=John.20.2">20:2</a>; <a href="?bref=John.21.7">21:7</a>). We know from the other Gospels that Peter and John (together with James) were especially close (see also <a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-26">Acts 3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.8.14">8:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Gal 2:9</a>). Of course, one of the unnamed disciples may have been the beloved disciple, but we have no reason to assume this. Further, such a supposition faces the problem of the omission of the name of John the apostle throughout the entire fourth Gospel. If John wrote this book, we can understand his not mentioning himself. But if it was written by someone else, why would that person omit all mention of a man as prominent in the apostolic band as the other Gospels show John to have been? In addition, if John is the author, it would explain why John the Baptist is called simply “John.”</p>
<p>It is argued that “the disciple whom Jesus loved” is not the kind of title a man would naturally use of himself, but it must be said also that it is not the kind of title a man would naturally use of someone else, either. And it may be that John uses it in a modest fashion—partly because he did not want to draw attention to himself by using his name, and partly because he wanted to emphasize the truth that it was the fact that Jesus loved him that made him what he was.</p>
<p>If this identification may be accepted, we learn more about the apostle. We should not, of course, read the words “the disciple whom Jesus loved” as though they meant that Jesus did not love the other disciples. He loved them all. But as applied to John, they mean that he was indeed beloved, probably also that he recognized that he owed all he had and all he was to that love. That he was specially close to Jesus is indicated by the fact that he leaned on Jesus’ breast at the Last Supper (<a href="?bref=John.13.23">Jn 13:23</a>). It also tells us something of his relationship to the Master that he was at the cross when Christ was crucified and that it was to him that Jesus gave the charge to look after his mother (<a href="?bref=John.19.26-27">19:26-27</a>). One would have expected that Jesus would have selected one of his family for this responsibility. But his brothers did not believe in him, whereas both John and Mary did. This event certainly shows that a close relationship existed between Jesus and the disciple he loved.</p>
<p>On the first Easter morning, John raced with Peter to the tomb when Mary Magdalene told them it was empty. He won the race but stood outside the tomb until Peter came. Peter, the leader of men, went right in, and John followed. We read that he “saw and believed” (<a href="?bref=John.20.8">Jn 20:8</a>). Then in chapter <a href="?bref=John.21.1-25">21</a> we read of the beloved disciple fishing with the others. Significantly, it was he who recognized that it was Jesus who stood on the shore and told them where to cast the net (<a href="?bref=John.21.7">21:7</a>).</p>
<p>There is not much to add to this picture when we turn to Acts. At the beginning, John’s name occurs in a list of the Twelve (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>); and later, when we are told of James’s death, it is noted that he was John’s brother (<a href="?bref=Acts.12.2">12:2</a>). In every other reference to John, he is in the company of Peter. These two were the instruments God used in bringing healing to a lame man (ch <a href="?bref=Acts.3.1-26">3</a>). At that time, they were going to the temple at the hour of prayer. This says something about their habits of devotion. Prayer at the ninth hour apparently refers to the Jewish service of prayer that was held at the same time as the evening offering (i.e., at about three o’clock in the afternoon). Evidently, Peter and John were continuing the devotional habits of pious Jews with an interest in the temple and all its doings. On another occasion, these two were arrested and jailed on account of their preaching about Jesus’ resurrection (<a href="?bref=Acts.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>). They were brought before the council, where Peter spoke for them. The council saw that these two men were “uneducated, common men” (v <a href="?bref=Acts.4.13">13</a>). This means that they had never had the normal rabbinic education. By the standards of the council, they were uneducated. The council forbade them to speak about Jesus, but the apostles’ reply displays John’s typical boldness: “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard” (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.4.19-20">19-20</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>John was associated with Peter again when the gospel was first preached in Samaria. Philip was the evangelist to the Samaritans, but the apostles in Jerusalem decided to send Peter and John to Samaria when they heard how the people had accepted the gospel message. “As soon as they arrived, they began praying for these new Christians to receive the Holy Spirit” (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.15">Acts 8:15</a>, <span class="sc">tlb</span>), a revealing illustration of apostolic priorities. In due course, they laid their hands on the new believers and they received the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.17">8:17</a>). John is not specifically mentioned, but he no doubt was included in “the apostles” who were arrested and jailed because of the jealousy of prominent Jews (<a href="?bref=Acts.5.17-18">5:17-18</a>). But that imprisonment did not last long, for an angel released them at night, so that they resumed their preaching in the early morning (v <a href="?bref=Acts.5.21">21</a>). John is mentioned by name in <a href="?bref=Gal.2.9">Galatians 2:9</a>, where he is joined with Peter and James and the three are called “the pillars of the church.”</p>
<p>This appears to be the extent of the NT’s record of the apostle John. Clearly he was an important figure in the little band of early Christians. On almost every occasion when he comes before us in the record, he is in the company of someone else and normally the speaking is done by his companion, not by John. But we may justly conclude that he stood very close to Jesus. Perhaps he had entered into the mind of Jesus more than any of the others. The best evidence of this is the Gospel of John. Clearly the man who wrote this had great spiritual insight. John may have been more the thinker than a man of action and leader of men.</p>
<p>We have seen that there is good reason to think that the fourth Gospel was written by the apostle John. The epistles of John probably came from him also (though, as they stand, they are anonymous). All the Johannine writings probably emanated from the province of Asia. The heretics alluded to in 1 John resemble the Cerinthians (followers of the heretic Cerinthus), who were in Asia Minor at the end of the first century, and tradition connects the author of 1 John with Ephesus. It is certain that the same person wrote all three letters, and reasonably certain that this author also wrote the Gospel of John; the Gospel and the letters certainly represent the same mind at work in different situations.</p>
<p>An author named John wrote the book of Revelation (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.1">Rv 1:1</a>), though it is not clear whether this is the apostle or another John. Tradition has identified the John of Revelation (see <a href="?bref=Rev.1.1,9">Rv 1:1, 9</a>; <a href="?bref=Rev.22.8">22:8</a>) with John the apostle, the author of the Gospel of John and the three letters of John. This view was held by Justin Martyr as early as 140. The main objection to this view is that the original Greek is unlike that of the other Johannine writings, showing scant respect for the rules of the language. Some have suggested that a different John wrote Revelation, others that John’s disciples wrote the Gospel and letters and that John himself wrote Revelation. But it is still plausible that the apostle John (or one of his close disciples) wrote the Gospel and the letters.</p>
<p>Assuming John the apostle wrote Revelation, he was exiled to Patmos (<a href="?bref=Rev.1.9">Rv 1:9</a>). But the date of this is uncertain. Some probably unreliable evidence from the late fifth century suggests that John was martyred at about the same time as his brother James (c. 44; see also <a href="?bref=Acts.12.2">Acts 12:2</a>). Jesus’ prophecy in <a href="?bref=Mark.10.39">Mk 10:39</a> need not imply that both met with a simultaneous and violent end. Much stronger is the tradition reflected by Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus (c. 190), that John died a natural death in Ephesus, and by Irenaeus (c. 175–195) that John lingered on in Ephesus until the time of the emperor Trajan (ruled c. 97–117).</p>

<p class="fl">At the end of this Gospel we are told that it was written by “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (<a href="?bref=John.21.20,24">Jn 21:20, 24</a>), but unfortunately the book nowhere tells us who this disciple was. Evidence shows that the most probable identification is with the apostle John. He fills the place we would have expected John to fill from what we know from the other Gospels. (See discussion above on <a href="?item=JohntheApostle_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">John, the Apostle</a>.)</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientGreekManuscriptOfJohn"/>
<p>The Gospel appears to have been written by one who knew the Jews and the Palestine of Jesus’ day well. He was familiar with Jewish messianic expectations (e.g., <a href="?bref=John.1.20-21">Jn 1:20-21</a>; <a href="?bref=John.4.25">4:25</a>; <a href="?bref=John.7.40-42">7:40-42</a>; <a href="?bref=John.12.34">12:34</a>). He knew of the hostility between Jews and Samaritans (<a href="?bref=John.4.9">4:9</a>) and the contempt the Pharisees had for “the people of the land” (<a href="?bref=John.7.49">7:49</a>). He knew of the importance attached to the religious schools (v <a href="?bref=John.7.15">15</a>). He knew the way the Sabbath was observed and was aware of the provision that the obligation to circumcise on the eighth day overrides the Sabbath regulations (vv <a href="?bref=John.7.22-23">22-23</a>). Throughout the Gospel he moved with certainty in the vast range of Jewish ideas and customs.</p>
<p>It is the same with topography. The writer mentioned many places, and his place-names all seem to be used correctly. He referred to Cana, a village not mentioned in any earlier literature known to us, which means that the reference almost certainly came from someone who actually knew the place. He located Bethany with some precision as about 15 stadia from Jerusalem (about 2 miles, or 3.2 kilometers, <a href="?bref=John.11.18">11:18</a>). He had several references to places in or near Jerusalem, such as Bethesda (<a href="?bref=John.5.2">5:2</a>), Siloam (<a href="?bref=John.9.7">9:7</a>), and the Kidron Valley (<a href="?bref=John.18.1">18:1</a>). Of course, this does not rule out some contemporary of John’s, but it makes it difficult to think of the author as a much later individual writing at a distance from Palestine. The evidence as we have it indicates that the writer was a Jew in the Palestine of Jesus’ day.</p>
<p>To many careful readers, it seems that the Gospel bears the stamp of an eyewitness. For example, Jesus was teaching “in the treasury” (<a href="?bref=John.8.20">8:20</a>). Nothing is made of the point; the incident could easily have been told without it. It looks like a reminiscence of someone who sees the scene in his mind’s eye as he writes. The fact that the house was filled with fragrance when the woman broke the perfume jar (<a href="?bref=John.12.3">12:3</a>) does not materially affect the account but is the kind of detail that one who was there would remember. The author noted that the loaves used in the feeding of the multitude were barley loaves (<a href="?bref=John.6.9">6:9</a>) and that Jesus’ tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top to bottom (<a href="?bref=John.19.23">19:23</a>). He told us that the branches with which Jesus was greeted were palm branches (<a href="?bref=John.12.13">12:13</a>), and that it was night when Judas went out (<a href="?bref=John.13.30">13:30</a>). Such touches are found throughout the Gospel, and it seems unjustified to treat them as no more than an attempt to create verisimilitude. They seem much more like indications that the author was writing about events in which he had himself taken part.</p>
<p>The early church accepted Johannine authorship without question. Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian all see the apostle as the author. The first to quote this Gospel by name was Theophilus of Antioch, about <span class="era">AD</span> 180.</p>
<p>Those who object to Johannine authorship emphasize the differences between this Gospel and the Synoptics. The argument is that if Jesus was anything like the Christ portrayed by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he could not be like the Christ of the fourth Gospel. This is a completely subjective argument, ignoring the fact that any great man will appear differently to different people. The judgment of the church throughout the centuries has been that Jesus was large enough to inspire both portraits. To put the same point another way, we have no reason for holding that the first three Evangelists tell us all there is to know about Jesus. There is no contradiction. John simply brings out other aspects of Jesus’ life and teachings.</p>
<p>While we cannot prove beyond all doubt that John the apostle was the author, we can say that there is more reason for holding to this view than to any other.</p>

<p class="fl">It has been usual for conservatives and liberals alike to date this writing in the last decade of the first century or early in the second. Some liberal scholars have put it well into the second century, but this is not common, and it is remarkable that there has been such a considerable measure of agreement.</p>
<p>It is said that this Gospel is dependent on the Synoptics, which means that it must be dated sometime after them. But this argument has been widely abandoned in recent times. There is so much in John that is without parallel in the other three Gospels, and conversely so much in the other three that John might have used had he known it, that it is very difficult indeed to hold that this writer had any of the other Gospels before him when he wrote, or even that he had read them. Such resemblances as there are seem better explained by common use of oral tradition.</p>
<p>It is also argued that there is a very developed theology in John and that we must allow time for its development. Granted, the theology of this Gospel is profound, but this does not require that we must wait for it until the end of the first century. The theology of the Letter to the Romans is also profound, and there is no reason for dating that writing later than the 50s. On the ground of development, then, there is no reason for putting John later than Romans. Development is a slippery argument at best, for it usually takes place at uneven rates, and we have no means of knowing how fast it took place in the area where the author lived.</p>
<p>Other arguments for a late date are no more conclusive. For example, it is urged that the ecclesiastical system presupposed by the Gospel is too late for the time of the apostle John, and that the sacramental system of chapters <a href="?bref=John.3.1-36">3</a> and <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">6</a> must have taken time to develop. But John does not mention any sacrament. It is true that many scholars think these chapters refer to baptism and the Lord’s Supper, but the fact is that John mentions neither.</p>
<p>It is not surprising in view of the way the traditional arguments have crumbled away that many in recent times are arguing that John must have been written before the fall of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. If it were later, why does not John have some reference to it? Some of his language appears to be earlier. In <a href="?bref=John.5.2">5:2</a> he says there “is” (not “was”) a pool called Bethesda. And he often refers to the Twelve as Jesus’ disciples, or “his” disciples, or the like. In later times Christians usually said “the” disciples, for they saw no need to say whose the disciples were. But in the early days, when Christians were in contact with rabbis (each of whom had his disciples), it was important to show that Jesus’ disciples were in mind. It is important also that John makes no reference to any of the synoptic Gospels. The simplest explanation is that he had not seen them. They were not yet widely circulated.</p>
<p>None of this enables us to date this Gospel with precision. But the weight of evidence points to an early date (before <span class="era">AD</span> 70).</p>
<p>The author was John the apostle, a Jew. However, the writing gives evidence of contact with Greek thought, for example, in the reference to Christ as “the Word” in chapter <a href="?bref=John.1.1-51">1</a> and the translation of words like “rabbi” (<a href="?bref=John.1.38">1:38</a>). It is almost universally held that such considerations compel us to see the work as originating in a center of Greek culture, and Ephesus has traditionally been favored. Before the end of the second century we have Irenaeus writing that John published the Gospel during his residence at Ephesus.</p>
<p>Some scholars point to similarities between John and the Odes of Solomon, which they think came from Syria. As there are also some resemblances in the language of Ignatius, bishop of Antioch in the early second century, this is held to show that John was written in Syria, probably at Antioch. Others again think that Egypt was the place, and they support this by pointing out that the oldest fragment of a manuscript of this Gospel was found there. There is no real evidence, and we are left with probabilities. There is much to be said for accepting the evidence of Irenaeus and seeing Ephesus as the place of origin, but we can scarcely say more.</p>
<p>There is no real indication of the intended destination. From <a href="?bref=John.20.31">20:31</a> we learn that the book was written that the readers might believe that Jesus is the Messiah, God’s Son, and that by believing they might have life. The Gospel, then, has an evangelistic aim. But it is also possible that “believe” means “keep on believing”—“go on in faith,” rather than “begin to believe.” That is to say, the book may have been meant from the beginning to build people up in the faith. Probably we should not distinguish between these aims too sharply. Both may well be in mind.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Several possible backgrounds to the Gospel have been suggested. The Greek interest is obvious, and this writing has sometimes been called the Gospel of the Hellenists. The suggestion is that we should look to Greek writings, perhaps the works of the philosophers or Philo of Alexandria, to find the right background against which to understand what John has written. This approach may be seen in the work of Rudolf Bultmann, who thought specifically of Gnosticism. Indeed, for Bultmann one of the sources of this Gospel was a discourse source that he thought was taken from non-Christian Gnosticism. Not many have been prepared to follow Bultmann, but a number of recent commentators have discerned some form of Gnosticism as the backdrop to John.</p>
<p>While such views are put forward seriously, there are some substantial objections. One is that, despite the confident assertions of some scholars, Gnosticism has never been shown to be earlier than Christianity. In the form in which it comes before us in history, it is a Christian heresy, and of course, the Christian faith must appear before a Christian heresy is possible. Another objection is that there is a basic difference between the two systems. Gnosticism is concerned with knowledge (the very word is derived from the Greek word <span class="greek">gnosis</span><span class="ital">,</span> “knowledge”). Its “redeemer” is one who comes from heaven with knowledge. But John does not subscribe to the view that man is saved by knowledge. The Redeemer comes to take away the sin of the world (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">1:29</a>). Gnosticism tells people that life is an upward struggle; Christianity tells of a Savior who came down to raise them up. It is not easy to see any form of Gnosticism as the essential background to Christianity.</p>
<p>Much more significant is John’s Semitic background. Especially important here is the OT, accepted as sacred Scripture by Jew and Christian alike. It lies constantly behind John’s statements, and it must be studied carefully if John is to be understood. It is plain that John knew and loved the Septuagint, the translation into Greek of the Hebrew OT. Again and again, the Septuagint can be shown to lie behind what John says.</p>
<p>In modern times important discoveries have been made at Qumran, in the vicinity of the Dead Sea. Among the scrolls unearthed in the caves of this area are several that have affinities with John. Indeed, one of the interesting facts about the scrolls is that they have more parallels with John than with any other part of the NT, a fact difficult to explain if John was written late and at a distance from Palestine. The resemblances to the Qumran writings must be viewed with care, for there is often a linguistic resemblance where the thinking is quite different. For example, both use the unusual expression “the Spirit of truth.” But where John means one of the persons of the Trinity, the scrolls speak of “a spirit of truth” and “a spirit of error” striving in the souls of people. The connection is real, but John is clearly not dependent on the scrolls for his thinking. The contribution of the Dead Sea Scrolls is that they afford additional evidence that this Gospel is basically Palestinian and must be understood against a background of first-century Palestine.</p>
<p>Other backgrounds have been suggested, such as the Hermetic literature. This is a group of writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus (“Hermes Thrice-greatest”), a designation of the Egyptian god Thoth. There are indeed some points of contact with John, but they are few in comparison with those of writings rooted in Palestine. It is difficult to take such suggestions seriously. John is essentially Palestinian.</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The writer told us that Jesus did many “signs” (or miracles) that he had not recorded, but “these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life” (<a href="?bref=John.20.31">Jn 20:31</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). John wrote to show that Jesus is the Messiah. But he did not do this simply with a view to conveying interesting information. He wanted his readers to see this knowledge as a challenge to faith; when they believe, they will have life. John sought to bring men and women to Christ; he had an evangelistic aim. That does not exhaust what he was trying to do, for his words have meaning for believers. It is important that believers have a right knowledge of Jesus and that they continue to believe.</p>
<p>The main theological teaching of this Gospel, then, is that God has sent his Messiah, Jesus. He is the very Son of God, and he comes to bring life (<a href="?bref=John.3.16">3:16</a>). Though Jesus told the woman at the well that he was the Messiah, this is not often said so specifically. The avoidance of the term might well be because of the political overtones it had acquired among the Jews at large. They looked for a Messiah who would fight the Romans. He would defeat them and set up a mighty world empire with its capital in Jerusalem. Jesus was not aiming at anything like that, and it was important that he avoid the kind of language that would give that impression. But though the conventional messianic terminology is avoided, John left no doubt that Jesus was God’s chosen one. Again and again he depicted Jesus as fulfilling messianic functions. For example, in the long discourse in chapter <a href="?bref=John.6.1-71">6</a> we see Jesus as the bread from heaven, fulfilling the expectation that when Messiah came, he would renew the manna; and in the giving of sight to the blind man (ch <a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">9</a>) we have another messianic function (cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.35.5">Is 35:5</a>).</p>
<p>With this greatness of Jesus, John also combined teaching about his lowliness. A continuing, though unobtrusive, strand of Johannine teaching is that Jesus depends on the Father for everything. Apart from the Father, Jesus said, he could do nothing (<a href="?bref=John.5.30">Jn 5:30</a>). His very food is to do the Father’s will (<a href="?bref=John.4.34">4:34</a>). He lives through the Father (<a href="?bref=John.6.57">6:57</a>). It is the Father who gives him his disciples (<a href="?bref=John.6.37,44">6:37, 44</a>; <a href="?bref=John.17.6">17:6</a>). It is the Father who bears witness to him (<a href="?bref=John.5.32,37">5:32, 37</a>). John insists that Jesus is in no sense independent of the Father. In the mission of Jesus, John sees the working out of the purpose of the Father.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Prologue and Chapter <a href="?bref=John.1.1-51">1</a></p>
<p class="fl">John begins with a prologue (<a href="?bref=John.1.1-18">1:1-18</a>) that is unlike anything in any of the other Gospels. In it he refers to Jesus as “the Word,” a term that has points of contact with both Greek and Hebrew thinking. As John uses it, it conveys the thought that Jesus is the expression of the mind of the Father. John speaks of the Word as God (<a href="?bref=John.1.1">1:1</a>), sees him as active in creation (<a href="?bref=John.1.3-5">1:3-5</a>), goes on to the witness borne to him by John the Baptist (<a href="?bref=John.1.6-8">1:6-8</a>), speaks of the coming of the Word into the world (<a href="?bref=John.1.9-14">1:9-14</a>), and finishes with a section on the greatness of the Word (<a href="?bref=John.1.15-18">1:15-18</a>). In this prologue he briefly introduces some of the great themes that will be developed throughout the Gospel. It is a majestic introduction to the whole.</p>
<p>Next we have the beginnings of Jesus’ public ministry (<a href="?bref=John.1.19-51">1:19-51</a>). Jesus’ work was preceded by that of John the Baptist, and the Evangelist tells us first about the kind of witness that the Baptist gave to Jesus. Witness is one of his important concepts, and witness is all that John the Baptist does in this Gospel. From this witness we move to the way the first disciples came to Jesus. We learn something of how Andrew and Peter came to know the Lord. We read also of Philip and Nathanael, of whom we learn little or nothing in the other Gospels.</p>
<p class="h3">The Signs and Discourses (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-12.50">2:1–12:50</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The public ministry of Jesus is described in a very distinctive way in this Gospel. John has a long section (chs <a href="?bref=John.2.1-12.50">2–12</a>) in which he tells of a number of miracles Jesus did, interweaving into his account a series of discourses. Sometimes these are addresses given to groups of people, and sometimes they are talks with individuals. Some scholars call this section of the Gospel the Book of Signs, thus emphasizing the prominent place given to seven miracles. For John they are not simply wonders. They are meaningful; in the literal sense of the term they are <span class="ital">sign</span>ificant.</p>
<p>The first of them is the turning of the water into wine at a marriage in Cana of Galilee (<a href="?bref=John.2.1-11">2:1-11</a>). The water in question is connected with Jewish rites of purification (v <a href="?bref=John.2.6">6</a>), and the story is surely to teach us that Jesus transforms life. He changes the water of the law into the wine of the gospel. As a result of this “sign,” his disciples believed in him (v <a href="?bref=John.2.11">11</a>). John went on to tell how Jesus went up to Jerusalem and drove the traders out of the temple. They were selling animals for sacrifice and changing money. But their business was being done in the Court of the Gentiles, the only place in the temple where a Gentile could come to meditate and pray.</p>
<p>The first discourse is on the new birth (<a href="?bref=John.3.1-21">3:1-21</a>). Jesus talked with Nicodemus, a leading Pharisee, about the necessity for radical renewal if one is to enter the kingdom. Jesus was speaking of God’s regenerating activity, not some human reformation. Following this, John records a dispute between some of John’s disciples with a Jew on the subject of purification. This opens the way for a section that shows the superiority of Jesus over John the Baptist—by the Baptist’s own confession (<a href="?bref=John.3.22-36">3:22-36</a>).</p>
<p>The second discourse is really a long conversation Jesus had with the woman of Samaria, whom he met by a well (<a href="?bref=John.4.1-42">4:1-42</a>). It turns on “the water of life,” a term that is not fully explained in this chapter but which we later find points to the life-giving Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.7.38-39">7:38-39</a>). This leads to the story of the second sign, the healing of the nobleman’s son (<a href="?bref=John.4.46-54">4:46-54</a>), notable for the fact that Jesus healed at a distance.</p>
<p>The third sign is the healing of the lame man by the pool of Bethesda (<a href="?bref=John.5.1-18">5:1-18</a>). This man had spent many years waiting for healing at the moving of the water. Jesus told him to get up and walk, and he did. Because it was done on a Sabbath, the Pharisees objected. This leads to Jesus’ third discourse, that on the divine Son (<a href="?bref=John.5.19-47">5:19-47</a>). Here the closeness of the relationship of Jesus to the Father is stressed, and his place in the judgment is brought out. There is emphasis also on the variety of witness who encountered Jesus, which shows how reasonable it is to accept him as God’s own Son.</p>
<p>John’s fourth sign is the one miracle (apart from the resurrection) found in all four Gospels: the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="?bref=John.6.1-15">6:1-15</a>). It is followed by Jesus’ walking on water (vv <a href="?bref=John.6.16-21">16-21</a>), which seems to be meant as the fifth sign (though some scholars think not; if they are right, there are only six signs). Then comes the fourth discourse, the great sermon on the bread of life (vv <a href="?bref=John.6.22-59">22-59</a>). Jesus is this bread, which he gives to all men and women who believe in him. There are references to eating his flesh and drinking his blood (vv <a href="?bref=John.6.50-58">50-58</a>), which point to his death. Some have seen in them a reference to Communion, but it is hard to see why Jesus should refer in this way to an as-yet-nonexistent sacrament. Moreover, much the same effect is attributed in the same discourse to believing (vv <a href="?bref=John.6.35,47">35, 47</a>). It seems best to understand Jesus as meaning that people must believe in him as the one who would die for them in order for them to have life.</p>
<p>There is a section detailing Peter’s affirmation of loyalty in the face of some who drifted away from the Master (<a href="?bref=John.6.67-71">6:67-71</a>). Then we come to the fifth discourse, on the life-giving Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.7.1-52">7:1-52</a>). John has an important explanatory point of his own when he tells us that at the time the Spirit had not been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified (v <a href="?bref=John.7.39">39</a>). The fullness of the Spirit depends on the completion of the work of Christ in his death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The sixth discourse tells of the light of the world (<a href="?bref=John.8.12-59">8:12-59</a>). This aspect of Jesus’ person and ministry is dramatically brought out in the sixth sign, the healing of the man born blind (ch <a href="?bref=John.9.1-41">9</a>). It is a lively narrative, as the healed man conducts a spirited defense against the Pharisees who belittled Jesus.</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful of all the illustrations of Jesus’ relations to his people is that on which he dwells in the seventh discourse, where he speaks of himself as the good shepherd (ch <a href="?bref=John.10.1-42">10</a>). There is the obvious truth that sheep depend entirely on their shepherd, but Jesus says something else. Whereas earthly shepherds live to meet the needs of their sheep, Jesus laid down his life for his sheep.</p>
<p>The final sign is the raising of Lazarus (<a href="?bref=John.11.1-44">11:1-44</a>), a man who had been dead for four days. The story graphically brings out Jesus’ power over death and his readiness to confer the gift of life. Jesus speaks of himself as “the resurrection and the life” (v <a href="?bref=John.11.25">25</a>); death cannot defeat him. He brings life to the dead, to the spiritually dead as well as to physically dead Lazarus. John goes on to note the reaction to this miracle: some believed, but some opposed Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=John.11.45-57">45-57</a>). He includes a notable saying of Caiaphas, the high priest, that one man should die for the people (vv <a href="?bref=John.11.50-52">50-52</a>). Caiaphas was speaking as a cynical politician (better one dead, however innocent, than the whole nation be troubled). But John saw in the words the deeper meaning that Jesus’ death would bring salvation to many.</p>
<p>John rounds off his account of the ministry with the story of the anointing of Jesus by a woman in Bethany, the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the coming of some Greeks to Jesus, and his final summary of what he had taught (ch <a href="?bref=John.12.1-50">12</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Last Supper</p>
<p class="fl">The account of what went on in the upper room on the night before the Crucifixion is the fullest of all the four Gospels. Curiously, John says nothing about the institution of Communion, a fact that has never been satisfactorily explained. But he tells us how Jesus washed the feet of the disciples (<a href="?bref=John.13.1-17">13:1-17</a>), an action splendidly exemplifying the spirit of lowly service so soon to be shown on the cross. Then comes the prophecy of the betrayal, an action that set in motion the events that would lead to the cross (vv <a href="?bref=John.13.18-30">18-30</a>).</p>
<p>In the long discourse that follows, Jesus dealt with some questions posed by his followers and went on to teach them some important truths, for example, that he is the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="?bref=John.14.6">14:6</a>). He develops the thought that he is the true vine, the disciples being vitally joined to him as branches to the vine. It is important for the branches to remain in the vine if they are to have life (<a href="?bref=John.15.1-16">15:1-16</a>). Then come some words about suffering that would be of help to them in times of persecution (vv <a href="?bref=John.15.17-25">17-25</a>). Jesus goes on to speak about the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=John.15.26-16.15">15:26–16:15</a>). This is a very important passage, for it contains much more about the Spirit than we find elsewhere in Jesus’ words. Jesus calls the Spirit the “Paraclete,” a title not easy to understand. It is in origin a legal term, and at least we can say that it indicates that the Spirit brings friendship, encouragement, and help. Jesus went on to speak of his approaching departure from the disciples and to prepare them for the trying time ahead (<a href="?bref=John.16.16-33">16:16-33</a>). This part of the Gospel concludes with Jesus’ great High Priestly prayer. He prayed for the disciples to be one, as he commended them to the care of the heavenly Father (ch <a href="?bref=John.17.1-26">17</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Cross and Resurrection</p>
<p class="fl">When the soldiers came to arrest Jesus, he went forward to meet them and they fell to the ground (<a href="?bref=John.18.1-11">18:1-11</a>). He gave himself over to them; they did not take him over. At the outset of his passion narrative, John was making the point that Jesus is sovereign. He was not being defeated by the march of events but was sovereignly doing the will of the Father. John is the only one to tell us that Jesus was taken before Annas, father-in-law to Caiaphas, the reigning high priest (<a href="?bref=John.18.12-14,19-24">18:12-14, 19-24</a>). He tells also of Peter’s three denials of Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=John.18.15-27">15-27</a>). He did not spend much time on the Jewish trial, but he was much more explicit than the other Evangelists in his account of the Roman trial. Clearly, he had some special knowledge of what went on before Pilate. He presents a magnificent picture of Jesus talking with Pilate about kingship—the Son of God discussing with the representative of Caesar the meaning of sovereignty (vv <a href="?bref=John.18.33-40">33-40</a>).</p>
<p>In his account of the Crucifixion John has a number of touches of his own, notably the way Jesus commended Mary to the care of the beloved disciple (<a href="?bref=John.19.26-27">19:26-27</a>), the fact that the cry Jesus uttered as he died was “It is finished” (v <a href="?bref=John.19.30">30</a>), and the piercing of his side by a soldier’s spear (vv <a href="?bref=John.19.31-37">31-37</a>).</p>
<p>John proceeds to the narrative of the burial (vv <a href="?bref=John.19.38-42">38-42</a>) and of the empty tomb (<a href="?bref=John.20.1-10">20:1-10</a>). He speaks of appearances of the risen Lord to Mary Magdalene (vv <a href="?bref=John.20.11-18">11-18</a>), and to the disciples—both without (vv <a href="?bref=John.20.19-23">19-23</a>) and with Thomas (vv <a href="?bref=John.20.24-29">24-29</a>).</p>
<p>The final chapter, an epilogue, tells of a miraculous catch of fish (<a href="?bref=John.21.1-14">21:1-14</a>) and goes on to the moving account of Peter’s threefold declaration of love to Jesus and his restoration.</p>

<p class="h1">JOHN, Letters of</p>
<p class="fl">Three brief epistles ascribed to John. Their brevity is deceiving, for they deal with profound and critical questions about the basic nature of Christian spiritual experience. The Johannine letters also provide interesting insight into the condition of the church at the end of the first century. Heresy is rearing its ugly head. Autonomy and church organization are reflected. The genuine nature of a committed and obedient relationship to God through Christ is powerfully and warmly portrayed and commanded.</p>

<p class="h2" id="TheFirstLetterofJohn">The First Letter of John</p>
<p class="h3">Occasion and Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">First John is a simple yet profound response to a heresy threatening the church. The methodology used is a careful and clear delineation of the truth as it is found in Christ. The two different positions—the correct and the incorrect—are clearly contrasted. The lines of demarcation are definitely drawn.</p>
<p>The letter, however, also has a positive purpose. The author wants his “children” to know the truth and respond in relationship to God, who was revealed in Christ: “We are writing these things so that our joy will be complete. This is the message he has given us to announce to you: God is light and there is no darkness in him at all” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.4-5">1 Jn 1:4-5</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The positive purpose is further designated in <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.20">5:20</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>): “And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God. And now we are in God because we are in his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the only true God, and he is eternal life.” The clear understanding of Christ—as being both God and man—is of highest importance to the author. The believers need to know this and remain in this truth, so that they can continue to abide in the Son of God and not be taken away from him by heretical teachings.</p>
<p class="h3">The Nature of the Opposition</p>
<p class="fl">Assuming that the letter is written to contest the claims of the heretics provides interesting insights into their identity. According to <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.19">2:19</a>, the opponents had been members of the Christian community but later had withdrawn to propagate their own beliefs.</p>
<p>The major christological error of the heretics was a denial of the humanity of Jesus, with the implication that he was not the Messiah. The false prophets in the world can be identified by their confession of Jesus: “This is the way to find out if they have the Spirit of God: If a prophet acknowledges that Jesus Christ became a human being, that person has the Spirit of God” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2">4:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The opening verse of the letter sharply contests the denial of Jesus’ humanity. The liar is identified in <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.22">2:22</a> (<span class="sc">nlt</span>) as the one “who says that Jesus is not the Christ. Such people are antichrists, for they have denied the Father and the Son.”</p>
<p>The practical outcome of these positions was a moral irresponsibility that advocated a life of sin and disregard for others. John, therefore, needs to call these apostates back to a life of ethics and brotherly love in Christ.</p>
<p>The opposition has been identified in various ways. The emphasis on secret and esoteric knowledge points toward a Gnostic-type heresy. The denial of the humanity of Jesus points toward the docetic heresy. Cerinthus of Asia Minor (mentioned by Irenaeus) has often been associated with the opposition in 1 John.</p>
<p class="h3">Author</p>
<p class="fl">Careful comparison of 1 John with the fourth Gospel reveals a marked resemblance in vocabulary, style, and thought. Characteristic words used by both works include “love,” “life,” “truth,” “light,” “Son,” “Spirit,” “advocate,” “manifest,” “sin,” “world,” “flesh,” “abide,” “know,” “walk,” and “commandments.” Combinations of words such as “Spirit of truth,” “born of God,” “children of God,” and “overcome the world” also point to a single author. There are also similarities in grammatical usage and patterns of expression. There are marked similarities in theological outlook as well.</p>
<p>It is difficult to deny the close relationship of the two writings. Those who have attempted to distinguish between the two have had to admit that the variations in style and theological method must have come from one who was closely related and deeply influenced by the writer of the other.</p>
<p>The traditional position on authorship has been that the apostle John was the author of both the Gospel and the letter. The opening words of 1 John point clearly in that direction: “The one who existed from the beginning is the one we have heard and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands. He is Jesus Christ, the Word of life” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1">1:1</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). This is clearly intended to let the readers know that the author was an eyewitness of the events.</p>
<p>The traditional position has been questioned on the basis of a quotation from Papias, who was bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor (<span class="era">AD</span> 100–140). His comment, transmitted through Eusebius via Irenaeus, is “If anywhere one came my way who had been a follower of the elders, I would inquire about the words of the elders—what Andrew and Peter had said, or what Thomas or James or John or Matthew or any other of the Lord’s disciples; and I would inquire about the things which Aristion and the elder John, the Lord’s disciples, say.” A number of significant commentators have argued for the existence of an elder or presbyter John in Asia Minor as distinct from the apostle John. Irenaeus, in <span class="ital">Against Heresies,</span> and the Muratorian Fragment (both from the end of the second century), however, assign 1 John to the apostle John.</p>
<p>His claim to be an eyewitness and his air of authority definitely point toward the apostle John as the author of the first letter. Tradition speaks of the advanced age of the apostle as he taught at Ephesus, and of his emphasis upon love among Christians to the very end of his life. First John reflects just such a situation.</p>
<p class="h3">Date</p>
<p class="fl">The date for the composition of 1 John is usually placed near the end of the first century. This date is confirmed by the nature of the heresy condemned and by the references to it in Polycarp and Irenaeus. Greater precision in fixing the date is not possible with the evidence available.</p>
<p class="h3">Text</p>
<p class="fl">The text of 1 John has been preserved rather well. The simplicity of the terminology and the clarity of its thought have contributed to this preservation. Three passages deserve mention in the discussion of text.</p>
<p>The words “all things” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.20">2:20</a>) are found in the nominative case in some manuscripts and in the accusative or objective case in others. The <span class="sc">kjv</span> translates the verse: “Ye know all things.” Use of the nominative case, which then modifies “you”—“You all know”—is perhaps a better rendering. The emphasis is on the breadth of the distribution of knowledge and not on the completeness of it.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.19">4:19</a> there is no object for the verb “love” in the earliest manuscripts. Some later manuscripts have inserted either “him” or “God” in this sentence (see <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg), and the <span class="sc">kjv</span> is dependent upon these manuscripts.</p>
<p>The most famous variant in 1 John is found in <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.7-8">5:7-8</a>. “These three agree in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit . . .” is clearly an interpolation added to the text at a fairly late date. The earliest reference comes from the Spanish heretic Priscillian, who died in <span class="era">AD</span> 385. At a later date it was accepted into the Vulgate. Erasmus, who edited the first Greek Testament ever published, did not include the words on the basis of their absence in Greek manuscripts. The only two Greek manuscripts that contain the words were produced since that date. Thus modern translations have eliminated this verse.</p>
<p class="h3">Content</p>
<p class="fl">Commentators are unable to agree on the specific plan and structure of the first letter. The simple terminology, the narrow range of vocabulary, the repetition of ideas, and the almost monotonous grammatical construction defy logical analysis in terms of outline and structure. Commentators have characterized the argument of the epistle as “spiral.” The picture is that of a venerable and respected elder in the community sharing his wisdom without attempting to provide a closely reasoned argument.</p>
<p>Although chapter designations were not introduced into the text of the NT until <span class="era">AD</span> 1228 and are often misleading divisions of thought, they do provide a convenient method for surveying the content of the letter. It should be noted that the letter also departs from the common letter style of the first century so vividly represented in the Pauline letters.</p>
<p>The first chapter is composed of an introduction and a discussion of walking in the light. The nature of God and man in relationship comes into sharp focus.</p>
<p>The introduction stands in the noble tradition of the prologue to the fourth Gospel and the prologue to the Letter to the Hebrews. With majestic profundity the basic dependability of the gospel message is declared. The author claims his status as an eyewitness of the one through whom the Father manifested himself. He claims that he is simply proclaiming the events in which he himself participated. The emphasis on hearing, seeing, and touching (the frequent use of the perfect tense emphasizes the continuing results) takes the manifestation out of the ethereal and speculative realm and places it directly in the world of experience.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proclamation is fellowship (the Greek word is <span class="greek">koinonia</span>). This fellowship operates both on the horizontal plane between believers and on the vertical plane between believers and both Father and Son (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.3">1:3</a>). The second element of purpose is “to make our joy complete” (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.4">4</a>).</p>
<p>In the body of the letter the author moves immediately (<a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5-10">1:5-10</a>) to the definitive nature of God as light. God’s nature as light has a number of significant implications. First, darkness has no place in God at all (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.5">5</a>). Second, those who walk (live, conduct themselves) in darkness cannot be in fellowship with God (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.6">6</a>). Third, a relationship with God (walking in the light) results in fellowship with other believers and cleansing from all sin by Jesus, his Son (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.7">7</a>). Fourth, all have sinned, and denial of that fact does not change the truth (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.8">8</a>). Fifth, acknowledgment of sin brings forgiveness and cleansing from the faithful and righteous God (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.9">9</a>). Finally, denial of ever having sinned is a reflection upon God and proves that his word is not present (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>Joy and fellowship are available only to those who walk in the light of God’s presence. God—who is light through his Son, Jesus Christ (we are reminded of the prologue of the fourth Gospel, that the Word manifested light to all men)—solves the problem of sin and unrighteousness through forgiveness and cleansing.</p>
<p>The second chapter continues the thought of the final paragraph of chapter <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.1-10">1</a>—the solution to the problem of sin—and then turns to a discussion of the new commandment and the threat of the antichrist.</p>
<p>In <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1-6">2:1-6</a> the solution to the problem of sin in the presence of a pure God is expanded. Jesus Christ not only forgives sin and cleanses unrighteousness but also he is our advocate (the same word used in <a href="?bref=John.14.1-16.33">Jn 14–16</a> and transliterated “Paraclete”) before God. Jesus had satisfied the requirements for complete reconciliation between God and humanity.</p>
<p>In response the believer is to keep his commandments. The third verse is the first of a number of verses that respond to one question: How can the believer know that all of this is true? The first test is that of obedience. The implications of the test of obedience is stated positively in verses <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.3">3</a> and <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.5">5</a> and negatively in verse <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.4">4</a>. Verse <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.6">6</a> clearly points out that the model for the lifestyle of the believer is to be found in Jesus.</p>
<p>The second test of believing (“abiding in him”) is outlined in verses <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.7-17">7-17</a>. The second authentication is love for the brothers and sisters in the Christian community. The author clearly states that it is impossible to walk in the light of God and hate your Christian brother or sister at the same time. This is an expansion on the idea of fellowship in the light found in the opening verses.</p>
<p>After encouraging three different age groups (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.12-14">2:12-14</a>—the reference may well be to stages in the Christian life rather than to chronological age groups), he warns them of the folly of loving the world (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.15-17">15-17</a>). The world consists of transient lusts and pride and is not a part of the Father, who is light. The only one who survives is the one who is obedient to the total will of God.</p>
<p>Then the author turns to the problem of the end times with its manifestation of the antichrist (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.18-27">2:18-27</a>). The antichrists (note the use of the plural) once were members of the fellowship (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.19">19</a>). Anyone who denies that Jesus is the Messiah falls into that category. The author further declares that it is impossible to deny Christ and embrace God (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.23">23</a>). Those who are born of God have an anointing from him that enables them to recognize the lies of the antichrist (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.27">27</a>).</p>
<p>The whole epistle to this point has revolved around the implications of walking with God, who is light. God’s revelation of himself in Jesus provides clear direction and understanding to recognize the true and identify the false.</p>
<p>The last two verses of chapter <a href="?bref=1Jn.2.1-29">2</a> introduce the new topic for chapter <a href="1Jn.3.1-24">3</a>, being “born of God” (<a href="?bref=1Jn.2.29">2:29</a>). The children of God do not fear the final revelation of God at the Second Coming. Instead, they anticipate it, for the full quality of their new birth will be made visible (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.2">3:2</a>). The author pauses to revel in the function of God’s love in our lives as his children (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.1">1</a>).</p>
<p>The author quickly comes back from the joy of contemplating our status as children of God to the stark realities of the world in which we must live. The world about us is characterized by sin, which is now defined as lawlessness (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.4">3:4</a>). Sin finds its origin in the devil, who “has been sinning from the beginning” (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.8">8</a>). The children of the devil reveal their essential nature by living lawless lives—Cain is used as a model (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.10-12">10-12</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus, whose second appearance is noted in the opening verses, came the first time to take away sins (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.5">3:5</a>) and destroy the works of the devil (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.8">8</a>). Those who live in Jesus should live according to the pattern of their Father, who is righteous (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.7">7</a>). The righteous lifestyle is characterized by purity (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.3">3</a>) and cessation of sin (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.7-9">7-9</a>). The contrast between the two lifestyles is obvious (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.10">10</a>).</p>
<p>The last half of chapter <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.1-24">3</a> turns to one of the expressions of righteousness—love for others in the Christian community. The negative was already introduced in verse <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.12">12</a> (Cain). Hatred of the brother is equivalent to murder (<a href="?bref=1Jn.3.15">3:15</a>). Indifference to the need of a brother or sister is also condemned (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.17-18">17-18</a>). The model for the love of the brother is Jesus, who laid down his life for us (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.16">16</a>). The positive note is that love for one’s brothers and sisters is evidence of being born of God—of passing from death into life (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.14">14</a>). Again, the contrast between the children of God and the children of the devil is obvious.</p>
<p>The last half of chapter <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.1-24">3</a> highlights one of John’s favorite emphases. “We know” is repeated in verses <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.14,16,19,24">14, 16, 19, and 24</a>. In a world of uncertainties, John recognizes the great need for assurance. He thus outlines a variety of tests to establish and maintain assurance for the children of God.</p>
<p>The transition to chapter <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.1-21">4</a> occurs at the end of chapter <a href="1Jn.3.1-24">3</a>: “We know he lives in us because the Holy Spirit lives in us” (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.24">24</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Those who have the Holy Spirit need to distinguish between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. The doctrinal test is then outlined. Those who have the Spirit of God recognize that Jesus is God come in the flesh (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.2-3">4:2-3</a>). False prophets who deny this have the spirit of the antichrist (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.3">3</a>). Obedience to God enables the children of God to recognize and respond to the language of God (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.4-6">4-6</a>).</p>
<p>In verses <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.7-12">7-12</a> John speaks of the origin of love as coming from God who is love (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.8">4:8</a>). That love was demonstrated unmistakably in Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.9-10">9-10</a>) in order to solve the problem of sin. The natural response of the children of God, then, is to love one another (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.11">11</a>), to the end that God’s love may be perfected (reach its designated goal) in us (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.12">12</a>). In this paragraph being born of God, loving God, and knowing God are inextricably intertwined.</p>
<p>Verse <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.13">13</a> picks up the assurance note of <a href="?bref=1Jn.3.1">3:1</a>: “God has given us his Spirit as proof that we live in him and he in us” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). Futher assurance is given to those who recognize that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of the world, which leads us to know the love of God. The love of God flows through us to others and is an evidence of our relationship to God (<a href="?bref=1Jn.4.14-21">4:14-21</a>). The present assurance is so clear that even the fear of Judgment Day is obviated (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.4.17-18">17-18</a>).</p>
<p>In the final chapter, John turns to the interrelationship between love and righteousness. Those who are born of God do not find the commandments of God to be burdensome (<a href="?bref=1Jn.5.3">5:3</a>). The faith of the children of God enables them to find victory over the world that would hinder the fulfillment of commands (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.4">4</a>). That faith rests in Jesus as the Son of God (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.5">5</a>). Again, correct belief enters the picture: Jesus was fully human (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.6">6</a>), and the Spirit bears witness to the reality of Jesus (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.7-8">7-8</a>). The result is a great inner certitude that God “has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son” (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.11">11</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Again, the line of demarcation between the one who has life and the one who does not is made crystal clear (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.12">12</a>).</p>
<p>Verses <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.13-16">13-16</a> move from the possession of eternal life to certainty in prayer. A solid confidence in God brings answers to prayer (vv <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.14-15">14-15</a>). Confidence also extends to prayer on behalf of others who are committing sin (now John defines sin as unrighteousness rather than the sin that leads to death, v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.12">12</a>); God will honor that prayer by giving life to the sinner (v <a href="?bref=1Jn.5.16">16</a>).</p>
<p>The final verses are a reiteration of the major themes of the letter. The victory of the one who is born of God through the true God who has come to us in Jesus clearly differentiates the child of God from the life of the world under the power of the evil one. The shining note of assurance continues to the very end of the letter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheSecondLetterofJohn">The Second Letter of John</p>
<p class="h3">Author, Setting, and Date</p>
<p class="fl">Second John was written in a setting similar to that of 1 John. The author identifies himself as “the elder” and designates his audience as “the elect lady and her children” (<a href="?bref=2Jn.1.1">2 Jn 1:1</a>). The “elect lady” is probably a church and the “children” are the members of it. The closing greeting from “your elect sister” (v <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.13">13</a>) confirms this analysis. This church was harassed by the same heresies that were attacked in 1 John. The heresies are denounced, and the church is warned not to entertain the messengers of the heresy.</p>
<p>The grammar, style, and vocabulary of 2 John compare very closely to 1 John. Eight of the 13 verses of the second letter are almost identical with verses in 1 John.</p>
<p>Information concerning date of writing is inadequate to make any decision. The similarity to 1 John suggests a similar era.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AncientGreekTextOf2John"/>
<p class="h3">The Message</p>
<p class="fl">The message of the letter is twofold. In the first place, the members of the Christian community were urged to love one another (v <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.5">5</a>). The nature of love is then defined as following his commandments (v <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.6">6</a>). The second, and more compelling, element is the warning against the deceivers who refuse to acknowledge Christ and persuade others to do the same. Love indeed has its limits when it comes to even housing those who refuse to acknowledge Christ (vv <a href="?bref=2Jn.1.8-11">8-11</a>). The deceivers are probably the same heretics identified in the first letter.</p>
<p>The letter closes with a promise of further communication in person. The purpose of the visit will be to complete one another’s joy (cf. <a href="?bref=1Jn.1.4">1 Jn 1:4</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheThirdLetterofJohn">The Third Letter of John</p>
<p class="h3">Author, Setting, and Date</p>
<p class="fl">Third John is also written in a similar setting. The occasion, however, is not the threat of heresy. The problem now is a certain Diotrephes, who is repudiating the authority of “the elder” and trying to frustrate his leadership. The letter is addressed to Gaius, who is still loyal to the elder. The elder asks Gaius to provide for the genuine missionaries who are passing through. In the thanksgiving section Gaius is commended for his faithfulness to the truth, especially as a “child” of the elder.</p>
<p>Again, we have insufficient information to establish date or additional setting. The familiar terminology and writing style tie it closely to the other two letters; as such, the author was probably John the apostle.</p>
<p class="h3">Message</p>
<p class="fl">The burden of the letter is also twofold. The first paragraph (<a href="?bref=3Jn.1.5-8">3 Jn 1:5-8</a>) commends Gaius for his hospitality to the itinerant missionaries who are traveling “for the sake of the Name” (v <a href="?bref=3Jn.1.7">7</a>), i.e., the Lord Jesus Christ. The missionaries have spoken well of Gaius’s love for the church.</p>
<p>The main body of the letter warns against the insubordination of a certain Diotrephes. His love of power and authority has led him not only to defy the authority of the elder but also to convince others to follow his defiance or be excommunicated. He has refused to entertain the genuine itinerant preachers. Gaius is warned not to be influenced by Diotrephes’ example.</p>
<p>The conclusion reflects the anticipation of an immediate personal visit. Normal greetings conclude the little letter.</p>

<p class="h2" id="BirthInfancyandBoyhood">Birth, Infancy, and Boyhood</p>
<p class="fl">Luke’s Gospel is our only source of information concerning the birth and boyhood of John. The Gospel writer states that John was born in the hill country of Judah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.39">Lk 1:39</a>) of priestly descent, being the son of Zechariah, a priest of the order of Abijah, and Elizabeth, a descendant of Aaron (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.5">5</a>). Both parents were righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments closely (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.6">6</a>). Like the birth of Jesus, only to a much lesser degree, the birth of John the Baptist is described in Luke as extraordinary. The angel Gabriel announced the coming birth to Zechariah in the temple; to the older, barren Elizabeth it came as an answer to prayer (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.8-13">8-13</a>). John’s name is announced to Zechariah by the angel, even as his purpose as forerunner is revealed before birth (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.1.13-17">13-17</a>). Such a consecration from birth is reminiscent of the call of the OT prophet Jeremiah (cf. <a href="?bref=Jer.1.5">Jer 1:5</a>).</p>
<p>There existed some familial relationship between the families of John and Jesus. Elizabeth is described as a relative of Mary (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.36">Lk 1:36</a>), which may connote cousin or aunt, or may only mean being from the same tribe.</p>
<p>John’s childhood, as that of Jesus, is left quite vague in the Gospel account. All that is said is that “John grew up and became strong in spirit. Then he lived out in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel” (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.80">Lk 1:80</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Some scholars have suggested that John might have been adopted as a boy by the Essenes (as was their practice) at Qumran and reared in their wilderness community, adjacent to the Dead Sea and near the Jordan River. There are some similarities between the activities of the Qumran sect, known through the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the later ministry of John the Baptist. Both practiced a type of asceticism and removed themselves from the life of Jerusalem. Both practiced baptism and associated this rite with initiation and repentance. Finally, John and the Qumran group were both eschatologically minded, awaiting God’s final end-time activity in history. Nevertheless, many significant differences exist between John and the Qumran sect.</p>
<p class="h2" id="AppearanceandIdentity">Appearance and Identity</p>
<p class="fl">Mark’s Gospel begins with an account of John the Baptist’s appearance: “John the Baptist . . . lived in the wilderness and was preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had turned from their sins and turned to God to be forgiven” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.4">Mk 1:4</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). A rich OT background lies behind John’s association with the wilderness, in this case the wilderness of Judea. It was in the wilderness that God revealed himself to Moses (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.1-22">Ex 3</a>), gave the law, and entered into the covenant with Israel (ch <a href="?bref=Exod.19.1-25">19</a>). It was also the site of refuge for David (<a href="?bref=1Sam.23.1-26.25">1 Sm 23–26</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.63.1-11">Ps 63</a>) and Elijah (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.19.1-21">1 Kgs 19</a>), and in this light became the anticipated site of God’s future deliverance (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.3-5">Is 40:3-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.47.1-12">Ez 47:1-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Hos.2.14-15">Hos 2:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>The unusual dress of John the Baptist—“clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>)—may have suggested to his audience an association with Elijah in particular (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.1.8">2 Kgs 1:8</a>) or with the prophets in general (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.4">Zec 13:4</a>). His diet, “locusts and wild honey” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.6">Mk 1:6</a>), was Levitically clean, reflecting one who lived off the desert (such food was also eaten at Qumran) and formed part of the broader asceticism practiced by John and his disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.14">Mt 9:14</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.11.18">11:18</a>).</p>
<p>Who did John understand himself to be? In answer to questions by the multitude whether he was the Messiah, Elijah, or the expected prophet (<a href="?bref=John.1.20-23">Jn 1:20-23</a>), John only identified himself as “a voice crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord’ ” (<a href="?bref=Isa.40.3">Is 40:3</a>). The background for the question lies at the end of the OT period. Prophecy, on the one hand, was considered to have ceased (<a href="?bref=Zech.13.2-6">Zec 13:2-6</a>); yet, on the other hand, it was expected to appear again before the coming of the messianic kingdom (see <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28-29">Jl 2:28-29</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.3.1-4">Mal 3:1-4</a>). Some anticipated this final prophet to be one who was like Moses (<a href="?bref=Deut.18.15">Dt 18:15</a>), others a returning Elijah as foretold in <a href="?bref=Mal.4.5-6">Malachi 4:5-6</a>. While John personally refrained from identifying himself with these specific expectations (<a href="?bref=John.1.20-23">Jn 1:20-23</a>), it is clear that his dress, lifestyle, and message caused the people to identify him with this end-time prophet (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.5">Mt 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.11.32">Mk 11:32</a>). Jesus also saw John as this final “Elijah-like” prophet (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.7-15">Mt 11:7-15</a>), who from Malachi’s prophecy was to be a forerunner to the coming of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.1-4">Mal 3:1-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mal.4.5-6">4:5-6</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JohnsProclamation">John’s Proclamation</p>
<p class="fl">John’s proclamation involved three elements: a warning of imminent judgment at the hands of the Coming One, a call for repentance in light of the coming kingdom of heaven, and a demand to express this repentance in concrete ethical terms. Many Jews looked forward confidently to the messianic judgment as a time of blessing for themselves and destruction for the gentile oppressors. John, however, warned that Jewish ancestry was false security in the coming judgment (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.8">Lk 3:8</a>); true repentance was the only means of escaping destruction (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>). John anticipated this judgment at the hands of the Coming One, who would baptize the nation with “the Holy Spirit and with fire” (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>). Fire represented the OT means of destruction in the end time (<a href="?bref=Mal.4.1">Mal 4:1</a>) as well as purification (<a href="?bref=Mal.3.1-4">Mal 3:1-4</a>), while the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the end time connoted blessing (<a href="?bref=Isa.32.15">Is 32:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.39.29">Ez 39:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.2.28">Jl 2:28</a>) and purification (<a href="?bref=Isa.4.2-4">Is 4:2-4</a>). The judgment anticipated by John was therefore twofold: destruction for the unrepentant, and blessing for the penitent and righteous (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.12">Mt 3:12</a>).</p>
<p>In light of this imminent event John called for repentance on the part of his listeners (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.2">Mt 3:2</a>), a true “turning back” or “turning toward” God in obedience that would bring forgiveness of sin. Such a turnabout in an individual’s relation with God should be lived out in one’s everyday dealings: fairness on the part of tax collectors (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.12-13">Lk 3:12-13</a>) and soldiers (v <a href="?bref=Luke.3.14">14</a>), and the general requirement of compassion for the poor (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.3.10-11">10-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JohnsBaptism">John’s Baptism</p>
<p class="fl">The Gospels record that John baptized those repentant of their sins at several locations: the Jordan River (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.5">Mk 1:5</a>), Bethany beyond the Jordan (<a href="?bref=John.1.28">Jn 1:28</a>), and Aenon near Salim (<a href="?bref=John.3.23">Jn 3:23</a>). This practice was an integral part of John’s call for repentance, given in light of the approaching judgment and the appearance of the Coming One. The baptism of the penitent symbolized desire for forgiveness of sin, a renunciation of past life, and a desire to be included in the coming messianic kingdom.</p>
<p>What was the background for John’s practice of baptism? From the OT we know of ceremonial lustrations or washings that guaranteed ritual purity (<a href="?bref=Lev.14.1-15.33">Lv 14–15</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.19.1-22">Nm 19</a>). Unlike John’s baptism, these washings were repetitive in nature and referred predominantly to ritual rather than moral cleansing. The prophets, however, urged a moral purification associated with the washing of water (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.16-18">Is 1:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.4.14">Jer 4:14</a>). More significantly, the prophets anticipated a cleansing by God in the end times preceding the Day of Judgment (<a href="?bref=Ezek.36.25">Ez 36:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.13.1">Zec 13:1</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.44.3">Is 44:3</a>), an eschatological element that John may have assumed was being fulfilled in his water baptism.</p>
<p>Another precedent for John’s practice may have been proselyte baptism, a rite (along with circumcision and the offering of sacrifices) that constituted the conversion of a Gentile to Judaism. Common to both proselyte baptism and John’s baptism were the emphasis on an ethical break with the past, a once-for-all character, and the similarity of immersion. Notable differences were that John’s baptism was for Jews, not Gentile converts, and that it had a marked eschatological character as a preparation for the new age. Unless John, in light of the imminence of the messianic age, consciously treated all Jews as “pagan” in need of a baptism of repentance (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.3.7-10">Mt 3:7-10</a>), it is doubtful that proselyte baptism formed the primary background for John’s baptismal ministry.</p>
<p>If John’s baptism had a clear association with the forgiveness of sin, the question naturally arises as to why Jesus, the Son of God, sought baptism from John. John himself asks this very question of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.14">Mt 3:14</a>), to which Jesus responds, “It must be done, because we must do everything that is right” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.3.15">15</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). First, it is clear that Jesus’ baptism represented an act of obedience on his part to God’s will as he saw it. Second, by submitting to the baptism of John, Jesus was clearly validating the ministry and message of John. The imminent coming of the kingdom and its Messiah, and the need for repentance in anticipation of this event that John proclaimed, were affirmed by Jesus through baptism. Third, by being baptized, Jesus condemned the self-righteous for their lack of repentance and took a stand with the penitent publicans and sinners awaiting the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.29-30">Lk 7:29-30</a>). Fourth, Jesus stepped forward for baptism not as an individual in need of forgiveness but as one who represented the people of God. His baptism, therefore, demonstrated solidarity with the people in their need of deliverance, even as he is judged in their place on the cross. Finally, the voice from heaven (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11</a>) and the descent of the Spirit (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.21-22">Lk 3:21-22</a>) signify the inauguration of Jesus’ own ministry through his baptism by John.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JohnsViewofJesus">John’s View of Jesus</p>
<p class="fl">Throughout his ministry John pointed beyond himself to one “who is far greater than I am—so much greater that I am not even worthy to be his slave” (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.7">Mk 1:7</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). His self-understanding apparently sprang from the application of <a href="?bref=Isa.40.3">Isaiah 40:3</a> to himself, that he was the preparer or forerunner for God’s coming activity through the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.4-6">Lk 3:4-6</a>). When asked by curious spectators, John firmly denied that he was the Messiah, and according to the Gospel accounts, subordinated himself to the Coming One (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.7-8">Mk 1:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.26-28">Jn 1:26-28</a>; <a href="?bref=John.3.28-31">3:28-31</a>). The coming of Jesus to baptism seems to represent the first time John identified these expectations with Jesus himself (<a href="?bref=John.1.35-36">Jn 1:35-36</a>). His recognition of Jesus as the Messiah prior to baptism (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.14">Mt 3:14</a>) was confirmed by the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove and the voice from heaven quoting a phrase from an OT messianic psalm (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11a</a>, from <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Ps 2:7</a>), together with a phrase from a Suffering Servant song of Isaiah (<a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11b</a>, from <a href="?bref=Isa.42.1">Is 42:1</a>). In the fourth Gospel, John the Baptist goes even further in acknowledging Jesus to be the “Lamb of God” (<a href="?bref=John.1.29">Jn 1:29</a>), in anticipation of Jesus’ sacrificial role on the cross. And John recognized him as “God’s Chosen One” (v <a href="?bref=John.1.34">34</a>, <span class="sc">neb</span>—another term for the Messiah; <a href="?bref=Ps.2.7">Ps 2:7</a>, see <a href="?bref=Mark.1.11">Mk 1:11</a>).</p>
<p>In light of John’s strong affirmation, it is at first difficult to understand his questioning of Jesus while imprisoned: “Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?” (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.3">Mt 11:3</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Some have suggested that John was merely asking for the sake of his disciples, or that the question reflected John’s despondency with being imprisoned. It is more likely, however, that the question represents John’s own confusion with the activity expected of the Messiah. John had proclaimed a Coming One who would bring a baptism of fire and judgment upon the wicked (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.16">Lk 3:16</a>). It may have been difficult for him to understand Jesus’ different emphases on forgiveness and acceptance of sinners (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.9-13">Mt 9:9-13</a>) and his healing of the sick (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.1-9.38">Mt 8–9</a>). When John’s disciples brought their master’s question to Jesus, asking whether or not he was the Messiah, Jesus responded by quoting <a href="?bref=Isa.35.5-6">Isaiah 35:5-6</a> (see also <a href="?bref=Isa.61.1">Is 61:1</a>). This text proclaims the activities of healing and proclaiming salvation to the poor to be fulfillments of the Messiah’s role, even though they may not have been what John or countless other Jews expected.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JesusViewofJohn">Jesus’ View of John</p>
<p class="fl">That Jesus highly regarded John the Baptist is indicated by his baptism by John. It is also explicitly stated on several occasions. Jesus called him the greatest man to have ever lived (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.28">Lk 7:28</a>). (Of course, he was not as great as Jesus, the God-man.) Jesus also said that John was a burning and shining lamp (<a href="?bref=John.5.33-35">Jn 5:33-35</a>) and that he practiced a baptism divinely ordained (<a href="?bref=Luke.20.1-8">Lk 20:1-8</a>).</p>
<p>John’s uniqueness, however, lies in the fact that he stood at the turning of the ages. He was the last of the old era, the period of the law and the prophets (<a href="?bref=Luke.16.16">Lk 16:16</a>), which was to precede the coming of the messianic age (the kingdom of God). John was the last of the prophets, the greatest of them, the Elijah figure who would prepare the way for the judgment of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.13-15">Mt 11:13-15</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.1.17">Lk 1:17</a>). Because John belonged to the era of the law and the prophets, however, he was not as great as the “least” already in the kingdom of God (<a href="?bref=Matt.11.11">Mt 11:11</a>)—that is, those who belonged to the era of the kingdom’s appearance in Jesus.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ArrestImprisonmentandMartyrdom">Arrest, Imprisonment, and Martyrdom</p>
<p class="fl">To understand why John was arrested and beheaded by Herod Antipas, one has to grasp the messianic excitement caused by John’s appearance and message (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.15-18">Lk 3:15-18</a>). Herod and other secular rulers were obviously suspicious of anyone who might stir up the crowds with predictions of a coming messianic ruler. Other messianic movements had arisen before John, which resulted in outbreaks of violence against the Roman-Herodian rulership. Moreover, Herod Antipas was under heavy criticism for his marriage with Herodias, the ex-wife of his brother Philip. His first marriage, with the daughter of Aretus II, constituted a political alliance between the Herodian family and the Nabatean kingdom of Perea. His new relationship with Herodias was perceived as a breach of the political alliance and led to friction between the two families. John’s denunciation of Herod’s new marriage (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.3-12">Mt 14:3-12</a>) could thus have been interpreted by Herod as a subversive rousing of sentiment against his authority. The Jewish historian Josephus states that Herod did, in fact, arrest John because he feared John’s influence over the crowds. According to Josephus, John was imprisoned at the fortress Machaerus on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. That he was not killed immediately was due to Herod’s personal fear of the righteous John (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.2">Mk 6:2</a>) and of the people’s reaction (<a href="?bref=Matt.14.5">Mt 14:5</a>). On a point about which Josephus is silent, the Gospels record that it was Herodias’s feelings against John (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.17">Mk 6:17</a>) and her plot, through the dancing of her daughter, which brought about the beheading of John (vv <a href="?bref=Mark.6.21-29">21-29</a>). John was beheaded at Herodias’s request in approximately <span class="era">AD</span> 29 or 30.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheDisciplesofJohn">The Disciples of John</p>
<p class="fl">While it is clear that a band of disciples formed around John in his lifetime (<a href="?bref=John.1.35">Jn 1:35</a>), to suggest that he intended to begin a continuing movement is contradicted by his message on the imminent Day of Judgment. Apparently, John’s disciples consisted of a small group of those who had been baptized by him and were awaiting the coming Messiah. Some transferred their loyalty to Jesus after John had identified Jesus as the Coming One (<a href="?bref=John.1.37">Jn 1:37</a>). Others, however, apparently stayed on with their teacher, communicating with the imprisoned John concerning the activities of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.18-23">Lk 7:18-23</a>) and, after his death, taking the body for burial (<a href="?bref=Mark.6.29">Mk 6:29</a>).</p>
<p>We know little about the activities and practices of the band of disciples clustered around John. We do know, however, that fasting was one practice specifically associated with the group, and one that marked them as similar to the Pharisees (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.14">Mt 9:14</a>). In this practice they no doubt followed the example of John himself (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.33">Lk 7:33</a>). Prayer and fasting were often linked in late Judaism. The disciples of John were also known for the prayers taught by their master (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.1">11:1</a>). Seeing this practice, the disciples of Jesus asked the Lord to teach them to pray, to which Jesus responded with the Lord’s Prayer (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.11.2-4">2-4</a>).</p>
<p>After his death it is likely that other disciples of John joined the followers of Jesus (see <a href="?bref=Luke.7.29-30">Lk 7:29-30</a>). Not all did so, however, as disciples of John were encountered by Paul and other Christians approximately 25 years later in Ephesus (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.24-29.7">Acts 18:24–29:7</a>). Upon hearing witness to Jesus, these followers of John proclaimed Jesus as Messiah. When Paul baptized them in the name of Jesus they received the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Acts.19.4-7">19:4-7</a>). Even so, it is apparent from later documents that various groups continued to honor John, even considering him the Messiah, centuries after the NT period.</p>

<p class="h1">JONAH (P<span class="lc">erson</span>)</p>
<p class="fl">Prophet of Israel; Amittai’s son (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.1">Jon 1:1</a>) of the Zebulunite city of Gath-hepher (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">2 Kgs 14:25</a>). The historian who wrote 2 Kings recorded that Jonah had a major prophetic role in the reign of King Jeroboam II (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jonah had conveyed a message encouraging expansion to the king of Israel, whose reign was marked by prosperity, expansion, and unfortunately, moral decline.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the political corruption of Israel, Jonah remained a zealous patriot. His reluctance to go to Nineveh probably stemmed partially from his knowledge that the Assyrians would be used as God’s instrument for punishing Israel. The prophet, who had been sent to Jeroboam to assure him that his kingdom would prosper, was the same prophet God chose to send to Nineveh to forestall that city’s (and thus that nation’s) destruction until Assyria could be used to punish Israel in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>. It is no wonder that the prophet reacted emotionally to his commission.</p>
<p>No other prophet was so strongly Jewish (cf. his classic confession, <a href="?bref=Jon.1.9">Jon 1:9</a>), yet no other prophet’s ministry was so strongly directed to a non-Jewish nation. Jonah’s writing is also unusual among the prophets. The book is primarily historical narrative. His actual preaching is recorded in only five words in the Hebrew—eight words in most English translations (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.4">Jon 3:4b</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JONAH, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Fifth book of the 12 Minor Prophets in the traditional arrangement of the books of the OT. It is a literary narrative rather than a series of prophetic oracles, and it gives the account of Jonah’s experiences after he disobeyed a command from the Lord directing him to preach to the people of Nineveh. Several extraordinary events recorded in the book have made it the center of much controversy as to its interpretation.</p>

<p class="fl">The book of Jonah has been traditionally ascribed to Jonah the son of Amittai, a prophet of great influence, who ministered during the reign of Jeroboam II of Israel (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">2 Kgs 14:25</a>).</p>
<p>The content of the book describes Jonah as an intensely patriotic person, but his misguided patriotism caused him to rebel at the possibility of Israel’s former enemies receiving forgiveness from God. One of the most important lessons of the book emerges when God rebukes Jonah’s exclusivistic attitude (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.6-11">Jon 4:6-11</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus used two of the experiences of Jonah as signs to his generation. The three days and nights spent by Jonah in the great fish served as an analogy of Jesus’ death and resurrection (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.38-41">Mt 12:38-41</a>). Also, the positive response of the Ninevites to Jonah’s preaching was used by Jesus as a condemnation of the failure of many in his generation to believe in him (<a href="?bref=Luke.11.32">Lk 11:32</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Authenticity">Authenticity</p>
<p class="fl">The unusual elements in the book of Jonah have led to widely varying views of its nature. Not only has the account of Jonah being swallowed by the fish led some to think the book to be of a fabulous nature, but the account of the repentance of the people of Nineveh (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.5">Jon 3:5</a>) also has been regarded as highly unlikely.</p>
<p>The historicity of the book has been championed by outstanding biblical scholars. The basic approach of these scholars has been to counter the arguments of those who deny its historicity and to point to what is regarded as positive evidence for the historicity of the book in Jesus’ allusions to the prophecy and in early Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>Opponents of the authenticity of Jonah point to the following difficulties: (1) The use of the expression “king of Nineveh” (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.6">3:6</a>) appears to be an inaccuracy because Nineveh was the capital of Assyria. A contemporary would have referred to the king as the king of Assyria. (2) The use of the past tense to describe the city of Nineveh (v <a href="?bref=Jon.3.3">3</a>) seems to point to a much later date than the traditional view of the authorship of the book would permit. (3) The size of the city of Nineveh is described in greatly exaggerated terms (v <a href="?bref=Jon.3.3">3</a>). (4) The mass repentance of the Ninevites lacks historical support. (5) It is unlikely that a human being could exist within a fish for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>With regard to the use of “king of Nineveh,” it should be noted that similar expressions may be found in the OT. Ahab, the king of Israel, is called “king of Samaria” (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.21.1">1 Kgs 21:1</a>), and Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, is designated “king of Damascus” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.24.23">2 Chr 24:23</a>). The designation “king of Nineveh” is therefore not anomalous.</p>
<p>The use of the past tense to describe the city of Nineveh may be regarded as nothing more than a simple narrative past tense describing the size of the city at the time that Jonah prophesied there.</p>
<p>The description of the size of the city (“three days’ journey”) may be an indication of the length of time that it would take one to go through the suburbs included in the administrative district of Nineveh.</p>
<p>The repentance of the Ninevites is not to be understood as a mass conversion to Yahweh, the God of Israel. The book of Jonah describes their response as repentance in view of the impending destruction threatened by Jonah (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.4">Jon 3:4</a>). While secular history does not record such an event, there is evidence that such a response was possible. In less than a decade (765–759 <span class="era">BC</span>) the city of Nineveh had experienced a total eclipse of the sun and two serious plagues. One can understand how the citizens of Nineveh may have been prepared for the preaching of this prophet who came to them in such an unusual way.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that one of the kings of Assyria, Adad-nirari III, limited his worship to the god Nebo. If the prophetic ministry of Jonah was active during the time of his reign (810–783 <span class="era">BC</span>), it is possible that the Jewish monotheism represented by Jonah may have found a more favorable climate than one would normally expect in a pagan society.</p>
<p>The participation of the animals in the national penitence that followed Jonah’s preaching (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.7-8">3:7-8</a>) is not unknown from history. The historian Herodotus records a similar event in the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>The event that creates the greatest difficulty, however, is the experience of Jonah in the fish. It has often been pointed out that the gullets of most whales are not large enough to admit an object the size of a man. But the book does not say that it was a whale that swallowed Jonah, but simply a great fish (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.17">1:17</a>). Even so, it is possible for a sperm whale to swallow an object as large as a man.</p>
<p>Numerous examples of individuals being swallowed by whales have been cited in the past. While many of these accounts may be disregarded as fancy, it would be wrong to uncritically reject all of them. (An interesting account of one of these experiences may be found in the <span class="ital">Princeton Theological Review</span> 25, 1927, p. 636.) The experience of Jonah in the great fish need not be regarded as an absolute impossibility. The activities of God in history have often been accompanied by unusual or miraculous events.</p>
<p>The difficulties of the book of Jonah have led many to regard the book as a prophetic parable rather than a record of historical fact. The most common interpretation is that the book is an expression of the universal concerns of God. As such, it inveighs against the exclusive nationalism of the Jews. This narrow-minded attitude, some suggest, fits best into the postexilic period, when the hatred of Israel for its former captors was still very bitter.</p>
<p>There are several difficulties with this view. While there are a number of parables in the OT, none is as extensive as the book of Jonah. Also, since the major elements of a parable symbolize persons, objects, or concepts that contribute to the main teaching of the parable, the proponents of this view are hard pressed to show how the account of Jonah’s experience in the fish contributes to the central lesson of the parable.</p>
<p>Another approach to the book is to regard it as an extended allegory. An allegory is a literary form, the basic elements of which are intended to symbolize or explain aspects of real life to which they are analogous. The intended meaning is usually evident or explained by the author. In the OT, allegories are short literary forms used to lend force to a pronouncement. The book of Jonah does not seem to fit this category. It is a narrative account with no evident meaning given to the various persons, objects, and events cited.</p>
<p>There seems to be no convincing reason for rejecting the historicity of the book of Jonah on the basis of the arguments generally given. Jesus referred to the account of Jonah in a way that seems to imply his acceptance of its validity.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">If Jonah was the son of Amittai cited in <a href="?bref=2Kgs.14.25">2 Kings 14:25</a>, the prophecy would have to be dated in the reign of Jeroboam II of Israel (793–753 <span class="era">BC</span>). Jonah would then be one of the great eighth-century prophets who ministered during the Silver Age of Israel.</p>
<p>Those who understand the book to have been written by an author other than Jonah place the writing at various times, from the period following the fall of Nineveh to well into the postexilic period.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Archaeological excavations at the site of ancient Nineveh have yielded many artifacts and literary works indicating that it was a cultural center for a great part of its history. In the Middle Assyrian period, the city of Nineveh was greatly enlarged and became an administrative center. Some of the most powerful Assyrian kings ruled from Nineveh.</p>
<p>The city of Calah, to the south of Nineveh, had an area much smaller than Nineveh but housed almost 70,000 persons. The description of the vast population of Nineveh in the prophecy of Jonah seems to fit with this.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The purpose of the book of Jonah is to teach that God’s grace was not limited to the Hebrew people. This lesson is taught in the dramatic climax of the book. Jonah, filled with self-pity, laments the loss of the plant that gave him shade. God shows Jonah’s concern for the plant in stark contrast to his own concern for the thousands of people of Nineveh.</p>
<p>The book clearly sets forth the fact that God’s mercy was not the sole possession of the Hebrew people of Jonah’s time but was available to all through repentance. Even Israel’s enemies could experience God’s mercy.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="fl">The book of Jonah begins with a command from the Lord to the prophet directing him to preach to the people of Nineveh. Jonah was reluctant to go to Nineveh because he knew that the Ninevites would repent. He would therefore find himself in the dubious position of proclaiming God’s mercy to the hated Assyrians. Therefore, he fled from Joppa by ship in a futile attempt to flee from the presence of God. He boarded a ship bound for Tarshish, a Phoenician colony in southern Spain. It was as far west as Jonah could flee within the scope of the ancient Mediterranean world (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.1-3">1:1-3</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="JonahsRoundaboutJourney"/>
<p>God would not allow his servant to disobey without chastisement, however (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.4-16">1:4-16</a>). God’s love demanded Jonah’s discipline. The program of discipline commenced with a divinely originated storm (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.4">4</a>). In the midst of the terrifying rage of this storm, the sailors busied themselves with supplications to their individual pagan deities and with casting excess cargo overboard (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.5">5</a>). Through all the commotion Jonah was asleep in the hold of the ship.</p>
<p>The sailors were as yet unaware that Jonah was the real problem. The captain of the ship aroused Jonah and told him to pray to his god for deliverance from the tempest (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.6">6</a>).</p>
<p>Receiving no response to their supplications, the sailors proceeded to cast lots in an attempt to determine who on board was the cause of the wrath of the god who had brought the storm upon them (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.7">1:7</a>); the lot indicated that Jonah was to blame. The sailors then wanted to know what god was responsible for the storm and why. Jonah’s testimony was simple and to the point: he was a Hebrew who worshiped the Lord who created both land and sea (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.9">9</a>).</p>
<p>The sailors asked Jonah what they should do to him since the storm was increasing in its fury (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.11">1:11</a>). The captain had previously told Jonah to pray or perish. Now Jonah revealed that praying would not accomplish what his perishing could (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.12">12</a>). He asked them to throw him into the sea.</p>
<p>Before yielding to Jonah’s request, the sailors struggled to save the ship (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.13">1:13</a>). Failing in their attempt, they cast him into the sea (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.15">15</a>). Imagine the impression made on these sailors when the storm ceased as soon as Jonah’s body was in the sea. Their experience caused the ship’s crew to fear the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him (v <a href="?bref=Jon.1.16">16</a>).</p>
<p>But God was not through with Jonah, for he prepared a great fish to swallow him (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.17">1:17</a>). Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and nights (cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.12.38-41">Mt 12:38-41</a>). From within the fish Jonah prayed to God (<a href="?bref=Jon.2.1">Jon 2:1</a>), and thanked him for hearing his prayer and saving him from death in the sea (vv <a href="?bref=Jon.2.7-8">7-8</a>). Jonah’s deliverance brought him to the point of renewed devotion to God (v <a href="?bref=Jon.2.9">9</a>). It is significant that his prayer reflected a deep personal acquaintance with the Psalms (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.3.8">Pss 3:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.5.7">5:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.18.4-19">18:4-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.30.2-3">30:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.31.6,22">31:6, 22</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.39.9">39:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.42.6-7">42:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.59.17">59:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.69.1-2">69:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.120.1">120:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.142.3">142:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.144.2">144:2</a>).</p>
<p>The ultimate answer to Jonah’s prayers came when God provided him with the opportunity of obeying his commission and keeping his vows. The sea creature spit Jonah out upon the shore (<a href="?bref=Jon.2.10">Jon 2:10</a>).</p>
<p>The writer now turns his attention to God’s dealing with the city of Nineveh (chs <a href="?bref=Jon.3.1-4.11">3–4</a>). Jonah repented of his disobedience and manifested that repentance by going to Nineveh to declare God’s message (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.1-3">3:1-3</a>). Upon his arrival in Nineveh, he proceeded to proclaim God’s message. The inhabitants of the city were told they had 40 days (v <a href="?bref=Jon.3.4">4</a>), but they evidently responded immediately.</p>
<p>The people and their king repented in sackcloth and with fasting (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.5-6">3:5-6</a>). Having repented privately, the king made a public proclamation to reinforce the response to God’s message (vv <a href="?bref=Jon.3.7-9">7-9</a>).</p>
<p>God’s acceptance of Nineveh’s repentance (<a href="?bref=Jon.3.10">3:10</a>) caused Jonah’s grudging attitude to return and he complained (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>). His recently uttered psalm of prayerful praise to God (<a href="?bref=Jon.2.1-9">2:1-9</a>) now turned to bitter grumbling. Jonah prayed again to God (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.2">4:2</a>), revealing his reason for refusing to obey the first commission. He had personal knowledge of God’s loving and forgiving nature, and he resented that love and forgiveness being extended to the enemies of his country. In foolish abandon, Jonah asked to die rather than to see God’s work among the Ninevites (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.3">3</a>).</p>
<p>God’s compassion had been manifested to Nineveh, but he was also to show compassion again to Jonah by illustration and instruction (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.4-11">4:4-11</a>). God’s quiet question, “Is it right for you to be angry about this?” must have probed Jonah’s innermost being (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.4">4</a>). But the prophet preferred to put in a temporary shelter on the east side of Nineveh (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.5">5</a>) waiting to see if anything would happen.</p>
<p>God added a plant (something with large leaves) to the number of nature’s objects that he used in his dealings with Jonah (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.6">4:6</a>). This provision for Jonah’s comfort brought him joy. But the plant was destroyed by a worm sent by God (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.7">7</a>). Then God sent the hot sirocco wind to dry out the air, increase the heat, and add to Jonah’s misery (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.8">8</a>). Again, Jonah begged to die.</p>
<p>For the second time God questioned Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?” (<a href="?bref=Jon.4.9">4:9</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). The point of the illustration was being driven home to the insensitive prophet. Jonah, however, responded with more bitterness (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.9">9</a>). Jonah was greatly agitated because the loss of the plant affected him personally, even though he had nothing to do with its creation (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.10">10</a>). The Lord Yahweh had created man. The Lord was concerned for the welfare of the Ninevites. Did not the great Creator have the right to be agitated over the destruction of Nineveh with its 120,000 children and all its animals (v <a href="?bref=Jon.4.11">11</a>)? As Jonah had desired the preservation of the plant, so God had desired even more exceedingly the preservation of Nineveh.</p>

When Judas Maccabeus was killed in battle with Bacchides (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.18">1 Macc 9:18</a>), his brother Jonathan became his successor (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.9.28-31">28-31</a>). Jonathan continued the struggle against Syria for three years with a small band of guerrillas. But the Syrians were busy with an internal struggle for political power, and so, in 157 <span class="era">BC</span>, made peace with him. The political machinations in Syria worked to Jonathan’s advantage, and five years later he became high priest in Jerusalem and administrator of Judea (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.1-11">10:1-11</a>). Under his management, Jewish territory and power increased. This occurred partly because Jonathan was able to play the Syrian political rivals against one another. One of these was Tryphon, a pretender to the Syrian throne who saw that his influence was threatened by Jonathan’s power. So in 143 <span class="era">BC</span> he decided to overthrow the Jewish leader. Jonathan was taken prisoner by Tryphon through treachery and eventually killed, leaving his brother Simon to lead the Jews (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.12.1-13.53">1 Macc 12–13</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JOPPA</p>
<p class="fl">City about 35 miles (56.3 kilometers) northwest of Jerusalem that served as Jerusalem’s seaport. Joppa was built on a rocky hill about 116 feet (35.4 meters) high, with a cape projecting beyond the coastline into the sea, and was the only natural harbor on the Mediterranean coast between Egypt and the OT town of Acco. Some 300 to 400 feet (91.4 to 121.9 meters) offshore a series of reefs formed a breakwater so that entrance into the harbor was gained from the north. It is possible that the harbor was larger and better protected in biblical times than it is today. The biblical city was well supplied with water, and the land surrounding it was quite fertile.</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="AerialViewOfJoppa"/>
<p>Joppa first appears in ancient records in the Egyptian list of Palestinian cities captured by Thutmose III (1490–1432 <span class="era">BC</span>). During the Amarna period, it was ruled by a local prince in alliance with Jerusalem. One source from this period describes its beautiful gardens and the craftsmanship of its workers in metal, leather, and wood. When Palestine was divided among the 12 tribes, Joppa was assigned to Dan (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.46">Jos 19:46</a>; <span class="sc">kjv</span> “Japho”). It was soon taken by the Philistines, who made it one of their seaports. David’s conquest of the Philistines restored Joppa to Israel, and during Solomon’s reign, it became a major port serving Jerusalem. Cedar logs were floated from Lebanon to Joppa and then transported to Jerusalem for use in building the temple (<a href="?bref=2Chr.2.16">2 Chr 2:16</a>).</p>
<p>Joppa was the seaport to which Jonah fled in an attempt to avoid preaching to Nineveh (<a href="?bref=Jon.1.3">Jon 1:3</a>); there, hoping to escape his responsibility, he boarded a ship bound for Tarshish. When Tiglath-pileser III invaded Philistia in 743 <span class="era">BC</span>, Joppa probably was one of the Philistine cities that fell to him. Sennacherib, in his campaign of 701 <span class="era">BC</span>, lists Joppa as one of the cities he occupied. Subsequent to that, little is known of it until the time of Ezra, when once again cedar logs from Lebanon were floated to Joppa and taken to Jerusalem for the rebuilding of the temple (<a href="?bref=Ezra.3.7">Ezr 3:7</a>). During the fourth century <span class="era">BC</span>, Eshmunazar of Sidon controlled the city. When Sidon revolted against Persia and was destroyed by Artaxerxes III, Joppa apparently became a free city. Alexander the Great changed its name from Japho (its OT name) to Joppa and established a mint there, making it a city of some importance in the Greek Empire. Following Alexander’s death, his successors fought over the city several times. It was ruled by Egypt from 301 <span class="era">BC</span> until 197 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Antiochus III made it a part of the Seleucid kingdom.</p>
<p>During the Maccabean period, Joppa had varied experiences. When Antiochus IV Epiphanes moved toward Jerusalem in 168 <span class="era">BC</span> to enforce his program of Hellenization, he landed his troops at Joppa. In 164 <span class="era">BC</span>, because of the success of Judas Maccabeus against the Seleucids, non-Jewish citizens drowned about 200 Jews. Judas retaliated by burning the harbor installations and the boats anchored there but was unable to conquer the city itself (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=2Macc.12.3-9">2 Macc 12:3-9</a>). In 147 <span class="era">BC</span> Jonathan and Simon defeated Appollonius Taos, the Syrian general, and occupied Joppa for Alexander I Epiphanes, a contender for the Syrian throne (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.10.74-86">1 Macc 10:74-86</a>). Through a series of political moves in the next few years Simon was able to fortify the city, expel the Greek inhabitants, and firmly establish Joppa as a Jewish city. During Pompey’s Roman occupation, Joppa was declared a free city; it was returned to the Jews by Julius Caesar (47 <span class="era">BC</span>); and it was captured by Herod the Great in 37 <span class="era">BC</span>. Hated by the residents of Joppa, Herod built a new port at Caesarea, about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) north of Joppa. By the time of Jesus’ birth, Joppa was under the rule of Caesarea in the province of Syria (Josephus’s <span class="ital">Antiquities</span> 17.13.2-4).</p>
<p>A Christian congregation appeared quite early in Joppa. Among the disciples living there were Dorcas, whom Peter raised from death (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.36-41">Acts 9:36-41</a>), and Simon the tanner (v <a href="?bref=Acts.9.43">43</a>). From Joppa, Peter was called to Caesarea to present the gospel to the Roman centurion Cornelius (<a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10:1-48</a>).</p>
<p>Joppa was a primary center of revolt against the Romans. It was destroyed by Vespasian in <span class="era">AD</span> 68 and replaced with a Roman army camp. It was later rebuilt, and is known today as Jaffa, a suburb of Tel Aviv.</p>

  <title>Jordan River</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JORDAN RIVER</p>
<p class="fl">River lying in the bottom of a great canyon called the Jordan Rift, an elongated depression stretching from lower southwest Asia Minor (Syria) to the Gulf of Aqaba. The rift was once filled by the Lisan Lake, but significant geologic activity caused it to recede, and the result was the formation of three separate aqueous bodies: the Huleh Lake, the Sea of Galilee, and the Dead Sea. To this day each of these are fed by the Jordan River, the stream whose name in Hebrew means “the descender.”</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="HeadwatersOfTheJordanRiver"/>
<p class="h2" id="Sources">Sources</p>
<p class="fl">Originating at the northern end of the Huleh Basin, the river comprises four separate streams: Nahr Bereighith, Nahr Hasbani, Nahr el-Liddani, and Nahr Baniyas. In the northwest corner of the Huleh Valley the Bereighith emerges within the area of Merj Ayoun, flowing from a spring located on a modest knoll west of Mt Hermon. Slightly to the east is the Hasbani, a stream that descends from a spring 1,700 feet (518.2 meters) above sea level and follows a course of about 24 miles (38.6 kilometers). These two smaller streams merge less than a mile above their confluence with the el-Liddani and the Baniyas. The el-Liddani, lying between the Nahr Hasbani and the Nahr Baniyas, is located near Tel el-Qadi (the biblical city of Dan). The most powerful stream of the four; it is fed by ‘Ain Leddan, a spring that is nestled among thick underbrush and is fed by the melting snows off Mt Hermon. Flowing quickly and briefly, the el-Liddani rushes to meet the Nahr Baniyas, the last of the four streams. In the northeast corner of the Huleh Valley, at the NT site of Caesarea Philippi, the Baniyas originates from a cave approximately 1,100 feet (335 meters) above sea level and follows a steep descent to its confluence with the others. These four streams, making up the Jordan River, then flow together along a southerly course of 10 miles (16 kilometers) before entering Huleh Lake.</p>
<p class="h2" id="CourseandCharacteroftheRiver">Course and Character of the River</p>
<p class="fl">The course of the Jordan follows a north-south route through the Great Rift, descending gradually from the Huleh Lake (7 feet, or 2 meters, above sea level) to the Dead Sea (1,274 feet, or 388 meters, below sea level). From the Huleh Lake the river follows a 20-mile (32.2-kilometer) course, passing through the basaltic lip that forms the southern dam of the Huleh Basin (Rosh Pinnah Sill) and descends quickly to the Sea of Galilee (685 feet, or 209 meters, below sea level). To the south lies the Dead Sea at a distance of approximately 65 miles (105 kilometers). The river that connects these two seas, however, travels a circuitous route of 200 miles (322 kilometers), following a snakelike riverbed cut through the Ghor, the canyon floor.</p>
<p>The Jordan has many tributaries, not all of which are perennial. If there is no consistent water source, such as a spring at the head of the riverbed, then these V-shaped watercourses remain dry until a seasonal deluge. When the rain comes, these dry, narrow courses are filled with fast-paced streams that flow off the sides of the canyon into the Jordan River. North of the Sea of Galilee four major systems feed the fluvial system in the Huleh Basin: Nahr Dishon and Nahr Hazor on the west, and Nahr Shuah and Nahr Gilbon on the east. Between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea are the following major tributary systems: on the east—Yarmuq, ‘Arab, Tayibeh, Ziqlab, Jurm, Yabis, Kufrinjia, Rajib, Zarqa, Nimrin, Abu Gharuba; on the west—Fejjas, Bireh, Jalub, Malih, Far’ah, Aujah, el-Qelt.</p>
<p>The character of the Ghor varies from north to south as the canyon floor drops farther below sea level. Just south of the Sea of Galilee arable fields may be cultivated without irrigation, which permits occupation and settlement. South of this and farther below sea level, beyond the narrowest constriction of the canyon at Ghor el-Wahadina, the terrain and climate change. Since the floor now consistently approaches 1,000 feet (305 meters) below sea level, the climatic conditions approximate that of the desert. In this dry and desolate region, the river and its immediate environs now assume a more prominent role, becoming a lifeline to the flora and the fauna that hug its banks. Its course and character are more easily discerned as it has become a veritable stream in the desert. The dense foliage on the banks of the Jordan is still today a wildlife haunt as it was in antiquity, the low-lying shrubs and the tamarisk alike providing thick ground cover. This lower section of the canyon, called the Zor, is 150 feet (45.7 meters) below the Ghor and separated by the <span class="ital">qattara</span> (a sedimentary deposit of grayish-white marls and clays that form precipitous and barren slopes) from the canyon floor above. Generally inaccessible and extremely dangerous, the Zor and <span class="ital">qattara</span> form a natural barrier between Cis-Jordan (west) and Transjordan (east). Thus, trade, settlement, and travel were necessarily affected by the various topographical features that characterize this area.</p>
<p class="h2" id="BiblicalEvents">Biblical Events</p>
<p class="fl">The OT Israelites passed across the Jordan upon entry into the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.14-17">Jos 3:14-17</a>). The fords of the Jordan were the sites of conflict in the war of Jephthah and the Gileadites against the Ephraimites (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-6">Jgs 12:1-6</a>). The prophet Elijah sought refuge from Ahab king of Israel by the brook of Kerith east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.17.1-5">1 Kgs 17:1-5</a>). Elijah was translated up to heaven in a whirlwind after having crossed the Jordan with Elisha on dry ground (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.2.6-12">2 Kgs 2:6-12</a>). Naaman, the Syrian general, bathed in the Jordan at the command of Elisha and his leprosy was healed (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.8-14">5:8-14</a>). Elisha made the ax head float here (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.6.1-7">2 Kgs 6:1-7</a>). In the NT, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist in the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Matt.3.13-17">Mt 3:13-17</a>). Peter confessed that Jesus was the “Christ, the Son of the living God” at Caesarea Philippi—located on one of the sources of the Jordan, Nahr Baniyas (<a href="?bref=Matt.16.13-20">16:13-20</a>). Jesus healed two blind men at Jericho, which is near the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.29-34">20:29-34</a>) and visited with Zacchaeus in that same city (<a href="?bref=Luke.19.1-10">Lk 19:1-10</a>).</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">JOSEPH</p>
<p class="list">1. Jacob’s 11th son and the firstborn son of Rachel. Rachel named the boy Joseph, meaning “may he add,” expressing her desire that God would give her another son (<a href="?bref=Gen.30.24">Gn 30:24</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Nothing more is said about Joseph until, at the age of 17, he is seen tending his father’s flocks with his brothers (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.2">Gn 37:2</a>). Joseph was the favorite of his father, since he was the son of his old age (v <a href="?bref=Gen.37.3">3</a>) and the firstborn son of his favorite wife. Because of this, his brothers hated Joseph. This envy was magnified when Jacob gave Joseph a ground-length, long-sleeved, multicolored robe (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.37.3-4">3-4</a>). (This type of garment is illustrated by the paintings in the Asiatic tombs of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan and of the nobles at Gurneh, near Luxor.) The animosity of his brothers increased still more when Joseph revealed to them his dreams of dominion over them (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.37.5-11">5-11</a>). Subsequently, when Joseph was sent to check on his brothers and the flocks near Shechem, his brothers sold him to a caravan of traders going down to Egypt (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.37.25-28">25-28</a>). His brothers then took his robe, dipped it in goat’s blood, and brought it to Jacob, who concluded that Joseph had been killed by wild animals (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.37.31-33">31-33</a>); Jacob was overwhelmed with grief (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.37.34-35">34-35</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">In Egypt, Joseph was sold to Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of the guard (<a href="?bref=Gen.37.36">Gn 37:36</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.39.1">39:1</a>), who eventually put Joseph in charge of his entire household. However, trouble arose from Potiphar’s wife, who was attracted to the young Hebrew and tried to seduce him (<a href="?bref=Gen.39.6-10">39:6-10</a>). He steadfastly resisted her advances, protesting that to comply with her wishes would be a disservice to his master and a sin against God (v <a href="?bref=Gen.39.9">9</a>). One day she seized his garment, but he left the garment behind and fled. Potiphar’s wife accused Joseph of attempted rape; her report was believed, and Joseph was incarcerated in the king’s prison (v <a href="?bref=Gen.39.20">20</a>), where Pharaoh’s butler and baker were also confined. While in prison, Joseph, with the Lord’s help, interpreted these men’s troublesome dreams. As Joseph had foretold, the baker was executed and the butler was restored to royal favor (ch <a href="?bref=Gen.40.1-23">40</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Two years later Pharaoh had two dreams that his magicians and wise men could not interpret. The butler, remembering Joseph, had him summoned from prison. God revealed to Joseph that the dreams foretold seven years of abundance, followed by seven years of famine (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.25-36">Gn 41:25-36</a>). Pharaoh, impressed with Joseph’s interpretation, made him ruler of Egypt, second only to himself (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.41.39-44">39-44</a>). Joseph was given a new name, Zaphenath-paneah, and a wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera (v <a href="?bref=Gen.41.45">45</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Joseph was 30 years old when he became ruler of Egypt. During the seven years of prosperity, he gathered the good supplies for the seven years of famine to come (<a href="?bref=Gen.41.53-56">Gn 41:53-56</a>). When the famine eventually became severe in Palestine, Jacob sent all his sons, except Benjamin, his youngest son, to Egypt to purchase grain. Appearing before Joseph in Egypt, they did not recognize him. But he knew them and remembered his dreams of years before (<a href="?bref=Gen.42.8-9">42:8-9</a>). After listening to the report of their family, he accused them of being spies (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.42.9-14">9-14</a>) and insisted that they leave one of their brothers as hostage and return with Benjamin to verify the truthfulness of their report (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.42.19-20">19-20</a>). Thus Simeon was bound and left in Egypt (v <a href="?bref=Gen.42.24">24</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">After the famine worsened in Palestine, Jacob asked his sons to go back to Egypt to buy more grain (<a href="?bref=Gen.43.1-2">Gn 43:1-2</a>); reluctantly agreeing to the conditions that the Egyptian administrator had placed on them, Jacob allowed Benjamin to go with them (vv <a href="?bref=Gen.43.11-13">11-13</a>). When they arrived in Egypt, they were taken to Joseph’s house, where Simeon was restored to them (v <a href="?bref=Gen.43.23">23</a>) and a meal was prepared for them (v <a href="?bref=Gen.43.33">33</a>). Joseph at last disclosed his identity and declared that God had sent him before them to preserve their lives (<a href="?bref=Gen.45.4-8">45:4-8</a>). Arrangements were then made to send for Jacob; wagons were provided, along with provisions for the journey (v <a href="?bref=Gen.45.21">21</a>). When Jacob came to Goshen in the Nile Delta, Joseph went out to meet him, and another great reunion took place (<a href="?bref=Gen.46.28-29">46:28-29</a>). He also presented his father and brothers to Pharaoh, who let them live in the land of Goshen (<a href="?bref=Gen.47.6">47:6</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Upon learning that his father was ill, Joseph took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to him for his blessing. He presented the sons so that the older would be at Jacob’s right hand and the younger at his left in order that Manasseh would receive the blessing of the firstborn. Jacob, however, crossed his hands and with his right hand on Ephraim gave him the greater blessing (<a href="?bref=Gen.48.14-20">Gn 48:14-20</a>). He also gave to Joseph the land that he had taken from the Amorites (v <a href="?bref=Gen.48.22">22</a>). At Jacob’s death, Joseph made the funeral arrangements; and after the customary funerary practices were carried out, a great funeral procession went to Canaan, where Jacob was buried by his sons in the cave of Machpelah near Hebron (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.1-12">50:1-12</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Joseph was 110 years old, he called his brothers and told them that he was about to die. He made them take an oath that when they returned to Canaan they would take his bones with them. So he died, was embalmed, and was placed in a coffin in Egypt (<a href="?bref=Gen.50.26">Gn 50:26</a>). Many years later, during the exodus, Moses took the bones of Joseph with him from Egypt (<a href="?bref=Exod.13.19">Ex 13:19</a>). Joseph’s remains were eventually interred at Shechem in the parcel of land that Jacob had bought from Hamor, the father of Shechem (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.18-20">Gn 33:18-20</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>). <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=IsraelHistoryof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Israel, History of</a>; <a href="?item=PatriarchsPeriodofthe_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Patriarchs, Period of the</a>.</p>

<p class="list">6. Descendant of David (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.16">Mt 1:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.23">Lk 3:23</a>) and the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Joseph was betrothed to Mary, a young woman of the city of Nazareth. Mary had learned from the angel Gabriel that she was to bear the Son of God, whom she was to name Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.31">Lk 1:31</a>) and that this conception was to be a work of the Holy Spirit (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">35</a>). Joseph was not aware of this, so when he learned that Mary was pregnant, he decided to divorce her quietly, for he was a just man and did not want to humiliate her publicly (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.19">Mt 1:19</a>). An angel subsequently appeared to him in a dream to tell him what was happening (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">Mt 1:21</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Is 7:14</a>). The text of Matthew makes it clear that there was no sexual union between Joseph and Mary until after Jesus was born (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18,25">Mt 1:18, 25</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Luke.1.34-37">Lk 1:34-37</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Caesar Augustus issued a decree that everyone had to register in his native city for purposes of taxation, Joseph and Mary returned to Bethlehem, where Jesus was subsequently born (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.1-6">Lk 2:1-6</a>). Later, Joseph and Mary took the infant Jesus to the temple to present him to the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Luke.2.22,33">22, 33</a>). After the visit of the wise men, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and instructed him to take Jesus and Mary to Egypt to protect the child from King Herod (<a href="?bref=Matt.2.13">Mt 2:13</a>). Upon the death of Herod, an angel similarly advised him to return to Israel, so the family went to live in Nazareth. The last recorded event that involves Joseph is the incident of Jesus at the temple at age 12 (<a href="?bref=Luke.2.41-51">Lk 2:41-51</a>). Joseph is not mentioned by name, but Mary told Jesus that she and his father had been looking for him anxiously.</p>
<p class="list-text">Jesus was identified by people around Nazareth as “Joseph’s son” (<a href="?bref=Luke.4.22">Lk 4:22</a>; <a href="?bref=John.1.45">Jn 1:45</a>; <a href="?bref=John.6.42">6:42</a>). It is only through references identifying Jesus that we learn of Joseph’s trade. Twice Jesus is referred to as “the carpenter’s son” (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>). Joseph was not a carpenter in our sense of the word, for houses were built mostly of stone and earth. He was a woodworker or artificer in wood, and probably most of his work was with furniture and agricultural implements.</p>
<p class="list-text">During the ministry of Jesus, it was his mother and his brothers who came to look for him (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.46-50">Mt 12:46-50</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.31-35">Mk 3:31-35</a>), so it is assumed that by this time Joseph was dead. Joseph was most likely the father of James, Joseph, Simon, Judas, and unnamed sisters (<a href="?bref=Matt.13.55">Mt 13:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.6.3">Mk 6:3</a>).</p>

He was a good and righteous man and did not go along with the decision to crucify Jesus (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.50-51">Lk 23:50-51</a>). Joseph had been a secret follower of Jesus because he was afraid of the Jews (<a href="?bref=John.19.38">Jn 19:38</a>), but after the Crucifixion he took courage and went to Pilate to ask for Jesus’ body. He and Nicodemus took the body, treated it with spices, and wrapped it in linen cloths, according to the Jewish burial customs. In a nearby garden was Joseph’s own new rock-cut tomb in which no one had ever been buried. Here they placed Jesus and sealed the tomb with a large stone.</p>

<p class="h1">JOSEPHUS*, Flavius</p>
<p class="fl">Jewish military officer and historian (<span class="era">AD</span> 37–c. 100).</p>
<p>Josephus was born into an aristocratic priestly family in Jerusalem. Through his mother he was related to the Hasmoneans. In his youth he was noted for his memory and ease in learning. As a teenager he attached himself to a member of an ascetic sect. Then he became a Pharisee.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 64 Josephus was a member of an official party sent to Rome to secure the release of some priests. The empire’s capital made an indelible impression on him. After his return to Jerusalem, the first Jewish revolt erupted (<span class="era">AD</span> 66). The Sanhedrin (the Jewish governing council) appointed Josephus commander of Galilee. He organized the province well but incurred the opposition of John of Gischala, Galilee’s former leader. Conflict between the two men’s forces continued until the arrival of the Roman general Vespasian in the spring of 67.</p>
<p>Josephus and the Galileans entrenched themselves at Jotapata. After a siege of six weeks, the Roman army captured and destroyed the city, but Josephus and 40 soldiers escaped to a cave. Josephus, whose life was assured by the Romans through a friend’s intervention, persuaded his fellow soldiers to kill each other rather than be captured. When only he and one other remained alive, he surrendered to the Romans.</p>
<p>When Josephus appeared before Vespasian and prophesied that Vespasian would become emperor, his life was spared. Nonetheless, Josephus was held prisoner. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in the year 69 and Josephus was set free. He then adopted Vespasian’s family name, Flavius. In 70, when Vespasian’s son Titus marched on Jerusalem, Josephus accompanied him. Several times Josephus tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Jews to surrender.</p>
<p>After Titus’s destruction of Jerusalem, Josephus went to Rome, where Vespasian favored him with Roman citizenship and a pension. Free to write, Josephus produced a number of books of considerable historical value. In <span class="ital">The Jewish War</span> (<span class="era">AD</span> 77–78) Josephus described the Roman-Jewish conflict from the time of Antiochus Ephiphanes to slightly beyond the fall of Jerusalem. Perhaps Josephus’s greatest work was <span class="ital">Antiquities of the Jews</span> (c. 94). A 20-volume work designed to glorify the Jews and eliminate gentile hostility, it traces Jewish history from the Creation to the outbreak of war with Rome in 66. His autobiography, <span class="ital">Life,</span> was primarily a vindication of his activities as governor of Galilee. Josephus wrote <span class="ital">Against Apion</span> to counteract claims of anti-Semites; in this work he used logical arguments as well as derision.</p>
<p>As a historian, Josephus sometimes distorted facts in favor of his patrons. However, he was witness to many of the events about which he wrote. His works illumine the period in which the church came into existence, especially concerning the religion, politics, geography, and prominent persons of the early Christian era. Of particular interest to Christians are his references to John the Baptist, Jesus, and James the Just (Jesus’ brother).</p>

<p class="list-text">Early in the exodus, Joshua was sent by Moses to fight against the Amalekites (<a href="?bref=Exod.17.8-15">Ex 17:8-15</a>). Joshua defeated Amalek, and Moses wrote of the event and built an altar that he called “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Is My Banner” (v <a href="?bref=Exod.17.15">15</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Moses sent 12 men from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land of Canaan, Joshua represented the tribe of Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Num.13.8">Nm 13:8</a>). At that time Joshua was called Hoshea, but Moses changed his name to Joshua (vv <a href="?bref=Num.13.8,16">8, 16</a>). Joshua and Caleb were the only two spies to bring back an affirmative report concerning an Israelite invasion of the land (<a href="?bref=Num.14.6-9">14:6-9</a>). Consequently, of all the adult Israelite males to leave Egypt in the exodus, only these two crossed the Jordan River and entered the Promised Land (v <a href="?bref=Num.14.30">30</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When the Lord announced to Moses his impending death, Moses asked about his successor, and the Lord appointed Joshua to that position (<a href="?bref=Num.27.12-23">Nm 27:12-23</a>). After the death of Moses on Mt Nebo, Joshua’s leadership was confirmed (<a href="?bref=Num.34.17">34:17</a>), and the Lord told Joshua to go over the Jordan and take the land (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-2">Jos 1:1-2</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">From the Transjordan, Joshua sent two men across the river to reconnoiter Jericho (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.2.1-24">2</a>). In Jericho they were concealed by Rahab and later safely made their way back to Joshua to report that the people of the land were fainthearted because of the Israelites (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.2.23-24">23-24</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Israel had crossed the river, the Lord instructed Joshua to set up a circle of 12 stones at Gilgal to commemorate this passage (<a href="?bref=Josh.4.1-7">Jos 4:1-7</a>). The Lord then commanded all of the males who had been born during the exodus to be circumcised (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.2-9">5:2-9</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">While camped at Gilgal, near Jericho, Joshua was confronted by a man with a drawn sword. When Joshua challenged the man, he learned that it was the Lord, who told him to remove his shoes, for the ground was holy (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.13-15">Jos 5:13-15</a>). The Lord gave Joshua directions for the destruction of Jericho; these were followed explicitly and the city fell (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-27">6</a>). The attack on Ai ended in temporary defeat, until the matter of Achan’s sin was discovered and judged (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.10-26">7:10-26</a>). Then Ai was taken and destroyed.</p>
<p class="list-text">Joshua built an altar on Mt Ebal (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-32">Jos 8:30-32</a>), and the blessings and curses were read, as commanded by God through Moses (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.33-35">Jos 8:33-35</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-28.68">Dt 27–28</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Because the Israelites failed to ask direction from the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.14">Jos 9:14</a>), Joshua was tricked into making a covenant of peace with the Hivites of Gibeon. Joshua then reduced them to doing menial tasks in Israel (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.9.21-27">21-27</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The kings of the various Canaanite cities allied themselves against the Israelite threat (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-2">Jos 9:1-2</a>) and a league of five Amorite cities (Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon) attacked Gibeon (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-5">10:1-5</a>). The Gibeonites appealed to Joshua for help; he responded quickly against this Amorite confederation and routed the Amorite forces. It was on this occasion that Joshua commanded the sun and the moon to stand still so that Israel could have more time to defeat these adversaries (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.10.12-14">12-14</a>). This victory was followed by a series of successful attacks on enemy towns (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.10.28-43">28-43</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">A northern alliance headed by Jabin, king of Hazor, was the next opposition (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-5">Jos 11:1-5</a>). The Lord assured Joshua of success, and the city of Hazor was taken and destroyed by fire (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.11.6-15">6-15</a>). <a href="?bref=Josh.11.23">Joshua 11:23</a> summarizes the conquest of the land, and chapter <a href="?bref=Josh.12.1-24">12</a> enumerates the kings who were conquered.</p>
<p class="list-text">Joshua was now old, and the Lord told him that much land remained to be possessed. These territories are listed, but the Lord directed Joshua to proceed with the division of the land among the nine and a half tribes (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.7">Jos 13:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.13.8-18.28">13:8–18:28</a>). Joshua himself was given the city he asked for, Timnath-serah, in the hill country of Ephraim, which he rebuilt and settled (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.49-50">19:49-50</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">The Lord told Joshua to appoint cities of refuge to which a person guilty of manslaughter could flee to escape the avenger of blood (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-9">Jos 20</a>). Then the Levites came to Eleazar the priest and Joshua to request that they be given their cities, as the Lord had commanded through Moses (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-42">21:1-42</a>).</p>

<p class="list-text">In his advanced years Joshua summoned all Israel and solemnly charged them to continue in faithfulness to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-16">Jos 23</a>). Finally, he called all Israel to Shechem, where he gave them his farewell message. He summed up the Lord’s dealings with them from the time of Abraham and again challenged them to serve the Lord, putting before them the well-known choice and decision: “Choose today whom you will serve. . . .

<p class="fl">According to the Talmud, Joshua wrote the book. This ancient tradition is possibly based on the brief statement that Joshua “recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God” (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.26">24:26</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). However, this applies only to the renewal of the covenant (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.24.1-33">24</a>). The issue of authorship is tied up with the dating of the book. Since the book has no unambiguous markers on date and authorship, neither critics nor conservative scholars have been able to come to any agreement on these issues. According to a conservative analysis of Joshua, the book was written between 1375 <span class="era">BC</span> and 1045 <span class="era">BC</span> (premonarchic). The argument is based on the references to the migration of Dan (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.47">19:47</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.18.27-31">Jgs 18:27-31</a>), to Jerusalem as a Jebusite city (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.8,63">Jos 15:8, 63</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.18.16,28">18:16, 28</a>), to Sidon rather than Tyre as the prominent Phoenician city (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.8">11:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.13.4-6">13:4-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.28">19:28</a>), and also on the eyewitness style (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.1,6">5:1, 6</a>—in the MT). But critical scholars have raised issues that they considered could best be resolved by positing a seventh-century <span class="era">BC</span> or even an exilic date.</p>
<p class="h2" id="ProblemsofInterpretation">Problems of Interpretation</p>
<p class="h3">Holy War</p>
<p class="fl">The morality of the Conquest may be explained by the concept of holy war. The holy war motif would explain why Israel was to destroy the indigenous population (<a href="?bref=Deut.7.16">Dt 7:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.16-18">20:16-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.6.21">Jos 6:21</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.24-26">8:24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.10,28-30,35-42">10:10, 28-30, 35-42</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.11">11:11</a>). The justification may lie in the concept that Israel was God’s instrument of judgment on the Canaanite nations. This argument is related to the mention of the wickedness of the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.16">Gn 15:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.2-5,25-26">Dt 7:2-5, 25-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.12.30-31">12:30-31</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.7">Jos 23:7</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.11">Jgs 2:11</a>). However, the canonical narrative of the progression of the Conquest puts the responsibility on the Canaanites. They marched and fought against Israel (<a href="?bref=Num.21.21-35">Nm 21:21-35</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.4-5">Jos 7:4-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.5,16-17">8:5, 16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-2">9:1-2</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-6">10:1-6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-5">11:1-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.11">24:11</a>). Therefore, it could be argued that in the process of war a sincere invitation to make peace was given to the kings (cf. <a href="?bref=Num.21.21-22">Nm 21:21-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.20.10-11">Dt 20:10-11</a>) but was refused. Instead, the kings took the initiative in battle. The responsibility for the destruction of the native population thus lay with the leadership. Yet all this was evidence of God’s working in human affairs, which the Bible simply states, “For it was the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had commanded Moses” (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.20">Jos 11:20</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). Even as Pharaoh, whose heart the Lord hardened, was responsible for the plagues in Egypt, so the Canaanite rulers were responsible for the extermination of their populations. The biblical account of the Conquest affirms the mystery of human responsibility and divine sovereignty without explaining it.</p>
<p class="h3">Nature of the Conquest</p>
<p class="fl">Various explanations of the nature of the Conquest have been given. The traditional view of a blitzkrieg type of conquest, which resulted in a complete occupation of the whole land (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.10.40">Jos 10:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-3,16-19">11:1-3, 16-19</a>), does not fit within the whole picture of the book. The book presents a realistic description of the areas that still had to be conquered (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-7">13:1-7</a>) and of the military strength of the indigenous population (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.13.13">13:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.15.63">15:63</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.16.10">16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.12-18">17:12-18</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.19.47">19:47</a>). Moreover, Joshua promised that the Lord would continue to help Israel to occupy the land, as its population and needs developed (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.5">23:5</a>). The occupation of Canaan was in two stages: conquest and gradual occupation (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.23.29-30">Ex 23:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.22">Dt 7:22</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Purpose">Purpose</p>
<p class="fl">The role of the final (canonical) form of the book is to present Joshua’s obedience to the law of Moses. Victory and defeat are illustrations of obedience and disobedience. Of course, there is tension in this because the descriptions of the Conquest are complete and yet incomplete. The tension is a dynamic device to show that the Conquest and enjoyment of the land depend wholly on obedience. The period of Joshua is viewed as a paradigm of obedient Israel. Thus, a holistic reading of the book presents an appeal to covenant loyalty directed to future generations.</p>

<p class="h3">Conquest of the Land, <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-12.24">1:1–12:24</a></p>
<p class="h4">The Lord’s Commission of Joshua, <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-9">1:1-9</a></p>
<p class="fl">With the death of Moses (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.1">Jos 1:1</a>), the Lord himself confirms Moses’ ordination of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Deut.34.9">Dt 34:9</a>). He charges him with leadership in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.2-3">Jos 1:2-3</a>), defines the geographical boundaries of the land (v <a href="?bref=Josh.1.4">4</a>), encourages him with his continued presence (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.1.5,9">5, 9</a>), and expects him to devoutly follow in “the law of Moses” (i.e., the law given in Dt; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.31.9,24-26">Dt 31:9, 24-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.6">Jos 23:6</a>), so that he may succeed in his mission (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.7-8">1:7-8</a>). The original mission, as well as the ministry of Moses, find their continuity in Joshua.</p>
<p class="h4">Crossing the Jordan, <a href="?bref=Josh.1.10-5.12">1:10–5:12</a></p>
<p class="fl">The first stage calls for the preparation of Israel. As their leader, Joshua must demonstrate to the people that he follows in the footsteps of Moses. He does this by reminding the Transjordan tribes to demonstrate loyalty to the command of Moses by joining with the other tribes in the conquest of Canaan (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.13-15">1:13-15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.32.20-27">Nm 32:20-27</a>). They submitted to Joshua’s authority as to Moses’ (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.16-18">Jos 1:16-18</a>). He demonstrates his military leadership in sending the two spies to Jericho (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.2.1-24">2</a>). His authority is accepted by priests (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.6">3:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.4.10">4:10</a>) and people (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.5-9">3:5-9</a>) as they cross the Jordan. The crossing of the Jordan marks the public recognition of Joshua as a leader like Moses (<a href="?bref=Josh.4.14">4:14</a>).</p>
<p>The account of the crossing marks an important transition from the era of the exodus/wilderness to the era of the Conquest. On the one hand, the story of Rahab illustrates how the Canaanites had heard about the Lord’s mighty acts (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.10-11">2:10-11</a>) and reacted with great fear (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.15.15">Ex 15:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.23.27-28">23:27-28</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.2.25">Dt 2:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.23">7:23</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.25">11:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.32.30">32:30</a>). Rahab’s expression of faith in Israel’s God (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.11">2:11</a>) anticipates the inclusion of the Gentiles in the covenant community as promised to the patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.3">Gn 12:3</a>). By faith Rahab was included in the covenant and was richly rewarded by the inclusion of her name in the lineage of Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.5">Mt 1:5</a>).</p>
<p>The Israelites crossed the Jordan with the knowledge that the fear of God had come on the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Josh.2.24">Jos 2:24</a>). However, they were also instructed to show their reverence for the Lord by keeping a safe distance between themselves and the ark of the covenant (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.4">3:4</a>) and by consecrating themselves (v <a href="?bref=Josh.3.5">5</a>). The “living God” was among them and required holiness and reverence from his people (v <a href="?bref=Josh.3.10">10</a>). He, in turn, would demonstrate his loyalty in the marvelous passage through the Jordan River (v <a href="?bref=Josh.3.13">13</a>) and in the conquest of the land (<a href="?bref=Josh.3.10">3:10</a>). After the tribes had crossed the river (<a href="?bref=Josh.4.1">4:1</a>), each leader of the 12 tribes took up a stone out of the dried-up riverbed and set up a memorial at Gilgal (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.4.1-9,20">1-9, 20</a>). Thus, Israel was to remember that the stones, taken from the place where the priests who carried the ark had stood, were reminders of the majestic presence of God. Future generations who were to hear this report (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.4.21-24">21-24</a>) were hereby encouraged because the fear of God would fall on all the peoples of the land (v <a href="?bref=Josh.4.24">24</a>).</p>
<p>The consecration before the conquest of Jericho is also symbolized by the act of circumcision (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.1-9">5:1-9</a>) and by the celebration of the Passover (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.5.10-12">10-12</a>). The events are not necessarily chronologically related but were selected as examples of Israel’s responsiveness to Joshua’s ministry. Moses’ appeal to the new generation had its effect (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.4.4-14">Dt 4:4-14</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.6.1-5">6:1-5</a>). The new generation served the Lord as long as Joshua and the elders were alive (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.31">Jos 24:31</a>). Physical circumcision, neglected during the wilderness journey (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.5">5:5</a>) due to unbelief, was a sign of spiritual responsiveness. The responsive nation received the external sign of the covenant with the anticipation that the Lord of the covenant would bless his people in giving them victory and the fruit of the land. Their reproach was rolled away (v <a href="?bref=Josh.5.9">9</a>). The covenant continuity is also brought out in the brief mention of the Passover celebration. The newness is their eating the fruit of the land. With the taste of the food of Canaan, the manna stopped. The desert experience was over. A new era was ushered in with their presence in the Promised Land (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.5.11-12">11-12</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Conquest of Jericho, <a href="?bref=Josh.5.13-6.27">5:13–6:27</a></p>
<p class="fl">The victory is the Lord’s. This is the message with which the battle of Jericho begins. The holy God who appeared to Moses in the burning bush (<a href="?bref=Exod.3.2-4.17">Ex 3:2–4:17</a>) appeared to Joshua as the commander of the Lord’s army (<a href="?bref=Josh.5.14-15">Jos 5:14-15</a>) with a message from the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.2">6:2</a>). The city of Jericho will fall without a siege and ensuing battle. Israel’s response to Jericho’s preparedness for war (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.24.11">24:11</a>) was strange, but the presence of the ark and the blowing of the trumpets symbolized that the Lord would fight for Israel, even as he had promised. However, Israel could not take any of the spoil. Because Yahweh fought for Israel, everything was to be devoted to him (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.17">6:17</a>). The Lord honored the vow to Rahab, made by the spies, so that she and her family were kept alive (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.6.17,25">17, 25</a>), but they were temporarily placed outside the camp (v <a href="?bref=Josh.6.23">23</a>). The valuable metals were placed into the treasury (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.6.19, 24">19, 24</a>), whereas everything else was burned by fire (v <a href="?bref=Josh.6.24">24</a>). Nothing was to be taken for personal gain; otherwise God’s judgment would rest on Israel (v <a href="?bref=Josh.6.18">18</a>). In order to emphasize God’s absolute ownership of Jericho, Joshua put a curse on anyone who would attempt to rebuild the city (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.26">6:26</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=1Kgs.16.34">1 Kgs 16:34</a>). The rumors of Jericho’s destruction spread, and the peoples of Canaan knew that the Lord was with Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.27">Jos 6:27</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.1.5,9">1:5, 9</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Tragedy and Triumph at Ai, <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-8.29">7:1–8:29</a></p>
<p class="fl">Victory was short-lived because Achan defied God’s “ban,” took some of the objects, hid them in the ground under his tent (<a href="?bref=Josh.7.21">7:21</a>), and brought God’s wrath on all of Israel (v <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1">1</a>). Israel was stunned by their defeat at Ai (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.7.2-5">2-5</a>). Joshua and the elders responded to the disaster by fasting and lamenting (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.7.6-9">6-9</a>). What a contrast between the reports of victory spread through the land and the anguished cry of God’s servant, fearful that the Canaanites would amass strength and wipe out Israel (v <a href="?bref=Josh.7.9">9</a>). Only after the people had consecrated themselves (v <a href="?bref=Josh.7.13">13</a>) and Achan was exposed and his memory removed (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.7.25-26">25b-26</a>) could they renew the attack on Ai with the encouraging promise of God’s presence and victory (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.1-2">8:1-2</a>). Ai, too, was taken (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.8.3-19">3-19</a>) and the population execrated (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.8.20-26">20-26</a>), but Israel enjoyed the spoils by direct permission from the Lord (v <a href="?bref=Josh.8.27">27</a>). The ruins of Ai, the pile of stones covering the body of Ai’s king (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.8.28-29">28-29</a>), and the heap of rocks over Achan’s body were sobering reminders to Israel that God’s faithfulness requires absolute loyalty from his people.</p>
<p class="h4">Renewal of the Covenant, <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-35">8:30-35</a></p>
<p class="fl">Joshua led Israel in a ceremonial covenant renewal at Shechem, as Moses had instructed (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.31">Jos 8:31</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.11.29">Dt 11:29</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.27.1-26">27</a>). Joshua took care in the proper preparation of the altar (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.20.25">Ex 20:25</a>) on which dedicatory and communal offerings were presented. He copied the law as a symbol of his royal leadership and his devotion to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.32">Jos 8:32</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.17.18">Dt 17:18</a>). All Israel (officers and people, aliens and native-born Israelites) together presented themselves for the reading of the blessings and the curses (<a href="?bref=Josh.8.33-35">Jos 8:33-35</a>). The whole book of Deuteronomy (i.e., “the Book of the Law,” cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.31.26">Dt 31:26</a>) was read in their presence. Half the tribes stood on Mt Gerizim and said “Amen” to the blessings, and the other six stood on Mt Ebal, saying “Amen” to the curses (cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.27.9-26">Dt 27:9-26</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Covenant with the Gibeonites, <a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-27">9:1-27</a></p>
<p class="fl">The rumors of God’s mighty acts had brought fear on the Canaanite kings (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.2.8-11,24">Jos 2:8-11, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.5.1">5:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.6.27">6:27</a>). The first defeat at Ai had given them a ray of hope that Israel could be put down. Rather than submit themselves to Israel and suffer from humiliation as servants of Israel, they joined forces against Joshua and Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.1-2">9:1-2</a>).</p>
<p>The Hivites from Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.7,17">9:7, 17</a>) did not join with their fellow Canaanites. Instead, they developed an intricate plan to deceive Israel and to sue for full treaty status. The purpose of the treaty was that of friendship (namely, “peace”), promising each other to be of mutual assistance in case of attack. The concern was with the preservation of life (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.9.15,24">15, 24</a>). Their deception included a ruse about the great distance they had traveled (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.9.11-14">11-14</a>) and a false report of Israel’s victories in Transjordan with no mention of their crossing the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.9.9-10">9:9-10</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.5.1">5:1</a>). The law permitted the submissive city to subject its population to a type of suzerainty treaty, in which Israel defined the terms and expected the subjugated populace to serve as its forced laborers (<a href="?bref=Deut.20.11">Dt 20:11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.28-35">Jgs 1:28-35</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.9.15-21">1 Kgs 9:15-21</a>). However, the treaty permitted the Hivites to maintain their way of life with the advantage of Israel’s military protection.</p>
<p class="h4">The Southern Campaign, <a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-43">10:1-43</a></p>
<p class="fl">The king of Jerusalem, Adoni-zedek, led the cities of Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon in an alliance against Gibeon as a military ploy to take a stand against Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.1-5">Jos 10:1-5</a>). The Gibeonites appealed to Israel for help based on their covenantal relationship (v <a href="?bref=Josh.10.6">6</a>). Joshua led Israel on a 25-mile (40-kilometer) hike through the wilderness from Gilgal up to Gibeon during one night (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.10.7-9">7-9</a>). The Israelite attack surprised the Canaanites, who were already frightened of the Israelites. The camp of the Canaanites was thrown into confusion, and the soldiers fled the hill country via the road of Beth-horon to Azekah and Makkedah (v <a href="?bref=Josh.10.10">10</a>). But while running, they were tormented with large hailstones (v <a href="?bref=Josh.10.11">11</a>). The victory was the Lord’s. Miraculously, Israel could push the Canaanites farther from the hill country because of the long day (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.10.12-14">12-14</a>). The marvel of this day was long remembered in the Book of Jashar (cf. <a href="?bref=2Sam.1.18">2 Sm 1:18</a>), because on it the Lord listened to a man, namely Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.14">Jos 10:14</a>).</p>
<p>The five kings hidden in a cave at Makkedah were discovered, killed, hanged on trees, and buried in the cave (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.16-27">10:16-27</a>). Their foolish attempt to make war on Israel came to a quick end. Since the coalition of large cities had been put down, Joshua led Israel in a rapid campaign of the other southern cities (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.10.29-43">29-43</a>). The region was taken in one campaign with the Lord’s help (v <a href="?bref=Josh.10.42">42</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Northern Campaign, <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-15">11:1-15</a></p>
<p class="fl">The Israelites were again forced into battle, this time by the leadership of Jabin, king of Hazor. Jabin rallied the kings of the northern cities who assembled their troops and horses by the waters of Merom for battle against Israel (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.1-5">11:1-5</a>). The similarity to the southern campaign is a literary way to demonstrate that the kings of the south and north initiated the war and were consequently defeated. So it was with the northern kings, who were routed as far as the region of Sidon in Phoenicia (v <a href="?bref=Josh.11.8">8</a>). Their horses were hamstrung and their chariots burned (v <a href="?bref=Josh.11.9">9</a>), as the Lord had instructed (v <a href="?bref=Josh.11.6">6</a>). Israel was to depend on the Lord (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.20.7">Ps 20:7</a>). Hazor, the great and ancient city, the center of Canaanite power in the north, was completely destroyed (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.10-13">Jos 11:10-13</a>). The burning of Jericho, Ai, and Hazor were exceptions, because Israel had been promised Canaanite houses, wells, and cities (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.10-11">Dt 6:10-11</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.24.13">Jos 24:13</a>). The campaign narrative stresses again the absolute loyalty of Joshua to the Lord and to Moses, the servant of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.9-15">Jos 11:9-15</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Summary of the Campaigns, <a href="?bref=Josh.11.16-12.24">11:16–12:24</a></p>
<p class="fl">Joshua led Israel in victory and rest because of his careful adherence to the Lord’s directions to Moses. Moses had described the land to be conquered in detail (<a href="?bref=Deut.1.7">Dt 1:7</a>), and Joshua took the regions of which Moses had spoken. Though the cities could have sued for a peaceable arrangement under which they would have been forced laborers (<a href="?bref=Deut.20.11">Dt 20:11</a>), none of the cities recognized Israel. In fear they plotted and schemed how to destroy Israel. They were the aggressors. God had hardened their hearts (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.20">Jos 11:20</a>). The theological reason is a mystery, as it was in the case of Pharaoh. But the net result was that Canaan was conquered and the population exterminated, except for the Hivites at Gibeon and their surrounding cities (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.11.19-20">19-20</a>). Even the Anakites, who had brought fear on Israel some 40 years before (<a href="?bref=Num.13.33">Nm 13:33</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.2.10,21">Dt 2:10, 21</a>), were execrated (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.21">Jos 11:21</a>). Yet it is already apparent that not every square mile of land was taken (v <a href="?bref=Josh.11.22">22</a>), even though in a sense the entire land was Israel’s, because major centers of Canaanite resistance had been broken. The tension between fulfillment and complete fulfillment is apparent in these verses.</p>
<p>The listing of defeated kings (ch <a href="?bref=Josh.12.1-24">12</a>) includes the victories over Sihon and Og under Moses’ leadership. Their juxtaposition with the list of kings conquered under Joshua demonstrates the continuity of leadership and purpose—two leaders, many campaigns, but one battle. The Land of Promise is now a fulfillment. Through the campaigns the borders of the land of inheritance were now more apparent. In Transjordan the limits are from the Arnon to Mt Hermon (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.12.2-5">2-5</a>). In Canaan the boundary extends from the region south of Sidon to the Negev (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.12.7-8">7-8</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">The Division of the Land, <a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-22.34">13:1–22:34</a></p>
<p class="h4">The Command to Divide the Land, <a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-7">13:1-7</a></p>
<p class="fl">Because of Joshua’s advanced age, the “whole” land was not taken. Moses had forewarned Israel that the inheritance would result from conquest as well as from gradual extension of Israel’s narrow boundaries. Slowly Israel was to inherit the whole land, lest it be overwhelmed by the size and be unable to use it properly (<a href="?bref=Exod.23.29-30">Ex 23:29-30</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.22">Dt 7:22</a>). The areas still to be occupied were: the region to the north of Galilee, Mt Hermon (east of the Sea of Galilee), the area occupied by the Philistines, and regional Canaanite enclaves (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.2-7">Jos 13:2-7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-36">Jgs 1</a>). Israel was not to be concerned with the future rights of occupation, because the Lord promised to help them (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.6">Jos 13:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Division of Transjordan, <a href="?bref=Josh.13.8-33">13:8-33</a></p>
<p class="fl">Joshua did not alter the Mosaic arrangement concerning the allotments to the tribes of Manasseh, Reuben, and Gad (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.8,32-33">Jos 13:8, 32-33</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.32.1-42">Nm 32</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.3.12-17">Dt 3:12-17</a>). Their territory also excluded certain regions still occupied by Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.13">Jos 13:13</a>). The clans of Reuben had received the territory from the Arnon River north to Heshbon (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.13.15-23">15-23</a>). The clans of Gad had received the territory of Gilead, south of the Jabbok River to Heshbon (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.13.24-28">24-28</a>). Several clans of Manasseh received the region south of the Wadi Yarmuk to the Jabbok (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.13.29-31">29-31</a>). The Levitical towns are not listed here, but a reference is made to them as not receiving a patrimony, because they were to live off the offerings and sacrifices made to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.14">Jos 13:14</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.18.20-24">Nm 18:20-24</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.35.1-8">35:1-8</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Tribal Divisions in Canaan, <a href="?bref=Josh.14.1-19.51">14:1–19:51</a></p>
<p class="fl">Eleazar, the high priest, and Joshua together cast lots to determine the boundaries, size, and allocation for the remaining nine and a half tribes. Again the exclusion of the tribe of Levi is mentioned (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.4">Jos 14:4</a>), because their cities will be dealt with in chapters <a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-21.45">20–21</a>. Another literary device is special mention of the inheritance of Caleb in the beginning (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.6-15">14:6-15</a>) and of Joshua at the conclusion (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.49-50">19:49-50</a>). These two were the only ones who had left Egypt as adults, had been faithful spies, and had entered into the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Num.14.24,30">Nm 14:24, 30</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.36-38">Dt 1:36-38</a>).</p>
<p class="h5">Judah, <a href="?bref=Josh.15.1-63">15:1-63</a> (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.10-15,20">Jgs 1:10-15, 20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The boundaries of Judah extended from the Dead Sea westward to the Mediterranean (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.2-12">Jos 15:2-12</a>). The cities of Judah are listed in its four regions: 29 in the Negev (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.15.21-32">21-32</a>), 42 cities in the Shephelah (or western foothills) and coastal plains (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.15.33-47">33-47</a>), 38 cities in the hill country (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.48-60">15:48-60</a>), and 6 cities in the desert (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.15.61-62">61-62</a>). Judah was unable to take Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Josh.15.63">63</a>) until David made it his capital (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.21">Jgs 1:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-16">2 Sm 5:6-16</a>).</p>
<p class="h5">Ephraim and Manasseh, <a href="?bref=Josh.16.1-17.18">16:1–17:18</a></p>
<p class="fl">These two tribes, descended from Joseph, were richly blessed (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.48.1-22">Gn 48</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.49.22-26">49:22-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.33.13-17">Dt 33:13-17</a>) and had obtained prominence among the tribes. They received one allotment as “the allotment for Joseph” (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.1">Jos 16:1</a>). Part of Manasseh had already received a patrimony east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Josh.13.29-31">13:29-31</a>). The limits for Ephraim and the west half of Manasseh were from Bethel to Mt Gilboa in the north and from the Jordan to the Mediterranean (<a href="?bref=Josh.16.1-3">16:1-3</a>). Ephraim received the smaller portion in the south (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.16.5-9">5-9</a>) but was unable to drive the Canaanites out of Gezer. The clans of Manasseh are given, including Zelophehad (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.3-6">17:3-6</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.27.1-11">Nm 27:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.36.1-12">36:1-12</a>), in order to clearly distinguish them from the clans of Manasseh in Transjordan. The region of west Manasseh extended from Shechem to Mt Gilboa (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.7-11">Jos 17:7-11</a>); but Manasseh, also, was incapable of driving out the Canaanites completely (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.17.12-13">12-13</a>).</p>
<p>Though they had received the largest portion of the land (more than a third), the tribes of Joseph complained. They knew that the Lord had blessed them (<a href="?bref=Josh.17.14">17:14</a>), and they expected to get more cultivable land. But Joshua urged them to use the available land by cutting down the forests (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.17.15-18">15-18</a>). When they expressed realistic concern about Canaanite military power, Joshua called on them to do their share in occupying the land.</p>
<p class="h5">Seven Tribes, <a href="?bref=Josh.18.1-19.51">18:1–19:51</a></p>
<p class="fl">The Israelites assembled at Shiloh to set up the tabernacle (cf. <a href="?bref=1Sam.1.1-28">1 Sm 1</a>). At that point seven tribes had not yet received their patrimony. Joshua called for each tribe to commission three men to survey the land. When they returned, Joshua cast lots at the tabernacle in Shiloh and divided the land (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.3-10">Jos 18:3-10</a>). The territory of Benjamin was between Judah and Ephraim (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.18.11-28">11-28</a>). Simeon’s allotment was in southern Judah (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.1-9">19:1-9</a>), resulting in its absorption into Judah (cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.49.7">Gn 49:7</a>). Zebulun (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.10-16">Jos 19:10-16</a>), Issachar (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.19.17-23">17-23</a>), Asher (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.19.24-31">24-31</a>), and Naphtali (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.19.32-39">32-39</a>) received a portion north of Manasseh in the region of Galilee. Dan received the seventh lot and suffered subsequently, when it could not maintain the allotted territory because of the pressure of Judah on the east and the Philistines to the west (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.19.40-48">40-48</a>). They migrated northward and found the sources of the Jordan to be a fruitful region (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.47">Jos 19:47</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">Jgs 18</a>).</p>
<p class="h5">Conclusion, <a href="?bref=Josh.19.49-51">19:49-51</a></p>
<p class="fl">The conclusion is symmetric with the beginning (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.1-14">Jos 14:1-14</a>) in that Joshua also received a gift. Again, mention is made that all divisions were in the presence of the Lord, witnessed to and executed by the high priest Eleazar and Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.19.51">19:51</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.14.1">14:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Cities of Refuge and the Levitical Cities, <a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-21.45">20:1–21:45</a></p>
<p class="fl">According to the instructions of Moses, six Levitical cities were set apart, three on each side of the Jordan, as cities of refuge (<a href="?bref=Num.35.9-34">Nm 35:9-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.4.41-43">Dt 4:41-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.19.1-10">19:1-10</a>). The purpose was to provide “refuge” (asylum) for those who were guilty of manslaughter but had not intentionally killed someone. This practice was not to provide a way out for someone who was guilty, but to allow for the legal process to be completed (<a href="?bref=Josh.20.1-9">Jos 20</a>).</p>
<p>The Levites received by clan a total of 48 cities, six of which also served as cities of refuge (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.1-42">21:1-42</a>). The Levites could not cultivate the soil because they were dependent on the tithes of the people (<a href="?bref=Num.18.21-24">Nm 18:21-24</a>), but they were permitted to have land for grazing. The dimensions of the land are given in <a href="?bref=Num.35.4-5">Numbers 35:4-5</a>. A special allocation is made to the descendants of Aaron (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.9-19">Jos 21:9-19</a>), because they served as priests and their 13 cities were in the Judah-Simeon region, in proximity to the Jerusalem temple of the Solomonic era.</p>
<p>With the allocation of the Levitical cities, the division of the land is concluded. The promise of the land is fulfilled (<a href="?bref=Josh.21.43-45">21:43-45</a>). God is faithful! This section emphasizes the fulfillment, the power, and the grace of God, by which Israel entered into its rest. However, the book of Joshua also hints of the struggle that is still ahead of the Israelites and of the test that ultimately they will fail (cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.95.11">Ps 95:11</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.3.7-11">Heb 3:7-11</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Return of the Transjordan Tribes, <a href="?bref=Josh.22.1-34">22:1-34</a></p>
<p class="fl">Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes with a commendation for their loyalty to the other tribes and to the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.1-4">Jos 22:1-4</a>), with a warning not to succumb to idolatry but to love the Lord in accordance with the Deuteronomic law, and with a blessing (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.22.5-8">5-8</a>). However, as they returned they set up a large altar by the Jordan on the western side. The other tribes heard about it and met at Shiloh (v <a href="?bref=Josh.22.12">12</a>). They wisely commissioned Phinehas, the son of the high priest, with ten representatives of the tribes, to investigate the matter. The commission charged the Transjordan tribes with treachery (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.15-20">Jos 22:15-20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.25.1-18">Nm 25</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.7.1-26">Jos 7</a>).</p>
<p>The response of the Transjordan tribes demonstrated their concern for the unity of the tribes and for the worship of God. These tribes feared being excluded from the fellowship of God’s people and had purposefully constructed an altar, identical to that prescribed in the law, in order to demonstrate their common heritage (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.21-30">Jos 22:21-30</a>). The altar was not for sacrifice or worship but functioned as a symbol of the covenantal unity of the people of God.</p>
<p>Phinehas and the tribal representatives were pleased with the response and left with the assurance of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Josh.22.30-31">22:30-31</a>). Their report to the tribes led to reconciliation of all the tribes on this matter. The narrative concludes with a mention of the name given to the altar: “A witness between us and them that the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> is our God, too” (v <a href="?bref=Josh.22.34">34</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p class="h3">Epilogue: The Land Is a Sacred Trust, <a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-24.33">23:1–24:33</a></p>
<p class="fl">The last two chapters contain Joshua’s farewell speeches to all the leaders and to all Israel.</p>
<p class="h4">Address to the Leaders, <a href="?bref=Josh.23.1-16">23:1-16</a></p>
<p class="fl">Joshua reviews what the Lord has done for Israel in giving the land to the tribes. He has demonstrated his loyalty. And he will continue to be with his people so that no enemy can stand against them. He will fulfill every outstanding promise, even as he had already fulfilled promises. However, they must persevere in their loyalty to the Lord. Loyalty to the Lord is not apart from loyalty to the law of Moses. Apostasy will be severely punished, first by leaving the nations to ensnare Israel, and then by consuming them in his wrath.</p>
<p class="h4">Address to Israel, <a href="?bref=Josh.24.1-28">24:1-28</a></p>
<p class="fl">The address ends with a covenant renewal at Shechem (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.1,25-28">Jos 24:1, 25-28</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.8.30-35">8:30-35</a>). In the ancient Near East it was common when making a treaty (covenant) to give a brief historical summary of the relationship of the parties involved. Joshua reviewed Israel’s history from the patriarchs to their generation: patriarchs (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.2-4">24:2-4</a>), exodus (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.24.5-7">5-7</a>), and conquest (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.24.8-13">8-13</a>).</p>
<p>The goodness, presence, and loyalty of Yahweh was evident to them. Yahweh also expected “faithfulness” from his people in the form of whole allegiance, without any form of idolatry (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.14-15">Jos 24:14-15</a>). As the head of his family, Joshua vowed to be loyal (v <a href="?bref=Josh.24.15">15</a>). The people responded by giving reasons for being loyal to the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.24.16-18">16-18</a>). But Joshua pushed them to a deeper commitment by challenging their profession (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.24.19-20">19-20</a>), then recording their vow and setting up a stone of witness against them (vv <a href="?bref=Josh.24.25-27">25-27</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">End of an Era, <a href="?bref=Josh.24.29-33">24:29-33</a></p>
<p class="fl">The book began with a reference to the death of Moses (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>) and concludes with the death and burial of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.29-30">24:29-30</a>) and of Eleazar the high priest (v <a href="?bref=Josh.24.33">33</a>). This marks the end of an era. The burial of Joseph’s bones (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.32">Jos 24:32</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Gen.50.25">Gn 50:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.13.19">Ex 13:19</a>) in a plot purchased by Jacob (<a href="?bref=Gen.33.19">Gn 33:19</a>) brings together the hope characteristic of the epoch of Moses and Joshua.</p>

<p class="h1">JOSIAH</p>
<p class="list">1. Sixteenth king of the southern kingdom of Judah (640–609 <span class="era">BC</span>). A godly man, he stood in marked contrast to his grandfather Manasseh and his father, Amon. In fact, Scripture declares there was no king either before or after him who was as obedient to the law of Moses (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.25">2 Kgs 23:25</a>). The Greek form of his name, Josias, appears in <a href="?bref=Matt.1.10-11">Matthew 1:10-11</a> (<span class="sc">kjv</span>).</p>
<p class="h2-list">The Times of Josiah</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">When Josiah became king in 640 <span class="era">BC</span>, the international scene was about to change drastically. After the great Assyrian king Ashurbanipal died in 633 <span class="era">BC</span>, mediocre rulers followed him on the throne, and there was considerable unrest in the empire. Nabopolassar, father of Nebuchadnezzar, seized the kingship in Babylon and established the Neo-Babylonian Empire late in 626 <span class="era">BC</span>. Soon Babylonians and Medes combined forces to topple the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 <span class="era">BC</span> completely destroyed the city of Nineveh. As Babylonian power rose in the east, Assyrian control over the province that had once been the kingdom of Israel relaxed and Assyrian pressure on Judah virtually ceased. After the fall of Nineveh, the Assyrians established their capital at Haran. There they were defeated by Babylonians and Scythians in 610 <span class="era">BC</span>. At that point Pharaoh Neco II of Egypt decided to support Assyria. In the late spring of 609 <span class="era">BC</span> he advanced through Judah, defeated and killed Josiah, and spent the summer campaigning in Syria.</p>
<p class="list-text">Before Josiah’s reign, Judah had capitulated to gross idolatry during the reign of Manasseh (697–642 <span class="era">BC</span>). Baalism, Molech worship, and other pagan religions had invaded the land, as had occultism and astrology. A false altar even stood in the temple in Jerusalem, and human sacrifice to pagan deities was practiced near Jerusalem. The nation was thoroughly corrupt. Although some reform occurred in Manasseh’s latter days, conditions reverted to their former baseness during the reign of his son Amon (642–640 <span class="era">BC</span>). In 640 <span class="era">BC</span> officials of Amon’s household assassinated him, and the “people of the land” put Josiah on the throne (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.21.26">2 Kgs 21:26</a>; <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1">22:1</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.33.25-34.1">2 Chr 33:25–34:1</a>).</p>
<p class="h2-list">Josiah’s Reform Activities</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">Josiah was only eight years old when he became king. Evidently he had spiritually motivated advisers or regents; by the time he was 16, he began of his own accord “to seek the God of his ancestor David” (<a href="?bref=2Chr.34.3">2 Chr 34:3</a>). When he was 20, he became greatly exercised over the idolatry of the land and launched a major effort to eradicate the pagan high places, groves, and images from Judah and Jerusalem. So intense was Josiah’s hatred of idolatry that he even opened the tombs of pagan priests and burned their bones on pagan altars before the altars were destroyed.</p>
<p class="list-text">Josiah carried his reform movement beyond the borders of Judah, venting his fury especially on the cult center at Bethel, where Jeroboam had set up his false worship. In fulfillment of prophecy (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.13.1-3">1 Kgs 13:1-3</a>), he destroyed the altar and high place and burned the bones of officiating priests to desecrate the site (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.15-18">2 Kgs 23:15-18</a>). What he did at Bethel he did everywhere else in the kingdom of Samaria (vv <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.19-20">19-20</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">When Josiah was 26, he launched a project to cleanse and repair the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.3">2 Kgs 22:3</a>). Shaphan, the king’s administrative assistant, commissioned the work; Hilkiah the priest supervised the renovation and construction. In the process of restoring the temple, Hilkiah found the Book of the Law, the nature and contents of which are otherwise unknown. Possibly in the dark days of Manasseh a deliberate attempt had been made to destroy the Word of God. At any rate, there was little knowledge of Scripture in Judah.</p>
<p class="list-text">When Shaphan read the Book of the Law to Josiah, the king was devastated by the pronouncements of judgment against apostasy contained in it. He sent a delegation to Huldah the prophetess to find out what judgments awaited the land. The prophetess replied that the condemnation of God would indeed fall on Judah for its sin, but she sent word to Josiah that because his heart was right toward God, the punishment would not come during his lifetime.</p>
<p class="list-text">The king called together a large representative group for a public reading of the law—evidently sections especially concerned with obligations to God. The king and the people made a covenant before God to keep his commandments.</p>
<p class="list-text">Faced with the importance of maintaining a pure monotheistic faith, the king was spurred on to even more rigorous efforts to cleanse the temple and Jerusalem. He destroyed the vessels used in Baal worship, the monument of horses given by the kings of Judah for sun worship, the chariots dedicated to the sun, the homosexual community near the temple, and shrines built by Solomon and in use since his day. Moreover, he made stringent efforts to eliminate the pagan shrines and high places in all the towns of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.4-14">2 Kgs 23:4-14</a>).</p>
<p class="h2-list">The Death of Josiah</p>
<p class="list-text-fl">Precisely why Josiah opposed Pharaoh Neco’s advance through Judean territory is unknown. He may have wanted to prevent aid from reaching the hated Assyrians or to maintain his own independence. Josiah was mortally wounded in the conflict and was greatly lamented by Jeremiah and all the people (<a href="?bref=2Chr.35.25">2 Chr 35:25</a>). Well they might weep, for their godly king was gone, and within a few years the judgment withheld during his lifetime would descend on the nation.</p>

<p class="h1">JOTHAM</p>
<p class="list">1. Youngest of Gideon’s 70 sons and the only survivor of Abimelech’s slaughter of Jotham’s brothers at Ophrah (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.5">Jgs 9:5</a>). Upon learning of Abimelech’s intrigue with the Shechemites, which led to the death of his brothers, Jotham traveled to Shechem and addressed its people from atop nearby Mt Gerizim. Using a parable, he portrayed Abimelech’s rise as king and concluded his denunciation by issuing a curse on both his half brother (see <a href="?bref=Judg.8.31">8:31</a>) and the people of Shechem for their treachery (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.7">9:7</a>). Jotham then fled to Beer for fear of a reprisal from Abimelech (v <a href="?bref=Judg.9.21">21</a>). Later, God fulfilled Jotham’s curse; the people of Shechem were killed in a revolt and Abimelech was struck down at the hands of a woman (v <a href="?bref=Judg.9.57">57</a>).</p>
<p class="list">2. Eleventh king of Judah (750–735 <span class="era">BC</span>). He was the son of King Azariah (Uzziah) of Judah and Jerusa, daughter of Zadok (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.7">2 Kgs 15:7</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.26.21">2 Chr 26:21</a>; <a href="?bref=2Chr.27.1">27:1</a>), and the father of Ahaz. Jotham, at 25 years of age, ascended Judah’s throne in the second year of King Pekah of Israel (752–732 <span class="era">BC</span>) and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. Initially he reigned as co-regent with Azariah, who was stricken with leprosy for tolerating pagan worship, until his father’s death (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.15.5">2 Kgs 15:5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Jotham was considered a righteous king in the eyes of the Lord. However, he also failed to cleanse the temple of its pagan influences, and subsequently the people of Judah continued in their evil ways (<a href="?bref=2Chr.27.2-6">2 Chr 27:2-6</a>). His building projects included the Upper Gate of the temple, work on the wall of Ophel, and the fortification of numerous towns in Judah’s hill country (vv <a href="?bref=2Chr.27.3-4">3-4</a>). Jotham also defeated the troublesome Ammonites in battle (v <a href="?bref=2Chr.27.5">5</a>) and registered by genealogy the families of Gad living east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=1Chr.5.17">1 Chr 5:17</a>). He was buried in Jerusalem after his death (<a href="?bref=2Chr.27.9">2 Chr 27:9</a>). The prophets Isaiah and Micah ministered to Judah, and Hosea to Israel, during his tenure as king. Jotham is listed as an ancestor of Jesus Christ in Matthew’s genealogy (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.9">Mt 1:9</a>).</p>

  <title>Joy</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JOY</p>
<p class="fl">Positive human condition that can be either feeling or action. The Bible uses “joy” in both senses.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JoyasaFeeling">Joy as a Feeling</p>
<p class="fl">Joy is a feeling called forth by well-being, success, or good fortune. A person automatically experiences it because of certain favorable circumstances. It cannot be commanded.</p>
<p>The shepherd experienced joy when he found his lost sheep (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.13">Mt 18:13</a>). The multitude felt it when Jesus healed a Jewish woman whom Satan had bound for 18 years (<a href="?bref=Luke.13.17">Lk 13:17</a>). The disciples returned to Jerusalem rejoicing after Jesus’ ascension (<a href="?bref=Luke.24.52">24:52</a>). Joy was also the feeling of the church at Antioch when its members heard the Jerusalem Council’s decision that they did not have to be circumcised to keep God’s law (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.31">Acts 15:31</a>). Paul mentioned his joy in hearing about the obedience of the Roman Christians (<a href="?bref=Rom.16.19">Rom 16:19</a>). He wrote to the Corinthians that love does not rejoice in wrong but rejoices in the right (<a href="?bref=1Cor.13.6">1 Cor 13:6</a>; see also <a href="?bref=1Sam.2.1">1 Sm 2:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.11.9">11:9</a>; <a href="?bref=1Sam.18.6">18:6</a>; <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.12">2 Sm 6:12</a>; <a href="?bref=1Kgs.1.40">1 Kgs 1:40</a>; <a href="?bref=Esth.9.17-22">Est 9:17-22</a>).</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Ps.137.1-6">Psalms 137:1-6</a> shows that the emotion cannot be commanded. The Jews’ captors wanted them to sing in the land of their exile, something they were unable to do. Faraway Jerusalem was their chief joy.</p>
<p class="h2" id="JoyasanAction">Joy as an Action</p>
<p class="fl">There is a joy that Scripture commands. That joy is action that can be engaged in regardless of how the person feels. <a href="?bref=Pr.5.18">Proverbs 5:18</a> tells the reader to rejoice in the wife of his youth, without reference to what she may be like. Christ instructed his disciples to rejoice when they were persecuted, reviled, and slandered (<a href="?bref=Matt.5.11-12">Mt 5:11-12</a>). The apostle Paul commanded continuous rejoicing (<a href="?bref=Phil.4.4">Phil 4:4</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.16">1 Thes 5:16</a>). James said Christians are to reckon it all joy when they fall into various testings because such testings produce endurance (<a href="?bref=Jas.1.2">Jas 1:2</a>). Joy in adverse circumstances is possible only as a fruit of the Holy Spirit, who is present in every Christian (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.22">Gal 5:22</a>).</p>

  <title>Jubilee Year*</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JUBILEE YEAR*</p>
<p class="fl">Year of emancipation and restoration to be kept every 50 years. For Israel, the seventh year expressed at length the values of the seventh day Sabbath (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-7">Lv 25:1-7</a>). When a series of seven years reached the perfection of seven sevens, the 50th year was heralded by the trumpet of jubilee and a whole additional year was set aside as belonging to the Lord.</p>
<p>The word “jubilee” simply means a ram’s horn; it came to mean a trumpet made from or in the shape of a ram’s horn. Such horns were exclusively for religious use. The sacred trumpet gave its name to the year of the ram’s horn, the jubilee year—a year to which the people of God were summoned in a striking and holy way. It was not simply a release from labor, not just a rest, but a year belonging to the Lord. In <a href="?bref=Lev.25.1-55">Leviticus 25</a> this exact expression occurs in connection with the seventh year rather than expressly with the jubilee year. Functionally such a year was a Sabbath rest for the land, and it brought enjoyment “to the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>” (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.4">Lv 25:4</a>). But nothing could more directly express the implications and orientations of the 50th year.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Lordship">Lordship</p>
<p class="fl">The first principle of the jubilee is God’s lordship over the whole earth, acknowledged by his people in their obedience to his command to set the year aside in this way. Just as the Sabbath expressed his right to order life, giving it the shape of six days’ work and one day’s rest, and just as the seventh year, linked in <a href="?bref=Deut.31.9-13">Deuteronomy 31:9-13</a> with the reading of his law, expressed his right to command the obedience of his people, so the 50th year expressed his sovereign possession of all: land, people, means of production, and life itself. Take the typical case of debtor and creditor. When God brought his people into possession of the land, he gave to each his inheritance. In a given circumstance a man might be compelled to sell his land in whole or part, but it must come back to him: “The land must never be sold on a permanent basis because it really belongs to me. You are only foreigners and tenants living with me” (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.23">Lv 25:23</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). In this verse “foreigners” carries the meaning “stateless persons,” “refugees,” “those who have sought political asylum”—in a word, those who have no rights except what mercy concedes. Such are the people of God and such they must acknowledge themselves to be when the jubilee year comes around. When a piece of real estate changed hands, the seller might congratulate himself on the astuteness with which he had solved his problem, and the buyer might rejoice in his skillful acquisitiveness, but in the Year of Jubilee seller and buyer alike are compelled to confess a different truth: neither is master, either of his own welfare or of the person and goods of another. Each has a Master in heaven.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Redemption">Redemption</p>
<p class="fl">According to the ordinance, the trumpet that heralded the year was sounded on the Day of Atonement (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.9">Lv 25:9</a>). That was the day on which the Lord proclaimed his people clean before him from all their sins (<a href="?bref=Lev.16.30">16:30</a>). Forgiveness of sins ushered in the jubilee year. The verb “to redeem” and the noun “redemption” had a strong commercial use in the recovery of property pledged against loans of money, and in the 50th year these words would have sounded and resounded as debtors confessed that they could not “redeem” and creditors forewent their “redemption” rights, each using the very vocabulary of the Lord’s action at the exodus (<a href="?bref=Exod.6.6">Ex 6:6</a>). This is what the Lord had done for his people, and the divine action must be the norm of the human. Brotherly generosity is urged (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.35-38">Lv 25:35-38</a>), liberty is granted (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.25.39-43">39-43</a>), and slavery in perpetuity is forbidden (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.25.47-55">47-55</a>) simply because the divine redemptive act makes the redeemed into brothers, brings them into the Lord’s servitude, and cancels the bondage that would otherwise be theirs forever.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Rest">Rest</p>
<p class="fl">The correlative of redemption is rest. This rest is vividly illustrated and enforced as Moses legislates rest from all the toil connected with promoting next year’s crop (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.4">Lv 25:4</a>); rest from the toil of harvesting, for the people of God were to live hand to mouth, gathering only what and when need dictated (vv <a href="?bref=Lev.25.5-7">5-7</a>); rest from the anxious burden of debts incurred; and rest from slavery (v <a href="?bref=Lev.25.10">10</a>). Like the Sabbath, this rest would have meant exactly what it said: freedom from toil; relaxation, refreshment, and recreation. Very likely tiredness was as endemic among the people of God then as now, and grace drew near to give them a holiday. But equally with the Sabbath, release from the preoccupations of staying alive created time to be preoccupied with the Lord, his worship, his Word, and the life that pleases him. We can understand <a href="?bref=Isa.58.1-14">Isaiah 58</a> as binding the ideals of Sabbath and jubilee together. The Lord frees his people not for unbroken idleness but for the redirection of life toward himself. The jubilee year was thus a deliberate opting out of the rat race; it called a halt to acquisitiveness; it abandoned concern over the pressure to stay alive. It reordered priorities, giving a chance to appraise the use of time and the selection of objectives. For a whole year the people of God stood back, rested, ceased from the good in order to attain the best.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Faith">Faith</p>
<p class="fl">But this standing back from life was not in the style of a dropout. It was the action of responsible faith. No one on earth can escape questions such as “What shall we eat?” The Lord foresees and provides (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.20">Lv 25:20</a>); grace provides so that God’s people can enjoy the ordinances of grace (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.16.29">Ex 16:29</a>). When he commands a year off, he enables them to take it. The 50th year was a living testimony to his faithfulness. The last season of sowing and reaping would have been the 49th year; in the final 7th year in the series the people would live off the casual growth; and in the 50th year nothing but the sheer attentive faithfulness of their God could provide for them (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.21">Lv 25:21</a>). Here indeed their faith would be put to the test, for God spoke a word of majestic promise and called on them to believe. At the heart of their jubilee they took God at his word and found him faithful.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Obedience">Obedience</p>
<p class="fl">Biblically, it is a central characteristic of the people of God that they do what he commands for no other reason than that he commands it. In the ordinance of the 50th year the people of God must show themselves as his obedient ones, and in fact their obedience is the guarantee of continuance in the land he has granted to them. Thus, for example, <a href="?bref=Lev.26.34-35">Leviticus 26:34-35</a> teaches that loss of tenure and loss of liberty is directly related to contravention of the principle of the Sabbath, found on the seventh day, seventh year, and jubilee year. Refusal to obey goes hand in hand with loss of possession, leaving behind an empty land, which then enjoys the Sabbath rest it never received from its disobedient inhabitants.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Hope">Hope</p>
<p class="fl">In the 50th year the people lived in the light of the forgiveness of sins, walked by obedience in harmony with the God who redeemed them, and in freedom from toil, received from the ground its life-sustaining benefits without any sweat on their brows (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.16">Gn 2:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.3.19">3:19</a>). It was a sort of Eden restored, the curse momentarily held in abeyance—but also a prolonged foretaste of the coming day when the promises would all be fulfilled, the blood of the covenant efficacious without hindrance, the prisoners of hope (i.e., who had waited in hope for their release) freed, and the trumpet of liberation heard throughout the world (<a href="?bref=Isa.27.13">Is 27:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Zech.9.11-14">Zec 9:11-14</a>). The Year of Jubilee in a limited but real way foreshadowed what would yet be the eternal inheritance and bliss of the people of God.</p>

<p class="list-text">Though reckless in his behavior with Tamar (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.6-30">Gn 38:6-30</a>), Judah showed firm resolve in taking personal responsibility for Benjamin’s safety in Egypt and acting as intercessor for his brothers before Joseph (<a href="?bref=Gen.44.14-18">44:14-18</a>). At the time of Jacob’s blessing, Judah was granted the birthright privileges of the firstborn; the leadership of Jacob’s family would come through Judah’s seed, as would the promised Messiah of Abraham’s covenant (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.8-12">49:8-12</a>). Later, Judah’s family was praised at the time of Ruth’s engagement to Boaz (<a href="?bref=Ruth.4.12">Ru 4:12</a>), and both the Davidic lines of kings (<a href="?bref=1Chr.2.1-15">1 Chr 2:1-15</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.3.1-24">3:1-24</a>) and Jesus Christ’s ancestors traced their descent from Judah (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.2-3">Mt 1:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.3.33">Lk 3:33</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JUDAH, Tribe of</p>
<p class="fl">One of the 12 tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="h2" id="GeographicalTerritory">Geographical Territory</p>
<p class="fl">The frontiers of Judah are well defined in <a href="?bref=Josh.15.1-63">Joshua 15</a>, which describes the inheritance of the tribe after the Conquest. <a href="?bref=2Kgs.23.8">Second Kings 23:8</a> describes Judah as extending from Geba to Beersheba: Geba is about 8 miles (13 kilometers) north of Jerusalem, and Beersheba about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south. Judah thus held a strip of mountain land on the central spine of southern Palestine, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from north to south and 20 miles (32 kilometers) from east to west. Of this 1,000 square miles, half was desert (on the south and east); the rest was stony and not well watered. The central ridge, upon which are situated Jerusalem, Hebron, and Beersheba, rises to over 3,000 feet (914 meters) in places before tapering off into the desert in the south. Along this ridge, connecting these towns, runs the chief road. To the east, the ridge drops steeply to the Dead Sea, nearly 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) below. To the west it drops less sharply to the “lowlands,” actually a plateau some 1,000 feet (305 meters) high, before descending to the Philistine plain, which stretches to the sea.</p>
<p>Judah proper (Jerusalem was a later addition) was remote and secure in its hills. Its true center and capital was Hebron, 3,500 feet (1,067 meters) up. Only on the north was it vulnerable to attackers marching south along the ridge road. However, three great valleys led up from the western lowlands into the hills: the valley of Ajalon, the valley of Sorek, and the valley of Elah. Battles would rage up and down these valleys from the days of Joshua to the time of David and long afterward. The few roads to the east (the one from Jerusalem to Jericho is the best known) were not so important, although it was by this “back door” that Joshua had invaded the hill country (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.9">Jos 10:9</a>). Judah was thus geographically well out of the mainstream of Israelite life, since only the territory of Simeon lay to the south.</p>
<p>The area occupied by Judah falls easily into three natural regions: the central mountain ridge, fairly densely settled, especially on its western side, where rainfall and dew were greatest; the eastern slopes, almost uninhabited and mostly desert; and the southern pastoral region round Beersheba, where the mountains fall away into dry prairie, with sparse settlement throughout.</p>
<p class="h2" id="EconomicLife">Economic Life</p>
<p class="fl">To Israel, Palestine was a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="?bref=Num.13.27">Nm 13:27</a>). Half of Judah might be desert, but the rest had reasonably good soil, and on the western slopes the rain was usually adequate. Wheat, barley, olives, figs, and especially vineyards, grew freely. The land might be stony, but stones could be collected and used for walls and buildings. Not as rich as the great northern valleys like Jezreel, Judah was still good mixed farming country, although it required hard work. Sheep and goats were plentiful, and that meant wool and milk. Cattle were probably rarer; Judah was not cattle country like Bashan (<a href="?bref=Num.32.1">Nm 32:1</a>). Wool meant cloth, and hide meant leather. In those days the hills were forested, which meant fuel and building materials. Clay for pottery was readily available for domestic utensils. Copper came from Edom in the south, and iron from Philistia in the west; these could be obtained by bartering agricultural produce. Whether they realized it or not, God had dealt graciously with the people of Judah in giving them adequate resources. Nonetheless, the climate was bracing: a cold, wet winter, with snow and hail at times, and a long, rainless summer, with low humidity and cool nights. This brought heavy dews on the eastern slopes (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.38">Jgs 6:38</a>), and precious rainwater was conserved in rock-hewn cisterns (<a href="?bref=Jer.2.13">Jer 2:13</a>). Permanent streams of any size did not exist in Judah, but springs or “wells” were abundant, from Jerusalem to Beersheba. It was not until Judah got caught up into the economic life of Solomon’s trading empire that its simple pattern of life changed; even then, the change in the hills of Judah was far less than elsewhere. Judah had no seaport of its own and controlled no rich caravan routes. It had no coveted raw materials, like the copper of Edom or the cedars of Lebanon; no luxury goods for trade, like the purple dye of Phoenicia or the gold of Ophir; no lush land to tempt the greed of others. In God’s mercy Judah’s temptations were few. Its faith was also less liable to be corrupted: comparatively few Canaanites had ever settled in this area, while the Conquest had been more thorough in the south than in the north.</p>
<p class="h2" id="HistoryandSignificance">History and Significance</p>
<p class="fl">The earliest blessings on Judah are recorded in <a href="?bref=Gen.49.8-12">Genesis 49:8-12</a> and <a href="?bref=Deut.33.7">Deuteronomy 33:7</a>. After the exodus, the tribe of Judah took first place in the desert camping arrangement (<a href="?bref=Num.2.3">Nm 2:3</a>). Caleb, one of the two faithful spies, was a tribal chieftain of Judah (<a href="?bref=Num.13.6">13:6</a>). In Joshua’s invasion of Palestine, the highlands allotted to Judah were the first to be cleared of Canaanites, after the initial fighting around Jericho and Ai (<a href="?bref=Josh.6.1-27">Jos 6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.8.1-35">8</a>). The book of Joshua is a summary account of the whole campaign.</p>
<include_items src="../Maps/Maps.xml" name="JudahFightsforItsLand"/>
<p>After Joshua’s death, Simeon and Judah continued the fight against the Canaanites and marched together against the hill country of the south, led by Caleb and Othniel. Although God’s gift to Judah had been the whole land westward as far as the sea, Judah failed to take anything but the hills. The plain was controlled by iron-protected chariots and fortress cities. The king of Jerusalem was killed and Jerusalem was burned (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.8">Jgs 1:8</a>), but the Jebusites continued to occupy the area until David’s day (v <a href="?bref=Judg.1.21">21</a>). The men of Judah, like other Israelites, might burn Canaanite towns, but they did not usually occupy the old sites themselves. Under the judges, the tribe of Judah was still isolated, though Othniel was of Judah (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.3.1-31">3</a>). In the great battle against Sisera, Judah is not even mentioned (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">5</a>). This tribal isolation was soon lost, first through Philistine invasions from the west, and then through David’s capture of Jerusalem and the placing of the national and religious capital there. Although in <a href="?bref=Judg.15.11">Judges 15:11</a> the men of Judah are prepared even to hand over Samson to the Philistines, with Samuel as judge, everything changes. The ark returns (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.1">1 Sm 7:1</a>); lost territory is regained (v <a href="?bref=1Sam.7.14">14</a>). Indeed, Samuel’s sons act as judges in Beersheba (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.2">8:2</a>), although they are corrupt.</p>
<p>David finally breaks the power of the Philistines in a series of victories and rules as king first in Hebron, Judah’s chief town (<a href="?bref=2Sam.2.1-4">2 Sm 2:1-4</a>). When he is crowned king of all Israel, however, he moves the capital to the newly conquered Jerusalem, on the northern frontier of the tribe of Judah (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-10">5:6-10</a>). Here the ark was to be brought (ch <a href="?bref=2Sam.6.1-23">6</a>), and here Solomon was to build the temple (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.13">7:13</a>). All God’s promises will henceforth cluster around Jerusalem, the temple, and David’s line. Most important, the Messiah would come from Judah (<a href="?bref=Gen.49.10">Gn 49:10</a>).</p>
<p>The division between the northern and southern tribes had begun in David’s lifetime, after Absalom’s revolt (<a href="?bref=2Sam.20.1">2 Sm 20:1</a>); after Solomon’s death, the rift became complete (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.16">1 Kgs 12:16</a>). Henceforth for 200 years, until the fall of the northern kingdom in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, there were two little kingdoms side by side: a larger one in the north and east, called Israel (the “ten tribes” of <a href="?bref=1Kgs.11.35">1 Kgs 11:35</a>), and a smaller one in the south, called Judah. With this, the history of Judah as a tribe virtually comes to an end, for although still called by the old tribal name, this little kingdom was really a “Greater Judah.” It now contained not only the old tribe of Judah but also the newly conquered Jebusite territory of Jerusalem, some of the old Philistine country, and the tribes of Benjamin and Simeon, as well as many Levites (<a href="?bref=2Chr.11.14">2 Chr 11:14</a>) and other “loyalists” from the north. Indeed, from now on, “tribe” had far less meaning than before; it was more important where a person lived than of what tribe the person was, although, within the family, tribal origins continued to be remembered. For 250 more years the little kingdom of Judah persisted alone. Even after the exile it was the tiny province of Judah that emerged under Nehemiah (<a href="?bref=Neh.1.2-3">Neh 1:2-3</a>), and Judea still remained as a district in NT days (<a href="?bref=Luke.3.1">Lk 3:1</a>). In fact, the vast majority of later Jews were of the tribe of Judah, as the very name “Jew” shows. But the chief glory of the tribe of Judah, now as ever, was that the house of David sprang from it. When Jesus Christ was born, he was to be of David’s line and Judah’s tribe. So it is that in <a href="?bref=Rev.7.5">Revelation 7:5</a>, when 12,000 are sealed from each tribe, Judah has pride of place in the list, as it had in Numbers (<a href="?bref=Num.2.3">Nm 2:3</a>) so long before.</p>

<p class="h1">JUDAISM</p>
<p class="fl">Religion and culture of the Jewish people from the beginning of the postexilic period (538 <span class="era">BC</span>) to modern times. The term “Judaism” is derived from “Judah,” the name of the southern kingdom of ancient Israel, while “Jew” is a shortened form of “Judeans.”</p>
<p class="h2" id="ThePeriodoftheSecondTemple">The Period of the Second Temple (515 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 70)</p>
<p class="h3">Historical Survey</p>
<p class="fl">The united kingdom of Israel under Saul, David, and Solomon came to an end shortly after the death of Solomon. Rehoboam, his son, provoked a revolt about 930 <span class="era">BC</span> on the part of the 10 northern tribes by levying unreasonably high taxes (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.12.1-33">1 Kgs 12</a>). From that time on, the kingdoms of Israel (or Samaria, the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom) maintained a separate existence. The northern kingdom fell to the Assyrians in 722 <span class="era">BC</span>, and thousands of captives, primarily members of the upper class, were exiled forcibly and taken to Assyria, where they presumably intermarried with the native population and disappeared from history. The kingdom of Judah survived as an independent state until 597 <span class="era">BC</span>, when it came under the control of the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar. The temple was finally destroyed in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> and many captives were carried off to Babylonia, beginning a period of exile that was to last two generations. The Babylonians were defeated by Cyrus the Persian in 539 <span class="era">BC</span>, and the following year the king issued a decree permitting all captive peoples to return to the lands of their origin (<a href="?bref=2Chr.36.22-23">2 Chr 36:22-23</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezra.1.1-11">Ezr 1</a>). At least four waves of Jewish expatriates returned from Mesopotamia to Judea during the century following the decree of Cyrus, under such leaders as Sheshbazzar, Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. Many Jews, however, chose to remain in their adopted Mesopotamian homeland. The dedication of the second temple in the spring of 515 <span class="era">BC</span> provided a formal end to the exilic period of 70 years (<a href="?bref=Jer.29.10">Jer 29:10</a>), and was a direct result of the prophetic exhortations of Haggai and Zechariah.</p>
<p>In Judea the Jewish people were ruled by governors who held office at the pleasure of the Persian king. One of the earlier governors was Zerubabbel (<a href="?bref=Hagg.1.1">Hg 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Hagg.2.1-2">2:1-2</a>), a descendant of David (<a href="?bref=1Chr.3.10-19">1 Chr 3:10-19</a>). In some way he shared rule with the high priest Jeshua ben Jehozadak. Palestine was part of one of the 20 satrapies of the Persian Empire, which lasted from 539 to 331 <span class="era">BC</span>, when it fell to the Greeks under Alexander the Great. Little is known about the historical developments in Palestine during most of the Persian period. When Alexander died in 323 <span class="era">BC</span>, his empire was divided up among his generals; Egypt and Palestine fell to Ptolemy I. The Ptolemies were benevolent despots who allowed the Jews of Palestine a measure of freedom and autonomy. After the battle of Paneion in 198 <span class="era">BC</span>, Palestine came under the rule of the Seleucid Empire, founded by Seleucus I, another of Alexander’s generals.</p>
<p>The Seleucid Empire embraced a very large area with a diverse population, extending from Asia Minor and Palestine in the west to the borders of India on the east. Antiochus IV (Epiphanes) ascended the Seleucid throne in 175 <span class="era">BC</span> and attempted to unify his vast empire by Hellenizing it (i.e., by forcing the adoption of Greek language and culture). Local cultures and religions were forcibly suppressed as a result of this policy, and the Jewish state in Palestine was perhaps the hardest hit of all. In 167 <span class="era">BC</span> Antiochus IV dedicated the temple in Jerusalem to Olympian Zeus, sacrificed a sow on the altar, destroyed scrolls containing the Jewish Scriptures, and forbade the rite of circumcision. This repression triggered a revolt led by an aged priest named Mattathias and his sons. The Seleucids were repulsed, and finally in 164 <span class="era">BC</span> the temple was retaken by Mattathias’s son Judas the Maccabee (an epithet meaning “the hammer”). This Jewish victory has been commemorated annually by the festival of Hanukkah (“dedication”). Judas and his brothers, called Maccabees or Hasmoneans (Mattathias was of the house of Hasmon), and their descendants ruled Judea from 164 to 63 <span class="era">BC</span>, when Palestine fell to the Roman general Pompey. Thereafter, Palestine remained a vassal of Rome.</p>
<p>Hyrcanus, a Hasmonean, was high priest after the conquest of Judea by the Romans, though Antipater (an Idumean) was the real power behind Hyrcanus. The sons of Antipater, Phasael and Herod, were governors of Jerusalem and Galilee, respectively. Upon the assassination of Antipater in 43 <span class="era">BC</span>, and through his connections in Rome, Herod (later called Herod the Great) was named king of Judea by the Roman senate; he reigned from 37 to 4 <span class="era">BC</span>. When he died, Palestine was divided up by the emperor Augustus (27 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 14) and placed under the governorship of three of Herod’s sons: Herod Archelaus (ethnarch of Judea, Idumea, and Samaria from 4 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 6), Herod Antipas (tetrarch of Galilee and Perea from 4 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 39), and Herod Philip (tetrarch of Batanea, Trachonitis, and other small states from 4 <span class="era">BC</span> to <span class="era">AD</span> 34). These territories were generally placed under Roman procurators after the sons of Herod had died or been deposed. For a brief period (<span class="era">AD</span> 41–44), Herod Agrippa I, the grandson of Herod the Great, ruled virtually the same territory as his grandfather. Upon his death (narrated in <a href="?bref=Acts.12.20-23">Acts 12:20-23</a>), his territories were placed under Roman procurators. The greed and ineptitude of these procurators provoked the Jewish populace to rebel. The ill-fated Jewish revolt of <span class="era">AD</span> 66–73 resulted in the destruction of the second temple by the tenth Roman legion under Titus in <span class="era">AD</span> 70. The revolt was completely quelled in <span class="era">AD</span> 73, when more than 900 Jews under siege in the desert fortress of Masada near the Dead Sea committed mass suicide rather than fall into Roman hands. These tragic events ended permanently the temple cult and the priestly system in Judaism.</p>
<p class="h3">Social and Religious Developments</p>
<p class="fl">The Babylonian conquest of Judea and the destruction of the Solomonic temple in 586 <span class="era">BC</span> produced dramatic social and religious changes in Jewish life. The cessation of the temple cult struck a serious blow at the heart of the Israelite religion, since the Jerusalem temple alone was the legitimate and divinely appointed place for discharging much of the ritual requirement of the Mosaic law, chiefly the sacrificial cult. Even the three annual pilgrimage festivals, Succoth (Tabernacles), Pesach (Passover), and Shavuoth (Weeks) could no longer be observed by pious Jews who had remained in Judea after 586 <span class="era">BC</span>. When after 538 <span class="era">BC</span> many exiles chose to return to Judea, many others elected to remain in their new homeland. For the latter, the temple cult, even when reinstituted in 516 <span class="era">BC</span>, could no longer play a significant role in their religious lives.</p>
<p>During the exilic and early postexilic period, the peculiar Jewish institution of the synagogue (a Greek word meaning “gathering place”) began to evolve. The synagogue became such a popular and useful institution for Jewish communities outside Palestine that in the centuries after the dedication of the second temple they sprang up throughout Palestine, many in Jerusalem itself. By the end of the second temple period, the synagogue had come to play three important functions in Jewish life: it served as a house of prayer, a house of study, and a place of assembly. First-century <span class="era">AD</span> synagogue worship is illustrated in <a href="?bref=Luke.4.16-30">Luke 4:16-30</a> and <a href="?bref=Acts.13.13-42">Acts 13:13-42</a>. The focus of the service was a reading of a selection from the Torah (Law of Moses), then one from the Haphtorah (Prophets). These readings were followed by a homily based on Scripture. Other elements in first-century <span class="era">AD</span> synagogue worship included the recitation of the Shema (“Hear, O Israel”), a combination of biblical passages including <a href="?bref=Deut.6.4-9">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.11.13-21">11:13-21</a> and <a href="?bref=Num.15.37-41">Numbers 15:37-41</a>, and the Shemoneh Esreh (Eighteen Benedictions) called the Amidah (“standing”) because it was recited while standing upright. Jews also wore fringes on their garments in obedience to <a href="?bref=Num.15.38-39">Numbers 15:38-39</a> (<a href="?bref=Matt.23.5">Mt 23:5</a>), and phylacteries on their foreheads and left arms. Phylacteries are little boxes containing the portions of Scripture recited in Shema; they were used in literal fulfillment of the command in <a href="?bref=Deut.6.8">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>. Archaeologists have discovered first-century phylacteries in the ruins of Masada.</p>
<p>Outside of Palestine, Mesopotamia became the second most important center of Judaism. The Babylonian Jewish community was known as the Golah (“captivity”), and its titular head was called the Resh Galuta or Exilarch (both terms mean “leader of the captivity”). By the end of the exilic period, the descendants of the ancient original captives had forgotten Hebrew and had adopted Aramaic, the international language of the ancient Near East and sister language to Hebrew, as their first language. Even in Palestine, Aramaic was the primary language spoken. Thus, when portions of Scripture were read in synagogue services in Hebrew, most of those present were unable to understand what was read. This problem was solved by providing a methurgeman (translator) who would translate orally short sections of Scripture. Eventually these targums (“translations”) were reduced to writing, beginning in the second century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>By the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, it had been estimated that there were from four to seven million Jews in the Greco-Roman world, perhaps three to four times the population of Palestine. Jews in lands outside of Palestine came to be known collectively as the Diaspora (“scattering”). After the Greeks dominated the Mediterranean world through Alexander and his successors, Greek became the common language throughout this region. Just as Mesopotamian Jews spoke Aramaic in place of Hebrew, so Jews in the Greco-Roman world came to speak Greek. By the middle of the third century <span class="era">BC</span>, Hellenistic Jews began to translate the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. This translation, called the Septuagint (a term meaning “seventy,” based on a legend that it was translated simultaneously by seventy Jewish scholars), contained a more extensive canon of Scripture than that recognized by Palestinian Judaism. This reflects the more liberal attitudes of Hellenistic Jews.</p>
<p>During the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, most of the major sects within Palestinian Judaism came into being. The Hasidim (“pious”) were members of a religious association that aided the Hasmoneans in the revolt against the Seleucids (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.2.42">1 Macc 2:42</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.13">7:13</a>) but later opposed them when they claimed rights to the priesthood. Both the Pharisees and Essenes may have their origin in this religious sect. The Sadducees were perhaps connected with Zadok, a high priest appointed by David. Zadok’s descendants were regarded as the only legitimate priestly line; they were devoted above the Levites in <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.1-48.35">Ezekiel 40–48</a>. The Sadducees were a wealthy, aristocratic class that monopolized the high priesthood. They did not believe in angels, spirits, life after death, or the resurrection (<a href="?bref=Acts.23.8">Acts 23:8</a>), nor did they accept the validity of the oral law as developed by the Pharisees. They left no writings and disappeared with the destruction of the temple in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>The Pharisees (“separated ones”) first appear in our sources toward the end of the second century <span class="era">BC</span> and were involved primarily in political affairs. They represented the common people against the tyrannical Hasmonean ruler Alexander Janneus (103–76 <span class="era">BC</span>), who had hundreds of Pharisees executed in reprisal. By the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, the Pharisees seem wholly concerned with religious matters and were noted for the scrupulous observance of the Mosaic law as traditionally interpreted. On grounds of ritual purity, they separated themselves from other Jews who were not as scrupulous and who might contaminate them. Pharisees went about in groups called Haberim (“associates”) in which they were insulated from those who were lax religiously. In their zeal to remain faithful to the Mosaic law, the Pharisees developed an oral law (later erroneously attributed to Moses) that served as a fence around the Torah. This oral law was an interpretation and expansion of the 613 commands in the Mosaic law; it was finally compiled and reduced to written form as the Mishnah (“teaching”) in the late second century <span class="era">AD</span>. Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.22.3">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.6">23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.5">26:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Phil.3.5">Phil 3:5</a>) and many other early Christians were converts from Pharisaism (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">Acts 15:5</a>). Pharisaic Judaism survived the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70 to form the rabbinic Judaism that dominated Jewish religious life from the second century <span class="era">AD</span> to modern times.</p>
<p>The Essenes were another religious sect within Judaism that had its origins in the second century <span class="era">BC</span>. Like the Pharisees, the Essenes were concerned principally with maintaining ritual purity in obedience to the law of Moses. The Essenes lived and worked in Jewish society; they tried to influence people by the simple, altruistic life they followed. Some Essenes also lived in their own communities, to which they returned each night after work. There were numerous religious factions within Judaism, and one such group, which may only have had vague connections with the Essenes, established a community on the western shore of the Dead Sea. This group regarded itself as the true Israel and in the wilderness prepared for the final visitation of God by keeping themselves pure from all defilement. Many documents written by members of this sect were discovered in caves near the Dead Sea where they had been hidden just before the Romans destroyed the settlement. These documents, the Dead Sea Scrolls, have provided detailed information about this religious sect and its beliefs.</p>
<p>The Zealots were another Jewish sect, who may be related to the Sicarii (“dagger men”). This group of political activists flourished from <span class="era">AD</span> 6 to 66. Regarding God alone as their sovereign, they attempted to overthrow the Romans and those who collaborated with them by violent means, including assassination. They helped to foment the Jewish revolt of <span class="era">AD</span> 66–73 and perished with Jerusalem in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>Social class and status in first-century <span class="era">AD</span> Palestine were determined in accordance with the rules of ritual purity. The upper class comprised members of the religious establishment, such as the Sadducees, scribes, Pharisees, and Jerusalem priests. The Sanhedrin was a deliberative body whose membership was drawn from these groups. For all practical purposes there was no middle class. The lower class consisted primarily of the Am Ha Arez (“people of the land”)—Jews who were ignorant of the law through lack of education and who did not scrupulously observe those commandments with which they were familiar. The generally hostile attitude of the Pharisees toward the Am Ha Arez is expressed in <a href="?bref=John.7.49">John 7:49</a>: “But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). There was yet another social class in first-century Palestine, which can be designated as “untouchables.” This group was composed of Samaritans, tax collectors, prostitutes, shepherds, lepers, Gentiles, and perhaps worst of all, Jews who became as Gentiles (e.g., the prodigal son of <a href="?bref=Luke.15.11-32">Lk 15:11-32</a>). The rules of ritual purity as generally observed prevented any form of social contact between the upper class and the untouchables, and made contacts with the Am Ha Arez highly undesirable. Against this background, the horror of the Pharisees over Jesus’ association with tax collectors and sinners is throughly understandable (<a href="?bref=Mark.2.15-17">Mk 2:15-17</a>).</p>
<p>A further consequence of this religious criterion for determining social class and status was an uneasy tension between Jerusalem and the rural areas of Palestine, particularly Galilee, during the last two centuries of the second temple period. Those in Jerusalem regarded Galilee as a place where ignorance of the Torah was the rule (<a href="?bref=John.1.46">Jn 1:46</a>). Jerusalem was primarily a religious center, whose major industry was the temple cult. The total population of Jerusalem in the first century <span class="era">AD</span> has been estimated at 25,000 to 40,000. Most of these were either artisans and craftsmen devoted to building and adorning the temple (still incomplete before it was destroyed; see <a href="?bref=John.2.20">Jn 2:20</a>) or priests and Levites involved in the many ritual activities of the temple. Though Jews were expected to travel to Jerusalem for each of the three annual pilgrimage festivals, this requirement proved difficult for rural Palestinian farmers.</p>
<p>Further, the tithe demanded by Mosaic command was only on the produce of the land, not upon wages or bartered goods. The rural farmers, therefore, bore the brunt of this taxation and quite naturally resented the privileged position of urban artisans, merchants, and priests who were not obliged to tithe. The temptation not to tithe the produce of the land was very great, and many farmers succumbed to it. Their untithed produce was not kosher, and thus to be avoided by those, like the Pharisees, who were religiously scrupulous. In addition to the first and second tithes demanded of farmers (the second tithe had to be spent in the vicinity of Jerusalem), it has been estimated that Roman tax levies amounted to 10 to 15 percent of an individual’s income. Religious taxes, together with Roman taxes, added up to a crushing tax burden of from 25 to 30 percent. The fact that the Jews finally revolted against their Roman oppressors in <span class="era">AD</span> 66 is not difficult to comprehend. Throughout the first century <span class="era">AD</span>, in fact, minor revolts in Palestine occurred with predictable frequency. Many of these occurred during the three annual pilgrimage festivals in Jerusalem, when the normal population of 25,000 to 40,000 swelled to 500,000 or more. These festivals provided ideal opportunities for uprisings, and the Romans were particularly alert for such eventualities. Jesus was executed during one such Passover festival because he was suspected of being a political revolutionary (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.26">Mk 15:26</a>).</p>
<p>The second temple period provided the setting for the rise and fall of apocalypticism within Judaism. Apocalypticism (from a Greek word meaning “revelation”) was a kind of eschatology (“account of final events”) that assumed that ideal conditions could not be restored on earth unless God first intervened climactically to destroy evil (particularly foreign oppressors) and vindicate the righteous (Israel). Apocalyptic visionaries composed many documents, called apocalypses, in which they attempted to read the signs of the times and predict the coming of the visitation of God. Since there was a widespread consciousness that the era of prophecy was over, these apocalyptists wrote not under their own names but under the names of ancient Israelite worthies, such as Moses, Abraham, Enoch, and Ezra. Among the more significant expectations of Jewish apocalypticism were (1) the coming of a Messiah; (2) the coming of a great period of tribulation, sometimes called the messianic woes; (3) the resurrection of the just; (4) the judgment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous. Apocalyptic beliefs probably provided the motivation for most—if not all—of the Jewish revolts against the Romans.</p>

<p>Some portions of the Hebrew Scriptures were still in the process of composition at the beginning of the second temple period. The last three prophetic books—Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi—were written from the end of the sixth century to the mid fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>. Later rabbis expressed the opinion that the Spirit of God had been taken from Israel when these prophets ceased their labors. The Chronicler ends his work by referring to the decree of Cyrus (538 <span class="era">BC</span>), and both Ezra-Nehemiah and Esther appear to have been written in the fifth century <span class="era">BC</span>.</p>
<p>The second temple period witnessed not only the completion of those writings that were later regarded as inspired and authoritative in Judaism but also the full recognition of all 24 sacred books. Prior to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 <span class="era">BC</span>, the Mosaic law had not been observed with any consistency (according to <a href="?bref=2Kgs.22.1-20">2 Kgs 22</a> it had been mislaid for an unknown period of time), nor had the classical prophets always received appropriate recognition. But after 586 <span class="era">BC</span> the Torah occupied a position of unquestioned sanctity in the lives and thoughts of the Jewish people, replacing in many respects the temple cult even before its final dissolution in <span class="era">AD</span> 70.</p>
<p>The Jewish Scriptures are divided into three sections, designated by Jews with the acrostic “Tanak”: (1) Torah (“Law” or “Revelation”), (2) Nebi’im (“Prophets”), and (3) Kethubim (“Writings”). It is generally claimed that while the Law and Prophets enjoyed canonical status prior to the second century <span class="era">BC</span>, the Writings were finally declared canonical at the rabbinic council of Jamnia (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 90), though the historicity of this is disputed. The rabbis are thought to have discussed whether certain biblical books should continue to be part of Scripture. In reality, the Jewish canon of Scripture was fully defined from traditional usage by the first century <span class="era">BC</span>. The Law consisted of five books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The Prophets consisted of two sections, the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and the Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the 12 Minor Prophets). The Writings included Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Ruth, and Daniel. The total number of books in this canon is 24, identical with the Protestant canon of 39 books, since Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, and the 12 are each counted as only one book. The Alexandrian canon of Hellenistic Judaism was more extensive, and the extra books (called Apocrypha by Protestants) are all found in the Roman Catholic OT canon of 46 books.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheTalmudicPeriod">The Talmudic Period (<span class="era">AD</span> 73–425)</p>
<p class="h3">Historical Survey</p>
<p class="fl">According to Jewish legend, when the Romans were about to conquer Jerusalem in the revolt of <span class="era">AD</span> 66–73, a prominent Pharisee, Rabbi Johanan ben Zakkai, feigned death and his disciples were permitted to carry him out of the besieged city in a coffin. The more likely scenario is that he received permission from the Romans to move his school from Jerusalem to Jamnia, on the coast of Palestine. The temple cult and the priestly system had disappeared, and rabbinic academies such as that of Rabbi Johanan set themselves to the enormous task of reconstructing Judaism. The older Sanhedrin was reinstituted as the Beth Din (“Court of Law”), and Gamaliel II, a grandson of Hillel, who had presided over the old Sanhedrin, became its leader with the title Nasi (“prince”), or Patriarch. The patriarchate continued until <span class="era">AD</span> 425, when Emperor Theodosius II abolished the office upon the death of the last patriarch, Gamaliel VI. In Mesopotamia, Babylonian Judaism experienced a renaissance that lasted until the end of the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>. This period was called the Age of the Gaonim (“excellencies”) after the heads of the two great rabbinic academies at Sura and Pumpeditha. It was there that the great Babylonian Talmud was compiled by the fifth century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>In <span class="era">AD</span> 115 various Jewish communities throughout the eastern Mediterranean, including Egypt, Cyprus, and Cyrene, revolted against the Roman emperor Trajan. Without exception these revolts were all put down by Roman legions. Finally, when the emperor Hadrian was on the brink of founding the new city of Aelia Capitolina on the site of old Jerusalem, the Jews again revolted in <span class="era">AD</span> 132, led by a self-proclaimed messiah, Simeon Bar Koziba, who was called Bar-Kochba (“Son of a Star”) by his followers as an allusion to the messianic passage in <a href="?bref=Num.24.17">Numbers 24:17</a>. Bar-Kochba was aided by the famous rabbinic scholar Akiba. This revolt, though initially successful, was put down by the Romans under Julius Severus in 135. Shortly thereafter, Hadrian issued a decree banning all Jews from the new Aelia Capitolina.</p>
<p class="h3">Social and Religious Developments</p>
<p class="fl">During this period, the result of generations of rabbinical scholarship bore fruit with the compilation of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. The rabbinic sages consciously saw themselves as the heirs of the ancient Israelite prophets, who in turn were the heirs of the Mosaic law. They distinguished consciously between their own legal interpretations of the Mosaic law (which they called Halakah, or “walking,” i.e., a guide for life), and the commands in the Torah itself (called Mitvah, or “commandment”). The oral law, developed through generations of rabbinic discussion, was finally compiled and written down through the efforts of the patriarch Judah ha-Nasi (c. <span class="era">AD</span> 135–220) during the last quarter of the second century <span class="era">AD</span> and became known as the Mishnah (“teaching”). This is a topical arrangement of rabbinic discussions on such subjects as the Sabbath, firstfruits, sacrifices, and women. The Mishnah became the basis for further rabbinic discussion in both Palestine and Babylonia. The decisions of sages who flourished after the writing of the Mishnah were compiled about <span class="era">AD</span> 450 in Palestine and about 500 in Babylonia. This second stage beyond the Mishnah was called the Gemara (meaning either “completion” or “repetition”). The Mishnah and the Babylonian Gemara make up the Babylonian Talmud, while the same Mishnah with the Jerusalem or Palestinian Gemara comprises the Jerusalem Talmud. Yet another type of rabbinic literature is the Midrashim (“interpretations”), which either follow the order of a particular biblical book or consist of homilies on particular biblical texts. The Targums, paraphrastic translations of Scripture into the Aramaic language, finally came to be written down beginning in the late second century <span class="era">AD</span>.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the temple, rabbinic Judaism concentrated on the religious significance of the Torah and elevated scholarship to the central role that it still plays in Judaism. Rabbinic Judaism gradually exerted its influence upon diaspora Judaism under the initial leadership of Rabbi Johanan until a kind of rabbinic orthodoxy emerged during the second century. Christianity was one of the major ideological foes of rabbinic Judaism. In order to purge Jewish Christians from their midst, the rabbis introduced an additional benediction to the eighteen benedictions customarily recited at synagogue services. This 19th benediction was a curse upon the <span class="ital">minim</span> (Christians and other heretics), which Jewish Christians who attended synagogue services found impossible to recite. The line was firmly drawn between Judaism and Christianity by this device, which was employed late in the first century.</p>

<p class="h1">JUDAIZERS*</p>
<p class="fl">Christian Jews who, during the apostolic and early postapostolic periods, attempted to impose the Jewish way of life on gentile Christians. The Greek verb, which literally means “to Judaize,” is found only one time in the NT (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.14">Gal 2:14</a>), where it actually means “to live according to Jewish customs and traditions.” In that passage Paul quotes part of a brief conversation he had with Peter several years earlier: “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews [i.e., to Judaize]?” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The issue that concerned Paul was not simply whether or not a person followed the Jewish way of life but whether one erroneously thought that salvation was attained thereby.</p>
<p>In the early days of Christianity, most—if not all—Christians were Jews prior to their conversion to Christianity. The few who were originally Gentiles, such as Nicolaus of Antioch (<a href="?bref=Acts.6.5">Acts 6:5</a>), had converted to Judaism before turning to Christianity. At that time, conversion to Judaism was accomplished through three separate steps: (1) circumcision (for males); (2) a ritual bath in water; and (3) agreement to take upon oneself the “yoke of the law,” that is, to obey the 613 commands of the Mosaic law as interpreted and expanded in Jewish Halakah (rabbinic legal decisions). Following Jewish customs and traditions and observing Jewish religious laws was a normal way of life for Jewish Christians, whether they were Jews by birth or through conversion. For them, belief in Jesus as the Messiah of Jewish expectation enhanced, but did not replace, their Judaism. Christianity was not regarded as a religion distinct from Judaism but rather as the truest form of Judaism. These Jewish Christians had all been circumcised as infants, or upon conversion to Judaism, and they also practiced the kosher dietary laws and rules of ritual purity prescribed in Mosaic legislation and rabbinic tradition. Further, they continued to worship at the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.3.1">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.26">21:26</a>) until its destruction by the Romans in <span class="era">AD</span> 70, and certain Jewish Christians continued to meet in synagogues (see <a href="?bref=Jas.2.2">Jas 2:2</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span> mg).</p>
<p>While earliest Christianity began as a predominantly Jewish movement, it soon expanded into the Greco-Roman world. Jewish Christians were forced to leave Jerusalem as a result of persecutions (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.1">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.11.19-24">11:19-24</a>), and they proclaimed the gospel wherever they went. Philip was responsible for bringing the gospel to Samaria, where many Samaritans became Christians (<a href="?bref=Acts.8.4-25">8:4-25</a>). On the Day of Pentecost, many Jews from places all over the Roman world became converts to the Christian faith (<a href="?bref=Acts.2.5-11">2:5-11</a>). Presumably, when these newly converted Jewish Christians returned to their homes, they carried the gospel with them. Although the origin of the Christian community in Rome is shrouded in obscurity, this is probably how the gospel first came to Rome. One of the central concerns of Luke, the author of Acts, is to show how Christianity, which began as a small, persecuted sect of Judaism in Jerusalem, spread throughout the Roman world; in so doing, it was rejected by Jews and embraced by Gentiles. The major turning point in Acts is in chapter <a href="?bref=Acts.10.1-48">10</a>, where Peter is the means whereby the Roman centurion Cornelius, together with his entire household, accepted the gospel and began to manifest the gifts of the Holy Spirit. According to <a href="?bref=Acts.10.45">Acts 10:45</a>, “The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out upon the Gentiles, too” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>).</p>
<p>The growing number of gentile converts to Christianity forced Jewish Christians to face a very difficult problem: Must a Gentile first become a Jew in order to be a Christian? Some Jewish Christians gave a positive answer to this question, and these became known as the circumcision party (<a href="?bref=Acts.11.2">Acts 11:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.2.12">Gal 2:12</a>). Others, such as Peter and Barnabas, and especially Paul, vigorously disagreed. While these two radically different points of view could have split the early church into two major factions, that possibility did not occur. Luke tells the story of how, after a successful first missionary journey (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.1-14.28">Acts 13:1–14:28</a>), Paul and Barnabas reported to the church at Antioch how God had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles (<a href="?bref=Acts.14.27">Acts 14:27</a>). Opposition from the Judaizers in the circumcision party was soon felt, however, since some of them had come to Antioch from Judea for the express purpose of advocating the idea that circumcision was absolutely necessary for salvation (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.1">15:1</a>). Many Jewish Christians had, like Paul, once been Pharisees. These former Pharisees were particularly insistent that new converts who were Gentiles be circumcised and charged to keep the law of Moses (v <a href="?bref=Acts.15.5">5</a>). They were really demanding that Gentiles become converted to Judaism in order to be Christians.</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas debated with members of the circumcision party before an assembly of apostles and elders in Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Acts.15.4-12">Acts 15:4-12</a>). The assembly, led by James the Just (the brother of Jesus), listened to both sides and decided to issue a compromise. A letter to the gentile churches was drafted in which it was recommended that gentile converts to Christianity adhere to only a few absolutely essential obligations: (1) abstention from meat sacrificed to idols, (2) abstention from eating blood or blood-saturated meat, and (3) abstention from unchastity (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.15.23-29">23-29</a>). These three obligations were probably singled out because they were thought to have been important features of those laws regarded as part of the covenant between God and Noah according to Jewish tradition. Since Noah was the ancestor of all mankind, Gentiles as well as Jews, such laws had universal validity. The Mosaic covenant, on the other hand, was incumbent only upon Jews, not upon Gentiles. For this reason the Jerusalem Council determined that abstention from meat sacrificed to idols, blood-saturated meat, and unchastity applied to all Christians, whereas the obligation of circumcision did not.</p>
<p>Judging from the remainder of the book of Acts, it might be supposed that the decision of the Jerusalem Council was satisfactory to the Judaizers of the circumcision party. However, from the details provided by Paul in many of his letters, we find that this was not the case. After Paul briefly summarizes the results of the Jerusalem Council for the Galatian Christians (<a href="?bref=Gal.2.1-10">Gal 2:1-10</a>), he relates how, even after the Jerusalem Council, the Judaizers of the circumcision party were sufficiently powerful to cause even Peter and Barnabas to temporarily isolate themselves from gentile Christians. (According to rabbinic purity laws, one would become religiously impure if one ate with Gentiles.) The major reason Paul wrote the Letter to the Galatians was to combat Judaizers who had apparently invaded the Christian communities in Galatia after his departure. These Judaizers appear to have successfully persuaded some of the Galatian Christians that salvation was available only for those who were circumcised and who kept the Mosaic law (<a href="?bref=Gal.5.12">5:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.6.13">6:13</a>). At least some of the problems experienced by the Corinthian church appear to have been caused by Judaizers (<a href="?bref=2Cor.11.12-15,22">2 Cor 11:12–15, 22</a>), and they had infected the Christian community at Philippi (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.2-3">Phil 3:2-3</a>). Judaizers also appear to have made some progress in the church at Colosse. Therefore, according to <a href="?bref=Col.2.16-17">Colossians 2:16-17</a>, “Let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath. These are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>).</p>
<p>Of all the early apostles and elders, Paul was the one who most consistently opposed the Judaizers’ view that Gentiles must first become Jews in order to be Christians. His dramatic conversion to Christianity, narrated three times in Acts (<a href="?bref=Acts.9.1-9">9:1-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.22.6-16">22:6-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.12-23">26:12-23</a>) and occasionally referred to by Paul himself (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.1">1 Cor 9:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.15.8">15:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gal.1.11-17">Gal 1:11-17</a>), convinced him that salvation could be achieved only through faith in Christ. Since Jesus was the <span class="ital">only</span> way, all other means by which persons sought to obtain salvation were necessarily invalid and illegitimate. Paul was fully aware that it was not because of the fact that he was an observant Jew that he had become justified before God (<a href="?bref=Phil.3.2-11">Phil 3:2-11</a>) but through his faith in Christ. Primarily because of the persistent activity of the Judaizers, Paul had to insist frequently on the invalidity of the law and the validity of faith as the means of being justified before God. This theme dominates his letters to the Romans and the Galatians.</p>
<p>Jewish Christianity gradually withered and disappeared, and with it went the insistence of the Judaizers that Gentiles live according to Jewish customs and traditions in order to receive salvation. The center of Jewish Christianity had traditionally been Jerusalem. Just before the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple at the end of the Jewish revolt of <span class="era">AD</span> 66–70, many Jewish Christians fled to Pella in obedience to a divine revelation. The ill-fated revolt of Bar-Kochba (<span class="era">AD</span> 132–135) further weakened the movement, when Jewish Christians experienced persecution at the hands of the Jewish insurgents. Thereafter Jewish Christianity grew weaker and eventually disappeared. With its disappearance the persistent notion that Gentiles must first become Jews in order to be Christians also died.</p>

<p class="h1">JUDAS</p>
<p class="list">1. Simon’s son, surnamed Iscariot; one of the 12 disciples of Jesus. The derivation of Iscariot is uncertain. In all probability it designated the place of his birth, the town of Kerioth. His childhood home was perhaps Kerioth of Moab, east of the Jordan (<a href="?bref=Jer.48.24">Jer 48:24</a>; <a href="?bref=Amos.2.2">Am 2:2</a>), or Kerioth-hezron of southern Judah, also known as Hazor (<a href="?bref=Josh.15.25">Jos 15:25</a>). A less feasible suggestion identifies Iscariot with an Aramaic word meaning “assassin,” a word eventually attached to Judas’s name because of his betrayal of Jesus.</p>
<p class="list-text">Judas Iscariot’s name appears last in the list of disciples (<a href="?bref=Matt.10.4">Mt 10:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.3.19">Mk 3:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.6.16">Lk 6:16</a>), perhaps indicating his ignominy in the minds of later believers rather than his original importance among the Twelve. During Jesus’ public ministry, he managed the treasury of the group (<a href="?bref=John.13.29">Jn 13:29</a>), from which he was known to pilfer money (<a href="?bref=John.12.6">12:6</a>). As a betrayer, Judas contracted to turn Jesus over to the chief priests for 30 pieces of silver. He accomplished this act of treachery by singling out Jesus with a kiss in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="?bref=Matt.26.14-47">Mt 26:14-47</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.14.10-46">Mk 14:10-46</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.22.3-48">Lk 22:3-48</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.2-5">Jn 18:2-5</a>).</p>
<p class="list-text">Various suggestions have been offered to explain Judas’s traitorous deed. (1) In keeping with his patriotic zeal, Judas turned Jesus over to the authorities after realizing that his Master did not intend to overthrow the Roman order and establish a Jewish state. (2) Judas believed Jesus to be the Messiah and planned his arrest in hope of urging Jesus to usher in his kingdom. (3) He was a scoundrel who had plotted wickedness since the start of Jesus’ public ministry. (4) Prompted by a satanic impulse, Judas betrayed Jesus; however, after recognizing that he was deceived, out of remorse he took his own life. (5) With damaged pride and humiliated ego from Jesus’ caustic rebukes, Judas, originally a loyal disciple, turned against him. (6) Judas, moved by his own greed, yielded to his selfish instincts, not realizing that Jesus would consequently be tried and killed; upon learning the outcome of his betrayal, he repented in despair and committed suicide.</p>
<p class="list-text">Judas, despondent over his act of betrayal, went out and hung himself in a field bought with his 30 pieces of silver (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.3-10">Mt 27:3-10</a>). <a href="?bref=Acts.1.18">Acts 1:18</a> gruesomely adds that his body burst open, spilling out his intestines; for this reason the field was called the “Field of Blood” (<a href="?bref=Acts.1.19">Acts 1:19</a>).

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The Letter of Jude states that it was written by “Jude . . . [the] brother of James” (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.1">1:1</a>). Many scholars understand this nomenclature to designate Jude (Greek “Judas”), Jesus’ brother, whose brother James became the leader of the Jerusalem church. But other scholars think that perhaps another Jude wrote it, or some later author wrote it in the spirit of the leader whom he revered. The hypothesis that another Jude wrote it seems unlikely, for the apostle Jude (<a href="?bref=Luke.6.16">Lk 6:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.1.13">Acts 1:13</a>) is the son of a certain James, not a brother of James; besides, <a href="?bref=Jude.1.17">Jude 1:17</a> appears to distinguish Jude from the apostles. And since there was only one James who was prominent in the early church, James the Lord’s brother, it would be hard to believe that some other Jude would have a brother named James and would use such an identification in the title; it would have been too confusing. The title “brother of James” most likely means that Jude was James of Jerusalem’s brother and therefore Jesus’ brother; he did not use the title “brother of our Lord,” perhaps, as Clement of Alexandria said, out of modesty.</p>
<p>The idea that a later author wrote using Jude’s name presents a major problem: Why would he pick such an obscure name, instead of Paul or Peter or James, and why would he not use a more exalted and authoritative title? We must conclude that, despite the difficulties of date and background, Judas the Lord’s brother wrote this letter.</p>
<p class="h2" id="DateOriginandDestination">Date, Origin, and Destination</p>
<p class="fl">About date, origin, and destination, the letter says nothing directly. Since the content of the faith is clearly fixed (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.3">Jude 1:3</a>) and the recipients have personally heard the apostles (who may have died already, v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.17">17</a>), the date is probably between <span class="era">AD</span> 60 and 100.</p>
<p>Presumably, Jude traveled (with his wife and family) to promote the faith (<a href="?bref=1Cor.9.5">1 Cor 9:5</a>). Throughout his travels, he may have established some churches—or, at least, he probably taught at various local churches. It may be that he heard of false teachers infiltrating these churches and was prompted to write them this epistle.</p>
<p>Jude may have written from Galilee in his old age, or perhaps he had returned to Jerusalem. The best guess we can make about the recipients would be that they were members of Jewish-Christian churches in Syria. Still, these locations remain little more than guesses.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Background">Background</p>
<p class="fl">Three facts about the Letter of Jude make its background difficult to reconstruct. First, it is hard to be sure what type of heresy it was combating. Some scholars believe that this was early Gnosticism, and others that it was simply teaching infiltrated with ethical error. If the heretics were Gnostics, they believed in a hierarchy of angels or demigods. In this case they probably saw Jesus as a lower rung on the way to salvation. Perhaps they also considered God to be the lower creator (the demiurge) and spoke of wanting to serve the true God (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.4">Jude 1:4</a>). This might explain the interest in angels and demons (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.8">8</a>) and the stress on the unity of God (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.25">25</a>). But probably these were simply people who had found a way to rationalize immoral behavior and were unwisely mocking the evil powers. There is no clear evidence that they were Gnostic, while there is plenty of evidence that people turned the freedom of the gospel into an excuse for sin (e.g., <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">Rom 6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-6.20">1 Cor 5–6</a>). These teachers probably denied Christ by failing to follow his ethical teaching, and their blasphemy of angels (while they themselves were deep in sin) was another ethical sin. Such depravity is enough to explain the letter; however, knowing that doctrinal and ethical error often go hand in hand, we must not discount the possibility that some doctrinal error was also involved.</p>
<p>Second, Jude surprises us by quoting from two apocryphal books, the Assumption of Moses (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.4">Jude 1:4</a>) and 1 Enoch (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.14-15">Jude 1:14-15</a> quotes 1 Enoch 1:9). This fact and other allusions in the book reveal that Jude and probably his readers were well read in Jewish apocryphal literature. Moreover, it also shows that Jude regarded books outside the canon of the OT as transmitting true traditions and authoritative prophecy. That Jude accepted these books is not surprising, since many apocryphal books were used by Jews of that period, alongside the OT, as a type of devotional literature. Early Christians often included apocryphal literature along with canonical books as part of their Bibles (sometimes they would also omit NT books that were not yet considered authentic). The canon of NT Scripture was not firmly established until the third century, long after Jude’s epistle was written.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that while Jude probably believed in the historicity of these citations, the teaching of the letter does not depend on that historicity. Jude wrote about neither Moses nor Enoch but about how one should behave toward authorities (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.8">Jude 1:8</a>) and what God will do to ungodly people (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.13">13</a>). The citations illustrate Jude’s teaching and probably carried weight with his first readers, but the fact that they are apocryphal should bother us no more than Paul’s quotations from pagan writers or the writer of Hebrews’ allusions to 2 Maccabees (<a href="?bref=Acts.17.1-34">Acts 17</a>; <a href="?bref=Titus.1.12">Ti 1:12</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.35">Heb 11:35</a>). The authority of Scripture rests in the point the author is making.</p>
<p>Third, Jude shows such a close relationship to <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.1-22">2 Peter 2</a> that either Jude is an expansion of 2 Peter 2 or else 2 Peter 2 is an abbreviation of Jude. Words, phrases, and illustrations are essentially identical in the two works. While it is hard to determine who borrowed from whom, probably the author of 2 Peter has adapted the strong denunciations of Jude to the more instructive tone of his work. It would be hard to imagine anyone writing Jude if 2 Peter already existed. Christians should have no problem with this borrowing, for no writer of Scripture believed himself so original that he could not borrow from other Scriptures, from hymns, or from noncanonical literature. It is no more a problem for God to inspire a quotation or adaptation from another writing than for him to inspire a new composition. Indeed, some passages in Scripture are total repetitions of others (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.18.1-50">Ps 18</a> and <a href="?bref=2Sam.22.1-51">2 Sm 22</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">Jude describes his work in terms of exhortation or encouragement (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.3">Jude 1:3</a>). Obviously he wanted to strengthen the churches against false teachers who were perverting the gospel. Thus, he repeatedly urged the believers to hold fast or guard their purity and the gospel (vv <a href="?bref=Jude.1.3,20-21,24">3, 20-21, 24</a>). Yet he did not want the teachers simply kicked out, for he had hopes that the believers would be able to rescue some from this danger, although the rescue itself would be dangerous work (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.23">23</a>).</p>
<p>In framing his exhortation the author did not produce any new doctrines; rather, he underlined some old ones: (1) He stressed the ethical nature of the gospel and the need to maintain purity in life and speech. (2) He showed a high regard for salvation through Christ and a strong belief in one God. (3) He demanded respect for authority, both temporal and spiritual (vv <a href="?bref=Jude.1.8-11">8-11</a>). (4) He had a clear apocalyptic belief, stressing the coming last judgment (vv <a href="?bref=Jude.1.14-15">14-15</a>) and affirming that the last days had already come (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.18">18</a>). (5) He warned of the necessity to persevere in the faith both doctrinally and ethically (vv <a href="?bref=Jude.1.19-21">19-21</a>). (6) He demonstrated zeal to reclaim those who had erred, for they were outside the grace of God (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.23">23</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">Salutation (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.1-2">1:1-2</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The author identifies himself humbly as a servant of Jesus Christ and addresses his letter to the faithful in the church—those who are loved, guarded, and called by God and Christ.</p>
<p class="h3">Called to Hold to the Faith (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.3-4">1:3-4</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jude had been planning to write these Christians about “the salvation we all share” (v <a href="?bref=Jude.1.3">3</a>). We will never know what instruction he had planned to give, for in the middle of his preparations he heard news that forced him to change his plans. Instead, he penned an epistle in defense of “the faith”—that is, the true apostolic teachings concerning Jesus Christ that all genuine believers embrace. Some people had joined the church, perhaps with ulterior motives, who were dangerous to the church. The Christians must fight hard to keep pure the body of doctrine (meaning ethics as well as theology) that they had received from Jude and the apostles. Jude makes two charges against these false believers: (1) they had perverted God’s grace into licentiousness, perhaps openly flaunting sexual sins as a sign of freedom they had in Christ (cf. <a href="?bref=Rom.6.1-23">Rom 6</a>; <a href="?bref=1Cor.5.1-6.20">1 Cor 5–6</a>); and (2) they denied the Lord Jesus (by failing to follow his teachings).</p>
<p class="h3">Reminder of God’s Judgment (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.5-7">1:5-7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Since the recipients were probably Jewish Christians, they had learned the OT and Jewish tradition well. The author chose three illustrations of the results of apostasy: (1) Judgment can come to those once considered as God’s people (as it did to those “saved” from Egypt, <a href="?bref=Exod.32.28">Ex 32:28</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.11.33-34">Nm 11:33-34</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.14.29-35">14:29-35</a>). (2) The consequence of apostasy is eternal damnation (as in the case of the fallen angels of 1 Enoch 6–16—these ideas appear in other Jewish traditions as well). (3) Ethical corruption is in fact a type of apostasy and thus merits damnation (as in the case of Sodom—<a href="?bref=Gen.19.1-38">Gn 19</a>; <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.4-6">2 Pt 2:4-6</a>). The author stressed the homosexuality of Sodom rather than its injustice, which <a href="?bref=Ezek.16.49">Ezekiel 16:49</a> condemns, so perhaps sexual misbehavior was a problem with the false teachers. These three illustrations drive home the seriousness of the problems that the church was facing.</p>
<p class="h3">Denunciation of the False Teachers (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.8-16">1:8-16</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Pet.2.10-17">2 Pt 2:10-17</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The false teachers claimed to have received revelations in dreams as the basis of their evil behavior. Their sins were (1) sexual impurity (including, but not limited to, homosexuality); (2) rejection of Christ’s authority (as embodied in his ethical teaching); and (3) evil speech about angels (whether good ones, which is probably the case, or evil). This latter practice is shown to be sin by an example from the Assumption of Moses: even an archangel rebuking the devil himself would not use the language these teachers used about angels. But since these people were unspiritual, they were totally ignorant of what they insulted (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.2.7-16">1 Cor 2:7-16</a>), yet they were experts in bodily sin—like savage animals. Their sin was destroying them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the teachers were just like Cain (the embodiment of violence, lust, greed, and rebellion against God in Jewish tradition), Balaam (who tried to make money by leading people into sin—<a href="?bref=Num.31.16">Nm 31:16</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.23.4">Dt 23:4</a>), and Korah (who rebelled against God’s authority in Moses—<a href="?bref=Num.16.1-50">Nm 16</a>). They were also dangerous to the believers, for they were turning the meal, which was part of the love feast and Lord’s Table (Eucharist), into an orgy (cf. <a href="?bref=1Cor.11.20-22">1 Cor 11:20-22</a>), and would thereby corrupt the practice of the rest of the church. They cared only for themselves and were devoid of real spiritual gifts from God (like waterless clouds or the dead trees of winter, cf. <a href="?bref=Luke.13.6-9">Lk 13:6-9</a>), being ready for the second death (their fate was so sure that it is seen as having already happened). They produced only evil deeds; in this they are like the fallen angels (stars are considered angels in Jewish tradition—1 Enoch 18:13-16; 21:1-10).</p>
<p>The prophecy of Enoch in 1 Enoch 1:9 shows the certainty of their doom. Originally, the prophecy spoke of God coming in judgment, but Jude made it refer to Christ, who for Christians is the coming judge (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31">Mt 25:31</a>). Christ will come with the angelic hosts and execute justice on sinners for their sins (both evil deeds and evil words). That prophecy pertains to people who grumble or accuse God, as Israel did (<a href="?bref=Exod.16.7-12">Ex 16:7-12</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.17.3">17:3</a>); it also applies to people who do whatever they desire, are loud-mouthed, yet flatter when it is to their advantage.</p>
<p class="h3">Instructions for the Faithful (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.17-23">1:17-23</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Faithful Christians must remember that the apostles (here meaning the Twelve, not the wider circle of apostles that included Paul, Barnabas, and others) had predicted just such a situation when they were alive: in the last days there would be scoffers, who would do any ungodly act they desired (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.3">2 Pt 3:3</a>). These false teachers are such people. They divide the church, and although they claim to be spiritual and receive dreams, they are totally worldly, for they do not possess the Holy Spirit. The faithful must watch out that they remain in the love of God and do not drift into rebellion as these heretics have. This is done by (1) building themselves up (as opposed to causing divisions) on the basis of the faith, the apostolic teaching, and example; (2) praying in the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Eph.6.18">Eph 6:18</a>), which sets them off from those not having the Spirit; and (3) waiting expectantly for the mercy Jesus would show them in the soon-coming Last Judgment (1 Enoch 27:3-4).</p>
<p>Yet the Christians must still deal with those influenced by the false teaching. While the Greek text here is very uncertain (it is not clear whether Jude had two or three groups in mind), Jude probably intended that the church should act mercifully toward those who were wavering over whether to follow the false teaching, restore those it could from the followers of the false teaching as if snatching them from hell, and while keeping a merciful attitude (a readiness to accept them back quickly if they repented), strictly avoid any social contact with the unrepentant out of fear of God’s judgment.</p>
<p class="h3">Benediction (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.24-25">1:24-25</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jude closes with a doxology very much like that found in <a href="?bref=Rom.16.25-27">Romans 16:25-27</a>. In the midst of many who have fallen from the faith, God is praised as the one who is able to keep the believers from falling and to bring them safely into his very presence. It is to this one who is alone God our Savior through Jesus Christ (meaning God saves us by means of Jesus) that the four attributes—glory, majesty, dominion, and authority—belong, now and forever.</p>

<p class="h1">JUDEA, JUDEANS</p>
<p class="fl">“Land of the Jews,” particularly after the Captivity. Since most of the Israelites who returned from the exile were from the tribe of Judah, they were called Judeans or Jews and their land, Judea. This part of the Holy Land has always been of great interest to the Bible student because of the location of such places as Jerusalem and Bethlehem within the area and because of the events of Christ’s life and ministry that occurred here.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Definition">Definition</p>
<p class="fl">First used in <a href="?bref=Ezra.5.8">Ezra 5:8</a>, the term there designates a province of the Persian Empire. It is also spoken of in the literature of the Maccabean period after Greece had taken control of the area from the Persians (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.5.45">1 Macc 5:45</a>; <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=1Macc.7.10">7:10</a>). In Roman times Judea was annexed to the Roman province of Syria until the time of Herod the Great, who was declared king of Judea in about 37 <span class="era">BC</span>. On occasion, the term Judea seems to mean all the territory occupied by the Jewish nation, that is, all of western Palestine (<a href="?bref=Luke.23.5">Lk 23:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.10.37">Acts 10:37</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.26.20">26:20</a>). Secular writers of NT times, including Strabo, Tacitus, and Philo, used the term in the wider sense. But in its ordinary and strict sense it denoted the southern district of Palestine. The other two districts or divisions were Galilee in the north and Samaria in the center.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Geography">Geography</p>
<p class="fl">While the geographic boundaries of Judea were not always the same in different historical periods, the province did include the territories once belonging to the tribes of Judah, Dan, Benjamin, and Simeon. The northern boundary, separating Judea and Samaria, is less definite than the others since there is no natural geographic barrier—no valley, no body of water, no break in the terrain—to indicate a division. It is thought, however, that the northern boundary line ran from Joppa on the Mediterranean to a point on the Jordan River about 10 to 12 miles (16 to 19 kilometers) north of the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>The southern boundary extended from a point about seven miles (11 kilometers) southwest of Gaza near the coast through Beersheba to the Dead Sea. According to <a href="?bref=Judg.20.1">Judges 20:1</a>, Beersheba was the southern boundary of the nation, and it is therefore properly considered the southern limit of Judea. The eastern boundary was the Dead Sea, and the western boundary the Mediterranean Sea. Judea therefore was in shape a square of territory approximately 45 miles (72 kilometers) wide on each side.</p>
<p class="h2" id="History">History</p>
<p class="fl">The history of Judea begins in the Persian period (539–331 <span class="era">BC</span>), when Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to rebuild their temple and their holy city of Jerusalem. In the Greek period (334–167 <span class="era">BC</span>) the area came under the control of the Seleucids, descendants of one of Alexander’s generals who ruled in Syria. Their attempts to destroy the Jewish religion led to a Jewish revolt under the leadership of the Hasmonean family, and the Jews enjoyed nearly a hundred years of independence (167–63 <span class="era">BC</span>). In 63 <span class="era">BC</span> Pompey conquered Palestine for Rome, and eventually Herod the Great was made king (37–4 <span class="era">BC</span>), being succeeded by his son Herod Archelaus (4 <span class="era">BC</span>–<span class="era">AD</span> 6). The Romans then appointed a series of imperial governors called procurators, and these ruled Judea, Samaria, and Idumea (south of Judea) until the Jewish revolt of 66–70, with the exception of the years 41 to 44, when the grandson of Herod the Great, Herod Agrippa I, ruled all of Palestine.</p>
<p>The fate of Judea has been the fate of all Palestine, and it has continued to know many cruel conquerors since the close of NT times. The country was under the heel of Rome until 330, when it came under Constantinople, or Byzantium, and saw the building of many Christian churches (330–634). The Persians again invaded (607–629), destroying Christian churches and killing many people. The Arab period (634–1099) saw the coming of Muslim control of Judea, which was interrupted by the Crusaders (1099–1263), who were determined to rescue the Holy Land from the Muslims. After the final defeat of the Crusaders, the Muslims regained control until the modern period (1917–present). After World War I, Judea was a part of the British mandate over Palestine. In 1948 it was partitioned between Israel and Jordan, and as a result of Israel’s victories in the Six Day War of June 1967, Judea was reunited and came once again under the control of the Jews.</p>

Moses appointed other judges to assist him, taking only the difficult cases himself (<a href="?bref=Exod.18.13-26">Ex 18:13-26</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.9-17">Dt 1:9-17</a>). Samuel went on circuit judging cases (<a href="?bref=1Sam.7.16-17">1 Sm 7:16-17</a>); his sons became judges too (<a href="?bref=1Sam.8.1">8:1</a>). During the monarchy period, the office of judge was well established.</p>
<p>In the NT era two kinds of courts operated in Palestine, the Jewish and the Roman. Capital cases were tried before a Roman judge. Witnesses were produced at trials (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.16">Mt 18:16</a>; <a href="?bref=2Cor.13.1">2 Cor 13:1</a>; <a href="?bref=1Tim.5.19">1 Tm 5:19</a>). Jesus himself was tried before Pontius Pilate, the Roman procurator (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.11-25">Mt 27:11-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.15.2-5">Mk 15:2-5</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.23.2-3">Lk 23:2-3</a>; <a href="?bref=John.18.29-40">Jn 18:29-40</a>), and Paul before Felix (<a href="?bref=Acts.24.1-26">Acts 24:1-26</a>) and Festus (<a href="?bref=Acts.25.1-26">25:1-26</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">JUDGES, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">Old Testament book named after the prominent leaders raised up by the Lord to deliver his people. The word “judge” in Hebrew also denotes the activity of governance, including warfare. Some scholars have argued that there were two kinds of judges: charismatic deliverers (or major judges) and local judicial sages (minor judges). It is uncertain why some judges receive cursory attention, whereas the exploits of other judges are given in great detail.</p>

<p class="h2" id="Author">Author</p>
<p class="fl">The book reflects a final editing of the material in the period of the early monarchy. It may well be a polemic for the righteous rule of David over against the kingship of Saul, which was molded by a secular, Canaanite conception of kingship rather than by the law of God. The author was almost certainly not Samuel, as traditionally thought, but a later compiler who relied on ancient written materials.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Date">Date</p>
<p class="fl">Though the judges succeeded in giving the tribes some rest from the incursions of surrounding enemies, the Israelites were continually harassed over long periods of time. Scholarly opinion differs on the duration of the period of the judges. The dating of the exodus affects the dating of the beginning of the judges. Those who take an early date for the exodus put the beginning around 1370–1360 <span class="era">BC</span>, whereas others propose a date close to the end of the 13th century <span class="era">BC</span>. A related issue pertains to the chronology of the judges. Does Judges give a chronological, sequential account of the period, or is the book a representative account of judges from various parts of Canaan and Transjordan who “judged” a region, a tribe, or several tribes simultaneously?</p>
<p class="h2" id="LiteraryFramework">Literary Framework</p>
<p class="fl">There is no doubt that the stories in the book bear the marks of literary creativity. The stories are classics in their own right. The poetry of Deborah’s song (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">Jgs 5</a>) is very moving, and the fable of Jotham (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.8-15">9:8-15</a>) is a fine example of figurative speech. The care given to the stories is also reflected in the construction of the book. There are two introductions: a political one (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-2.5">Jgs 1:1–2:5</a>) and a socioreligious one (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.6-3.6">2:6–3:6</a>). The political introduction connects Judges with the story of the Conquest, when the tribes attempted to occupy the land. It prepares the reader for the political and military problems of the era of the judges. The socioreligious introduction explains why Israel had so many adversities, why the institution of the judges arose, and why the Lord never gave Israel the promised lasting rest from its enemies. The main body of the book is the story of the judges (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.7-16.31">3:7–16:31</a>). References to the minor judges (six in all) are set within the stories of the major judges in increasing frequency. As is evident from the schema, the number of minor judges increased in frequency in proportion to the decrease in number of major judges: two major, one minor; two major, two minor; one major, three minor; one major. There is a total of 12 judges, representative of the 12 tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>The purpose of the listing of 12 judges, representative of the various parts of Canaan and Transjordan, is to demonstrate that all tribes throughout the conquered territories experienced grave difficulties from a variety of enemies: Arameans, Moabites, Ammonites, Amalekites, Canaanites, and Philistines. Israel was hard pressed on nearly all its frontiers. The appendixes (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-21.25">17–21</a>), together with the two introductions, form the framework of the book. The political and socioreligious problems (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-3.6">1:1–3:6</a>) are presented by way of several stories in the last chapters. The final editor who gave the book its canonical shape purposefully framed the stories of the judges so as to show lack of movement. The successes of the previous stages in redemptive history came to a standstill in the ebb and flow of the judges. Though the Lord delivered his people in many ways, they returned to the problems described in <a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-3.6">1:1–3:6</a>. The appendixes describe Israel’s problems representative of the period of the judges, when “there was no king in Israel” (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.6">17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1">18:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1">19:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.21.25">21:25</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PurposeandTheologicalTeaching">Purpose and Theological Teaching</p>
<p class="fl">The cycle of apostasy, judgment, cry for deliverance, and God’s raising up of a judge reflects a deuteronomic perspective with its warnings concerning disobedience and judgment. The repetitiveness of the cycle supports the contention of the anonymous narrator that Israel remained unchanged by the grace of God. However, in spite of the moral, religious, and political anarchy as well as the civil wars, the last chapter shows that the tribes are still concerned with each other’s welfare. Though the unity of God’s people has been gravely challenged, the situation is not hopeless. The book ends on a note of hope—hope for a king who may deliver Israel.</p>
<include_items src="../Charts/Charts.xml" name="CycleOfOppressionAndDeliveranceInTheBookOfJudges"/>
<p>Thus, there are several purposes of the book: (1) to demonstrate the meaninglessness of this stage in Israel’s development; (2) to explain why the tribes did not occupy all the land promised to the patriarchs; (3) to justify the way of God, who was gracious and patient with Israel’s repeated acts of disobedience; (4) to set forth the legitimacy of a “shepherd” king in contrast to a despotic form of kingship; and (5) to explain the urgent need for a new momentum, lest Israel succumb to the Philistines and intertribal warfare.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Content">Content</p>
<p class="h3">The Political Introduction (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.1-2.5">1:1–2:5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">In <a href="?bref=Josh.1.1-12.24">Joshua 1–12</a> the warfare under Joshua is portrayed as a mobilization of Canaanite forces against Israel. By the intervention of the Lord, the Canaanite resistance was put down and the land was occupied by the tribes (chs <a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-21.45">13–21</a>). <a href="?bref=Josh.13.1-21.45">Joshua 13–21</a>, however, clearly shows that each tribe had problems ridding its territory of pockets of Canaanite resistance, which were usually centered around heavily guarded and well-fortified cities (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.13.2-6,13">13:2-6, 13</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.15.63">15:63</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.16.10">16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.17.12-18">17:12-18</a>).</p>
<p>The book of Joshua emphasizes the successes and minimizes the problems, whereas the prologue to Judges sets the stage for the whole book by openly addressing Israel’s problems and failures. As the book unfolds, it is precisely these problems and failures that in due time bring Israel to the brink of disaster.</p>
<p>The period of the judges began with the death of Joshua (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.1">Jgs 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.2.8-9">2:8-9</a>). The Israelites had inherited a legacy from Joshua: the law of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.6">Jos 23:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.24.26">24:26</a>), the land, a challenge to obey the Lord (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.14-27">24:14-27</a>), and a promise of God’s presence and help in subduing the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Josh.23.5,10">23:5, 10</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Judah and Simeon (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.2-20">Jgs 1:2-20</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The prominence of Judah and Caleb parallels the position of Judah in Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.14.6-15.63">Jos 14:6–15:63</a>; cf. also the house of Joseph, <a href="?bref=Judg.1.22-29">Jgs 1:22-29</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.16.1-17.18">Jos 16–17</a>). Judah was victorious over the cruel Adoni-bezek, who ruled over Bezek, a town of uncertain location. Judah successfully occupied the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills. They even took Jerusalem, or an outlying suburb identified with Jerusalem (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.8">Jos 1:8</a>), but could not retain control there (v <a href="?bref=Jos.1.21">21</a>) until David’s conquest of the city (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-9">2 Sm 5:6-9</a>). Judah was victorious over the Canaanites in the region of Hebron, already conquered under Joshua (<a href="?bref=Josh.10.36">Jos 10:36</a>). Hebron, also known as Kiriath-arba (“city of four” or “tetrapolis”), was a powerful ally of Jerusalem (v <a href="?bref=Josh.10.3">3</a>) and had been able to rally military support for a new assault on Israel, even after its first defeat. Caleb received Hebron, as Moses had promised (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.20">Jgs 1:20</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.15.13">Jos 15:13</a>). After the victory over Hebron, Judah extended its control over the southern hill country by an attack on Debir (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.11-15">Jgs 1:11-15</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.15.14-19">Jos 15:14-19</a>).</p>
<p>The Kenites (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">Jgs 1:16</a>), descendants of Jethro and therefore related to Moses by marriage, settled in the Negev around Arad and the City of Palms, which here probably refers to Tamar rather than Jericho.</p>
<p>Judah secured the southern border by a victory over the Canaanites at Hormah (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.17">Jgs 1:17</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.14.45">Nm 14:45</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.21.3">21:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.1.44">Dt 1:44</a>) and the coastal plain by victories at Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron. However, Judah’s successes in the coastal plain were resisted by a well-armed Canaanite force (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.18-19">Jgs 1:18-19</a>). It occupied the Judean hill country and the Negev, but could not retain control over the plains. The Philistines were soon to take control over Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, and incorporate them into their pentapolis.</p>
<p class="h4">Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.21">1:21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jerusalem was situated on the border between Judah and Benjamin. Judah took the city or a suburb (<a href="?bref=Josh.1.8">Jos 1:8</a>) but was too far removed to retain control over it. Benjamin was too weak to subdue the Jebusites. Only David succeeded in this (<a href="?bref=2Sam.5.6-9">2 Sm 5:6-9</a>); he incorporated it into Judah (cf. <a href="?bref=Josh.15.63">Jos 15:63</a>), even though it originally was allotted to Benjamin (<a href="?bref=Josh.18.28">Jos 18:28</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Joseph: Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.22-29">1:22-29</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ephraim took Bethel, known from the patriarchal stories as a significant cultic site (<a href="?bref=Gen.12.8">Gn 12:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.13.3-4">13:3-4</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.28.19">28:19</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.31.13">31:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Gen.35.1-15">35:1-15</a>). However, Manasseh was unsuccessful in taking the fortified cities in the valley of Jezreel (Esdraelon): Beth-shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo. These cities controlled traffic along the east-west and north–south roads as well as the important passes through the Carmel range and the ford of the Jordan. Ephraim could not take full possession of the coastal plain, controlled by Gezer. The success of both Ephraim and Manasseh was limited.</p>
<p class="h4">The Other Four Tribes (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.30-36">1:30-36</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The other four tribes in Canaan receive brief mention. They, too, were only partially successful. Zebulun, Asher, Naphtali, and especially Dan did not fully succeed in driving out the Canaanites. At best they later subjected most of them to forced labor.</p>
<p class="h4">The Failure of Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-5">2:1-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The failure to subdue the land and to wipe out the Canaanites and their culture led to intermarriage and idolatry (cf. <a href="?bref=Exod.23.33">Ex 23:33</a>; <a href="?bref=Exod.34.12-16">34:12-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Num.33.55">Nm 33:55</a>; <a href="?bref=Deut.7.2-5,16">Dt 7:2-5, 16</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.7,12">Jos 23:7, 12</a>).</p>
<p>The identity of “the angel of the Lord” who appears at Bokim is far from certain. It may be a reference to the Lord himself, to an angelic messenger, or to a prophet (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.6.8">Jgs 6:8</a>). He rebuked the people in the prophetic spirit and pronounced God’s judgment as taking the form of continual confrontation between Israel and the Canaanites (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.3">2:3</a>). Their weeping and sacrificing were to no avail (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.4-5">2:4-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Mal.2.13">Mal 2:13</a>). Israel stood condemned within a generation after Joshua’s death.</p>
<p class="h3">The Theological Introduction (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.6-3.6">2:6–3:6</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The theological introduction begins where Joshua left off (<a href="?bref=Josh.24.28-31">Jos 24:28-31</a>). The generation of Joshua was characterized by loyalty, but their loyalty to the Lord did not last long after the excitement of the Conquest and the demonstration of God’s presence (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.10">Jgs 2:10</a>). Israel served Canaanite gods (Baal and Astarte) instead. Baal was the storm god, symbolic of rain and fertility, and Astarte was his cohort. The plural (Baals and Ashtaroth, <a href="?bref=Judg.2.11-13">2:11-13</a>) signifies the many local ways in which the Canaanite gods were worshiped. The religious unity was broken up into a great diversity. Thus Israel angered the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.2.12-14">12-14</a>), who sent them enemies and plunderers. Israel was unsuccessful in dealing with them, as Moses and Joshua had forewarned (<a href="?bref=Deut.28.25,33">Dt 28:25, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=Josh.23.13,16">Jos 23:13, 16</a>). The cycle of apostasy, judgment, cry for mercy, and deliverance is found throughout Judges. The people were rooted in the apostasy of their forefathers, even though the previous generation had been sensitive to God. Israel did not submit to the leadership of the judges, except to free itself from the oppressors. In fulfillment of the curses of the covenant, God swore not to give his people rest but to test them and to train them for warfare (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.1-4">Jgs 3:1-4</a>), so that they might learn to respond to the challenges of a real world.</p>
<p class="h3">The Judges of Israel (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.7-16.31">3:7–16:31</a>)</p>
<p class="h4">Othniel (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.7-11">3:7-11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Othniel is a transitional figure, linking the Conquest and the judges. He had involved himself in the conquest of Kiriath-sepher and was related to Caleb as his cousin and son-in-law (<a href="?bref=Judg.1.13">1:13</a>). He repelled the Arameans led by Cushan-rishathaim, so that the land enjoyed peace for some 40 years.</p>
<p class="h4">Ehud (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.12-30">3:12-30</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The Moabites, allied with the Ammonites and Amalekites, came against Israel from the east and oppressed them for 18 years under the leadership of Eglon. Ehud led the mission to bring tribute to Eglon at his palace, located probably by Jericho (the City of Palms). Ehud was uniquely qualified for this mission; being left-handed, he was able to use his double-edged sword in an unsuspecting manner to stab the king. Ehud’s success was the result of careful plotting and the element of surprise. He paid the tribute and left, only to return with a supposed oracle from the gods. The king fell for the deception and was murdered. The delay at the Moabite court gave the Israelites an opportunity to bring their forces together at the fords of the Jordan. Ehud’s success was complete; no Moabite escaped, and Israel enjoyed peace for 80 years.</p>
<p class="h4">Shamgar (<a href="?bref=Judg.3.31">3:31</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Shamgar’s exploits were against the Philistines in the coastal plains. He had a non-Israelite name but was probably an Israelite by birth. Like Samson he fought the Philistines with an unconventional weapon (an ox goad). His name is also mentioned in the song of Deborah (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.6">5:6</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Deborah and Barak (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-5.31">4:1–5:31</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The narrative now turns to the Canaanite aggressors in the north under the leadership of Jabin, king of Hazor, and Sisera, of Harosheth-haggoyim (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.1-3">4:1-3</a>). The ruins of Hazor (<a href="?bref=Josh.11.13">Jos 11:13</a>) had been rebuilt, and another Jabin (cf. v <a href="?bref=Josh.11.1">1</a>) ruled over the region. He had regained his military power, as he had as many as 900 chariots of iron. He oppressed Israel for 20 years (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.3">Jgs 4:3</a>).</p>
<p>God had a prophetess in Israel who led his people during this dark time (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.4">4:4</a>). She rendered judgments under a palm tree in southern Ephraim near Benjamin (v <a href="?bref=Judg.4.5">5</a>). She called on Barak to muster the armies of Naphtali and Zebulun, the tribes affected by the Canaanite raids, and to engage Sisera in a surprise attack by the Kishon River (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.4.6-7">6-7</a>). Barak’s hesitancy led him to request Deborah’s presence, which resulted in his forfeiture of the honor of killing Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite forces (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.4.8-10">8-10</a>). The Lord gave success to the surprise attack from Mt Tabor, so that the Canaanites were routed, unable to use their heavy chariots, which were mired down in the swamps of the Jezreel Valley (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.20-22">5:20-22</a>). The Canaanites were routed, and Sisera was killed by Jael, the wife of Heber, a Kenite who had separated from the Kenites around Arad (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.17-18">4:17-18</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.1.16">1:16</a>). She offered him hospitality, as her family had friendly relations with the Canaanites, but heroically put him to death with a tent peg (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.18-21">4:18-21</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.5.26-27">5:26-27</a>). In successive campaigns the Israelites gained freedom from Jabin, until they destroyed his power (<a href="?bref=Judg.4.24">4:24</a>).</p>
<p>The song of Deborah (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.5.1-31">5</a>) celebrates, in poetic fashion, the victory over Jabin. It is one of the oldest poems in the Bible. It praises the God of Israel as the King who comes to protect his covenant people, and before whom the mountains move (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.2-3">5:2-3</a>). He is the God of Mt Sinai (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.4-5">Jgs 5:4-5</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.33.2">Dt 33:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.68.7-8">Ps 68:7-8</a>; <a href="?bref=Hab.3.3-4">Hb 3:3-4</a>). Though the oppressors had despoiled Israel and had made the roads unsafe for travel, and Israel was unable to defend itself (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.6-8">Jgs 5:6-8</a>), the Lord raised up Deborah and Barak to lead the nobles to war (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.9-13">9-13</a>). They came from Ephraim, Benjamin, Zebulun, Issachar, and Naphtali (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.14-15,18">14-15a, 18</a>), but the Transjordan tribes and Asher did not want to get involved (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.15-17">15b-17</a>). The song then moves to the battle scene, where torrential rains bogged the chariots down (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.19-23">19-23</a>). Jael is celebrated as “most blessed of women,” who used her simple way of life to bring an end to Sisera (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.24-27">24-27</a>). She stands in contrast to Sisera’s mother, who is portrayed with all her culture waiting in vain for Sisera’s return with all of his spoils (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.5.28-30">28-30</a>). The Lord has used the simple to confound the powerful. The conclusion is a prayer for God’s judgment on all of Israel’s enemies (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.31">Jgs 5:31a</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Ps.68.1-3">Ps 68:1-3</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">Gideon (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-8.35">6:1–8:35</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Israel’s rest for 40 years (<a href="?bref=Judg.5.31">Jgs 5:31b</a>) was disturbed by the invasion of Midianites and Amalekites from the East (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.1-3">6:1-3</a>). They destroyed the economy by invading the country at harvesttime (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.6.4-6">4-6</a>). In response to Israel’s cry, God sent a prophet with a message similar to that of the angel of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Judg.2.1-5">2:1-5</a>). Then an angel appeared to Gideon and called him to lead the people in battle (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.11-14">6:11-14</a>). The Lord assured him of his presence (v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.16">16</a>) by a sign (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.6.17-22">17-22</a>). Gideon knew that he had been visited by the Lord and built an altar called “The <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> Is Peace” in Ophrah (v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.24">24</a>). He responded by destroying the cultic site dedicated to Baal and Asherah at Ophrah (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.6.25-28">25-28</a>) and by initiating worship at the new altar (v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.28">28</a>). Baal did not protect his own altar (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.6.29-32">29-32</a>), even when challenged by Gideon’s father (v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.31">31</a>). Consequently, Gideon was known as Jerubbaal (meaning, “let Baal contend with him,” v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.32">32</a>).</p>
<p>Next, Gideon mustered an army of 32,000 men from Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.35">6:35</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.7.3">7:3b</a>). In order to assure himself of the Lord’s presence, he asked for another sign: the sign of the fleece (<a href="?bref=Judg.6.36-40">6:36-40</a>). It must be kept in mind that Gideon lived in an area in which the wonders of God had been scarce (v <a href="?bref=Judg.6.13">13</a>) and that he, like Moses, needed reassurance that God was with him. God responded to his growing faith. Gideon went forth with a greatly reduced army of 300 against the enemy. Of his original army, 22,000 had left because they were afraid (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.2-3">7:2-3</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Deut.20.8">Dt 20:8</a>). Another 9,700 were sent home, though they were valiant men (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.4-8">7:4-8</a>). After assuring Gideon by a dream of an enemy soldier, God used the 300 in a marvelous way to confound the Midianites (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.7.9-15">9-15</a>). God gave Israel victory over the Midianite leaders Oreb, Zeeb, Zebah, and Zalmunna (<a href="?bref=Judg.7.16-8.21">7:16–8:21</a>). Gideon wisely avoided a possible military confrontation with Ephraim (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.1-3">8:1-3</a>), pursued the enemy deep into the Transjordan, and punished the leaders of Succoth and Penuel, who did not assist him (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.8.4-9,13-16">4-9, 13-16</a>).</p>
<p>This glorious victory created a new wave of interest in the idea of kingship. The men of Israel wished to establish the family of Gideon as their royal dynasty (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.22">8:22</a>). Gideon refused, and instead wrongly set up an ephod, cast from the gold taken in battle (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.8.23-27">23-27</a>). The ephod was probably used for cultic practices, possibly divination (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.17.5">17:5</a>).</p>
<p>Gideon’s era also came to an end. He was God’s instrument, giving Israel rest for 40 years. He fathered 70 sons and died in old age. God had richly blessed him, even though he had led Israel astray with his ephod. Thereafter, Israel returned to Baal worship (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.33-35">8:33-35</a>).</p>
<p>In the wake of Gideon’s era, his son Abimelech attempted to establish dynastic continuity by having himself installed as king at Shechem (<a href="?bref=Judg.9.1-6">9:1-6</a>). With the support of his relatives at Shechem, Abimelech had all his brothers killed except Jotham (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.9.4-5">4-5</a>). After Abimelech’s coronation, Jotham set forth his opposition to his brother in a proverbial manner (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.9.7-20">7-20</a>), and went into hiding. Three years later Abimelech’s evil schemes entrapped him when the citizens of Shechem rebelled. He furiously attacked the city and destroyed it. A short time later, however, he was wounded at Thebez by a millstone dropped by a woman from the tower in which she had sought refuge from him. His servant put him out of his misery as per his request. This episode demonstrates how bad a despotic king may be. Again, God’s justice prevailed.</p>
<p class="h4">Tola (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.1-2">10:1-2</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Tola was a minor judge from Issachar who judged Israel for 23 years.</p>
<p class="h4">Jair (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.3-5">10:3-5</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Jair was a minor judge from Gilead who judged Israel for 22 years.</p>
<p class="h4">Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.6-12.7">10:6–12:7</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">A recapitulation (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.6-16">10:6-16</a>) of the cycle (idolatry, enemies, cry for help, momentary repentance) sets the introduction to the Jephthah narrative. Under attack from the Ammonites, the elders of Gilead requested help from Jephthah (<a href="?bref=Judg.10.17-11.8">10:17–11:8</a>), who promised to help them on the condition that he remain their leader even after the war (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.11.9-10">9-10</a>). At a solemn ceremony he becomes their “head” at Mizpah (v <a href="?bref=Judg.11.11">11</a>). Jephthah opened up correspondence with the Ammonite king, in which he argued for Israel’s rights on the basis of the Israelites’ historic claim to the land as granted to them by the Lord (vv <a href="?bref=Judg.11.12-27">12–27</a>). Instead of going out immediately to war, he hoped that “the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, the Judge” would settle the dispute (v <a href="?bref=Judg.11.27">27</a>); but the Ammonite king was unimpressed. When the Spirit of God came over him, Jephthah led Israel into battle, but only after making a rash vow. He was victorious but found out that his vow to sacrifice whatever came first out of his house required him to sacrifice his daughter. Debate continues as to whether he offered her up as a human sacrifice or whether she sacrificed marriage (see discussion under <a href="?item=Jephthah_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jephthah</a>).</p>
<p>The Ephraimites seemed to have had an insatiable desire for war. Earlier they had complained to Gideon, who successfully defused their threats (<a href="?bref=Judg.8.1-3">8:1-3</a>). Jephthah fought them, however, because the Israelites living in Transjordan had been reviled as “renegades” (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.1-4">12:1-4</a>). Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed by the fords of the Jordan in this civil war. Thereafter, Jephthah ruled for only six years.</p>
<p class="h4">Ibzan (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.8-10">12:8-10</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Ibzan was a minor judge from Bethlehem who ruled Israel for seven years.</p>
<p class="h4">Elon (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.11">12:11</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">A minor judge from Zebulun, Elon ruled Israel for ten years.</p>
<p class="h4">Abdon (<a href="?bref=Judg.12.13-15">12:13-15</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Abdon was a minor judge from Pirathon, the location of which is uncertain. He ruled for eight years.</p>
<p class="h4">Samson (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.1-16.31">13:1–16:31</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Samson’s greatness in the history of redemption is due to his miraculous birth (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.1-24">13:1-24</a>), his service as a Nazirite (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.7">13:7</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-21">Nm 6:1-21</a>), the repeated overpowering by the Spirit of the Lord (<a href="?bref=Judg.13.25">Jgs 13:25</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.6,19">14:6, 19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.14">15:14</a>), the single-handed exploits against the Philistines (Ashkelon, <a href="?bref=Judg.14.19">14:19</a>; the fields, <a href="?bref=Judg.15.1-6">15:1-6</a>; Ramath Etam, <a href="?bref=Judg.15.7-17">15:7-17</a>; Gaza, <a href="?bref=Judg.16.1-3,23-30">16:1-3, 23-30</a>), and his occasional dependence on the Lord (<a href="?bref=Judg.15.18-19">15:18-19</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.16.28-30">16:28-30</a>). However, his personal life was flawed because of his weakness for Philistine women (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.14.1-20">14</a>, <a href="?bref=Judg.16.1-31">16</a>). Having been seduced by Delilah, he was imprisoned at Gaza. He died in the collapse of Dagon’s temple, praying that the Lord would permit him to get revenge (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.28-30">16:28-30</a>). He was buried in his father’s tomb in the territory of Dan (<a href="?bref=Judg.16.31">16:31</a>).</p>
<p class="h3">Epilogue (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-21.25">17–21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The cyclical nature of Israel’s existence was without movement. Rest from enemies was always temporary. Israel was not yet ready for dynastic kingship, and whatever one may say of the three years of Abimelech, it was a kingship of the worst sort. Israel vacillated between idolatry and belief in the true Lord. The period of the judges was unstable, marked by petty individualism and provincialism. Yet God remained sovereign in the affairs of his people. The epilogue contains two stories: the story of Micah and the Danite migration (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-18.31">17–18</a>) and the civil war (chs <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-21.25">19–21</a>). The epilogue is bound together by the phrase “In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit” (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.6">17:6</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1">18:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.19.1">19:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.21.25">21:25</a>, <span class="sc">niv</span>). The symmetric recurrence (two times in each narrative) emphasizes the anarchy and inability of the tribes to unite together to serve God as a covenant people.</p>
<p class="h4">Micah and the Danites (<a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-18.31">17–18</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">Micah was an Ephraimite who established a shrine and hired one of his own sons, and then a Levite from Bethlehem, to serve as its priests (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-13">17</a>). Unable to keep their patrimony, the Danites left to establish themselves at the foot of Mt Hermon. They took the idols and the Levite from Micah’s shrine and set up a cultic city at the newly established city of Dan, built on the ruins of Laish (ch <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">18</a>). Thus, they set up a cultic center that rivaled the tabernacle at Shiloh (<a href="?bref=Judg.18.31">18:31</a>).</p>
<p class="h4">The Civil War (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.1-21.25">19–21</a>)</p>
<p class="fl">The people of Gibeah, which belonged to Benjamin, sexually abused the concubine of a Levite so that she died. Like the Levite of chapters <a href="?bref=Judg.17.1-13">17</a> and <a href="?bref=Judg.18.1-31">18</a>, she was from Bethlehem (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.1">19:1</a>). Dramatically, the Levite sent pieces of her corpse to all the tribes, which assembled against the Benjamites because they protected the criminals of Gibeah (<a href="?bref=Judg.19.29-20.19">19:29–20:19</a>). In the ensuing battle the population of Benjamin was decimated (<a href="?bref=Judg.20.20-48">20:20-48</a>). The 11 tribes gave them 400 virgins taken in a civil war against Jabesh-gilead (<a href="?bref=Judg.21.6-15">21:6-15</a>). These were not enough, however. Because of the threat of the extinction of Benjamin and the vow not to give their daughters in marriage to any Benjamite, the Israelites devised a plan by which the Benjamites could take Israelite virgins dancing in the festival at Shiloh. Benjamin thus was able to rebuild its towns and settlements.</p>

  <title>Judgment</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JUDGMENT</p>
<p class="fl">Concept in Scripture closely related to the concept of God’s justice. In all his relationships God acts justly and morally. Human beings, created by God, have a moral dimension, so that they may positively respond to God’s righteous demands in their lives. Divine judgment, involving God’s approval or disapproval upon each human act, is a natural consequence of the Creator-creature relationship. Thus judgment, simply defined, is the divine response to human activity. God the Creator must also be God the Judge. Since God is just, he responds with either punishment or reward to what each person does. A human’s moral accountability to God (a quality not shared by the rest of creation) is an essential ingredient of being created in God’s image. Creation in the divine image means that God and man can communicate with each other in such a way that all people are able to understand God’s moral requirements and willingly respond to them. Among the various positive commands given to people in his original creation—including marriage, the subduing of the earth, and enjoyment of the Garden of Eden—was the negative command prohibiting the eating of the fruit from one tree. Defiance of this prohibition carried the threat of death as punishment (<a href="?bref=Gen.2.16-17">Gn 2:16-17</a>). <a href="?bref=Gen.3.1-24">Genesis 3</a> contains the account of God’s first judgment, the one against Adam. He was punished by death since he had not lived within the moral regulations set by God (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.17-19">3:17-19</a>). In a purely technical sense, judgment includes God’s approval upon acts that please him; more frequently, judgment is understood negatively in the sense that God punishes those who violate his commands. Since the fall, all human activity stands under God’s negative judgment (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.12">Rom 2:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="JudgmentinThisLife">Judgment in This Life</p>
<p class="fl">The Christian idea of the atonement, that Christ died for sin in the place of man, depends on the premise that God holds humans accountable for their sins. But God sent his Son to deal with this problem. The Son willingly placed himself under God’s judgment, and in people’s place he received the divine punishment (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.13">Gal 3:13</a>). Christ’s death for sin may therefore be considered the extreme manifestation of divine judgment. God as judge visits upon the soul of Christ in his crucifixion the total divine judgment against sin.</p>
<p>Through faith, brought about by the Holy Spirit and fed by the Word, a believer becomes one with Christ and thus escapes divine judgment and is rescued from punishment (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.22">Rom 3:22</a>). Those who, by faith, share in the benefits of Christ’s death stand before the divine Judge and receive a verdict of “not guilty,” and instead of punishment and divine retribution, receive a sentence of eternal life. Jesus says of those who believe in him that they have already passed through judgment, have escaped death, and are already sharing in eternal life (<a href="?bref=John.5.24">Jn 5:24</a>).</p>
<p>Though sins have been atoned for by Christ, each person—believer and unbeliever alike—still suffers certain consequences of his or her sins here in this life. For every human action there is a divine reaction (<a href="?bref=Rom.2.6">Rom 2:6</a>). Paul speaks about the conscience, which carries out a series of judgments even upon the actions of those who do not know the true God (v <a href="?bref=Rom.2.15">15</a>).</p>
<p>Governments are also manifestations of divine judgment upon man’s public performances with respect to the law. Civil justice, though often corrupted, is a means through which God carries out temporal judgment upon any infringement of the law in this life (<a href="?bref=Rom.13.1-2">Rom 13:1-2</a>). Public crimes against society are not the only sins subject to divine judgment.</p>
<p>In addition to the accusations of the conscience against even the most private of sins, each human action carries with it potential reward or punishment. Living within the moral bounds established by God, especially as they are revealed in the Ten Commandments and further explicated in the rest of Scripture, results in certain physical benefits in this life. Living in disregard of the moral law results in penalties and hardships appropriate to the infraction (<a href="?bref=Gal.6.7-8">Gal 6:7-8</a>). For example, refusal to work can result in poverty, and overindulgence can result in poor health. Some activities bring their own penalties. Christians should not conclude, however, that the presence of calamities in a person’s life must indicate a specific judgment of God against a particular sin. God can use calamities in the life of a Christian to guide him providentially to the goal of eternal life (<a href="?bref=1Pet.4.12-13">1 Pt 4:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>On account of Adam’s sin, the creation was subject to a judgment of corruption (<a href="?bref=Gen.3.17">Gn 3:17</a>). All of human life participates in a deterioration that is a manifestation of divine judgment against the sin that originated with Adam. God remains sovereign even over the universal corruption and is able to direct and control it for his ultimate purposes (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.20">Rom 8:20</a>). Thus he can use calamities for the benefit of the Christian’s life (v <a href="?bref=Rom.8.28">28</a>), but he can also use them to manifest his anger on those who persist in deliberate sin and who reject his Son Jesus Christ as the Redeemer from sin. Pharaoh, who recognized Moses as God’s prophet and still rejected him and his message, is a prime example of a person who received God’s judgment (<a href="?bref=Exod.10.20">Ex 10:20</a>). The Jews who saw the miracles of Jesus and rejected his claims to be the Messiah are also among those who received God’s judgment while living (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.22-32">Mt 12:22-32</a>).</p>
<p>Through wars and the creation and destruction of nations, God carries out judgment collectively against entire peoples. The OT records the rise and fall of nations and of kings. The refusal to acknowledge and worship the true God and to follow his laws eventually and most certainly results in national extinction. The destruction of Nineveh and Israel in the OT and Jerusalem in the NT are clear examples of God’s judgment against entire peoples who reject his message of salvation. Public disregard of the moral law must result in national disintegration, which is then frequently compounded by invasion by a foreign nation. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was the direct result of immoral license (<a href="?bref=Jude.1.7">Jude 1:7</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="LastJudgment">Last Judgment</p>
<p class="fl">Judgment in its final and ultimate sense is best understood as the appearance of Jesus Christ on the last day. At that time believers will inherit eternal life and unbelievers will be damned. The Christian does not fear this moment, because he has already been acquitted in Christ Jesus. The unbeliever rightfully fears death. The cause of horrible and unchangeable judgment is the persistent rejection of God’s offer of salvation. This is the sin against the Holy Spirit (<a href="?bref=Matt.12.32">Mt 12:32</a>). Those who fall under its condemnation are those who have heard God’s special message to them and are convinced of its truth but who nevertheless persist in rejecting this salvation. As the unbeliever has rejected God in this life, so God rejects him in his death forever.</p>
<p>In addition to this individual judgment, all nations will appear before Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-32">Mt 25:31-32</a>). The fate of all those who appear before the Judge has already been sealed. The Scriptures teach that there is a judgment on that last day that will be made on the basis of works (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.25.31-46">31-46</a>). This should not be seen as a denial and contradiction of the principle that one is saved by faith alone. People enter into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ through faith alone, without works. Faith is known only to God and of itself is not visible to others. The evidence for the presence of faith is works.</p>
<p>God’s judgments upon people in this life can be of benefit because through these judgments he is calling them to repentance. The judgment of the last day will be final; no one will be permitted to repent or change his or her mind about God. On that day all will recognize the truthfulness of God’s claims in Christ Jesus, but only those who have believed in him and carried out his will in their lives will receive the invitation to enter eternal life (v <a href="?bref=Matt.25.34">34</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="PracticalImplications">Practical Implications</p>
<p class="fl">Christians live a positive and confident life knowing that Jesus has taken the divine judgment for them and thus they are free from any further divine retribution. At the same time they are aware of God’s judgment against all sins, including those of Christians, and that apart from Christ they would suffer the worst possible divine punishment. They see the evil and calamities of this life as God’s continued displeasure with sin. When they come, Christians use them as opportunities for searching their own souls and for repentance. Though they are not aware of the exact date of the last day, they prepare themselves each day for the final judgment.</p>
<p class="h2" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</p>
<p class="fl">The concept of judgment covers the entire history of the human race—from the fall to the last day. God, as a just God who sees a decisive difference between good and evil, has no choice but to carry out judgment upon all people in their daily lives and especially at life’s conclusion. God in his grace has sent his Son to suffer the judgment we deserved, and in his mercy delays the final Day of Judgment so that we can come to repentance by faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="?bref=2Pet.3.9">2 Pt 3:9</a>). The great concepts of creation, justice, law, salvation, and atonement reach their climax in the divine judgment of the last day.</p>

<p class="fl">KJV translation in <a href="?bref=John.18.28,33">Jn 18:28, 33</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.9">19:9</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.23.35">Acts 23:35</a> of a NT word also translated “Praetorium” (<a href="?bref=Mark.15.16">Mk 15:16</a>) and “common hall” (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.27">Mt 27:27</a>). The word was first used to refer to the place where the Roman general’s tent stood in an army camp and hence was a reference to the headquarters of the camp. It then came to mean the military council that met in the general’s tent. Later, it was used in reference to the palace in which the Roman governor or procurator resided while ruling a province. It also designated the army headquarters and barracks that were housed in connection with the governor’s residence. In Jerusalem it was the palace that Herod the Great had built for himself. When the Roman governor came from his normal residence in Caesarea to Jerusalem, he occupied Herod’s palace and conducted his official business there. It was there that Pilate questioned Jesus (<a href="?bref=John.18.28">Jn 18:28</a>; <a href="?bref=John.19.9">19:9</a>), but it was at another place called the “Pavement” that Pilate sat in judgment and gave Jesus to the Jews.</p>

  <title>Judgment Seat</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JUDGMENT SEAT</p>
<p class="fl">Place before which people will one day stand to give an account of their lives to God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">The NT concept of divine judgment has its roots in the OT. There God is seen as Judge of the whole world, and especially of his own people.</p>
<p>During his intercession for Sodom, Abraham spoke of God as the Judge of all the earth (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.25">Gn 18:25</a>). Moses’ position as judge over the Israelites was based on the belief that God gave judgments through Moses. A similar relationship existed between God and the judges who led Israel after the conquest of the Promised Land. That understanding of God became explicit in Jephthah’s message to the king of Ammon: “Let the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, who is judge, decide today which of us is right—Israel or Ammon” (<a href="?bref=Judg.11.27">Jgs 11:27</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). When God called Samuel, he told Samuel that he (God) would judge Eli’s house.</p>
<p>The concept of God as the Judge of his people is prevalent in the Psalms and Prophets. In <a href="?bref=Ps.9.4">Psalm 9:4</a> David said of God, “For you have judged in my favor; from your throne, you have judged with fairness” (<span class="sc">nlt</span>). He added, “But the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> reigns forever, executing judgment from his throne. He will judge the world with justice and rule the nations with fairness” (<a href="?bref=Ps.9.7-8">9:7-8</a>, <span class="sc">nlt</span>). Isaiah described a future day when God shall judge the nations (<a href="?bref=Isa.2.4">Is 2:4</a>). Joel also spoke of God as the judge of the nations (<a href="?bref=Joel.3.12">Jl 3:12</a>).</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Statements like those above formed part of the background for the NT understanding of the judgment seat of God or Christ. The image of a judgment seat came from the fact that in the Roman world judgment took place on a platform (Gk, <span class="greek">bema</span>) or tribunal, from which a judge would hear and decide cases. Thus, most of the NT references to a judgment seat occur when Jesus, or the apostle Paul, was brought before a ruling authority. For example, Pilate sat on his judgment seat when he tried Jesus (<a href="?bref=Matt.27.19">Mt 27:19</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=John.19.13">Jn 19:13</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.18.12,16-17">Acts 18:12, 16-17</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.25.6,10,17">25:6, 10, 17</a>).</p>
<p>The two passages in the NT that speak directly of the judgment seat of God or Christ are <a href="?bref=Rom.14.10">Romans 14:10</a> and <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>. In <a href="?bref=Rom.14.10">Romans 14:10</a> Paul addressed the urgent problem of unity within the church—unity based on a loving acceptance of those with different understandings of the effects of faith in a Christian’s daily life. Paul urged the Christians, both Jews and Gentiles, to accept one another in spite of differences concerning eating certain foods and observing certain days. All, he reminded them, must eventually stand before the judgment seat of God to give an account of the way they had lived. Further, since God is the ultimate Judge, Christians should not judge one another. Again, in <a href="?bref=2Cor.5.1-21">2 Corinthians 5</a> Paul told the Corinthian Christians why Christians strive to please the Lord: all must appear before the judgment seat of Christ to be recompensed for their deeds. The judgment seat of Christ or God, therefore, expresses the ultimate accountability of the Christian.</p>

  <title>Judith, Book of</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JUDITH, Book of</p>
<p class="fl">A deuterocanonical book, named from its leading character. There is general agreement that the book was originally written in Hebrew, but it never was admitted into the Hebrew canon, although it was recognized as canonical by the third Council of Carthage (<span class="era">AD</span> 397) and also by the Council of Trent (<span class="era">AD</span> 1545).</p>
<p>The Maccabean era, and more specifically the persecutions by Antiochus Epiphanes (175–164 <span class="era">BC</span>), are thought to have been the occasion most likely to have produced literature of this kind. The book is an attempt by a Palestinian Jew to encourage his fellow Jews in resisting their enemies and in continuing to observe the law of God faithfully. Judith, the heroine, is blest with the happy combination of a rigorous observance of the law and a cunning bravery amidst great danger.</p>
<p>The book recounts that when Nebuchadnezzar sought to enlist the forces of Persia, Cilicia, Damascus, Lebanon, Antilebanon, all those who lived along the seacoast, Palestine, and Egypt to assist him in war against the Medes, they refused to respond (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.7-11">Jdt 1:7-11</a>). Consequently, he vowed to avenge himself on the whole territory (v <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.12">12</a>). After defeating King Arphaxad of the Medes and overthrowing his army, he conquered Ecbatana, killed Arphaxad, and returned to Nineveh to celebrate his victory for four months (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.1.12-16">12-16</a>) and to recoup his military strength. Nebuchadnezzar commissioned Holofernes to lead a great army of 120,000 foot soldiers and 12,000 cavalry and contingents from other nations (ch <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.2.1-28">2</a>) against the nations who disobeyed him. The seacoast cities surrendered unconditionally and the Assyrians destroyed local shrines, insisting that all the subjugated peoples should henceforth worship Nebuchadnezzar alone as god (ch <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.3.1-10">3</a>). When the people of Israel in Judea heard of the devastation being wrought by Holofernes, they determined to thwart his advance against Jerusalem by mobilizing forces and setting up supply depots at strategic passes in the hills north of Jerusalem. At the same time, they sought divine favor (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.4.1-15">4:1-15</a>). Holofernes, enraged because the people of Israel prepared to fight against him, inquired of the chiefs of Moab and Ammon who these people were (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.5.1-4">5:1-4</a>) and was informed by Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, of their history and of their invincibility so long as they do not sin against their God (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.5.5-21">5-21</a>). In anger, Holofernes ordered Achior to be bound and abandoned near the Jewish camp so that he might be destroyed with the nation he had said was invincible (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.5.22-6.9">5:22–6:9</a>). Achior was found by the men of the city of Bethulia; Uzziah, the chief ruler of the city, treated him kindly and the Jews continued to call on the God of Israel for help (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.6.10-21">6:10-21</a>). The next day Holofernes moved his entire army into the valley near Bethulia, terrifying the inhabitants. He decided to cut off the water supply and wait until famine forced the Jews to surrender (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.7.1-18">7:1-18</a>). Uzziah, after a siege of 34 days, was asked by the elders to surrender to the Assyrians, but he pled with them to hold out for five more days, agreeing that he would capitulate if help was not forthcoming within that time (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.7.19-32">19-32</a>).</p>
<p>Judith was a wealthy and beautiful widow who was also deeply pious. She reproached the leaders for limiting God and inspired them to believe that God would deliver them by her hand (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.8.2-36">8:2-36</a>). Judith prepared herself by earnest prayer and dressing in elaborate finery. She packed some kosher food, and with her maid went into the valley toward the camp of the enemy. When she told the Assyrian patrol that she was a Jewess fleeing from the impending fall of the city and that she would show Holofernes how to take the hill country without losing a man (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.10.11-13">10:11-13</a>), Holofernes assured Judith that she had nothing to fear and encouraged her to tell what her mission was (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.10.14-11.4">10:14–11:4</a>). With persuasive words and expressions that had a double meaning, she indicated that her people were about to sin, disobeying the law because of the rigors of the siege. She promised to inform Holofernes when the people had committed their sins so that he might have an easy conquest of all Judea (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.11.11-19">11:11-19</a>).</p>
<p>Holofernes ordered food and wine for her, but she explained that she must conform to the dietary laws of the Jews. On the fourth night after her arrival a banquet was staged and Holofernes lay drunk after all the servants had been dismissed (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.12.5-13.2">12:5–13:2</a>). With a prayer for strength, she drew his sword and with two powerful strokes severed his head from his body. Putting the head in her bag, she went out calmly, as on previous nights, into the darkness beyond the borders of the camp and came to the gates of Bethulia (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.13.3-11">13:3-11</a>). Unbounded joy greeted Judith as the people learned what she had done. Uzziah and all the people gave thanks to God and praised Judith for her daring exploit (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.13.12-20">13:12-20</a>). They arranged for the Jews to make an attack on the morrow (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.14.1-4">14:1-4</a>). When Achior was summoned and shown the head of Holofernes, he converted to Judaism (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.14.5-10">5-10</a>). When the Assyrians realized that their general was murdered, they fled in terror and utter confusion, while the Jews pursued them beyond Damascus (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.14.11-15.7">14:11–15:7</a>). The high priest Joakim and the members of the Sanhedrin came from Jerusalem to pay homage to Judith for her bravery, and all joined in praising her in song and dance (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.15.8-13">15:8-13</a>). Judith responded in a hymn of praise to God for granting them deliverance (<a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.16.1-17">16:1-17</a>), after which all the people went up to Jerusalem to worship the Lord with sacrifices and feasting for three months (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.16.18-20">18-20</a>). The book closes with the account of Judith’s return to Bethulia, where at the age of 105 she died and was buried with her husband and was mourned for seven days (vv <a class="apocrypha" href="?bref=Jdt.16.21-25">21-25</a>).</p>

Because indecision by two successive Roman governors kept Paul in prison for more than two years, he finally appealed to Caesar. Julius was a kind man. He allowed Paul to leave the ship in Sidon to be comforted by his friends (v <a href="?bref=Acts.27.3">3</a>). However, in his eagerness to get his prisoners to Rome, Julius ignored Paul’s advice to spend the winter in Fair Havens. Instead, he ordered the ship to sail to Phoenix, another harbor in Crete, which was more suitable for harboring in winter (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.9-12">9-12</a>). During the trip, a storm wrecked the ship. The soldiers on board wanted to kill the prisoners for fear of their escaping, but Julius prevented that massacre, ordering all to jump ship and swim to shore. This decision spared Paul’s life (vv <a href="?bref=Acts.27.42-44">42-44</a>).

  <title>Justification*, Justified</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">JUSTIFICATION*, JUSTIFIED</p>
<p class="fl">The act of God in bringing sinners into a new covenant relationship with himself through the forgiveness of sins. It is a declarative act of God by which he establishes persons as righteous—that is, in right and true relationship to himself.</p>
<p>Since the time of the Reformation, when Martin Luther reestablished the doctrine of justification by faith alone as the cornerstone for theological understanding, this term has had special significance in the history of theology. To Luther it represented a rediscovery of the writings of Paul and a fundamental counterthrust to medieval Catholicism with its theology of works and indulgences. The doctrine of justification by faith alone affirms the thoroughgoing sinfulness of all persons, their total inability to deal effectively with their own sin, and the gracious provision through the death of Jesus Christ of a complete atonement for sin, to which persons respond in simple trust without any special claims or merit of their own.</p>
<p>The noun “justification” and the verb “to justify” are not used often in Scripture. In the <span class="sc">kjv</span>, for example, the verb is found only in the OT, and there fewer than 25 times. In the NT both terms are used only 40 times. The more frequent and more important terms that translate the same Hebrew and Greek words are “righteousness” and “to declare (or make) righteous.” Any understanding of justification, therefore, directly involves a biblical understanding of righteousness.</p>
<p>In common Greek, “justification” and “justify” are frequently forensic terms; that is, they relate to the law court and the act of acquitting or vindicating someone. It has to do with the innocence or virtue of a person. But more broadly it has to do with the norm of any relationship.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheOldTestament">In the Old Testament</p>
<p class="fl">In the OT righteousness has to do with relationship and the obligations of that relationship. At times one is referred to as righteous because he or she stands in right relationship to another. At other times one is righteous because he or she fulfills certain obligations in a relationship (<a href="?bref=Gen.38.26">Gn 38:26</a>). But more important, these terms are used with reference to God, who is viewed as just. He governs with justice (<a href="?bref=Gen.18.25">18:25</a>), and his judgments are true and righteous (<a href="?bref=Ps.19.9">Ps 19:9</a>). Both the innocent and the guilty know well the justice of God; the former know they will be vindicated and the latter know his law prevails.</p>
<p>Justification and righteousness have technical significance because of their close association with the saving activity of God on behalf of his covenant people. The righteousness of God is bound up not so much with justice as with his intervention on behalf of his people under the covenant. The righteousness of God or the act of justification is, therefore, to be viewed not primarily in terms of law but in terms of covenant. The most important expression of this is the example of Abraham, who was reckoned righteous, that is, brought into personal relationship by virtue of his response of faith to the covenant offered by God (<a href="?bref=Gen.15.6">Gn 15:6</a>). Abraham could not justify himself, but on the basis of the covenant, God established him as righteous. All persons share the helplessness of Abraham. In the sight of God no one shall stand justified (<a href="?bref=Ps.143.2">Ps 143:2</a>). The hope of humanity is that God will remember his covenant. Righteousness is hence a product of the mercy or grace of God, who deals with his people according to his lovingkindness (<a href="?bref=Isa.63.7">Is 63:7</a>). Justification is thus derived from the nature of God; it is primarily a religious term, and only secondly ethical.</p>
<p class="h2" id="IntheNewTestament">In the New Testament</p>
<p class="fl">Almost all discussion of justification in the NT is found in the letters of Paul, primarily in those to the Romans and Galatians. In these two letters it is one of the fundamental terms by which Paul seeks to set forth the consequences of the work of Christ for sinful humanity. Justification by faith is set primarily against the background of Jewish legalism and its attempts to make the law the basis of salvation. Paul regards this as an alien message requiring the strongest condemnation (<a href="?bref=Gal.1.6-9">Gal 1:6-9</a>). The word and work of Christ, embedded in the message that Paul proclaimed, was a reminder that righteousness or justification is the gift of God through the blood (<span class="ital">covenant</span> blood, <a href="?bref=Heb.13.20">Heb 13:20</a>) of Jesus Christ. All this is entirely apart from the law (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21">Rom 3:21</a>). The law, in fact, is not capable of leading one to righteousness, nor was it given to bring about righteousness.</p>
<p><a href="?bref=Gal.3.15-25">Galatians 3:15-25</a> is especially instructive in understanding the function of the law, which came 430 years after the covenant by which Abraham was brought into a living, personal relationship with the holy God. Whatever purpose the law had, it was not given as a means of righteousness. “For if a law had been given which could make alive, then righteousness would indeed be by the law” (<a href="?bref=Gal.3.21">Gal 3:21</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). The atoning work of Christ for the justification of people is to be seen in terms of covenant rather than law. This is the essential argument of Paul in this section of Galatians, namely, that justification, from the time of Abraham, has been through faith in the God who keeps covenant and has never come by the law. “Righteousness” is therefore a relational term and is affirmed by one who by faith has been brought into right relationship with God. The law brings judgment; it confronts one with his incapacity to cope with sin (<a href="?bref=Acts.13.39">Acts 13:39</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.8.3">Rom 8:3</a>). Justification, then, has its forensic (judicial) dimensions in that it copes with, and represents salvation to, the problem of sin and guilt. The believer is set free from condemnation (<a href="?bref=Rom.8.1">Rom 8:1</a>). Yet the fundamental understanding of justification is to be gained in moving away from the law and judgment to the covenant and grace. The appeal to Abraham in both Romans and Galatians is to show that the covenant has always been the only hope of humanity. God keeps his covenant, even though his covenant people violate it daily.</p>
<p>In Paul’s formulation of the gospel, God is both just and the one who justifies. Sin demands judgment and must be dealt with. God’s pattern of bringing people into personal relationship now stands manifest apart from the law in the ministry and death of Christ, whom God put forth as the atoning agent (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.21-26">Rom 3:21-26</a>). Sin is dealt with directly in the death of the sinless one who became sin for us so that we might in him become the righteousness of God (<a href="?bref=2Cor.5.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>). In his substitutionary death he bears the guilt of all humanity so that by responding in trust mankind might know God in true relationship.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="PaulAndJamesOnJustification"/>
<p>For Paul, then, justification in view of human sinfulness is rooted in the nature of God who alone is able to take initiative in the healing and redeeming of humanity. Justification is by grace alone. Rooted in the nature of God, it is also made available through the work of Christ as God’s gift. Thus, we have the often repeated confession that Christ died “for us” (<a href="?bref=Rom.5.8">Rom 5:8</a>; <a href="?bref=1Thes.5.10">1 Thes 5:10</a>), or “for our sins” (<a href="?bref=1Cor.15.3">1 Cor 15:3</a>). The means of appropriation is by faith and faith alone (<a href="?bref=Rom.3.22">Rom 3:22</a>; <a href="?bref=Rom.5.1">5:1</a>). This faith is a simple trust in the sufficiency of the work of Christ, a trust by which one freely and wholeheartedly identifies with Christ, loves and embraces his Word, and gives himself to the value system expressed in the kingdom of God. The basic self-consciousness of the justified person is that his right relationship with the living God has nothing to do with merit or achievement. It is from beginning to end a gift of infinite love. His own powerlessness is resolved in the power of the gospel in which God’s saving work is revealed (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">1:17</a>).</p>
<p>In the Gospels justification appears in the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector who went into the temple to pray. The former drew attention to his pious works and moral superiority. The latter, humbled by a deep sense of sin and unworthiness, could only cry for mercy. This man, according to Jesus, went down to his house justified (<a href="?bref=Luke.18.14">Lk 18:14</a>). Though this is the only instance of the terminology of justification by faith, the entire ministry of Jesus was among people preoccupied with their own piety and the task of justifying themselves before God, people who set themselves over against sinners and undesirables, people who were so involved in their own works that they were offended by the language of grace and the full pardon of sinners (<a href="?bref=Luke.7.36-50">7:36-50</a>). Jesus spoke to the same issue that later plagued Paul. Only the humble before God will be exalted (<a href="?bref=Matt.18.4">Mt 18:4</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.23.12">23:12</a>). Only the sinner hears the word of grace (<a href="?bref=Luke.5.32">Lk 5:32</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.15.7,10">15:7, 10</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.19.7">19:7</a>). The unworthy find healing (<a href="?bref=Matt.8.8">Mt 8:8</a>).</p>
<p>Justification (or righteousness) by faith is always to be reaffirmed, for within each person there is the almost inevitable and natural desire to establish personal righteousness, to be able to stand before God on the basis of personal character and piety. But the revival and well-being of the church (note that both Luther and Wesley turned from works to faith upon their study of Romans) is rooted in the understanding that the just live by faith (<a href="?bref=Rom.1.17">Rom 1:17</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.10.38">Heb 10:38</a>; <a href="?bref=Heb.11.7">11:7</a>).</p>
