<p class="fl">Queen during the reign of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) who was deposed for refusing to show herself to the guests at a royal banquet (<a href="?bref=Esth.1.9-19">Est 1:9-19</a>). Since neither she nor Esther is otherwise known in secular history, many have suggested that they were inferior wives or concubines who were simply dignified with the title “queen.” According to Plutarch, Persian custom dictated that the kings would ordinarily eat with their legitimate wives, but when they wanted to “riot and drink,” they would send their wives away and call in their concubines. While this citation is often used to support the judgment that Vashti was called because she was only a concubine, the opposite conclusion better explains Vashti’s refusal to come. Vashti’s position as queen is indicated by the fact that she was supposed to appear with her “royal crown,” that she was always called “queen” until the time of her dismissal, and that her behavior should serve as an example for all the women in the kingdom.</p>

  <body>
<p class="h1">VINES, VINEYARD</p>
<p class="fl">Plants cultivated for the production of grapes, raisins, and wine. The grapevine is mentioned frequently in Scripture both in a literal and a figurative sense. Probably originating in the Ararat region (<a href="?bref=Gen.9.20">Gn 9:20</a>), the vine was also cultivated in ancient Egypt, where tomb murals depict the wine-making process. The Canaanites provided wine for Abraham (<a href="?bref=Gen.14.18">14:18</a>), and Moses described the vineyards in the Promised Land (<a href="?bref=Deut.6.11">Dt 6:11</a>). Excellent grapes from the valleys and plains (<a href="?bref=Num.13.20,24">Nm 13:20, 24</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.14.5">Jgs 14:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Judg.15.5">15:5</a>) provided fruit and wine to enhance the bland diet of the Hebrews. Wine was traded extensively in the late monarchy (cf. <a href="?bref=Ezek.27.18">Ez 27:18</a>), as well as in the Greek and Roman periods. For the Hebrews, an ideal picture of life was a sedentary one in which a man could remain peacefully in one place, cultivating his plot of land, and sitting under his vine (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.4.25">1 Kgs 4:25</a>).</p>
<include_items src="../Pictures/Pictures.xml" name="TheGrapevine"/>
<p>The typical vineyard was surrounded by a protective hedge or fence, and at harvesttime a watchtower was manned to guard the crop from thieves (<a href="?bref=Job.24.18">Jb 24:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.1.8">Is 1:8</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.1">Mk 12:1</a>). The vines were planted in rows within the enclosed area, and as the plants grew, the tendrils were trained along supports to raise the fruit-bearing branches off the ground (<a href="?bref=Ezek.17.6">Ez 17:6</a>). The vines were pruned and tended by vinedressers (<a href="?bref=Lev.25.3">Lv 25:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.61.5">Is 61:5</a>; <a href="?bref=Joel.3.10">Jl 3:10</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.2">Jn 15:2</a>). At harvesttime the mature fruit was picked and taken to the winepresses (<a href="?bref=Hos.9.2">Hos 9:2</a>). A festive atmosphere accompanied the treading of the grapes (<a href="?bref=Isa.16.10">Is 16:10</a>; <a href="?bref=Jer.25.30">Jer 25:30</a>), and the fermenting juice was collected in new goatskin bags (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.17">Mt 9:17</a>) or large pottery jars.</p>
<p>People working in the grape harvest were exempted from military service, which attests to its importance. Taxes and debts were often discharged by payments of wine, and the law provided for the poor to glean in the vineyards as in the wheat fields (<a href="?bref=Lev.19.9-10">Lv 19:9-10</a>). Nonproductive vines were used for producing charcoal (<a href="?bref=Ezek.15.4">Ez 15:4</a>; <a href="?bref=John.15.6">Jn 15:6</a>).</p>
<p>Christ frequently used the vineyard as a background for his parables (<a href="?bref=Matt.20.1-16">Mt 20:1-16</a>; <a href="?bref=Matt.21.28-43">21:28-43</a>; <a href="?bref=Mark.12.1-11">Mk 12:1-11</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.13.6-9">Lk 13:6-9</a>; <a href="?bref=Luke.20.9-18">20:9-18</a>). Wine-making methods were commonly known and understood, so that an allegory of placing new wine in old wineskins (<a href="?bref=Matt.9.17">Mt 9:17</a>) was immediately familiar and significant. In a symbolic sense, Christ described himself as the true vine (<a href="?bref=John.15.1-11">Jn 15:1-11</a>), and his blood became the sacramental wine of communion.</p>

  <title>Virgin</title>
  <body>
<p class="h1">VIRGIN</p>
<p class="fl">Word used only of women and (metaphorically) of places, nations, and the church. Literally, it describes a woman who has reached physical maturity but has not experienced sexual intercourse. Mary, mother of Jesus, is an obvious example (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-25">Mt 1:18-25</a>).</p>
<p>The OT puts a high value on premarital virginity. One of Rebekah’s qualities that made her a suitable bride for Isaac was her virginity (<a href="?bref=Gen.24.16">Gn 24:16</a>). The law prescribed that priests, as men whose lives should conform most closely to God’s standards, must marry only virgins (<a href="?bref=Lev.21.7,13-14">Lv 21:7, 13-14</a>).</p>
<p>Undoubtedly this reflects the whole Bible’s teaching on marriage, with its ideal of exclusive faithfulness. The NT expresses that ideal by its ban on premarital intercourse (<a href="?bref=1Cor.6.13,18">1 Cor 6:13, 18</a>), and by its use of “virgin” language to describe Christians who remain faithful to their Lord (<a href="?bref=Rev.14.4">Rv 14:4</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=2Cor.11.2">2 Cor 11:2</a>).</p>
<p>Negatively, the OT highlights the same principle in the penalties it lays down for the loss of a woman’s virginity. If the man is morally responsible, he must either marry her or compensate her father (<a href="?bref=Exod.22.16-17">Ex 22:16-17</a>). If the woman herself is to blame, the punishment is death (<a href="?bref=Deut.22.20-21">Dt 22:20-21</a>). The OT says little, however, to commend lifelong virginity. Jeremiah was told not to marry, only to reinforce God’s warning of coming judgment (<a href="?bref=Jer.16.2">Jer 16:2</a>). From the woman’s point of view, it was a tragedy to remain an unmarried virgin and therefore childless for life (cf. <a href="?bref=Judg.11.37">Jgs 11:37</a>).</p>
<p>The NT echoes the value of marriage but brings out more clearly the advantages of a commitment to virginity for Christian men as well as women. Celibacy for some is God’s gift, declared Paul, because it has positive gains for Christian service (<a href="?bref=1Cor.7.7,25-38">1 Cor 7:7, 25-38</a>). Jesus commended those who “make themselves eunuchs” for the kingdom of heaven’s sake (<a href="?bref=Matt.19.12">Mt 19:12</a>).</p>

<p class="h1">VIRGIN BIRTH OF JESUS*</p>
<p class="fl">Doctrine, drawn from the birth narratives of <a href="?bref=Matt.1.1-25">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="?bref=Luke.1.1-2.52">Luke 1–2</a>, which states that Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. The whole concept of the Incarnation (as well as Jesus’ divine and human natures) focuses upon this historical event as its foundation. At the same time, rationalists and literary critics deny this miracle, stating that it was created by the early Christians.</p>
<include_items src="../Textboxes/Textboxes.xml" name="PaganParallelsToTheVirginBirth"/>
<p class="h2" id="TheOldTestamentProphecy">The Old Testament Prophecy</p>
<p class="fl">The <span class="sc">kjv</span> of <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Isaiah 7:14</a> says that a “virgin” shall “conceive and bear a son . . . Immanuel,” and <a href="?bref=Matt.1.22-23">Matthew 1:22-23</a> expressly states that this was fulfilled in Jesus’ birth. This passage has been greatly debated, especially since the <span class="sc">rsv</span> changed the <span class="sc">kjv</span> “virgin” to “young woman,” based on the ambiguity of the term in the original manuscripts. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span> refers generally to a young girl who has passed puberty and thus is of marriageable age. Another Hebrew word <span class="ital">(</span><span class="hebrew">bethulah</span><span class="ital">)</span> specifies a woman who is a virgin. The Septuagint translators, nevertheless, translated <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span> as <span class="hebrew">parthenos</span><span class="ital">,</span> which does denote a virgin.</p>
<p>From these linguistic considerations come the following four interpretations:</p>
<p class="list-space">1. The “virgin” (<a href="?bref=Isa.7.14">Is 7:14</a>) was Ahaz’s new wife and the son was Hezekiah. But Hezekiah was nine years old when Ahaz began to reign, so this prophecy must look to the future.</p>
<p class="list">2. She was Isaiah’s wife and the son was Maher-shalal-hash-baz. Many scholars support this interpretation because the definite article with <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span> seems to indicate that “the woman” was known to Isaiah and Ahaz and because <a href="?bref=Isa.7.14-16">Isaiah 7:14-16</a> seems to indicate that the prophecy was to be fulfilled in Isaiah’s time. The difficulty here is that Isaiah’s wife already had a son and so she could not be called <span class="hebrew">‘almah</span><span class="ital">.</span></p>
<p class="list">3. The prophecy is purely messianic. This is the traditional evangelical position, based on the name of the child Immanuel, “God with us,” and the reference (<a href="?bref=Isa.9.6-7">Is 9:6-7</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.11.1-5">11:1-5</a>), which points to a divine person.</p>
<p class="list">4. Many evangelicals recently have opted for a fourth interpretation, which accepts the arguments for the historical fulfillment (in Isaiah’s day) and for the futuristic fulfillment. This view takes into account the historical fulfillment intended in <a href="?bref=Isa.7.15-16">Isaiah 7:15-16</a> while seeing the future as being fulfilled through the virgin birth of Jesus, as indicated in <a href="?bref=Matt.1.22-23">Matthew 1:22-23</a>.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheGospelRecords">The Gospel Records</p>
<p class="fl">Neither Mark nor John provides an account of the birth of Christ; the actual event is chronicled only in Matthew and Luke. Both agree that a “virgin,” Mary, conceived of the Holy Spirit and bore a son, Jesus. Matthew’s account is simpler and more direct, attributing the birth of the Messiah to divine origins and highlighting the christological significance. Jesus is called the “Christ [or Messiah],” the son of David (<a href="?bref=Matt.1.1">Mt 1:1</a>), who comes to inaugurate the kingdom of God. As evidenced both by the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.1.22-23">22-23</a>) and by the nature of his conception (vv <a href="?bref=Matt.1.18-20">18-20</a>), Jesus is “God with us,” now come to “save his people from their sins” (v <a href="?bref=Matt.1.21">21</a>). The scene where Joseph decides to privately divorce Mary is added to give even greater stress to the miraculous conception.</p>
<p>Luke told the Nativity story from the perspective of Mary. The angel Gabriel visited her and announced that she would give birth to the Messiah (<a href="?bref=Luke.1.26-38">Lk 1:26-38</a>). She conceived miraculously by the Holy Spirit, as was foretold by the angel Gabriel: “The Holy Spirit will come upon you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God” (v <a href="?bref=Luke.1.35">35</a>, <span class="sc">rsv</span>). Mary was portrayed by Luke as being devoutly submissive to the purposes of God.</p>
<p class="h2" id="TheologicalSignificancefortheChurch">Theological Significance for the Church</p>
<p class="fl">From the very beginning of the church, the doctrine of the virgin birth became the foundation of an exalted Christology. Some of the earliest church fathers stressed this more than any other event in Jesus’ life as proof of the incarnation and deity of Christ. Justin Martyr and Ignatius defended the virgin birth against opponents at the beginning of the second century, and even at that early date it appeared to be a fixed doctrine. In the debates of the next three centuries, the virgin birth became a prominent issue. Gnostics such as Marcion contended that Christ descended directly from heaven and so was never truly human. On the other hand, those groups that denied his deity, such as the Arians, also denied the virgin birth, stating that at his baptism Jesus was “adopted” as Son of God. The Council of Nicaea in <span class="era">AD</span> 325 affirmed that Jesus was truly God, and then the Council of Chalcedon in <span class="era">AD</span> 451 stated that Jesus was at the same time human and divine, a “hypostatic union” of the true natures. These were summarized in the Apostles’ Creed of the fifth century, which declares, “I believe in . . . Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, conceived of the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.” In most of the creeds the virgin birth is also connected to Jesus’ sinlessness, inasmuch as his incarnate, divine nature is the source of his sinlessness.</p>
<p>From the beginning, as attested in Matthew and Luke as well as the early patristic writers, the virgin birth has been a central doctrine of the church. As such, it is a living symbol of the twofold nature of Jesus: born of the Holy Spirit and of woman, he is the incarnate God-man. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Christology_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Christology</a>; <a href="?item=Incarnation_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Incarnation</a>; <a href="?item=JesusChristTeachingsof_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Jesus Christ, Life and Teachings of</a>; <a href="?item=Virgin_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Virgin</a>.</p>

  <title>Vision, Visions</title>

<p class="h1">VISION, VISIONS</p>
<p class="fl">Visual experiences of any kind, but in the Bible the word usually refers to supernatural revelations of a prophet. In early OT prophecy there are cases of extraordinary sight, which was regarded as evidence of the visionary endowment of a prophet. Samuel was a “seer” or visionary; he was able to “see” where Saul’s lost donkeys were and to tell him their whereabouts (<a href="?bref=1Sam.9.19-20">1 Sm 9:19-20</a>). Elisha was able to follow Gehazi’s wrongful actions “in spirit” and confront him on his return (<a href="?bref=2Kgs.5.26">2 Kgs 5:26</a>). This psychic gift was given only to the prophets.</p>
<p>Apart from these kinds of visions of present happenings occurring elsewhere on earth, there are revelatory visions—visions concerning the future that are given by God to various prophets. Sometimes God communicated these visions through dreams. Both experiences are legitimate channels of divine revelation. Presumably visions are distinguished from dreams as being daytime experiences.</p>
<p>There are different types of revelatory vision. At one end of the spectrum is the ecstatic vision of Ezekiel. He experienced a psychic trance that could supernaturally transport him to other places (<a href="?bref=Ezek.8.3">Ez 8:3</a>; <a href="?bref=Ezek.40.2">40:2</a>). Daniel’s vision (<a href="?bref=Dan.8.1-27">Dn 8</a>) was probably of the same type, and so perhaps was Jeremiah’s experience (<a href="?bref=Jer.13.4-7">Jer 13:4-7</a>). At the other end of the spectrum is what has been called symbolical perception. In this, a prophet sees an ordinary object that is part of the natural world, but sees it with a heightened significance. The basket of summer fruit that God “caused” Amos “to see” (<a href="?bref=Amos.8.1-2">Am 8:1-2</a>) seems to fall into this category, and so probably do Jeremiah’s visions of the almond branch and the tilting pot (<a href="?bref=Jer.1.11-13">Jer 1:11-13</a>). An intermediate type includes the pictorial heavenly visions that Isaiah received (<a href="?bref=1Kgs.22.19-22">1 Kgs 22:19-22</a>; <a href="?bref=Isa.6.1-13">Is 6</a>), as well as those of the apostle John, when he wrote the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>Actually, prophecy could come via either an auditory or a visual experience. Typically, in the course of a vision a verbal message was communicated, so that the seeing and hearing took place within the same supernatural experience. This was the case with Isaiah, who both “saw the Lord” and heard his voice. But an auditory experience could itself be called a vision, for the divine word is a revelation from God. It is often difficult to know whether the term “vision” includes a predominant element of hearing or is used in the wider sense of revelation (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ezek.12.21-28">Ez 12:21-28</a>). Often “vision” is apparently used simply as a technical term for a verbal communication from God. Thus Samuel’s call is literally called a “vision” (<a href="?bref=1Sam.3.15">1 Sm 3:15</a>). Several of the prophetic books have the word “vision” in their headings (<a href="?bref=Isa.1.1">Is 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Obad.1.1">Ob 1:1</a>; <a href="?bref=Nah.1.1">Na 1:1</a>). Nathan’s prophecy of God’s covenant with David is described as a vision (<a href="?bref=2Sam.7.17">2 Sm 7:17</a>; <a href="?bref=1Chr.17.15">1 Chr 17:15</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.89.19">Ps 89:19</a>). In <a href="?bref=Dan.9.24">Daniel 9:24</a> “to seal both vision and prophet” means to authenticate the prophecy of Jeremiah referred to in verse <a href="?bref=Dan.9.2">2</a>. In the famous proverb traditionally rendered “Where there is no vision, the people perish” (<a href="?bref=Pr.29.18">Prv 29:18</a>, <span class="sc">kjv</span>), the term “vision” refers to prophetic revelation, the divine gift of prophecy that was intended to be a guiding influence in Israel’s life. <span class="ital">See</span> <a href="?item=Apocalypse_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Apocalypse</a>; <a href="?item=Dreams_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Dreams</a>; <a href="?item=Prophecy_Article_TyndaleOpenBibleDictionary">Prophecy</a>.</p>

  <title>Vow, Vows</title>

<p class="h1">VOW, VOWS</p>
<p class="fl">Serious promises or pledges made to God. The making of vows to God is a religious practice frequently mentioned in Scripture. Most references to vows are found in the OT, especially in the Psalms, but there are a few in the NT.</p>
<p>Unlike tithing, sacrifices and offerings, Sabbath keeping, and circumcision, vow making was not something commanded by the Mosaic law. For example, <a href="?bref=Ps.50.14">Psalm 50:14</a> says, “Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High” (<span class="sc">rsv</span>). The command is to “pay,” that is, to keep or fulfill a pledge that has already been made. No order is given to make such promises in the first place. The practice is accepted and regulated but not demanded.</p>
<p>The purpose of a vow is to win a desired favor from the Lord, to express gratitude to him for some deliverance or benefit, or simply to prove absolute devotion to him by way of certain abstinences. Dedication of oneself and separation to the Lord were the primary features of the Nazirite vow. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist are the most familiar examples of those who took this type of vow. <a href="?bref=Num.6.1-8">Numbers 6:1-8</a> prescribes the conditions of this commitment, and verses <a href="?bref=Num.6.13-21">13-21</a> tell how release from the vow may be obtained. Women, as well as men, might take this vow of separation (v <a href="?bref=Num.6.2">2</a>), which could be of limited duration. The Recabite clan pledged themselves to an ascetic and nomadic life. They constitute a compelling illustration of loyalty to the God of Israel (<a href="?bref=Jer.35.1-19">Jer 35</a>).</p>
<p>Frequently, however, vows were taken as a type of bargain with God. At Bethel, Jacob promised God worship and the tithe if he would protect him and supply his needs (<a href="?bref=Gen.28.20-22">Gn 28:20-22</a>). Hannah pledged that if God would give her a son, she would return him to God (<a href="?bref=1Sam.1.11,27-28">1 Sm 1:11, 27-28</a>). In the Psalms, payment of vows is often associated with thanksgiving for deliverance from danger or affliction (e.g., <a href="?bref=Ps.22.24-25">Pss 22:24-25</a>; <a href="?bref=Ps.56.12-13">56:12-13</a>). </p>
<p>Most important is that once a vow is made, the obligation is serious. To refrain from making any vow is no sin (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.22">Dt 23:22</a>), but once declared, the vow must be kept (<a href="?bref=Deut.23.21-23">Dt 23:21-23</a>; see also <a href="?bref=Num.30.2">Nm 30:2</a>; <a href="?bref=Eccl.5.4-6">Eccl 5:4-6</a>).</p>
<p>The term “vow” occurs just twice in the NT, both times in association with the apostle Paul (<a href="?bref=Acts.18.18">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="?bref=Acts.21.23-24">21:23-24</a>). But the same principle is involved in the case of the word “Corban” (<a href="?bref=Mark.7.11-13">Mk 7:11-13</a>; cf. <a href="?bref=Matt.15.5-6">Mt 15:5-6</a>). In these two passages Jesus severely rebuked those who made a vow that served as a clever escape from meeting obligations to care for aged parents. A monetary figure was involved in such a “gift” or “offering.” But Jesus declared that God did not want a gift designed to deprive someone.</p>
<p>In the case of Paul, he may have entered into his vows for the very purpose of averting objections that either antagonistic Jews or Jewish-Christian believers had to his removing the yoke of Mosaic regulations from the shoulders of gentile believers. Paul was in Jerusalem under the keen surveillance of Jewish authorities. He made it a point to join with four other Jewish believers in the payment of vows in the temple. This action, however, was misconstrued by his enemies, who charged that he was bringing Gentiles into the holy temple.</p>
